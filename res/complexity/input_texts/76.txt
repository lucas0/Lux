I was absolutely devastated by it, but also extremely angry."In the early days [I listened to it] quite often. Basically it came to the point when if I felt low then I would listen to it."In December I learned that it had disappeared. I just could not tell people how it affected me at that time. It really did devastate me."Mr Beaton contacted Virgin who managed to retrieve the message which has now been permanently saved for him.Rob Evans, executive director of engineering at Virgin Media, said finding it "was like searching for a needle in a haystack", however a team of 11 engineers spent three days tracking it down."The chances of its recovery were slim" he said, but the missing file containing Ruby's voice was found on Friday."The next morning we called Stan to deliver the good news," he said.
