However, police say he was driving toward them, and that the officer fired because he feared for his own safety, according to local media. The bean bag round hit and shattered the front passenger window."I didn’t have any weapons, I wasn’t looting or anything. I was just out with my boyfriend. We was just riding around respecting Mike Brown," she told local media outlet KMOV."I'm very upset and very disappointed with the tactics that they used," Conner's father Donnell added. "I understand that it was chaos, but there was no reason to fire upon an innocent person sitting in a vehicle. How can a pregnant person, in a car in a seatbelt, be causing chaos?”Conner subsequently vowed to seek justice for the incident on her Facebook page (where she also goes by the name "Lenora Prince"). "I will have justice for what they've done to me," she wrote, "But I'm happy I'm alive."Sixteen people were arrested at the gas station, and police say they still don't know who was firing gunshots there. They've issued a warrant for the arrest of Lee, Conner's boyfriend.
