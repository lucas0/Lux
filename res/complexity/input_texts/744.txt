bikini line Dana Sedgewick , 44 , from Sheffield , trimmed her pubic area with a brand new razor but ended up cutting a spot on her groin Her body almost immediately went into shock , causing a red rash on her legs before they turned black from necrotising fasciitis a flesh eating infection Rushed to intensive care , doctors operated to remove as much of the rotting skin as they could but she developed sepsis during the procedure She was placed in a coma as her family were told she had just a 30 per cent chance of survival as her kidneys failed and her heart stopped four times Having managed to survive the horrific ordeal , she underwent 21 operations to repair the damage to her skin but doctors warned she would never walk again But with the support of her husband , Mathew , 47 , she has now recovered and can walk using crutches and is back at home with her children Megan , 18 , Freya , 14 , and Klara , nine Dana Sedgewick , 44 , trimmed her pubic area with a brand new razor , but ended up in a coma after she developed the flesh eating infection , necrotising fasciitis \( pictured now , using a crutch to walk despite being told she may never be able to use her legs again \) Mrs Sedgewick said 'Like a lot of women , I tried to keep a tidy bikini line So I had a quick trim with a new razor 'But over the weekend , I felt unwell and noticed a little pimple on my groin which kept bleeding I did n't think anything of it as I often got a rash from shaving 'Little did I know that this tiny pimple would almost cost me my life ' Mrs Sedgewick 's ordeal began in May 2012 Two days after she 'd shaved , she began experiencing dizziness and nausea She visited her GP , who took swabs of the area and prescribed her antibiotics to combat a suspected infection Later that day , her eldest daughter Megan discovered her lying in bed , with her legs covered in a bloody red rash Her body almost immediately went into shock , causing a red rash on her legs before they turned black from the rotting flesh \( pictured in September 2012 after a couple of skin graft procedures to repair some of the damage on her legs \) Afterwards , her GP called to say that the swabs had revealed it was serious and that she needed to go in for another examination But when her husband dropped her off at the surgery , she collapsed Like a lot of women , I tried to keep a tidy bikini line So I had a quick trim with a new razor Dana Sedgewick , 44 An ambulance was called and she was rushed to the trauma unit at the Northern General Hospital in Sheffield , where doctors diagnosed her with necrotising fasciitis The condition causes bacteria to release toxins that attack the surrounding soft tissue , and can be caused by a minor cut or scratch Mrs Sedgewick said 'By the time I got to the hospital , my legs were covered in black , rotting flesh It was touch and go as to whether I 'd make it ' Over the next ten hours , surgeons battled to save her legs Cutting through seven inches of infected skin , they removed the diseased flesh and reapplied skin from her back Rushed to intensive care , doctors placed her in a coma as her family were told she had just a 30 per cent chance of survival as her kidneys failed and her heart stopped four times \( pictured at the Northern General Hospital in Sheffield in May 2012 \) Having managed to come round from the horrific ordeal , she

Mrs Sedgewick that she had been very lucky to survive her terrifying ordeal with necrotising fasciitis \( pictured in hospital in June 2012 \) During surgery , she developed sepsis and was given a slim chance of survival after going into septic shock The silent killer strikes when an infection such as blood poisoning sparks a violent immune response in which the body attacks its own organs To increase her chances of survival , doctors decided to put her into an induced coma for nine days She said 'When I woke up , my legs were covered in bandages and I had no idea what had happened I thought I 'd been in a car accident 'But when the surgeon asked me if I remembered shaving , I suddenly recalled trimming my bikini line 'He told me that the spot on my groin had become infected , and I 'd been very lucky to survive ' Mrs Sedgewick was transferred to the hospital 's burns unit for specialist treatment , and was able to see her legs for the first time She said 'It was horrific All of my muscle had rotted away , and I had a crater of skin near my groin I felt like I was going to throw up 'But I knew that it could have been much , much worse I could easily have lost my legs or worse , died ' Mrs Sedgewick was transferred to the hospital 's burns unit for specialist treatment , and was able to see her legs for the first time \( pictured in hospital in June 2012 \) But with the support of her husband , Mathew , 47 , she has now recovered and is back at home with her children Megan , 18 , Freya , 14 , and Klara , nine \( the family are pictured before Mrs Sedgewick 's

Necrotising fasciitis is most commonly caused by an infection with group A Streptococcus Those infections normally last just a few days they are mild and typically clear themselves up But in some unusual cases it can develop into necrotising fasciitis They infect flat layers of a membrane known as the fascia , which are connective bands of tissue that surround muscles , nerves , fat , and blood vessels The infection also damages the tissues next to the fascia Sometimes toxins made by these bacteria destroy the tissue they infect , causing it to die When this happens , the infection is very serious and can result in loss of limbs or death Doctors warned that she 'd never walk again but she defied them and managed to walk on crutches , after intense physiotherapy Six weeks later , she was discharged from hospital Over the next four years , she underwent 21 operations to improve the appearance of her skin Mrs Sedgewick , who has been left with extensive scarring , said 'It did n't feel like my own body any more 'But with Mat 's support , I grew to see the scars as a reminder of how brave I 'd been , and how lucky I was to survive 'It 's incredible to think a tiny shaving spot could have killed me I had a very close shave indeed ' Dr Ron Daniels BEM , chief executive of the UK Sepsis Trust , said 'Stories like Dana 's illustrate the serious damage sepsis can do Every day in the UK , individuals and families have their lives torn apart by the condition 'But through better awareness , thousands of lives could be saved each year 'While necrotising fasciitis is a rare cause of sepsis , it 's crucial that members of the public and healthcare professionals consider it when presented with an unwell patient 'Anyone with flu like symptoms and one or more of the key signs of sepsis must call an ambulance immediately With every hour that passes before the correct antibiotics are administered , the risk of death increases ' Mrs Sedgewick , who has been left with extensive scarring , said 'It did n't feel like my own body any more But with Mat 's support , I grew to see the scars as a reminder of how brave I 'd been' \( pictured with her 47 year old husband Mathew after the ordeal \)
