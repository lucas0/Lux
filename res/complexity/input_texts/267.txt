AWAY FROM TRUMP ! There s no need to beat around the bush , so I m just going to go ahead and say it I will resign my position as a Justice of the Supreme Court of the United States I cannot imagine performing my duties under the constant pressure of waking up in the morning and having to go to work knowing that every ruling we as an institution make will be viewed through the prism of a Trump presidency I can tolerate this charade of a presidential campaign , but I could not live with him as president , she said
