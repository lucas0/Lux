NEW YORK DAILY NEWSMonday , March 28 , 2016 , 4 38 PMOur European allies are under siege from radical Islamic terrorism The Paris attacks last November killed 130 people and seriously injured hundreds more The Brussels attacks last week killed more than 30 people and struck at the heart of NATO Americans were among the victims of both attacks as the terrorists do not differentiate between us and our close allies One of the causes of this horror has been European bureaucrats restraining law enforcement from fully engaging with the Muslim community in no go zones As a result , for years , a radical , theocratic , violent ideology has spread in some mosques and Muslim neighborhoods throughout Europe Terrorists have exploited these isolated enclaves to recruit followers , formulate plots and orchestrate attacks BRATTON RIPS CRUZ AGAIN OVER PROPOSALTO MONITOR MUSLIMSThere is no better example of these no go zones than one neighborhood in the city of this latest horrific attack the municipality of Molenbeek in the city of Brussels In attack after attack , from 9 11 to Madrid to Paris to Brussels , the trail seems to come back repeatedly to Molenbeek At least three of the terrorists of the November 2015 Paris attack grew up and lived there In fact , one of the key terrorists of the Paris attack , Salah Abdeslam , fled back to Molenbeek where he knew he could find sanctuary It is telling that Abdeslam effectively hid in plain sight there for weeks in the same city as the headquarters of NATO and the European Union Even Belgium 's own Prime Minister , Charles Michel , has admitted after the Paris attacks that A lmost every time there 's a link with Molenbeek It 's been a form of laissez faire and laxity Now we 're paying the bill Many European leaders are now recognizing that passively allowing the Islamist threat to fester was a serious error We cannot make the same mistakes in America NYPD TERRORISM CHIEF TED CRUZ 'CAMPAIGNING THROUGH FEAR' In the wake of the Brussels attacks , I called for vigorously guarding against the political correctness that has plagued Europe I also called for empowering law enforcement to patrol and secure Muslim neighborhoods before they follow the path of Molenbeek and become havens for radical Islamic terrorists The response was predictable Liberal politicians , including President Obama , Hillary Clinton and Mayor de Blasio , all loudly denounced my approach Indeed , they seemed far more outraged at my calling for us to prevent radical Islamic terrorism then they were at the terrorists who attacked in Brussels In high dudgeon , they insist we must remain willfully blind to the root causes of these attacks The Islamic State is not Islamic , President Obama absurdly tells us New York Daily News front pages on the presidential electionEveryone knows that 's nonsense Of course , there are many peaceful Muslims in America , and hundreds of millions across the world , who can be our allies in this global battle But we cannot fight and win without identifying and confronting the enemy Islamism is a political and theocratic philosophy that commands its adherents to wage jihad , to murder or forcibly convert the infidels \( by which they mean everyone else \) Islamism is the enemy , and it must be defeated To do so , we must take a risk based approach that focuses resources on the enclaves and potential hotbeds of radicalization where terrorists are likely to thrive Just as with law enforcement 's successful efforts against gangs or drug dealers or the Mafia , we need resources and informants and undercover officers placed where terrorists are likely to be We need lawful surveillance operations And we need far more engagement between law enforcement and members of Muslim communities who are committed to working to rid their neighborhoods of the scourge of terrorism In the wake of 9 11 , there was a broad consensus in favor of a common sense domestic counterterrorism strategy But over the last seven years , the focus on protecting the homeland has been lost The Obama administration has even joined Islamist governments in sponsoring a UN resolution that would shred our First Amendment by threatening to make discussion of radical Islamism potentially illegal And now we are seeing the erosion of our counterterrorism tools here at home , even while we know from successful attacks from Boston to San Bernardino that terrorists are still plotting to strike America A prime case study is here in New York City Under Mayor Michael Bloomberg and Commissioner Ray Kelly , the NYPD started a counterterrorism unit that tracked demographic trends in New York City to provide investigators with important information about where terrorists might congregate and recruit That sophisticated analysis can be a critical part of counterterrorism efforts to prevent an attack before it occurs or disrupt burgeoning terror cells That unit likely saved lives For example , a former director of intelligence analysis for the NYPD , Mitchell Silber , explained that the unit identified the Islamic Books and Tapes bookstore in Brooklyn as a venue for radicalization , and provided a predicate for an investigation that thwarted a 2004 plot against the Herald Square subway station Moreover , the Obama administration 's counterterrorism advisor and now CIA director , John Brennan , stated the administration knew about this unit and referred to its work as exceptionally good Indeed , while running for mayor in 2013 , even then candidate Bill de Blasio said he believed the unit was legal and was created in good faith to protect New Yorkers Once elected mayor , however , de Blasio shut down that counterterrorism unit He was taking heat from liberal advocacy groups who caricatured the unit 's work as spying on Muslims , which it was n't New Yorkers , including the Muslim community , are less safe as a result After the Brussels attacks , I called out the de Blasio administration for its shortsighted capitulation to its liberal allies at the expense of the safety and security of the people of New York In response , Commissioner Bill Bratton penned an op ed attacking my policy in this newspaper He did not say that the work of the unit was misguided or a failure Instead , he alleged , remarkably , that the unit was finished with its work and it was n't serving any useful purpose Bratton has a difficult job , and I am grateful for all he does to keep the people of New York safe I also understand that politically , he has no choice but to implement the de Blasio Obama liberal agenda But his explanation for dismantling the unit makes no sense it ignores the nature of the threat that we face from radical Islam Simply put , demographic trends are not static They are dynamic They change over time The pockets of New York City that are fertile grounds for terrorist recruitment today may not be fertile grounds next year , and places without a significant radical presence right now may become hotbeds of terrorist activity in the future To say that the work of a vital intelligence unit was finished is not plausible It is the excuse of an administration grasping for anything to justify what was obviously a surrender to political correctness Hitting back \( Alex Wong Getty Images \) Former Mayor Rudy Giuliani and former Mayor Michael Bloomberg have both stated they believe the unit was lawful and effective , and should not have been shut down The de Blasio administration is trying to avoid the ideological foundation of the war radical Islamic terrorists are waging against us While Bratton admits that the jihadists are driven by ideology , he astonishingly maintains that our response should have no ideological component whatsoever That 's ridiculous If the terrorist threat is driven by radical Islamic ideology , then we must take account of that ideology in countering the threat To stop the terrorists before they strike , we must understand what their motivation and goals are , where they might plot attacks and which targets they are inclined to strike Their ideology tells us how they might peddle their radical Islamism in our cities and towns and helps us encourage our fellow Muslim citizens to choose a different path The hollow argument that ideology has no role in counterterrorism leaves no doubt that politics is afoot here I repeat my call for de Blasio to repudiate the dangerous confines of political correctness and reinstate this important unit as the first step towards a more proactive , hard headed counterterrorism strategy on the home front The bottom line is that to defeat radical Islam , we need to focus our counterterrorism resources where terrorists are likely to be That 's not profiling or spying It 's common sense An investigation of Wall Street fraud would n't focus on community banks in the outer boroughs If we want to defeat radical Islam , we need to focus on areas that are at risk of being infiltrated by jihadists The vast majority of Muslim Americans are law abiding citizens Indeed , patriotic American Muslims have provided critical assistance to our law enforcement , intelligence and military officials to detect and disrupt jihadist plots And we need their help in the war on terrorism These are dangerous times If I am elected President , every American will have a commander in chief fiercely committed to defeating radical Islamic terrorism This is a battle we must win If we do n't want to become Europe , we need to put aside the political correctness , focus our efforts on stopping radicalization and do what needs to be done to keep America safe Cruz , U S senator from Texas , is running for the Republican nomination for President Sign
