BatchelderStimulating job creation and growth while simultaneously reining in an 8 billion state deficit are at the top of the priority list of both candidates running for the Ohio 69th House District seat The candidates approach to meeting those goals could not be more different , however Ohio is heading for quite a crisis unfortunately we did not have the focus on job creation in the last session that we should have , said incumbent 69th House Representative Bill Batchelder We sent 20 bills addressing job creation and expansion , but we should have been cutting back more on the appropriations level than we were , but as the minority party , we had no control over that Batchelder , who has been mentioned as a possible choice for Speaker of the House should the Republicans Party gain control , is serving the second term of his second time in the house He previ ously served for 30 years up until 2008 , when term limits forced him to give up the seat He has also served as a judge on the Medina County Common Pleas Court and the Ninth District Court of Appeals Addressing the deficit , which now accounts for roughly 20 percent of the entire state budget , will be a huge problem facing the next House of Representatives in their first six months , Batchelder said , adding that several tough battles must be waged to meet this goal He pointed specifically to seeking Federal waiers for participation in the Medicaid program , potentially via offsets for indigent services provided at facilities like MetroHealth Medical Center There are all kinds of things like that which we have n't done a good job of cataloguing , Batchelder said And the Federal government has arbitrary authority over granting waivers Batchelder also supports looking at the privatization of some medical services now done by public employees Many of these services are now done by people who are being paid higher than those in the private sector , Batchelder said He did not , however , indicate specifically which public sector jobs he would consider making cuts to , or how many of those jobs would be impacted by such a move We will be holding a lot of hearings and we will have to solve it in six months , when the budget must be in , he said On the growth side of the equation , Batchelder said enhancing the state 's Department of Development by encouraging the direct input of participation of business owners is key to job growth We are competing with Indiana and their economy is growing , Batchelder said It does n't help that our Department of Development has been through three or four directors in the same number of years But we have got to get guys in there from successful businesses who can tell us what they need National Cash Register is a company that was here for 100 years and now they are in Atlanta should n't we find out what companies like that need instead of having the government tell us what they need \? To provide an immediate shot in the state 's economic arm , Batchelder said there should be more of a focus on the needs of industries such as medical and metalworking We are starting to see a real philosophical difference between those who feel the government can create jobs and those who feel that only the private sector can , Batchelder said These 'green jobs' are generational , they are not something that will be ready next week or even next year All of these things are planned for the future there are a lot of ribbons being cut but not a lot of production You ca n't starve on your way to the green job Batchelder said Medina County is particularly poised to play a major role in this short term recovery focus When we create the jobs , it 's also important to have people trained to do them , he said So again , we have to find out from the business community what those needs are , then use or facilities such as the Akron University branch and the Medina County Career Center for that training That sort of business focus has begun to resonate with an increasingly weary electorate , in Batchelder 's view I think people are not so much looking for hope and change as nuts and bolts that maybe we need to be more business focused in order to put this economy back together , he said We have n't had control of the House for the last two years and it 's been malfunctioning , we had 109 session scheduled and held 49 Batchelder said that in spite of the fact that Ohio is in the worst shape since the Depression economically , having such a focus will turn around the state 's fortunes We need people who will roll up their sleeves to do the legislative work that needs done , he said There is no doubt in my mind we are in the position to do that Contact Lisik at \( 216 \) 986 2356
