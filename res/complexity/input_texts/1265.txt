His mind is made up and that’s that.”And it’s not likely that the band can hire a replacement for Plant’s unique voice.“There is no way they can go ahead without him,” the source said.Branson, a tremendous fan of the ’70s rock band, reportedly pulled out all the stops to get the “The Song Remains the Same” rockers back on stage together.The founder of Virgin Group was planning on renaming one of his jumbo jets “The Starship” and having the craft ferry the stars around to their gigs.He was even going to have the staircase of the jet renamed the Stairway to Heaven after the band’s landmark hit.“Even his money was not enough to get Plant to sign up,” the source said, adding that the tycoon was very upset by the singer’s diss.The band last played together, with Jason Bonham filling in on drums, during a tribute concert at London’s O2 arena in 2007.The band has been notoriously cranky about whether it would ever reunite, with Plant even calling one reporter a “schmuck” during a press conference in 2012.
