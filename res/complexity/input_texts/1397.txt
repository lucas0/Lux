b'Ms. Harris began her second term as attorney general the next year by outlining steps to make policing fairer and more transparent, saying we must acknowledge that too many have felt the sting of injustice. Still, she hesitated, refusing to endorse AB-86, a bill opposed by police unions that would have required her office to appoint special prosecutors to examine deadly police shootings.\n\nIn San Francisco, the police killed 18 people during Ms. Harriss six years as attorney general. But if there was a single flash point, it was the shooting of 26-year-old Mario Woods in December 2015. Widely circulated cellphone videos showed officers surrounding Mr. Woods  disturbed, strung out on methamphetamines and armed with a steak knife. Five officers fired 46 rounds, hitting him with 21.\n\nA series of rallies followed, and an 18-day hunger strike by five men who came to be known as the Frisco Five. Many believed that Ms. Harris would take action, as her predecessor, Jerry Brown, had done in 2009, when he obtained a court order placing the police department in Maywood under his oversight after widespread misconduct.\n\nIn a letter to Ms. Harris, Jeff Adachi, then San Franciscos public defender, urged her to exert her authority in the Woods case and several other shootings. An investigation, he said, would settle the pressing question of whether the racism evidenced in these incidents is endemic.\n\nUltimately, it was the Justice Department that intervened, led by Mr. Davis, the former East Palo Alto police chief, who had become director of the agencys office of community-oriented policing services. Mr. Davis said his work was bolstered by warnings from Ms. Harris that she would investigate the San Francisco police if necessary.\n\nWe werent absent, said Venus Johnson, a former associate attorney general who advised Ms. Harris on criminal justice issues, adding that there were frequent discussions with San Francisco officials. We werent putting our heads in the sand. We were actively involved. (The city later adopted some recommendations from a 68-page Justice Department report that found disproportionate use of force against people of color. In 2018, the district attorney said he would not bring criminal charges in the Woods case, though he called the shooting unnecessary and disturbing.)'
