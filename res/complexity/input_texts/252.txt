A luxury island previously owned by Tiger Woods, the golfer, is up for sale.The 62-acre island, in Lake Mälaren, Sweden, was the former home of the 14-time major winner and his ex-wife, Elin Nordegren, to whom he was married for six years.It boasts six tee-off areas for a custom-made golf hole, features a secluded villa, a hunting lodge and its very own landing strip for propeller planes.The island also includes a protected quay, private ferry boat, historic hill fort, pasture land for horses, stables and two small Skinnpälsarna islands with a water area of around 500 acres.However, potential buyers will have to bring their own clubs as the main building does not come with furnishing.Sabine Rollinger, of Vladi Private Islands, which is listing the island, said: "This island was owned by Tiger Woods, but after his divorce he doesn't need an island in Sweden any more."This is a unique, exclusive private island with total privacy. It includes a private harbour, untouched woods, beautiful lush parks, open fields, striking lake views and a tastefully designed main residence, a mini-mansion."Also on the island is a landing strip and six tee-off areas for golf practice. The secluded villa, hunting lodge and stables are located on the main island and surrounded by a very large lawn."Here you can land your private prop airplane, play soccer, do some riding or enjoy unstructured golfing."A hundred metres from the villa is the private, protected bay, and a 50-metre long quay that provides plenty of space for your own, and your friends' boats."This is the place to begin great fishing trips in your own private fishing waters, take a boat ride out to Mälaren's over 1,000 islands or the beautiful archipelago of Stockholm.Tiger Woods with ex-wife Elin Nordegren in 2010 (Reuters)"This island is also unique due to its central location as the Swedish capital is only about an hour away by boat or car, and from there you have swift access to the Stockholm archipelago."The property even has a historical 11th century Viking stronghold, a dramatic landscape with approximately 30 metres high rocks rising out of the lake."The island boasts a variety of wildlife, such as deer, hares and beavers - even elks can be seen on occasion."The protected location, combined with the quay's generous dimensions, make it an ideal place for private parties and outdoor dining."You go for a swim in Lake Mälaren, where the water reaches temperatures of up to 26C in the summer."Apart from the island, the property also includes the two small Skinnpälsarna islands and a water area of around two million square metres."Vladi Private Islands said the island's price would be released on request.
