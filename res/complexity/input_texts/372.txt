b'It is as if someone has dimmed all the lights.\n\nI go shopping for food and feel privileged. Many Iraqis are running out of money because they cannot work under the lockdown, so the outdoor markets are filled with women picking things up and putting them down again after checking the price. It seems a small inconvenience that I am getting bored of halloumi cheese. The sweet-tart citrus fruit called sindhi  a cross between a grapefruit and a pomelo but drier, so you can pick up peeled slices and not get your fingers sticky  is still in the markets. Soon, though, its season will be over.'
