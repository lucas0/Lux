by Chase McFadden HOUSTON , TX After double checking their math , scientists have announced that the total lunar eclipse predicted for August 21 , 2017 , will occur August 3 , 2018 Due to a computational mishap , the eclipse we projected for later this month will actually take place late next year , stated NASA astrophysicist Dr Theodore Moneta at a hastily planned press conference from Johnson Space Center in Houston We were a bit off Dr Moneta explained that in calculating the date of the eclipse , scientists utilized a complex formula involving geocentric ephemeris for the Sun and Moon , various parameters , constants , and the Besselian elements , but along the way an error went unnoticed In layman 's terms , we forgot to carry the one , explained Moneta , a mistake that has plagued 12 year olds in 7th grade math for centuries This is an embarrassing day for both science and mathematics , he added For officials in those states situated within the eclipse 's path of totality preparing for an influx of visitors in the next few weeks , the NASA announcement came as a shock It 's disappointing , stated Matt Mead , governor of Wyoming , upon hearing the news Obviously , the NASA nerds really dropped the ball on this one However , Mead felt that Wyoming would be less affected by the altered date than other locales due the Cowboy State 's inherent awesomeness A visit to our state is spectacular with or without a once in lifetime astronomical occurrence , said Mead Wyoming does n't need an eclipse to shine
