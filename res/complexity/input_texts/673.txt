b'MOUNT PLEASANT, S.C.  Mark Sanford smiled. He shook hands, posed for photographs and drove himself around his district on Election Day. He ordered a chocolate milkshake.\n\nBut all day, after all these years as a governor and a congressman, he seemed to know what might be coming: his first concession speech. So it came to be in a crowded restaurant here on Tuesday night, hours after he had been openly mocked by President Trump, then knocked aside by a rival who vowed a close alliance with the White House. Mr. Sanford, a politician first sent to Washington as an insurgent of one era, was toppled in a different moment by a different kind of renegade.\n\nWe are to cower before the people who elected us, and I get their verdict tonight, Mr. Sanford said, reading from scribbled notes on a legal pad, as it became clear he would lose his House race against Katie Arrington in South Carolinas Republican primary.\n\nEven for a politician accustomed to humiliations  his marital infidelity and ill-fated, infamous trip to the Appalachian Trail, which was actually Argentina, still proved ripe for jabs this campaign  Mr. Sanfords political unraveling in South Carolina was a striking comedown that somehow seemed both impossible and inescapable.'
