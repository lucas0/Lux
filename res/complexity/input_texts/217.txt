Melania Trump is facing yet more criticism today after wearing a Daleks t-shirt during a visit to the Holocaust Memorial in Berlin.Spokes-bigot for The White House, Sarah Huckabee-Sanders, told The Rochdale Herald that there was no hidden meaning behind her decision to wear a t-shirt that says Exterminate to a memorial for six million murdered Jews insisting it’s just a t-shirt.“It’s just a t-shirt and isn’t supposed to say anything about this administration’s position on the Holocaust, which probably didn’t happen anyway.”“She doesn’t know what Exterminate means because she’s a foreign and doesn’t speak a word of English.”“She just likes Daleks, they’re her second favourite genocidal maniacs.”This is her third clothing gaffe this week after she wore a coat that read “I really don’t care, do you?” during a visit to migrant child detention centre in Texas and an “I’m with stupid t-shirt” to The White House Correspondents’ Dinner.
