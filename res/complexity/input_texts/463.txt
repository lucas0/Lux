So , OK , I put Out Some Wrong Info Yesterday ! \( I 'll Admit it , I thought It Was Harry S Truman That Pushed This About the Confederate Soldiers and Members Of the Confederate Armed Services ! \( Nope It Was During Ike 's Administration ! \) Fact IS , U S Public LAW 85 425 , Enacted May 23rd 1958 ! Basically STATES ANY MEMBER OF THE CONFEDERATE ARMED FORCES NOW HAVE THE STATUS OF A UNITED STATES VETERAN ! D AND ANY REMOVAL OF A CONFEDERATE MONUMENT BY A CITY , CAMPUS OR STATE GROUND IS IN FACT A VIOLATION OF U S PUBLIC LAW 85 425 ! AND ANY FANCY PANTS LAWYER WHO WANT'S TO MAKE A NAME FOR HIM HER SELF SHOULD FILE A CLASS ACTION LAW SUIT ! 3
