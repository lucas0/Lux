b'Mississippi Republicans are taking a shoot first , ask questions later approach to preventing potential church violence with a bill that amounts to legalizing religious security squads tasked with killing perceived threats This week , the states Republican led senate passed the so called Mississippi Church Protection Act which would militarize the states churches while also walking back gun regulations and stripping away oversight The bill would allow churches to create security programs and designate and train members to carry concealed weapons It would provide criminal and legal protections to those serving as church security The bill also would allow concealed carry in a holster without a permit in Mississippi , expanding a measure passed last year that allowed concealed carry without a permit in a purse , satchel or briefcase , and another recent law that allows open carry in public The bill also seeks to prohibit Mississippi officials from enforcing any federal agency regulations or executive orders that would violate the state constitution an attempt to federal gun restrictions not passed by Congress Mississippi church goers will now get to assign church members as security which can carry concealed weapons without permits and are protected from legal liability if their actions result in death based on a designation of justifiable homicide the same legal standing that we afford police officers on duty pourmecoffee It passed pic twitter com H8WvOdHFA4 pourmecoffee \( pourmecoffee \) March 30 , 2016What could go wrong \? Much of this baffling new legislation is in direct response to NRA lobbying directives to erode existing gun laws in order to create a polite society of heavily armed citizens Exploiting tragedy \( and ignoring irony \) the NRA has used recent mass shootings to push for more guns , not less The narrative goes that if only churches would have access to firearms , shootings like the one in Charleston , South Carolina , could be prevented Subscribe to our Youtube Channel ytsub wrapper width 100 float left margin 24px 0 background D12827 height 46px text decoration none ytsub margin width 440px margin 0 auto ytsub text float left font size 18px font family helvetica , arial , sans serif color fff margin top 12px ytsub button background url \( https s29 postimg org rogixn1br ytsub button jpg \) width 120px height 28px float right margin top 9px position relative z index 9999 media screen and \( max width 469px \) ytsub wrapper height 88px ytsub margin width 340px display inline ytsub text font size 17px text align center width 100 margin top 12px display inline ytsub button top 43px float none margin 0 auto background repeat no repeat The premise , as tempting as it sounds for would be vigilantes , has been thoroughly debunked both in theory and in practice Data suggests that as the number of guns increase , the risk of someone being shot by those guns also increases Places with a lot of good guys with guns tend to have higher incidences of gun injuries Go figure At the same time , anecdotal evidence supports these warnings as well Weve seen that guns in churches often lead to disastrous accidents , while at the same time not once stopping a mass shooting in a house of worship With the removal of even permit requirements , Mississippi is planning on handing over the power of life and death to a bunch of untrained , untested amateurs who wont even have the risk of prosecution keeping their index finger off the trigger A militarized church security unit assigned by the church , trained by the church , and meant to protect the church by any means necessary If Mississippi legislators cant see the inherent danger in this as the bill heads to the House of Representatives to be finalized , then we are in a lot of trouble Featured image via George Frey Getty ImagesShare this Article !
