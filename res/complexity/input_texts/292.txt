This Labor Day , we need protestsAugust 29 , 2011Hunter Ribarchak , 7 , rides on the Iron Workers of America 's float during the annual Labor Day Parade in Pittsburgh , Pa , Monday , Sept 1 , 2008 Photo AP Photo John HellerLabor Day is traditionally a time for picnics and parades But this year is no picnic for American workers , and a protest march would be more appropriate than a parade Not only are 25 million unemployed or underemployed , but American companies continue to cut wages and benefits The median wage is still dropping , adjusted for inflation High unemployment has given employers extra bargaining leverage to wring out wage concessions All told , it 's been the worst decade for American workers in a century According to Commerce Department data , private sector wage gains over the last decade have even lagged behind wage gains during the decade of the Great Depression \( 4 percent over the last ten years , adjusted for inflation , versus 5 percent from 1929 to 1939 \) Big American corporations are making more money , and creating more jobs , outside the United States than in it Big American corporations are making more money , and creating more jobs , outside the United States than in it If corporations are people , as the Supreme Court 's twisted logic now insists , most of the big ones headquartered here are rapidly losing their American identity CEO pay , meanwhile , has soared The median value of salaries , bonuses and long term incentive awards for CEOs at 350 big American companies surged 11 percent last year to 9 3 million \( according to a study of proxy statements conducted for The Wall Street Journal by the management consultancy Hay Group \) Bonuses have surged 19 7 percent This does n't even include all those stock options rewarded to CEOs at rock bottom prices in 2008 and 2009 Stock prices have ballooned since then , the current downdraft notwithstanding In March , 2009 , for example , Ford CEO Alan Mulally received a grant of options and restricted shares worth an estimated 16 million at the time But Ford is now showing large profits in part because the UAW agreed to allow Ford to give its new hires roughly half the wages of older Ford workers and its share prices have responded Mulally 's 2009 grant is now worth over 200 million The ratio of corporate profits to wages is now higher than at any time since just before the Great Depression The ratio of corporate profits to wages is now higher than at any time since just before the Great Depression Meanwhile , the American economy has all but stopped growing in large part because consumers \( whose spending is 70 percent of GDP \) are also workers whose jobs and wages are under assault Perhaps there would still be something to celebrate on Labor Day if government was coming to the rescue But Washington is paralyzed , the president seems unwilling or unable to take on labor bashing Republicans , and several Republican governors are mounting direct assaults on organized labor \( see Indiana , Ohio , Maine and Wisconsin , for example \) So let 's bag the picnics and parades this Labor Day American workers should march in protest They 're getting the worst deal they 've had since before Labor Day was invented and the economy is suffering as a result Published by arrangement with RobertReich org Robert Reich is Chancellor 's Professor of Public Policy at the University of California at Berkeley He has served in three national administrations , most recently as secretary of labor under President Bill Clinton He has written 11 books \( including his most recent , Supercapitalism , which is now out in paperback \) Last modified August 29 , 2011 at 12 06 pm
