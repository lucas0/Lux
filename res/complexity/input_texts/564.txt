But the new proposal is likely to spur only small tweaks to the nations energy system.\n\nDetails of the plan, which is being drafted by the Environmental Protection Agency and is expected to be sent to the White House for approval in coming days , were described to The New York Times by industry officials who have worked closely with the agency to shape the rule.\n\nOn Thursday, Scott Pruitt, the administrator of the E.P.A., submitted his resignation after facing 13 federal investigations into his ethics, spending and management practices. That move is unlikely to lead to a major policy shift at the agency: The new acting E.P.A. chief will be Andrew Wheeler, a former coal lobbyist who shares Mr. Pruitts commitment to rolling back Obama-era climate policies.'
