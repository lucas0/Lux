Trump said at a rally at a convention center here , the night before the South Carolina primary It 's so borderline It 's like your minimal , minimal , minimal torture Trump criticized his Republican rivals for not embracing waterboarding as enthusiastically as he has , which he says sends the wrong message to terrorists who use barbaric techniques like chopping off the heads of their foes You know , I read a story it 's a terrible story , but I 'll tell you , Trump said Should I tell you \? Or should I not \? As the crowd cheered him on , Trump told them about Pershing rough guy , rough guy who was fighting terrorism in the early 1900s Trump did n't say where this happened , but variations of this story online usually state that it happened in the Philippines during the Philippine American War part of the island nation 's protracted battle for independence early in Pershing 's career They were having terrorism problems , just like we do , Trump said And he caught 50 terrorists who did tremendous damage and killed many people And he took the 50 terrorists , and he took 50 men and he dipped 50 bullets in pigs' blood you heard that , right \? He took 50 bullets , and he dipped them in pigs' blood And he had his men load his rifles , and he lined up the 50 people , and they shot 49 of those people And the 50th person , he said You go back to your people , and you tell them what happened And for 25 years , there was n't a problem Okay \? Twenty five years , there was n't a problem At one point in telling this story , Trump said By the way , this is something you can read in the history books not a lot of history books because they do n't like teaching this Donald Trump 's final pitch to South Carolina Although Trump never used the word Muslim in this story , he was clearly referring to Muslim terrorists and at one point commented There 's a whole thing with swine and animals and pigs , and you know the story , you know they do n't like that Pigs are deemed impure by the Koran Trump finished the story with this message So we better start getting tough , and we better start getting vigilant , and we better start using our heads , or we 're not going to have a country , folks We 're not going to have a country A guy in the audience then shouted This is the greatest country in the world While the story was well received by the cheering audience , it appears to be more of a military fable than a history lesson The website snopes com which investigates urban legends , myths , rumors and pretty much anything forwarded in a chain email could find little proof that the story is true There are several versions of the tale circulating , including one in which the prisoners were buried with dead pigs The pigs' blood on the bullets , according to at least one version , would keep a Muslim from entering heaven The Council on American Islamic Relations denounced Trump 's remarks Saturday in a sharply worded statement that accused the billionaire of inciting anti Muslim attacks The group has frequently tussled with Trump over anti Muslim rhetoric , including Trump 's call to temporary prevent all Muslims from entering the country Donald Trump 's inflammatory rhetoric has crossed the line from spreading hatred to inciting violence , said Nihad Awad , national executive director of CAIR By directly stating that the only way to stop terrorism is to murder Muslims in graphic and religiously offensive ways , he places the millions of innocent , law abiding citizens in the American Muslim community at risk from rogue vigilantes Republican presidential rival Sen Marco Rubio \( Fla \) called the story bizarre and questioned its historical authenticity I'm sure people are offended I hope people are offended by that That 's not what the United States is about , Rubio said on NBC 's Today show on Saturday morning Look , we 're in a very weird year here And obviously things are going on , people are saying whatever they want in politics today and there seems to be no accountability The presidency is a serious job and so I hope we can get this campaign back focused on the serious aspect of it and not the circus aspect of it , Rubio added Trump 's campaign had yet to respond to a request for comment Saturday afternoon The real estate mogul found himself mired in multiple controversies in the days leading to Saturday 's South Carolina primary On Friday , he called for a boycott of Apple products over the tech firm 's refusal to assist the FBI in unlocking an iPhone belonging to one of the San Bernardino , Calif , shooters On Thursday , he had sharp words for Pope Francis after the holy leader seemingly condemned Trump 's calls to build a wall along the U S Mexico border The billionaire tweeted a message Saturday morning that knocked President Obama for not attending Supreme Court Justice Antonin Scalia 's funeral and echoed past statements made by himself and others questioning the president 's Christian faith I wonder if President Obama would have attended the funeral of Justice Scalia if it were held in a Mosque \? Very sad that he did not go !
