Get US Out! of the United Nations has been the signature campaign of The John Birch Society for over 50 years. The global power elites view the UN as their main vehicle for establishing, step by step, a socialistic global government controlled by themselves. Now, more than ever, we need to get the US out of the UN and the UN out of the US. Each year, we gain more support to Get US Out! Can we count on your support today? If you're not already a member of The John Birch Society, consider joining today! Members work together to organize local action to create the change they seek: less government, more responsibility, and — with God's help — a better world.
