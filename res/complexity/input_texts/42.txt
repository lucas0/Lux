RECOGNIZE OUR CONSTITUTIONAL RIGHT TO OPEN CARRY FIREARMS AT THE REPUBLICAN NATIONAL CONVENTION AT THE QUICKEN LOANS ARENA IN JULY 2016 SUMMARY In July of 2016 , the GOP will host its convention at the Quicken Loans Arena in Cleveland , Ohio Though Ohio is an open carry state , which allows for the open carry of guns , the hosting venue the Quicken Loans Arena strictly forbids the carry of firearms on their premises According to the policy on their website , firearms and other weapons of any kind are strictly forbidden on the premises of Quicken Loans Arena This is a direct affront to the Second Amendment and puts all attendees at risk As the National Rifle Association has made clear , gun free zones such as the Quicken Loans Arena are the worst and most dangerous of all lies The NRA , our leading defender of gun rights , has also correctly pointed out that gun free zones tell every insane killer in America \( the \) safest place to inflict maximum mayhem with minimum risk \( March 4 , 2016 and Dec 21 , 2012 \) Cleveland , Ohio is consistently ranked as one of the top ten most dangerous cities in America By forcing attendees to leave their firearms at home , the RNC and Quicken Loans Arena are putting tens of thousands of people at risk both inside and outside of the convention site This does n't even begin to factor in the possibility of an ISIS terrorist attack on the arena during the convention Without the right to protect themselves , those at the Quicken Loans Arena will be sitting ducks , utterly helpless against evil doers , criminals or others who wish to threaten the American way of life All three remaining Republican candidates have spoken out on the issue and are unified in their opposition to Barack HUSSEIN Obama 's gun free zones Donald Trump said I will get rid of gun free zones on schools you have and on military bases on my first day It gets signed my first day you know what a gun free zone is to a sicko \? That 's bait \( Jan 8 2016 \) Ted Cruz has accurately pointed out shooting after shooting after shooting happens in so called gun free zones He continued , look , if you 're a lunatic ai n't nothing better then having a bunch of targets you know that are going to be unarmed \( Dec 4 , 2015 \) And Ohio Governor John Kasich has been a leader in this movement to eliminate deadly gun free zones starting with his brave decision to fight the Democrats and end gun free zones at National Guard facilities in Ohio \( Dec 18 , 2015 \) We are all too familiar with the mass carnage that can occur when citizens are denied their basic God given rights to carry handguns or assault weapons in public EVERY AMERICAN HAS THE RIGHT TO PROTECT AND DEFEND THEIR FAMILY With this irresponsible and hypocritical act of selecting a gun free zone for the convention , the RNC has placed its members , delegates , candidates and all US citizens in grave danger We must take a stand We cannot allow the national nominating convention of the party of Lincoln and Reagan to be hijacked by weakness and political correctness The policies of the Quicken Loans Arena do not supersede the rights given to us by our Creator in the U S Constitution THEREFORE , WE ARE CALLING TODAY FOR THE FOLLOWING FIVE POINTS OF ACTION 1 From the Quicken Loans Arena in Cleveland A suspension of their policy preventing the open carry of firearms on the premises of the arena from July 18 21 , 2016 to coincide with the Republican National Convention 2 From the National Rifle Association An immediate condemnation of the egregious affront to the Second Amendment of the United States Constitution constituted by the gun free zone loophole to the state law 3 From Ohio Governor John Kasich A concerted effort to use his executive authority to override the gun free zone loophole being exploited by the Quicken Loans Arena in Cleveland , Ohio 4 From Reince Priebus and the Republican National Committee An explanation of how a venue so unfriendly to Second Amendment rights was chosen for the Republican Convention Further , we demand a contingency plan to relocate the convention to another location should the Quicken Loans Arena refuse to honor the constitutional rights of the RNC guests to open carry firearms during the convention 5 From all Republican candidates for President You have been brave in raising awareness about the immense dangers posed by gun free zones In order to ensure the safety of your supporters , delegates and all attendees at the convention in July , you must call upon the RNC to rectify this affront to our Second Amendment freedoms and insist upon a suspension of the Quicken Loans Arena 's unconstitutional gun free zone loophole Every American is endowed with a God given Constitutional right to carry a gun wherever and whenever they please
