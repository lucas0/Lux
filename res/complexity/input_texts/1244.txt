This was copied, not my child. If your child has MUSICALLY/TIK TOK, make them delete it now!!! Friday night Lilly got a text from a Pennsylvania number. They knew her name, age, where she lived and her email. We took her phone to Verizon and they said it was the most dangerous app. Even with her account being set to private, they can still access all of her information.
