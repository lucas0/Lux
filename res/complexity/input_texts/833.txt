Members of the House Armed Services Committee met with Jordan's King Abdullah Tuesday not long after news broke that ISIS had burned to death a Jordanian pilot captured in the fight against the terrorist group. In a private session with lawmakers, the king showed an extraordinary measure of anger â€” anger which he expressed by citing American movie icon Clint Eastwood."He said there is going to be retribution like ISIS hasn't seen," said Republican Rep. Duncan Hunter Jr., a Marine Corps veteran of two tours in Iraq and one in Afghanistan, who was in the meeting with the king. "He mentioned 'Unforgiven' and he mentioned Clint Eastwood, and he actually quoted a part of the movie."Hunter would not say which part of "Unforgiven" the king quoted, but noted it was where Eastwood's character describes how he is going to deliver his retribution. There is a scene in the picture in which Eastwood's character, William Munny, says, "Any man I see out there, I'm gonna kill him. Any son of a bitch takes a shot at me, I'm not only going to kill him, I'm going to kill his wife and all his friends and burn his damn house down."RELATED: Obama calls Islamic State morally 'bankrupt' after apparent killing of Jordanian pilot"He's angry," Hunter said of King Abdullah. "They're starting more sorties tomorrow than they've ever had. They're starting tomorrow. And he said, 'The only problem we're going to have is running out of fuel and bullets.'""He's ready to get it on," Hunter added. "He really is. It reminded me of how we were after 9/11. We were ready to give it to them."Hunter said there was no mention of President Obama during the bipartisan meeting, either by King Abdullah or by any of the lawmakers in the room.RELATED: Islamic State video appears to show Jordanian pilot being burned aliveRead Byron York's story on the King of Jordan's fiery response to ISIS burning his pilot alive ht... in Politics on LockerDome
