After Stan Beaton's wife, Ruby, passed away in 2003, he saved the "leave a message after the beep" recording that they had shared.The recording was lost after Virgin Mobile conducted some technical work, but with the help of BBC Radio Leeds, the company was able to retrieve the deleted message for Stan â€” and captured his reaction to hearing it again.Stan, 68, is incredulous when he hears the good news. In the video, a reporter tells Stan that it took 10 people a total of three days to retrieve the message. "That must have cost a fortune!" Stan exclaims."It's just a wonderful, wonderful sound that I thought was lost forever," Stan says. I suppose it's going to be a bit of a PR job now, but thank you Virgin Media."
