b'Echoing the observations of doctors treating thousands of patients in the pandemic, the federal health agency changed its website to cite the following symptoms as possible indicators of Covid-19, the infection caused by the coronavirus:\n\nchills\n\nrepeated shaking with chills\n\nmuscle pain\n\nheadache\n\nsore throat\n\nand, new loss of taste or smell.\n\nPreviously it had listed just three symptoms: fever, cough and shortness of breath.\n\nThe C.D.C. added the six symptoms earlier this month after new recommendations were issued by an organization of public health epidemiologists that is responsible for defining which infectious diseases are tracked and reported to the agency. The organization, the Council of State and Territorial Epidemiologists or C.S.T.E., recommended that Covid-19 be considered a nationally reportable illness and gave guidelines about how cases should be defined and identified.'
