Clinton began to laugh but Maddow stopped her Madam Secretary , that 's not funny There are 37 million people in the path of the worst storm our country has seen since Katrina and it will probably do more damage That was callous and wrong You 've been poisoned Not everything is politics Maddow cancelled the interview and agreed to bury the footage , but one sound engineer who is a true patriot managed to keep a copy As soon as I heard her say it I knew she screwed up real bad She was talking to people backstage about running for president again in 2020 There ai n't no way she 's gonna run now Not without making me a very rich man The engineer , who refused to be named , says he will hold onto the footage until he needs it to either save the country or himself He says he 's made arrangements in case anything happens to him Share This As American As Apple Pie Article Now ! 3 5k
