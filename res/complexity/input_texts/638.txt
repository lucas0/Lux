Giant Squid Washes Ashore on Lake Michigan Michigan DNR were called to Leland to the report of a giant squid which had washed ashore Michigan DNR Marine Biologist Dr Debra Polowotski arrived at Good Harbor Bay and confirmed the 21 foot long giant squid to be a very rare fresh water species of genus Architeuthis We thought they were already in Lake Erie , we had no idea they were in Lake Michigan This is first time there s been an actual specimen recovered , so this is very exciting , she said It is believed that a few of the squid escaped from the Cleveland Sea World complex during the great Northeast blackout of 2003 when they were very young , and somehow made it into Lake Erie According to Dr Polowotski , the squid were kept contained in Lake Erie , as the Detroit River is too narrow and shallow for the squid to swim upstream They are intimidated by closed in spaces They need a lot of room You have to remember that this is a very big animal , she said Dr Polotwotski also confirmed that the squid is a female and further examination of the corpse indicated that it had recently laid eggs Hopefully the walleye can keep the tiny giant squid population under control , else there is some cause for concern , said Dr Polowotski Boaters and swimmers really need to exercise some caution The animal was discovered by Bob Ritchie and his sister Jill , both of Romeo We were just , you know , taking an evening walk along the beach , heading out to the sandbar when we stumbled across it , said Bob We were singing , drinking whiskey out of the bottle , not thinking about tomorrow But something like this really does make you stop and think , he said DNR officials removed the animal from the beach and took it to an undisclosed location for further study
