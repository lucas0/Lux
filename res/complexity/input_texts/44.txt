Reena Rose Sibayan The Jersey JournalPeople waited recently for several hours for the computers at the Motor Vehicle Commission in Jersey City to be fixed By Kevin OToole As a member of the state Senate Budget and Appropriations Committee , I recently participated in a hearing about recent problems at some Motor Vehicle Commission \( MVC \) offices in our area Specifically , these problems include long wait times and customers being turned away due to computer problems The public hearing proved itself to be nothing more than naked political theater by the Democratic members of the committee and a brazen election year stunt The problems with MVC service are almost entirely caused by an outdated computer system that is 30 years old The technology was placed in service back when drivers licenses were little more than laminated pieces of paper , not the secure documents that we rely on today to prevent identity theft , crime and terrorism Since the beginning of the Christie administration , the MVC has made great strides in serving its customers It has placed a greater emphasis on moving critical technology projects forward to better position the commission for the future We have finally restarted much needed upgrades that were put on hold during the Codey and Corzine administrations Year after year , during budget hearings , those of us who serve on the budget committees were told about major MVC technology investments , such as the Motor Vehicle Automated Transaction System \( MATRX \) and the Enhanced Digital Driver License \( EDDL \) , which were planned to improve customer service and make the MVC computers more reliable The proposed introduction of an extended six year license , along with plans to implement online license renewals , were meant to be positive changes for New Jersey drivers Those changes would make renewing easier and would reduce customer volume spikes and long lines at MVC offices In reality , projections about the effects of a six year license were off , implementation of the new digital driver license was greatly delayed and customer volume spikes and long lines exist to this day Had the EDDL project moved forward within the planned time frame under previous administrations , a contract would have been awarded in August 2008 Under this timeline , online renewals would have been in place by late 2009 , and the delays caused by the outdated , unreliable technology would not continue to occur While previous governors never made improving customer service at the MVC a priority , the Christie administration has been proactive in addressing short term MVC needs while it works to complete its long term technological improvements MVC office hours have been increased 20 percent to 54 5 hours per week more hours than ever before and include the restoration of service on Mondays Additional staff is being added at high volume MVC offices to speed up transactions , and additional cameras that are needed to issue drivers licenses are being installed , as well And to ensure that customers are not left waiting in line exposed to the elements , MVC office space is being rearranged to shelter more customers comfortably indoors while they are waiting to be served These changes will yield near immediate results in improving the customer experience at MVC offices and are the best short term options available to remedy a bad situation left by previous governors and Motor Vehicle commissioners But they are just that short term solutions The key to modernizing the MVC and solving its problems in the long term lies in updated technology Gov Christie is fixing the problems left by other governors who failed to bring the MVCs computer technology up to modern standards The dramatic change at the MVC is not just about this administrations push to introduce new technology , but also a number of other positive steps designed to better serve its customers From instituting the greatest number of agency service hours in motor vehicle history and the opening of state of the art facilities on state owned land to installing more camera equipment and increasing staffing levels at our states busiest agencies , under Gov Christies leadership , the MVC is doing whats necessary to fulfill the needs of New Jersey drivers After all of the upgrades are completed and more services are online , the wait times at the MVC will drop significantly In fact , most drivers will have to visit the MVC only once every eight years a welcome change from the current situation I would have hoped that my colleagues in the Legislature who noted concerns about the MVC would have shown greater interest over the last several years when essential technology projects were languishing under previous administrations Updating the technological capabilities of the MVC is of critical importance and should not be used for political gain As we near the 10th anniversary of the 9 11 terrorist attacks , we should not forget that some of the hijackers used New Jersey drivers licenses to board those aircraft Efforts like these to make the state drivers license more secure and the MVC more efficient will go a long way toward making drivers happier and New Jersey safer Kevin OToole , a Republican , represents the 40th District in the New Jersey Senate , where he is a member of its budget and
