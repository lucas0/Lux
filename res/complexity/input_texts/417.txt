Spread the love State Senator Scott Wiener \( D San Francisco \) and Assemblywoman Susan Eggman \( D Stockton \) introduced recent legislation to end blatant discrimination against LGBT young people regarding California 's sex offender registry However , under their bill , SB 145 , the offenders would not have to automatically register as sex offenders if the offenders are within 10 years of age of the minor Wiener claims the current law disproportionately targets LGBT young people for mandatory sex offender registration , since LGBT people usually cannot engage in vaginal intercourse Existing law , the Sex Offender Registration Act , amended by Proposition 35 by voters in 2012 \( Ban on Human Trafficking and Sex Slavery \) , requires a person convicted of a certain sex crime to register with law enforcement as a sex offender while residing in California or while attending school or working in California Wiener says , Currently , for consensual yet illegal sexual relations between a teenager age 15 and over and a partner within 10 years of age , sexual intercourse' \( i e , vaginal intercourse \) does not require the offender to go onto the sex offender registry rather , the judge decides based on the facts of the case whether sex offender registration is warranted or unwarranted By contrast , for other forms of intercourse specifically , oral and anal intercourse sex offender registration is mandated under all situations , with no judicial discretion This bill would authorize a person convicted of certain offenses involving minors to seek discretionary relief from the duty to register if the person is not more than 10 years older than the minor , SB 145 states Proposition 35 was created and passed to protect children from sexual exploitation and sex trafficking Victims of sex trafficking are often vulnerable children , afraid for their lives and abused sexually , physically , and mentally , the Proposition said What Does SB 145 Also Do \? Legislators Wiener and Eggman say they are trying to shield LGBT young people from having to automatically register as sex offenders for specified sex crimes But their bill does much more SB 145 would allow a sex offender who lures a minor with the intent to commit a felony \( i e a sex act \) the ability to escape registering as a sex offender as long as the offender is within 10 years of age of the minor No specification is made as to whether the sexual offender is straight or LGBT SB 145 would add a section to the state 's penal code \( Section 290 55 \) stipulating that as long as the offender is not more than 10 years older than the minor , they are not automatically mandated to register as a sex offender There is no age limit or range specified , except for existing law which already excludes lewd acts with children under 14 SB 145 appears to allow adults to victimize minors by luring them with the intent to have sex , and then shields the predator from being automatically registered as a sex offender , as in the case of a 25 year old luring a 15 year old for sex , or a 22 year old luring a 12 year old SB 145 , as currently written , appears to allow certain sexual predators to live among the population without anyone being aware Why is this bill needed \?
