b'Bidens signature issues\n\nMr. Biden, who has served in public life for around a half-century, is emphasizing his government experience, seeking to cast himself as a steady, seasoned hand in a dangerous and uncertain world.\n\nAs the coronavirus crisis has unfolded, he has looked for ways to help voters picture him as commander in chief, formulating recommendations rooted in advice from health care and economics experts. Those suggestions include making coronavirus tests broadly accessible, and free. He has said there should be no out-of-pocket cost for patients to receive an eventual vaccine, either. And he has been sharply critical of President Trumps response to the virus, accusing him of reacting too slowly.\n\nMr. Biden served as vice president in the Obama administration during the passage of the Affordable Care Act, and health care remains a top priority for him. Its an issue he often discusses in the context of his familys personal tragedies: He lost his first wife and an infant daughter in a car accident in 1972, and in 2015, his son Beau Biden died of brain cancer. Health care, he said in an early television ad, is personal to him. He supports adding a public option to the Affordable Care Act, but opposes Medicare for all, the sweeping single-payer measure advocated by some progressives in his party, including Senator Bernie Sanders.\n\nMr. Biden, who served for decades in the Senate, firmly believes in the value of bipartisanship and insists on extending overtures to Republicans even in a moment when many in his own party dont see negotiating partners on the other side. As a former chairman of the Senate Foreign Relations Committee, he also speaks passionately about asserting and defending Americas role as a leader on the global stage.'
