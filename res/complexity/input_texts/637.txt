Mo, as he’s known, won’t disclose his full net worth but says it’s in “the high eight figures.”Mo’s got an apartment in Midtown Manhattan, though his parents won’t let him move out of their house until he’s 18. He bought a BMW, but he doesn’t have a license to drive it – his dad drives him on inspirational tours past the home of his idol, billionaire Paul Tudor Jones, a hedge-funder and private asset manager who’s ranked the 108th richest American, according to Forbes.Islam recalls that, when he first experimented with penny stocks (at the tender age of 9), he lost some of the money he’d saved up from tutoring, which caused him to swear off trading briefly. But he was reinvigorated by Jones’s story and quotes his idol: “You learn more from your losses than from your gains.”From all appearances, Islam’s learned plenty.RELATED: Teen Performs CPR to Save Baby at Missouri Walmart[IMAGE” “” “” “0” ]Like us on Facebook for more stories like this!
