Because He 's sick of what he 's seeing But the best part about it , and the thing that we are obviously too stubborn to realize , the activist added , is He is more than willing to forgive He will always offer you a clean slate and a fresh start , no matter how sinful you 've become All we need to do now , all we need to do to help our women be better and more virtuous , is make them stop having dirty fantasies As if that was n't enough , Scarborough also stated his theory on how the deed should be done I ca n't say from personal experience , but I 've heard that talking to women never works because they 're too stubborn Beating the living daylights out of them is another way to go , and that 's what I 'd recommend I think every single woman who has dirty fantasies should be beaten and beaten well Then and only then will God even consider giving us the cure for breast cancer And another thing , Scarborough added I'm pretty sure that therapy by beating might also work on a certain percentage of the gay population I'm not sure what percentage , since a number of them probably loves to be roughed up during their filthy intercourse anyway , but it might prove to be a positive form of physical therapy after all
