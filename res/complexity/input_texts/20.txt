Looks like a photoshop job Normally the 3 outfits shown would be the same outfit but in different colors You can see the two in the background match , but the middle outfit does n't The artstyle is also different and the proportions are off They kept the face of the originally drawn girl in the middle , but drew over with new clothes and body Notice how the skin color of the middle girls face is orange , but the arms and legs are more white \? Notice the two background women are drawn with matching face and body tone You can see the difference in how the clothes are drawn as well The way the clothing are sketched does n't match in style or level of detail Somebody altered the original cover , changing the clothing of the middle woman , to match Conway Decent photoshop job in terms of skills , but they rushed it and did n't pay attention to the details
