The totals include deaths from Covid-19 as well as those from other causes, likely including people who could not be treated as hospitals became overwhelmed.\n\nWhere we found higher deaths than normal Area PCT. above normal Excess\n\ndeaths  Reported Covid-19 deaths = Difference Spain\n\nMar. 16 - May 10 72% 43,700  26,570 = 17,200 U.S.\n\nMar. 25 - Apr. 25 23% 63,700  47,430 = 16,300 U.K.\n\nMar. 14 - May 15 56% 59,200  45,226 = 14,000 Italy\n\nMarch 49% 24,600  13,710 = 10,900 Ecuador\n\nMarch - April 84% 10,100  1,561 = 8,500 Five cities in Brazil\n\nMar. 29 - May 2 47% 8,300  3,322 = 5,000 Netherlands\n\nMar. 16 - May 10 38% 8,800  5,416 = 3,400 Jakarta\n\nMarch - April 43% 2,600  381 = 2,200 Thailand\n\nMarch 4% 1,800  12 = 1,700 France\n\nMar. 16 - Apr. 26 34% 24,300  22,708 = 1,500 Istanbul\n\nMar. 9 - May 10 32% 3,700  2,272 = 1,400 Moscow\n\nApril 18% 1,800  642 = 1,100 Peru\n\nApril 22% 2,100  1,021 = 1,100 Sweden\n\nMar. 16 - May 10 32% 4,300  3,594 = 700 Portugal\n\nMar. 16 - May 10 11% 1,800  1,135 = 700 Austria\n\nMar. 16 - May 10 8% 900  607 = 300 Chile\n\nMarch - April 7% 500  227 = 300 Switzerland\n\nMar. 16 - May 3 18% 1,600  1,473 = 100 Finland\n\nMar. 16 - Apr. 26 4% 200  190 = <100 Israel\n\nMarch Normal <100  20 = <0 Norway\n\nMar. 23 - Apr. 19 4% 100  158 = <0 Belgium\n\nMar. 16 - May 10 51% 8,500  8,800 = <0 South Africa\n\nMar. 18 - May 19 Normal <100  312 = <0 Denmark\n\nMar. 29 - May 3 3% 100  421 = <0 Germany\n\nMar. 16 - Apr. 26 3% 3,000  5,737 = <0 Note: Excess deaths are estimates that include deaths from Covid-19 and other causes. Reported Covid-19 deaths reflect official coronavirus deaths during the period when all-cause mortality data is available, including figures that were later revised. Reported Covid-19 deaths in Istanbul are estimated based on the governments statement that 60 percent of the countrys cases are in the city.\n\nThese numbers undermine the notion that many people who have died from the virus may soon have died anyway. In Britain, which has recorded more Covid-19 deaths than any country except the United States, 59,000 more people than usual have died since mid-March  and about 14,000 more than have been captured by official death statistics.\n\nDeaths in the U.K. 59,300+ excess deaths from March 14 to May 15 0 10,000 20,000 weekly deaths Jan. March Dec. Deaths in 2020 Expected deaths in 2020 Note: Recent data is provisional and may increase as more deaths are counted. Sources: Office for National Statistics; National Records of Scotland; Northern Ireland Statistics and Research Agency.\n\nMortality data in the middle of a pandemic is not perfect. In most places, the disparities between the official death counts and the total rise in deaths reflect limited testing for the virus rather than intentional undercounting. Officially, about 355,000 people had died worldwide of the coronavirus as of Thursday.\n\nBut the total death numbers offer a more complete portrait of the pandemic, researchers say, especially because most countries report only those Covid-19 deaths that occur in hospitals.\n\nWhatever number is reported on a given day is going to be a gross underestimate, said Tim Riffe, a demographer at the Max Planck Institute for Demographic Research in Germany. In a lot of places the pandemic has been going on for long enough that there has been sufficient time for late death registrations to come in, giving us a more accurate picture of what the mortality really was.\n\nThe differences are particularly stark in countries that have been slow to acknowledge the scope of the problem. In March and April, the Indonesian government attributed 381 deaths to the coronavirus in Jakarta. But over 2,700 people more than normal were buried in Jakarta cemeteries during those months, according to data from the citys Department of Parks and Cemeteries.\n\nEcuador recorded about 10,000 more deaths than usual compared to the same period in the last three years  about six times higher than the reported number of Covid-19 deaths in the country during that time. And in Istanbul, the city recorded about 3,700 more deaths than expected from March 9 through May 10.\n\nEcuador 10,100+ excess deaths from March to April 14,000 monthly deaths 7,000 Jan.

The Economist is also tracking these deaths, known as excess deaths, in a similar way.\n\nIt is unusual for mortality data to be released so quickly, demographers say, but many countries are working to provide more comprehensive and timely information because of the urgency of the coronavirus outbreak. The data is limited and, if anything, excess deaths are underestimated because not all deaths have been reported.\n\nAt this stage, its a partial snapshot, said Patrick Gerland, a demographer at the United Nations. Its one view of the problem that reflects that most acute side of the situation, primarily through the hospital-based system.\n\nThat is likely to change.\n\nIn the next couple of months, Mr. Gerland said, a much clearer picture will be possible.\n\nA surge in deaths across Europe\n\nDespite the early data, many European countries have reported clear deviations from normal patterns of deaths, according to data released by the European Mortality Monitoring Project, a research group that collects weekly mortality data from 24 European countries.\n\nIn Italy, almost 50 percent more people died in March than the average for that month in the last five years, about 25,000 deaths more than normal in a single month.\n\nSpain 43,700+ excess deaths from Mar. 16 to May 10 9,000 19,000 weekly deaths Jan.

March Dec. 2020 Expected deaths in 2020 Notes: Data from weeks 1, 52 and 53 are excluded, as they may represent partial weeks.\n\nIn some countries, like Belgium and France, authorities are working to include Covid-19 deaths outside of hospitals in their daily reports, or adjusting the overall Covid-19 death totals once a death is confirmed in a place like a nursing or retirement home.\n\nOthers, like Britains Office for National Statistics, have started to release mortality data after death certificates have been processed, confirming those that mention Covid-19. This provides a more accurate, if delayed, account of mortality than the hospital figures released each day by Public Health England.\n\nNot all countries have seen excess deaths\n\nIn a handful of countries there has been no clear sign of increased mortality this year. The reasons for this are varied and will become more clear in the months ahead as countries process and certify deaths.\n\nIn Norway, Denmark and Finland, demographers say the low mortality is due in part to a less severe flu season this winter  but also because these countries implemented early, severe restrictions to slow the spread of the virus when their outbreaks were smaller and easier to contain.\n\nIsraels coronavirus outbreak has been comparatively small and well-contained, with only 245 Covid-19 deaths recorded. Preliminary mortality data is only available through March, however, and could look different in April.\n\nAnd in South Africa, weekly deaths are lower than normal due to a drop in deaths from non-natural causes like traffic accidents and homicides, according to the South African Medical Research Council. It is also likely that it is still too early in the countrys outbreak to pick up a notable spike in deaths.\n\nNorway 100+ excess deaths from Mar. 23 to Apr. 19 1,000 weekly deaths Jan. March Dec. 2020 Expected deaths in 2020 Denmark 100+ excess deaths from Mar. 29 to May 3 500 weekly deaths Jan.

March Dec. 2020 Expected deaths in 2020 Notes: Data from weeks 1, 52 and 53 are excluded, as they may represent partial weeks.\n\nAge breakdowns in mortality data will provide an even clearer picture of the role of Covid-19 in excess deaths. In Sweden, for example, a high mortality rate among men aged 80 and older accounted for the largest increase in deaths, suggesting that the overall numbers understate the severity of the outbreak for older people in particular.\n\nEven taking into account the new numbers, experts say the death toll to date could have been much worse.\n\nTodays rise in all-cause mortality takes place under conditions of extraordinary measures, such as social distancing, lockdowns, closed borders and increased medical care, at least some which have positive impacts, said Vladimir Shkolnikov, a demographer at the Max Planck Institute for Demographic Research. It is likely that without these measures, the current death toll would be even higher.\n\nRead more about the methodology and download data for excess mortality from The New York Times on GitHub.\n\nTo estimate expected deaths, we fit a linear model to reported deaths in each country from 2015 to January 2020. The model has two components  a linear time trend to account for demographic changes and a smoothing spline to account for seasonal variation. For countries limited to monthly data, the model includes month as a fixed effect rather than using a smoothing spline.\n\nSome countries have less historical data available. For countries with three or fewer years of data, the model uses a simple average of deaths in the observed years. For the United Kingdom, the model accounts for the number of bank holidays in a given week, since deaths are not registered during bank holidays.'
