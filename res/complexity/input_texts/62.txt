Businesses use Page audience data to understand what their followers care about To make audience data even more meaningful for businesses , we re updating the way Page likes are counted by removing memorialized and voluntarily deactivated accounts from Pages like counts This change ensures that data on Facebook is consistent and up to date Removing inactive Facebook accounts There are two primary benefits to removing voluntarily deactivated and memorialized Facebook accounts from Pages like counts Business results Removing inactive Facebook accounts from Page audience data gives businesses up to date insights on the people who actively follow their Page and makes it easier for businesses to find people like their followers through tools like lookalike audiences Consistency We already filter out likes and comments generated by deactivated or memorialized accounts from individual Page posts , so this update keeps data consistent What to expect Over the coming weeks , Page admins should expect to see a small dip in their number of Page likes as a result of this update It s important to remember , though , that these removed likes represent people who were already inactive on Facebook Going forward , any accounts that are voluntarily deactivated or memorialized will be removed from a Page s like count If a deactivated account is reactivated , the account will be re added to a Page s like count Everyone benefits from meaningful information on Facebook It s our hope that this update makes Pages even more valuable for businesses
