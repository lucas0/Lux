b'A small-town police officer who fatally shot an unarmed motorist in the back as he lay face down in the snow was acquitted Thursday of murder. A Dauphin County jury acquitted Officer Lisa Mearkle of the Hummelstown police of third-degree murder and voluntary and involuntary manslaughter charges in a shooting captured by a camera attached to her stun gun. The video, which was played to jurors, showed her shocking David Kassick, 59, after he fled a traffic stop before shooting him twice in the back in February. After the verdict, Ms. Mearkle, 37, tearfully said she was sorry. I feel relief right now, but its going to take a little bit for me to get back to my normal self, she said. In the video, Mr. Kassicks hands repeatedly disappeared beneath his body as Ms. Mearkle screamed at him to keep them where she could see them and then fired the fatal shots. The prosecutor, Johnny Baer, argued that Ms. Mearkle took Davids life without justification. Took it unnecessarily. The encounter began when Ms. Mearkle tried to pull over Mr. Kassick for an expired inspection sticker. It is not clear why he fled, but investigators recovered a syringe near his body and prosecutors have said alcohol and unspecified drugs were in his system.'
