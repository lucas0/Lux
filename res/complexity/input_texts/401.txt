Russia and the United States have never been allies One easily remembers how tense and long lasting the Cold War was , and it left Russia very angry that they suffered such a demoralizing defeat as a world power While the United States should not become Vladimir Putin s best friend , we also have to realize that Russia is a super power in this world and we must take them seriously Hillary and Obama dislike Putin because he only answers to strength and toughness , which is exactly why it is evident he likes Donald Trump As a way to project strength , Obama and Hillary continue to call Putin every name in the book while blaming him for cyber attacks and WikiLeaks On Friday , October 21 , Putin issued a global message that if Hillary Clinton and Barrack Obama continue to slander Russia , he was going to shoot down U S jets in the Middle East and begin to prepare for World War III Putin , Fearing For His Country , Declares War Is Coming If Hillary Continues But now , As of Sunday , October 23 , Putin has ordered the Russian Defense Ministry to begin training and managing all local authorities , law enforcement , and state security as they are preparing for a nuclear war with the United States And with the United States at the eve of war , Hillary Clinton has spent the last two days blaming Putin and Russia for WikiLeaks and continues to call him a thug puppet Moscow is sending a blunt message to Obama and Hillary by purposefully stationing dozens of large aircraft carriers to conduct operations in Syria On top of that , Putin is set to deploy more Russian spy ships to survey underwater internet cables in the region , as well This move originally began as the U S and Russia continued to disagree over Syria , but not it has become the first step into World War III Putin has told Obama that if he does not begin to cooperate and allow Russia to help , he will begin to shoot down American jets as well as aim his missiles towards the United States This has nothing to do with whether or not Russia could defeat the United States This is a result of Obama and Hillary risking war with Russia just because they want to blame Putin for WikiLeaks rather than take blame for their leaked emails She s Very Friendly With Russia As we all recall , Hillary Clinton sold Russia 20 percent of our uranium a few years ago in exchange for 145 , 000 , 000 to the Clinton Foundation So if Russia did not possess enough uranium to bolster their nuclear arsenal then , they have been sufficiently equipped thanks to Hillary Clinton No , Russia cannot defeat the United States , but why not attempt to make the relationship better \? Donald Trump has openly stated he will work with Russia to eliminate ISIS from the Middle East According to Hillary and Democrats , that is a terrible idea Vladimir Putin will continue to take precautions for nuclear war with the United States because they know if Hillary Clinton wins this election , she will engage in warlike conflicts As Secretary of State , she created wars in Libya , Syria , and Iran while also creating ISIS Who can blame Russia for taking precautions \? If a President Clinton scares Russia so badly that they are preparing their entire country for nuclear war , imagine how scared we should be as Americans
