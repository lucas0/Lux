The Straight Scoop I ve just returned from Guantanamo Bay , Cuba Naval Air Station base where we did three shows for the troops and toured several locations around the post visiting with some of the finest military personnel on planet earth The kids seemed to really enjoy the shows and especially liked This Ain t No Rag , It s A Flag and In America We had a great time with them We saw Camp X Ray , where the Taliban detainees are being held only from a distance , but I picked up a lot of what s going on there from talking with a lot of different people The truth of the matter is that this operation is under a microscope The Red Cross has an on site presence there and watches everything that goes on very closely The media is not telling you the whole truth about what s going on over there The truth is that these scum bags are not only being treated humanely , but they are probably better off healthwise and medically than they ve ever been in their lives They are fed well , able to take showers and receive state of the art medical care And have their own Moslem chaplain I saw several of them in a field hospital ward where they were being treated in a state of the art medical facility Now let s talk about the way they treat our people First of all , they have to be watched constantly These people are committed and wanton murderers who are willing to die just to kill someone else One of the doctors told me that when they had Taliban in the hospital the staff had to really be careful with needles , pens and anything else which could possibly be used as a weapon They also throw their excrement and urine on the troops who are guarding them And our guys and gals have shown great restrain in not retaliating We are spending over a million dollars a day maintaining and guarding these nasty killers and anyone who wants to see them brought to the U S A for trial is either out of their heads or a lawyer looking for money and notoriety Or both I wish that the media and the Red Cross and all the rest of the people who are so worried about these criminals would realize that this is not a troop of errant Boy Scouts These are killers of the worst kind They don t need protection from us , we need protection from them If you don t get anything else out of this soapbox , please try to realize that when you see news coverage much of the time you re not getting the whole story , but an account filtered through a liberal mindset with an agenda We have two fights on our hands , the war against terror and the one against the loudmouthed lawyers and left wing media who would sap the strength from the American public by making us believe that we re losing the war or doing something wrong in fighting it Remember these are the same people who told us that Saddam Hussein 's Republican guard was going to be an all but invincible enemy and that our smart bombs and other weapons were not really as good as the military said that they were They also took up for Bill Clinton while he was cavorting around the Oval office with Monica Lewinsky while the terrorists were gaining strength and bombing our Embassies and dragging the bodies of dead American heroes around the dusty streets of Somalia It s a shame that we can t have an unbiased media who would just report the truth and let us make up our own minds Here I must commend Fox News for presenting both sides much better than the other networks They are leaving the other cable networks in the dust People like being told the truth Our military not only needs but deserves our support Let s give it to them The next time you read a media account about the bad treatment of the Taliban in Cuba , remember what I told you Been there done that Footnote I got an e mail from a rather irate first cousin of mine the other day who has a daughter who s a lawyer and she seemed to think that I was painting all lawyers with the same brush Please understand that I m not doing that at all That would be like saying that all musicians were drug addicts There are a lot of good and honest attorneys out there I happen to have one of them But it seems that they never get any airtime It s always the radicals who get their opinions heard Who fight the idea of the military tribunals and site The Constitution and the integrity of America as their source of justifying their opinions Well , first of all The Constitution says We the people of the United States , it doesn t mention any other country And secondly as far as integrity is concerned , I don t think some of these folks would know integrity if it bit them in the posterior What do you think \?
