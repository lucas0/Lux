More comfortable online than out partying , post Millennials are safer , physically , than adolescents have ever been But they re on the brink of a mental health crisis O ne day last summer , around noon , I called Athena , a 13 year old who lives in Houston , Texas She answered her phone she s had an iPhone since she was 11 sounding as if she d just woken up We chatted about her favorite songs and TV shows , and I asked her what she likes to do with her friends We go to the mall , she said Do your parents drop you off \? , I asked , recalling my own middle school days , in the 1980s , when I d enjoy a few parent free hours shopping with my friends No I go with my family , she replied We ll go with my mom and brothers and walk a little behind them I just have to tell my mom where we re going I have to check in every hour or every 30 minutes Those mall trips are infrequent about once a month More often , Athena and her friends spend time together on their phones , unchaperoned Unlike the teens of my generation , who might have spent an evening tying up the family landline with gossip , they talk on Snapchat , the smartphone app that allows users to send pictures and videos that quickly disappear They make sure to keep up their Snapstreaks , which show how many days in a row they have Snapchatted with each other Sometimes they save screenshots of particularly ridiculous pictures of friends It s good blackmail , Athena said \( Because she s a minor , I m not using her real name \) She told me she d spent most of the summer hanging out alone in her room with her phone That s just the way her generation is , she said We didn t have a choice to know any life without iPads or iPhones I think we like our phones more than we like actual people
