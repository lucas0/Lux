b"Iris Baez is Mr. Baez's mother. She still believes that Mr. Livoti murdered her son.\n\nThe incident might seem like history, having taken place on Dec. 22, 1994, on a quiet side street in the University Heights section of the Bronx. History, however, has a funny way of looping around on itself. The loop will take another turn this Sunday when Mr. Livoti is to step from the Federal Correctional Institution in Butner, N.C., as a free man."
