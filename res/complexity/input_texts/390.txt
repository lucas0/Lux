When Donald Trump is sworn in , the White House Press Room , which is a large rectangular room in the West Wing , will become the White House Billiard Hall After today 's disaster of a press conference , it became obvious to President Elect Trump that he will have a much different relationship with the press He told Fox News We will sit down with news outlets individually , find out what they already know and fill them in with the information we feel they deserve according to how they 've treated this administration Some will get the whole story , like the tried and true Fox News and Breitbart and some will get next to nothing , like the horrible Politico and NPR When asked where CNN , which he refused questions from at the press conference because he considers them fake news , Trump said They 're gone No more Their press credentials wo n't be re issued CNN , NBC , ABC , MSNBC , Univision and The New York Times will have to read about what happens in the White House Asked whether or not he was concerned that denying media outlets access to publicly elected officials was a violation of the 1st Amendment , Trump said that he 's not worried about it With my new addition to the Supreme Court I AM the Constitution The country elected me to lead , not be held back by ancient laws we can just change We want jobs , a wall and to rip up the Iran deal Period It should be fun to watch the liberals cry as Trump rips healthcare and public safety nets out from under the poor and forces them to work after abolishing the minimum wage How high and mighty will all the lazy takers feel when they 're forced to work for 3 an hour and have to live in the dumpster behind the McDonalds they scrub \? This is change we can believe in , conservatives ! Change for the better ! ! GOD BLESS YOU , DONALD TRUMP ! ! !
