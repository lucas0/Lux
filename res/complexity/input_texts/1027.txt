But recently the number of new cases has soared, and authorities have warned that a new nationwide lockdown could be implemented if this trend continues.\n\nThe majority of Spains regional authorities have reimposed requirements to wear face coverings at all times outdoors. In Catalonia, the regional government also urged its nearly three million residents to stay indoors as the area reported a surge of new cases.\n\nThe coronavirus outbreak has severely damaged Spain's image as one of the healthiest nations in the world. It has long boasted a robust universal health care system and the highest life expectancy in the European Union. The pandemic also infected thousands of the countrys health workers.\n\nHow Cases Are Growing\n\nHeres how the number of new cases and deaths are changing over time:\n\nNew reported cases by day in Spain 0 5,000 cases Feb. March April May June July Aug. New cases 7-day average These are days with a data reporting anomaly.

Many deaths from unspecified days New deaths 7-day average These are days with a data reporting anomaly. Read more here Note: Scale for deaths chart is adjusted from cases chart to display trend.\n\nThe New York Times has found that official tallies in the United States and in more than a dozen other countries have undercounted deaths during the coronavirus outbreak because of limited testing availability.\n\nSpanish authorities have changed their data collection method several times since March, creating confusion over the actual number of confirmed cases in the country. In April, the health ministry started to include results from antibody tests in its daily tallies of confirmed cases, only to retract them a week later. Antibody tests, authorities said, dont reflect new infections, because they do not determine whether the person developed the disease, how long it has been since he or she has developed immunity.\n\nSince late April, the tally of confirmed cases includes data obtained from PCR diagnostic tests only, which caused a drop in the number of known infections, from around 220,000 to just over 200,000. In late May, Spain announced yet another way of collecting data, by counting a death based on when it occurred instead of when authorities were notified. As a result, the countrys death toll saw a drop of around 2,000 deaths.\n\nConfused? Many people and news outlets have been too. Although authorities have argued that the new data collection system provides a better picture of the pandemic, Spanish news media have reported incomprehensible figures and the thousands of casualties that suddenly disappeared from the series.\n\nSpain, like most countries, is only counting fatalities of those who have tested positive for coronavirus. The Madrid region and Catalonia, the countrys worst hit areas, have reported confirmed or suspected coronavirus deaths provided by funeral homes in daily updates, but those updated numbers are not included in the daily death tolls published by Spains health ministry. The regional numbers there include deaths in nursing homes and suggest that the death toll is far higher than reported so far.\n\nWhere You Can Find More Information\n\nRead more about Spains overwhelmed nursing homes, and watch how unprotected health workers, who have called themselves health care kamikazes, have made their own equipment.
