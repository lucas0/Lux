b'Senator from New Jersey; former city councilman and mayor of Newark; former Rhodes scholar\n\nThree questions about Cory Booker\n\n1. So, what are these baby bonds? One of the earliest proposals Mr. Booker touted on the campaign trail, the program would give every American child a $1,000 savings account at birth. The government would contribute additional money each year on a tiered basis, depending on family income. The account would be turned over to the child at age 18, but could only be used for education, investing in a business or buying a home.\n\n2. Is he the one who started talking about gun licenses? Yes. Following an early pledge to bring the fight to the N.R.A. like theyve never seen before, Mr. Booker introduced his gun control plan in May, which included a national gun-licensing program he likens to a drivers license. Mr. Booker often points to his personal experience with gun violence, as a former mayor of Newark and as someone who still lives in a low-income community, on the campaign trail.'
