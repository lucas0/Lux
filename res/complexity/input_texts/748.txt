By Theodore Shoebat New York City , the most pro abortion city of America , just placed a giant image of Satan on the Empire State Building , in order to convince people to worship and revere Mother Nature , which is really just a deceptive way of getting people to worship the devil The image is specifically that of the Hindu goddess Kali , who is no different than Satan , for the things which the Gentiles sacrifice , they sacrifice to devils , and not to God \( 1 Corinthians 10 20 \) Here is the image According to one report Artist Android Jones designed the fierce portrait of Kali , who is the Goddess of Time , Change , Power and Destruction , to make the point that Mother Nature now more than ever needs a fierce avatar to fight the dangers of pollution and extinction Kali is a demonic demon , who compels her followers to commit mass murder Just to demonstrate this to you \( especially for those who think that Hinduism is a religion of peace \) , in 19th century India there was a cult dedicated to the worship of Kali , called the Thugees The film , Indiana Jones and the Temple of Doom , portrays the Thugee cult as a murderous group that commits human sacrifice The reality is that there was indeed a Thugee cult in India and they did commit mass human sacrifice by the millions , but not by putting people in lava , rather they would strangle their victims to death According to the Guinness Book of Records the Thuggee cult was responsible for approximately 2 , 000 , 000 deaths Two million people ! This is a major holocaust and it was done by Hindus for the cause of Kali , the very satanic demon whose face is on the Empire State Building America is making itself as an offering to the devil , and do not think for a second that God is not angry For The foolish shall not stand in thy sight thou hatest all workers of iniquity \( Psalm 5 5 \) Now lets compare now to 1950s America Here is a photo \( thank you Fabio Emozione \) of Christian crosses upon the buildings , including the Empire State Building , of New York City We have to prepare our minds and intellect for this spiritual war that we are in This is why I made a 2 disk DVD series on teaching the warring spirit of the Christian Faith For too long Christianity has been watered down in our modern day as a pacifist faith with no inclination of fighting evil But is the Church here to be weak and useless \? This shocking and riveting two disk DVD set lecture series , passionately shows how Christianity is not here to be feeble , but for warfare , to be militant against tyranny and the forces of darkness You will not be dissatisfied after watching this lecture , and Bible studies will forevermore never be the same again CLICK HERE TO GET OUR 2 DISK DVD SERIES ON CHRISTIAN MILITANCY AND CHRISTIAN WARFARE AND JOIN THE FIGHT TODAY !
