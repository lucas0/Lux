Donald Trump has gained a ton of momentum He isn t running a campaign , it is a movement Movements start out small and grow because millions of others agree with the message and feel that same passion or anger towards an issue Since 2008 , the United States has declined in nearly every aspect that made us great Our allies don t trust us , our enemies don t fear us , we have domestic terrorist groups like Black Lives Matter being called heroic instead of our law enforcement officers , and we are allowing more than 12 million illegal immigrants to stay here undocumented What sense does that make \? We used to stand for something We used to pride ourselves on leading the world , on defending our allies , crushing our enemies , and thanking our brave men and women in uniform Under Obama and with the help of Hillary Clinton , we haven t been that America in quite awhile But there is a new beacon of hope The Man That Will Make America Great Again ! Not only will Donald Trump make this country great again , he won t have to worry about ever seeing Obama again , either Obama admitted just last week that he and his family are seriously considering moving to Canada if Donald Trump is elected the 46th president of the United States The Obama s had been expected to stay in Washington , DC at least until his daughter graduated from high school , but if they want to leave when Mr Trump takes over , we encourage them to pack up and go In typical Obama fashion , he couldn t just leave it there Not only did he tell reporters that his family will likely move directly to Canada , he said there education system is far superior to ours Their education system is clearly a lot better than ours anyway , he accepted , shaking his head Canadians would never elect someone as buffoonish and incompetent as Donald Trump , at least outside Toronto Obama also added that Canada is clearly a much safer place for a black person , especially one who s surrounded by police 24 7 Trump Being Awarded By American Patriots Trying To DEFEAT Hillary Clinton How can a sitting US president speak so badly about a country he has ran for eight years \? So the problem he is running from were literally created by him He allowed BLM to grow into a domestic terror group he allowed ISIS to grow into a global threat he did nothing to make our schools and colleges better His concerns have been what we have been screaming for eight years now , but he refused to listen When Trump takes office in January , it will be imperative that we continue to grow our network of Americans tired of the corruption Trump has thousands of grassroots networks that he uses to hear what the people are saying Our movement has grown into the hundreds of thousands , but if we get Trump elected , it could break well over a million and he listens to our platform through his associates Please share this because we cannot continue to grow as quickly as we have without your voice We have to get Obama AND Hillary out of this country after this election !
