The videos that Mr. Biden posts  these days, mostly repurposed campaign ads and TV-style interviews filmed from the makeshift studio in his basement  rarely crack 10,000 views. And the virtual crickets that greet many of his appearances have become a source of worry for some Democrats, who see his sluggish performance online as a bad omen for his electoral chances in November.'
