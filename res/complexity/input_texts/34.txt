b'State Highlights\n\nRepresentative F. James Sensenbrenner Jr., a Republican, won a 16th term in Wisconsins Fifth District, defeating Robert Raymond, a former roofer who once analyzed evidence for a law firm. Mr. Raymond ran as an independent. The Republicans unsuccessfully fought to pick up a Congressional seat in the conservative Eighth District, the only competitive House race in the state. In a rematch of the race two years ago, John Gard, a former State Assembly speaker, lost to Representative Steve Kagen, a Democrat, making an issue of Mr. Kagens votes against offshore drilling and accusing him of being part of a Congress that failed to regulate the housing industry.\n\nIn their previous contest, Mr. Kagen, an allergist, spent millions of dollars of his own money.
