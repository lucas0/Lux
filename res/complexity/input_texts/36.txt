Vice President Joseph R Biden Jr created a stir Tuesday at a campaign speech in Virginia when he told the crowd that Mitt Romney 's policies would enable the banking and financial sectors to put you all back in chains The remark came roughly two thirds of the way through Mr Biden 's 30 minute speech , which was delivered to a crowd that included many African Americans at the Institute for Advanced Learning and Research in Danville , Va Romney wants to let the he said in the first hundred days , he 's going to let the big banks once again write their own rules , unchain Wall Street , Mr Biden said They 're going to put you all back in chains On a C Span video of the speech , the audience does not appear to react negatively to Mr Biden 's phrasing indeed , laughter can be heard among the crowd President Obama and his surrogates have been campaigning heavily in Virginia , and the campaign 's strategy relies in part on energizing the black vote to take the traditionally Republican state , which moved to the Democratic column in the 2008 presidential election According to the Census , the population of Danville is roughly 48 8 percent white and 48 6 percent black After Mr Biden 's address , some Republicans assailed Mr Biden 's remark On Twitter , Ari Fleischer , a former press secretary for President George W Bush , likened the comment to one made by Sarah Palin when she compared critical press coverage to blood libel , a term alluding to the false allegation that Jews once killed Christian children to use their blood for religious rituals The press pounded Palin when she talked about blood libel , ' Mr Fleischer wrote What will they do about Biden 's chains' remark \? Later Tuesday , both presidential campaigns responded to the vice president 's remarks , with Mr Romney 's campaign calling the phrasing not acceptable After weeks of slanderous and baseless accusations leveled against Governor Romney , the Obama campaign has reached a new low , Andrea Saul , Mr Romney 's press secretary , said in a statement The comments made by the vice president of the United States are not acceptable in our political discourse and demonstrate yet again that the Obama campaign will say and do anything to win this election President Obama should tell the American people whether he agrees with Joe Biden 's comments In a statement , Stephanie Cutter , Mr Obama 's deputy campaign manager , defended Mr Biden For months , Speaker Boehner , Congressman Ryan and other Republicans have called for the unshackling' of the private sector from regulations that protect Americans from risky financial deals and other reckless behavior that crashed our economy Since then , the vice president has often used a similar metaphor to describe the need to unshackle' the middle class Today 's comments were a derivative of those remarks , describing the devastating impact letting Wall Street write its own rules again would have on middle class families We find the Romney campaign 's outrage over the vice president 's comments today hypocritical , particularly in light of their own candidate 's stump speech questioning the president 's patriotism Now , let 's return to that substantive' debate Mitt Romney and Paul Ryan promised 72 hours ago , but quickly abandoned As he concluded his speech , Mr Biden confused North Carolina with Virginia , where Danville is located With you we can win North Carolina again , and if we do , we win the election if we win you , Mr Biden said The city of Danville abuts the northern border of North Carolina , which also went for Mr Obama in 2008 but is considered a more challenging state for his campaign this time around At a second appearance on Tuesday , in Wytheville , Va , Mr Biden said his remarks had merely alluded to a term used previously by Republicans , including Mr Romney 's running mate , Representative Paul D Ryan In his response to Mr Obama 's State of the Union address in 2011 , Mr Ryan said , We believe a renewed commitment to limited government will unshackle our economy and create millions of new jobs and opportunities for all people , of every background , to succeed and prosper And I'm told that when I made that comment earlier today in Danville , Va , the Romney campaign put out a tweet , Mr Biden told the crowd in Wytheville You know , tweets these days \? Put out a tweet , went on the airwaves saying , Biden , he 's outrageous in saying that , ' I think I said instead of unshackled , ' unchained ' Outrageous to say that ' That 's what we had I'm using their own words I got a message for them , Mr Biden continued If you want to know what 's outrageous , it 's their policies and the effects of their policies on middle class America That 's what 's outrageous Mr Romney addressed Mr Biden 's original remark in a speech Tuesday evening in Chillicothe , Ohio , calling it an indicator that Mr Obama 's presidency had become angry and desperate , according to The Associated Press
