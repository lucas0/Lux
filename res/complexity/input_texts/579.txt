The US Defense Department is investigating video footage appearing to show Islamic State fanatics with at least one cache of weapons airdropped by coalition forces that was meant for Kurdish militiamen battling the extremist group in a border town.The cache of weapons included hand grenades, ammunition and rocket-propelled grenade launchers, according to a video uploaded by a media group loyal to the Islamic State (ISIS) group.The video appeared authentic and corresponded to The Associated Press' reporting of the event. At one point a fighter in the video says: 'Thanks be to God! Spoils and booty for the mujahideen.'The Britain-based Syrian Observatory for Human Rights, which bases its information on a network of activists on the ground, said the militants had seized at least one cache.Scroll down for videoA still from an Islamic State (ISIS) video, purportedly shows an IS militant displaying the content of a crate carrying grenades near the town of Ain al-Arab, known by the Kurds as Kobane, on the Syria-Turkey borderA U.S. military airdrop of weapons meant for Kurdish fighters fell into the hands of their jihadist foes near the Syrian battleground town of Kobane, the Syrian Observatory for Human Rights saidThe caches were airdropped early Monday to Kurds in the embattled Syrian town of Kobane that lies near the Turkish border.The militant group has been trying to seize the town for over a month now, causing the exodus of some 200,000 people from the area into Turkey. While Kurds are battling on the ground, a U.S.-led coalition is also targeting the militants from the air.On Tuesday, ISIS loyalists on social media posted sarcastic thank you notes to the United States, including one image that said 'Team USA.'The caches were airdropped early Monday to Kurds in the embattled Syrian town of Kobani that lies near the Turkish borderA container filled with meals ready to eat and fresh water being dropped from a C-130 Hercules during an operational resupply airdrop near the area of Bayji, IraqBut the lost weapons drop was more an embarrassment than a great strategic loss. The Islamic State militants already possess millions of dollars-worth of U.S. weaponry that they captured from fleeing Iraqi soldiers when the group seized swaths of Iraq in a sudden sweep in June.On Tuesday, the U.S. Central Command said U.S. military forces conducted four airstrikes near Kobani that destroyed IS fighting positions, an IS building and a large IS unit.Also Tuesday, Syrian government airstrikes hit a rebel-held town along the country's southern border with Jordan, killing at least eight people.Militant: Particular blackspots for ISIS checkpoints are the roads around the militants' strongholds in Raqqa and Deir ez-Zor, as well as a number of major highways in eastern Syria.Checkpoints: ISIS militants are forcing vehicles carrying food and medical supplies in Syria and Iraq to pay to continue their journey unhinderedActivists with the Local Coordination Committees and the Observatory said the number of those killed was likely to rise as there are more victims under the rubble.The LCC said Syrian government planes dropped crude explosives-laden canisters on the town of Nasib on the Syria-Jordan border.The airstrikes are part of battles between Syrian government forces and Islamic rebel groups for control of the area.Syrian government forces have been heavily bombing rebel areas in recent weeks, while the U.S-led coalition has been conducting airstrikes against Islamic State militants elsewhere in Syria.
