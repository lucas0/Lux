May 21 , 2017 Laura Keeling Gun Violence , News , Op Ed , Politics , Racism 0Sheriff Clarke , self declared Trump appointee , brings more plagiarism and less valorTrump advocate , controversial Milwaukee County Sheriff , David Clarke , announced on Wednesday that he has been appointed as an Assistant Secretary of the Department of Homeland Security Though , there has been no corroboration of his appointment , as of yet , from the White House As we 've observed from previous appointments , Trump requires neither qualifications , experience nor training in the specific field , only undying loyalty to him In the area of undying loyalty , Clarke excels In the arena of qualifications and experience , he leaves much to be desired In fact , CNN reported today that the sheriff had plagiarized portions of his Master 's thesis on US security In fact , there were 47 incidents in his thesis of direct quotes from sources being included in his text without quotation marks Clarke had been awarded the degree from the Naval Postgraduate School in Monterey , California He is not the first of Trump 's cabinet picks to have had plagiarism troubles , either , but the fourth In his short tenure , Betsy DeVos , Neil Gorsuch , Monica Crowley and even Trump 's wife have all been accused of plagiarism The specific position for which Clarke is reportedly being considered is Assistant Secretary in the Office of Partnership and Engagement where his primary function will be to serve as liaison with state , local and tribal law enforcement and governments This is a position for which Clarke is uniquely unqualified He 's a staunch conservative who 's made no bones about his intense dislike of Liberals Democrats saying The only time I 'd only reach across the aisle to a Democrat is to grab them by the throat This is not the attitude of a person who will be open to listening and considering different or opposing ideas or positions What type of relationship does Trump think Clarke will have with Democrats or even moderate Republicans with this hard line stance \? Or does Trump even know what the position requirements are \? Knowing Trump , probably not Trump apparently thinks he 's diversifying his cabinet It 's the diversity of ideas that 's important , not diversity in skin color Clarke , like his hero Trump , is also impulsive He , too , shoots from the hip spewing fact free rhetoric from questionable sources or making claims that have already been debunked His attacks on Black Lives Matter have been copious , vitriolic and unrelenting , but rarely based on facts Following the shooting of two police officers in Dallas and Baton Rouge , he claimed that America was at war and that BLM was the enemy However , the police chiefs in both cities had , after conducting a thorough investigation , publicly stated that neither perpetrator had been associated with Black Lives Matter What the shooters did have in common was that both were ex military , Afghan war veterans It 's much more like likely that both were suffering from untreated PTSD than anything else But , that does n't fit Sheriff Clarke 's hate filled rhetoric , so he ignored it Or , perhaps he never even considered PTSD as an option since he , like Trump , has never served in the military Which brings me to my final point Stolen Valor 2 Look at this fucking guy 's uniform You see all that shit pinned all over his dress uniform jacket \? That 's not supposed to be there pic twitter com 0QZlBxQjI8 Charles Clymer \( cmclymer \) May 17 , 2017Clarke loves posing with his chest full of medals except they 're neither military nor law enforcement They have more in common with Army Navy Store designer decorations for the chicken hawk out to impress the gullible than any sort of service Several veterans have called him on this blatant attempt at passing himself off as a military hero Just as he 's not a military hero , he 's not a law enforcement hero either if deaths within the jails you oversee is a measure Four inmates died in the Milwaukee county jails in 2016 One from being denied water for 7 days Clarke is also the subject of several lawsuits , as covered by Snopes com , many stemming from unnecessary deaths under his watch He also favors attacking the press if they dare report the truth about him You can see why Trump would want him in his cabinet , though the White House does seem to be casting doubt on the appointment that Clarke is claiming DHS has not confirmed that Clarke has been offered a position with the department On 17 May 2017 , the department 's official Twitter account posted Senior positions are announced when made official by the Secretary No such announcement w regard to the Office of Public Engagement has been made Clarke is an uncaring , unfeeling , unyielding , uncompromising , old fashioned misogynist who embarrasses himself with his inability to adapt to changing times , situations or updated facts Put it all together , a perfect fit for the Trump administration
