The name of this establishment is incredibly offensive. As a person who has lived with a mental illness, as well as worked in group homes for individuals with severe and persistent mental illness, I have to make a stand against this. We are here to advocate and provide care, not to demean and belittle a population for something a person can have little to no control over. Disgraceful.
