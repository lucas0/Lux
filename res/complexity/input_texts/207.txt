His response:A religious cleric in Saudi Arabia has issued a fatwa ruling forbidding the building of snowmen.It is not permitted to make a statue out of snow, even by way of play and fun.Quoting Muslim scholars, he argued that to build a snowman was to create an image of a human being, which is considered sinful under the country's strict interpretation of Sunni Islam.The ruling does open up the possibility of the building of a snowapple.
