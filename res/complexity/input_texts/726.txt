Some people are prepared to make that sacrifice are you \? Conservative Americans are fed up with liberals governing what they can or can t do , including their own personal liberties That s why we ve created this failsafe One way or another , America will change for the better come November The only question is will any innocent people have to die for that to happen \? I d like to think not , but the choice is up to you , dear viewers Vote for Trump Any other alternative is not good for you And I mean that literally , Copeland concluded
