b'The Apple Watch is a fairly large chunk of gold ! Get ready for the tech press to flip out when Apple announces the retail price for the gold Apple Watch Edition model Apple critics have always roasted the company for selling productsA that are more expensive than they should be , and they frequently use this as a wedge topic to criticize buyers But the 18 karat gold Apple Watch Edition will set a whole new bar with a sales price of 10 , 000 The funny thingA in this case is that Apple is perfectly right to be charging that much ! Do you disagree \? Check out my counterpoint , The Case Against the 10 , 000 Gold Apple Watch EditionGold is ExpensiveLets start with a little backgrounder in gold A Everyone has a vague sense that gold is expensive Even rabid Internet trolls have seen the banner ads and heard about that in the news But most people dont understand just how expensive even a little bit of gold is A So this is a good place to begin the discussion Update My calculations were wrong ! A Also , this was a bit back of the envelope Now that it has some readership I realize I should go back andA fix the calculations inA theA article to be more realistic Here are the basic facts Gold currently sells for between 1 , 200 and 1 , 300 per troy ounce and has been over 1 , 000 per troy ounce for the last five years 18 karat gold contains 75 pure gold , and that term is regulated by law One ounce of 18k gold occupiesA about 1 8 cubic centimeters of volume since a typical 18 karat gold alloy weighs about 16 5 grams per cc 18 karat gold currently sells for 29 11 per gram , 905 per troy ounce , or 480 per cc 25 ccA of 18k gold is about enough to construct a watch buckle and 75 cc gets you a deployant clasp It takes a few more to build a watch case , anywhere from 1 5 to 8A cc depending on the size and thickness of the case So the buckle is worth 120 360 and the watch case 720 to 3800 just as raw gold This is why gold watches generally sell for a lot more than 6 , 000 ! Gold Watches are ExpensiveLets apply this to a watch case Imagine you wanted to create a rectangular case 42 mm high by 36 mm wide by 10 mm deep If it was solid , this would equalA 15 12 cc of volume But its a watch case , so you have to leave room for the movement , dial , case back , etc So letsA just leave 5 mm of thickness all around , making a hollow rectangle This equals 6 8 cc \( 42 x 36 x 10 32 x 26 x 10 \) Therefore , the raw gold to make just the case of this hypothetical watch would cost 3 , 200A as of this writing A simple 42x36x10 mm rectangle of 5 mm thick 18 karat gold would costA more than 3 , 200Now lets consider the same shapeA but just 2 mm thick Thats 2 9 cc of gold , worth 1 , 400 Pick your thickness and youre still looking at thousands of dollars worth of gold How does this translate in the real world \? Lets look at the retail price of some watches thatA are available in both stainless steel and 18 karat gold This Cartier Tank MC is 15 , 000 more in 18k goldThe Cartier Tank MC measures 44 mm by 34 mm by 9 5 mm thick 15 , 000 extra \( list \) for 18k goldCartier Tank MC in stainless steel 7 , 000 list , 5 , 800 streetCartier Tank MC in 18k pink gold 22 , 000 list , 18 , 200 streetTheA Jaeger LeCoultre Reverso Squadra Hometime measures 50 5 mm by 34 9 mm by 14 mm thick 14 , 750 extra \( list \) for 18k goldJaeger LeCoultre Reverso Squadra Hometime in stainless steel 8 , 550 list , 6 , 800 streetJaeger LeCoultre Reverso Squadra Hometime in 18k pink gold 23 , 300 list , 18 , 400 streetThis list could go on and on , but the gist is simple 18 karat gold cases cost a lot more than stainless steel In fact , its pretty much impossible to find a gold watch for under 10 , 000 in any size and from any manufacturer Even tiny quartz ladies watches like the tiny Chopard Happy Sport Mini sells for 11 , 000 ! Most of the bargains commenters have pointed to are either 14 karat or less , very slim and small , or long out of production and with outdated pricing Then theres the bracelet SwapA a gold bracelet for a leather strap and you are looking at an extra 20 , 000 Adding a gold bracelet to thatA Jaeger LeCoultre bumps the price to 42 , 900 ! Certainly there is quite a bit of profit in luxury watches , but one simply cannot deny the raw material valueA in a gold watch case And the gold market is liquid like stocks and other commodities There are plenty of buyers and sellers of gold , and plenty of reserves , so no company , no matter how strong , can expect favorable pricing from their suppliers Another reason companies charge so much for gold watches and jewelry is as a hedge against volatility They cant priceA near the commodity price because they have to set a price and stick to it all year long So they generally price somewhat higher than they would , even taking into consideration all the rest of the materials , labor , distribution , and profit in a watch The Apple Watch Edition Will Cost 10 , 000Theres a reason I picked those twoA watches for my comparisons Both are similar in size and shape to the 42 mm Apple Watch The Cartier is a little smaller and theA Jaeger LeCoultre is a little larger , but bothA represent a traditional watchmakers gold cased square ish offering in the space And both cost more than 20 , 000 , with much of that price going to the gold case and matching buckle And Jony Ive recently said that the historic Cartier Tank was one of his inspirations for the Apple Watch design ! Apple would be crazy to sell the Apple Watch Edition for 20 , 000 , though ThatsA not going to happen So theyre likely to find ways to reduce the cost dramatically First , as we can see , the Apple Watch case is highly rounded in all three dimensions Although questionable from an estheticA standpoint , this reduces the amount of material required by quite a lot A Second , A Apple Watch has a large sapphire crystal front and back with the display , sensors , and such A Third , A the interior frame is likely made of steel or aluminum , not gold , to reduce cost and increase commonality with the aluminum and steel versions Could it be gold plated \? No Numerous reports state that it is a solid gold case Although Apple has not apparently used the word , solid in their press releases , they do claim it is crafted from 18 karat gold andA nowhere does it say it is plated or gold filled \( the industry term \) There are laws covering descriptions of metal content for jewelry and Apple cannot break these any more than Tiffany could Apple says that the Apple Watch will start at 349 for that aluminum Sport model , and many bloggers have reported the price for the steel Apple Watch to be roughly 1 , 000 A It is reasonable to assume that the gold Edition model will sell for substantially more than this , with many suggesting 4 , 000 or 5 , 000 But remember that this price would only cover 4 or 5 ounces of gold ! Even with thin walls and a steel frame , its hard to see how Apple could make a solid 18 karat gold case and buckle for a 42 mm watch with just 3 ounces of gold Gold is soft , but Apple claims that their special gold isA twice as hard as standard gold A Taking that at face value , perhaps they reduced the thickness of the case commensurately , cuttingA the amount of gold in half versus a standard rectangular watch This still leavesA a few thousand dollarsA of material value in the case A The Apple Watch Edition will come in 38 mm and 42 mm sizes , a difference of about 20 in terms of case volume So the smaller model could sell for 20 less still My prediction is that the 42 mm Apple WatchA Edition will retail for 9 , 999 with the 38 mm Apple Watch Edition retailing for 7 , 999 This covers the cost of the gold case , the internals , manufacturing , sales , and profit , and yet does not leave AppleA subsidizing the world gold market by selling at a discount or cheating with a too thin or plated case I will be shocked if the price is 4 , 999 , but I suppose its possible with some finagling and if thats the smaller model And it will not be any less than that This is a 10 , 000 productBonus prediction Given the very high price of the Apple Watch Edition , I predict that availability will be quite limited Apple will likely create special store within a store spaces inA certain Apple Store locations for the Edition A I further expect them to open special standalone Apple Edition Boutiques to sellA theA Watch Edition , accessories , and perhaps other future high end products Update ! Needless to say , many people disagree with me And now that Gruber Fireballed this post , A I imagine Ill hear from lots of them real soon ! The gist of theA disagreement lies in the amount of gold neededA for theA watch case I assumed it would be quite thick \( read sturdy \) and would contain upwards of 130 grams of 18k gold Then theres the strap lugs and buckle which would likely contain another few dozen grams But GAK PDX A \( and others , though he was most visually eloquent \) suspects it contains much less gold For fun , I took my Apple Watch models and used SW and some basic assumptions to figure the gold content 29 16g pic twitter com WGEnjtj1Yh Greg Koenig \( gak pdx \) February 19 , 2015I think this number is way too low , but its a good lower bound if the case was very thin and completely hollow And it puts the raw gold at about 849A at 29 11 per gram of 18k gold Although this is admittedly much , much lower than my estimate , it still illustrates my point that the Apple Watch Edition is not going to be cheap And I think hes way off but time will tell who is right and who isA wrong Another argument is based on this 2006 analysis of a gold Rolex watch Right off the bat one should point out that gold cost 400 oz when it was written and that watch includes a gold bracelet as well , something Apple is apparently not going to do with the Edition A That Rolex case contained 18 5 grams of gold alloy , but its much , much smaller than the Apple watch and its circular to boot ! A 34mm circleA is 107mm in circumference , while the 42mm Apple Watch is 156mm in circumference A Use the magic of math to scale theA Rolex up into a 42mm rectangle and were at 27 75 grams But that caseA is also much thinner since we excluded the bezel , and the Apple Watch is pretty slab sided So we can probably double this safely and come out withA 1 , 615 of gold in my mangledA square Rolex case So there are lower estimates than mine for the amount and value of the gold I can accept that But lets take a step back andA think about the final price A Even if it contained less than 1 , 500 of gold , how much would it sell for \? Certainly not 2 , 000 or 3 , 000 You still have to account for the cost of everything else , plus the intangibles of manufacturing and distribution And profit for Apple \( and a hedge against theA volatility of the price of gold \) So were back at the 4 , 000 5 , 000 estimate others have made As Greg Koenig tweeted , and Forbes reported , If anyone thinks Apple is charging less than 5k for the Edition , they are smoking crack Regardless of the total , its important to realize that the price of gold is in the drivers seat when it comes to pricing the Apple Watch Edition Id love to be wrong , A and I look forward to updating this piece Thanks for reading !
