But it is a theme that his aides believe proved to be successful , and they are planning to use it aggressively ahead through the Republican convention and into the fall \( Britney Spears and Paris Hilton , whose appearance in the first celebrity ad drew ridicule from Democrats and Ms Hilton , will be retired from future spots after helping draw huge attention in the form of news coverage and nearly 2 million You Tube hits \) The American people are likely not going to want to elect someone to the presidency based on their ability to transform themselves into a celebrity , said Steve Schmidt , a senior adviser to Mr McCain The advertising is effective because it speaks to a truth that people instantly get This was inspired by what Mr McCain 's advisers and some Democrats suspect was one mistake Mr Obama made on his otherwise well received overseas trip appearing at a rally before 200 , 000 Germans in Berlin , an event that lead Mr McCain 's advisers to describe Mr Obama as presumptuous and provided the footage for the first so called celebrity ads \( expect to more of that in future ads , highlighted by Mr Obama presenting himself as a fellow citizen of the world \) If this kind of attack does strike a chord , then Mr Obama might find he gave Republicans a bit of a gift with his decision to deliver his convention acceptance speech before 76 , 000 people at a stadium in Denver , an appearance \( think tail gate parties \) that seems to have potential to underline the Republican message Implicit in this approach is an attempt to portray Mr Obama as different , or alien , from many Americans , reinforcing a reluctance that polls suggest many Americans have about voting for this newcomer Hence the references to his years at Harvard , his years in Chicago 's Hyde Park , his affection for frequent gym visits and the food he eats , or to the McCain camp 's use of words intended to make Mr Obama seem elite or effete Please verify you 're not a robot by clicking the box Invalid email address Please re enter You must select a newsletter to subscribe to You agree to receive occasional updates and special offers for The New York Times 's products and services Thank you for subscribing An error has occurred Please try again later You are already subscribed to this email Sen Obama appears to get fussy when asked tough questions , Brian Rogers , Mr McCain 's campaign spokesman , said in an e mail to reporters last week Will all this work \? Mr Obama 's advisers argue that public polling data shows no evidence that it is taking hold , and that the public has little tolerance for this kind of attack at a time when there are so many serious issues facing the nation Their intent is obvious , but I do n't see any evidence that they are gaining with this , said David Axelrod , Mr Obama 's senior strategist He said he did not believe that Mr McCain , of all candidates , could succeed in painting Mr Obama as elitist Obviously , his strategists met on the portico of the McCain estate in Sedona or maybe in one of his six other houses and decided what line of attack they were going to use , he said While Mr McCain has used this summer to figure out a way to go after Mr Obama , Mr Obama used it to patch up a hole in his resume with his overseas trip It produced images of Mr Obama meeting with foreign leaders and visiting troops that even Republicans say would go a long way to addressing voter concerns about his foreign policy credentials And they permitted Mr Obama to dominate political coverage for much of July In downplaying the effectiveness of the Republican attacks on Mr Obama , Mr Axelrod was echoing the way Mr Schmidt and other McCain advisers downplayed the effect of Mr Obama 's trip In both cases , the campaigns pointed to polls as evidence that voters were n't impressed But now may not be the time to judge the effectiveness of these tactics things campaigns do in the summer often are not done with an eye to the daily Gallup tracking poll , but rather for setting the table for the fall Some people are paying attention , said Charlie Black , a senior adviser to Mr McCain But you are laying the foundation for the debate for the fall Even if people do n't pay enough attention to say , I'm changing my vote' or I'm making up my mind , ' they do absorb the information The fact that Mr McCain 's campaign continues to push this line of attack it trotted out this summer suggests that his camp thinks it works And Mr Obama 's campaign , which has seemed both awfully confident and at times hesitant in responding to Mr McCain , may have learned a lesson that it can put to use this fall We need to make sure that he is paying a price for his negativity , said David Plouffe , Mr Obama 's campaign manager The lesson here is that the media is definitely going to cover the theater of the absurd And we have to be very mindful of that George Bush did n't have to worry so much about that , but John McCain is viewed by some independent voters as a different kind of politician
