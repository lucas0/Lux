Work by Virgin Media caused the message, which was left by Beaton's wife, Ruby, two years before her death in 2003, to be erased last month, the BBC reported.The clip was recorded by Ruby to serve as the message people would hear when they called Beaton's phone.The 68-year-old told BBC Radio Leeds: "I've always resisted changing companies because whenever I mentioned that my wife's voice was our voicemail message and would it be retained and each company said no, so that's why I never changed."Sadly it disappeared. I was absolutely devastated by it, but also extremely angry."In the early days [I listened to it] quite often. Basically, it came to the point when if I felt low then I would listen to it."In December I learned that it had disappeared. I just could not tell people how it affected me at that time. It really did devastate me."
