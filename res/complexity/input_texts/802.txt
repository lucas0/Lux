b'Tuesdays mess of an election in Wisconsin is the culmination of a decade of efforts by state Republicans to make voting harder, redraw legislative boundaries and dilute the power of voters in the states urban centers.\n\nThe Republican-dominated state legislature, which has held a majority since 2011, due in part to gerrymandered maps, refused to entertain the Democratic governors request to mail absentee ballots to all voters or move the primary. Then the State Supreme Court, which is controlled by conservative justices, overturned the governors ruling to postpone the election until June.\n\nNow Wisconsin is conducting an election that the states largest newspaper  which previously endorsed Republican leaders including former Gov. Scott Walker  called the most undemocratic in the states history.\n\nHeres a look at how it came to this point.\n\nWhy are Republicans fighting so hard to hold an election in the midst of a pandemic?\n\nFormer Vice President Joseph R. Biden Jr. and Senator Bernie Sanders are on the ballot in Wisconsin, but the main event is the State Supreme Court race between the conservative incumbent justice, Daniel Kelly, and a liberal challenger, Jill Karofsky.'
