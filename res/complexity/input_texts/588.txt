As seen in a recent FB post Earlier today , law enforcement officers was dispatched to a call of an older , disheveled , apparently homeless , suspicious subject who was sitting in a restaurant without having ordered any food The first deputy responding to the call reportedly approached the subject , and in an attempt to treat him with humanizing kindness and compassion , sat down to him and asked the man how his day was going The man responded by putting a gun to the deputy 's temple and pulling the trigger He then proceeded outside , where he killed another responding deputy sheriff For those of you who have not worn a badge , please remember this case The next time you interact with a police officer \( or Sheriff 's deputy \) , the next time you witness someone else interacting with the cops , before you criticize the officer for not being as friendly as you think they should be , before you judge his or her demeanor as being cold , condescending , or excessively cautious , before you accuse them of overreacting or countering resistance or force with brutality , please remember this case Because there 's a good chance that officer does There 's a good chance they knew , remember , or heard about the deputy who was murdered in cold blood for simply being polite
