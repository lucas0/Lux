POSTED: 4:43 pm CST December 11, 2003A holiday shopping flier that's been distributed to thousands of households in north Texas is creating controversy because a message of hate is included within an advertisement.An ad for "Party City" was supposed to highlight a sale on Hanukkah items, but it also contained a hateful anti-Semitic message.The advertisement includes the sentence "CC Hates the Jews" in large, bold letters.According to ADVO, the company that printed the advertisement, a graphic artist working on the ad had left his desk for a moment, and a co-worker with the initials C.C. changed the text on the ad.The graphic artist didn't notice the change and the ad went to print.However, despite the explanation, the Anti-Defamation League wants more questions answered."How did it get out of the graphic shop in Pittsburgh? How did it get by ADVO? How did it get by the printer and all of that?" Mark Briskman said.Copyright 2003 by nbc5i.com. All rights reserved.
