When I kept pressuring the guy to tell me why I had to wait , he said they were under strict guidelines to check tithing records of members and number their bed reservations based on their 2016 giving I just ca n't believe this I just ca n't The mega church has not responded to Williams' accusations as a recorded message says they are not able to answer their phone due to overwhelming numbers of people needing help , but refers people to their website to donate money However other people in the community , who are not members of the church , also confirmed they have been turned away for help simply because they are not members of Lakewood 59 9k Shares 0 Tweet 59 9k Share 4 Pin 0 Share 0 Share 0 Share 0 Mail 0 Share
