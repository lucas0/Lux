REACHING OUT: Paradise is open to all creatures, including dogs, Pope Francis has told a small child.First he gave his blessing to gays, unmarried couples and advocates of the Big Bang theory - now the pope is reaching out to canines, sparking a debate about animals and souls.Trying to console a distraught little boy whose dog had died, Francis told him in a recent public appearance on St Peter's Square that "paradise is open to all of God's creatures," reports said."One day, we will see our animals again in the eternity of Christ," the pope said during a public appearance in St. Peter's Square, according to Italian media.The comments were welcomed by animal rights groups."My inbox got flooded," said Christine Gutleben, senior director of faith outreach at the Humane Society, the largest animal protection group in the United States. "Almost immediately, everybody was talking about it."Charles Camosy, an author and professor of Christian ethics at Fordham University, told the New York Times it was difficult to know precisely what Francis meant, since he spoke "in pastoral language that is not really meant to be dissected by academics." But asked if the remarks had caused a new debate on whether animals have souls, suffer and go to heaven, Camosy said, "In a word: Absolutely."The Catholic church doesn't outright deny that animals have souls but the community generally does believe that animals go to heaven.
