ShareThis \( Photo Bobby Doherty \) Editor 's Note In the most recent edition of New York , its annual Reasons to Love New York issue , the magazine published this story about a Stuyvesant High School senior named Mohammed Islam , who was rumored to have made 72 million trading stocks Islam said his net worth was in the high eight figures As part of the research process , the magazine sent a fact checker to Stuyvesant , where Islam produced a document that appeared to be a Chase bank statement attesting to an eight figure bank account After the story 's publication , people questioned the 72 million figure in the headline , which was written by editors based on the rumored figure The headline was amended But in an interview with the New York Observer last night , Islam now says his entire story was made up A source close to the Islam family told the Washington Post that the statements were falsified We were duped Our fact checking process was obviously inadequate we take full responsibility and we should have known better New York apologizes to our readers Rumors , on Wall Street , can be powerful A whisper can turn into a current that moves markets , driving a stock price up or sending it tumbling There may be only one other place where gossip holds such sway , and that is high school Late last year , a rumor began circulating at Stuyvesant that a junior named Mohammed Islam had made a fortune in the stock market Not a small fortune , either Seventy two million An unbelievable amount of money for anyone , not least a high school student , but as far as rumors go , this one seemed legit Everyone at Stuy knew that Mohammed , the soft spoken son of Bengali immigrants from Queens and the president of the school 's Investment Club , was basically a genius As the news spread , Mo 's stock went up The school paper profiled him , Business Insider included him on a list of 20 Under 20 , and Mo became a celebrity , as his friend Damir Tulemaganbetov put it on a recent Friday night at Mari Vanna near Union Square A VIP ! Mo , a cherubic senior with a goatee and slight faux hawk , smiled shyly He 's quiet today , said Patrick Trablusi , who was seated with Mo and Damir at a table littered with empty glasses Humble And tired This is our third meeting of the day , Damir said , signaling to the waitress for another round We saw a real estate agent , a lawyer , you Next we 're going to see a hedge fund guy , Patrick said The friends locked eyes and started to giggle He basically wants to give us 150 million , Mo explained , a blush like a sunset creeping over his cheeks The waitress arrived with a tray of green drinks Freshly squeezed apple juice , Damir said , passing them around It 's very good Do you like caviar \? After Mo became a celebrity , things got a little awkward at school \( Are n't you the kid who made all that money \? a teacher asked him \) So he reconnected with kids from his old school , Allen Stevenson One of them introduced him to Patrick , an aspiring financier , who introduced him to Damir at a poker game attended by kids whose parents are , according to Damir , the one percent of the one percent The son of a Kazakh oligarch , Damir is tall , slim , and cocky , like a cigarette wearing a fedora I call the poker game Destiny , ' he said The waitress arrived with a plate Here , have some caviar Over late nights out and dinners at Morimoto , the three hatched a plan to start a hedge fund There are a lot of steps we have to follow through , said Patrick , calling to mind a more serious Chuck Bass But we 're on the right track They plan to launch in June , after Mo turns 18 and can get his broker dealer license Mo 's our maestro , Patrick said He 's going to be earning the big bucks We 're just going to try to fill his needs All three plan to attend college next year , but they 're not concerned about classes getting in the way of their goal A billion dollars ! Damir said By next year ! Mo affirmed the number with a nod But it 's not just about money , he added We want to create a brotherhood Like , all of us who are connected , who are in something together , who have influence , like the Koch brothers Like in Wolf of Wall Street ! Damir interjected And Mo is Jordan Belfort No , but , not like that , Patrick said , blanching slightly Like Belfort , Mo started with penny stocks A cousin showed him how to trade He loved the feeling of risk the way his hand shook making the trade but he swore it off after losing a chunk of the money he 'd made tutoring I did n't have the balls for it , he said He was 9 It was a while before he was ready to try again In the meantime , he became a scholar of modern finance , studying up on hedge fund managers He was particularly enamored of Paul Tudor Jones I had been paralyzed by my loss , Mo said But he was able to go back to it , even after losing thousands of dollars over and over Paul Tudor Jones says , You learn more from your losses than from your gains ' Mo got into trading oil and gold , and his bank account grew Though he is shy about the 72 million number , he confirmed his net worth is in the high eight figures More than enough to rent an apartment in Manhattan though his parents wo n't let him live in it until he turns 18 and acquire a BMW , which he ca n't drive because he does n't yet have a license Thus , it falls to his father to drive him past Tudor Jones 's Greenwich house for inspiration It 's because he is who he is that made me who I am today , Mo said Which is to say a believer in Wall Street A lot of young people do start ups , but I think it 's a bubble Trading and investments will always be there Money will always be rotating Money never sleeps ! Damir added That 's from the Wall Street movie It all comes down to this , Mo continued What makes the world go round \? Money If money is not flowing , if businesses do n't keep going , there 's no innovation , no products , no investments , no growth , no jobs The check arrived for the caviar and apple juice It totaled 400 New York , that 's where the money 's at , Damir shouted , pulling out a credit card This reminded me of an old joke about robbing banks because that 's where the money is Damir grinned My father has a quote , he said It 's really dope You can rob a bank with a gun , but you can rob the whole world with a bank ' Patrick buried his face in his hands At the end of the day , he said , we 're young kids
