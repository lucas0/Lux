As a councilman and graduate of Forest Hill High School , I deeply regret the performance of the Forest Hill High School Band this past Friday It is very distasteful for us as a community of educators and leaders to not be aware , nor sensitive to the current negative portrayal and display of disrespect toward our Law Enforcement Community We have to be very careful with what we allow , understanding that it was a presentation from the movie John Q , does not excuse the use of toy or play guns Especially when so many students , teachers and first responders have lost their lives surrounding the same visual It is my prayer , that we as a community we will continue to educate and foster an atmosphere conducive of a community who embraces and appreciates its law enforcement community and that we cast down anything that portrays the opposite As leaders , we must evaluate the content of what we do , say and act out and what message it sends
