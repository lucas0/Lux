Google paid $585 million for six office buildings in Redwood City from two private investment firms.Google reportedly bought the properties at the waterfront Pacific Shores Center office park from Starwood Capital Group and Blackstone Group, according to Bloomberg News. Redwood City is approximately 11 miles northwest of Google's Mountain View campus.The new office buildings are likely so the tech company can expand hiring and acquisitions. Bloomberg News cites $1 billion in office-lease agreements made this month according to an SEC filing. “We expect to continue to hire aggressively for the remainder of 2014,” Google said in the document. “Acquisitions will also remain an important component of our strategy.”Employees are up about 19 percent from last year. The company has 55,030 employees as of Sept. 30.Neither Google nor the investment firms wanted to comment on the story.The new properties make up about 934,200 square feet of Class A office space, including a 38,000-square-foot fitness center, and consist of six buildings addressed from 1200 to 1900 Seaport Boulevard. The office space is next to part of the San Francisco Bay Wildlife Refuge.While Google has a decent-sized campus, it does lack a water view. With these new buildings and views, perhaps it may be able to lure more of its employees from San Francisco to work on the Peninsula.
