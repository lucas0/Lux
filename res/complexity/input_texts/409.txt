My father , Ronald Reagan , held the presidency in such honor and reverence that he was never in the Oval Office without a coat and tie Bill Clinton has such disrespect for the presidency that he was often in the Oval Office without his pants The president who thus exposed himself has now been exposed to the entire world Behold Bill Clinton , the shining hero of liberalism ! Behold the self anointed messiah of the progressive movement ! Behold the leader of the most ethical administration in history Though it is too early to say if he will be impeached , the jury is in on Bill Clinton s character We know beyond a reasonable doubt that Bill Clinton is an out of control sexual predator who publicly posed as the feminists best friend while secretly using Monica Lewinsky His real attitude toward women comes through loud and clear now With their standard bearer exposed as a yet to be convicted felon , the Democratic Party has no one to lift up as an example and a hero So , in a squalid attempt to justify the most corrupt President in American history , Bill Clinton s defenders now drag the entire history and tradition of the presidency into the gutter They have slimed Washington , Jefferson , FDR , Eisenhower , and even Ronald Reagan Typical of these defenders of the indefensible is Mario Cuomo , who on CNN s Larry King Live said , I liked President Reagan I certainly wouldn t have trusted him if he said to me I never had an extramarital affair \( On behalf of the Reagan family , I have publicly demanded an apology from former Gov Cuomo We shall see if he has the decency to offer one \) Those who claim the President s sex life is personal and none of our business conveniently forget one thing A President whose sex life is outrageous , out of control , and out of bounds is a threat not only to the nation s morals , but to the nation s security During l affair Lewinsky , Clinton was clearly aware of this fact , which underscores \( if underscoring is needed \) his utter recklessness In the 445 page Starr report , we read that Bill Clinton told Monica Lewinsky that he suspected that a foreign embassy \( he did not specify which one \) was tapping his telephones , and he proposed cover stories If ever questioned , she should say that the two of them were just friends If anyone ever asked about their phone sex , she should say that they knew their calls were being monitored all along , and the phone sex was just a put on Does this sound like a man who is worthy to be the leader of the Free World \? The Code of Federal Regulations provides rules for issuing security clearances Is Bill Clinton qualified to hold the most sensitive national security post in our government \? Read this excerpt from the federal regulations and you tell me Code of Federal Regulations , Title 32 , Chapter 1 , Part 147 SEXUAL BEHAVIOR Sexual behavior is a security concern if it involves a criminal offense , indicates a personality or emotional disorder , subjects the individual to undue influence or coercion , or reflects lack of judgment or discretion NOTE The adjudicator should also consider guidelines pertaining to criminal conduct \( criterion J \) or emotional , mental , and personality disorders \( criterion I \) , in determining how to resolve the security concerns raised by sexual behavior END NOTE \( Sexual orientation or preference may not be used as a basis for or a disqualifying factor in determining a person s eligibility for a security clearance \) Conditions that could raise a security concern and may be disqualifying include \( 1 \) sexual behavior of a criminal nature , whether or not the individual has been prosecuted \( 2 \) compulsive or addictive sexual behavior when the person is unable to stop a pattern of self destructive or high risk behavior or that which is symptomatic of a personality disorder \( 3 \) sexual behavior that causes an individual to be vulnerable to undue influence or coercion \( 4 \) sexual behavior of a public nature and or that which reflects lack of discretion or judgment Federal regulations couldn t be more clear Bill Clinton wouldn t even qualify for a national security clearance Michael Reagan , a nationally syndicated radio talk show host , is the author of The City on a Hill Fulfilling Ronald Reagan s Vision for America
