b"There have been at least 149,000 confirmed cases of coronavirus in France, according to the French government. As of Saturday afternoon, 28,662 people had died.\n\nNational health authorities in France do not provide regional data for test-confirmed cases of the virus, but they do report regional data for the number of people hospitalized for Covid-19 and how many of those people have recovered or died.\n\nHospitalizations in France Hospitalizations Per capita Share of population with a reported case No cases reported Double-click to zoom into the map.

Circles are sized by the number of people there who have been hospitalized with the virus, which may differ from where they contracted the illness.\n\nHeres how the number of hospitalizations and deaths are growing in France:\n\nReported cases by province Hosp.

As France gradually exits from its months-long lockdown, the authorities fear a potential second wave of the epidemic.\n\nThe country has started to lift some restrictions, allowing people to leave their homes without release forms for the first time since mid-March, although there are still restrictions on trips further than 100 kilometers from ones home. Some schools and shops also reopened, but cafes, restaurants and bars will remain closed until at least the end of May, and all large gatherings are banned for the summer. Wearing masks on public transportation is now mandatory.\n\nThe government has warned that lockdown restrictions could be reimposed if the number of cases shoots up again. To prevent that from happening, it has promised that it could muster 700,000 tests per week to identify and isolate new infectious cases, at their home or in hotels, and trace their contacts.\n\nFrance has one of Europes more robust economies and a vaunted universal health care system, but the virus has put both under serious strain. Mr. Macron was in the middle of a hotly-contested pension reform when the outbreak started and has faced criticism, especially for the governments handling of mask shortages.\n\nHow Cases Are Growing\n\nHeres how the number of new cases and deaths are changing over time:\n\nNew reported cases by day in France 0 2,000 4,000 6,000 cases Feb. March April May 7-day average New cases Note: The seven-day average is the average of a day and the previous six days of data.\n\nNew reported deaths by day in France 0 500 1,000 1,500 2,000 deaths Feb. March April May 7-day average New deaths Note: Scale for deaths chart is adjusted from cases chart to display trend.\n\nThe New York Times has found that official tallies in the United States and in more than a dozen other countries have undercounted deaths during the coronavirus outbreak because of limited testing availability.\n\nFrance is one of a few countries in Europe that includes Covid-19 deaths in retirement or nursing homes in its country-wide daily death tallies, meaning the overall picture of mortality is more accurate. But the data skewed higher in the early weeks of April when previously unrecorded deaths were suddenly added to the nationally tally.\n\nGenerally speaking, while France has increased its testing capacities, it has yet to massively test people like its neighbor, Germany. The national public health authority has acknowledged that the reported number of test-confirmed cases was lower than the real number of cases.\n\nWhere You Can Find More Information\n\nRead more about the viruss impact on Frances economy and on its vaunted health system, the strain the epidemic is putting on poor urban suburbs, and how Covid-19 has changed attitudes towards mask-wearing.\n\nIn Paris, the city imposed a curfew on outdoor sports, and around the country people have fled to their second homes. Nearly 60 percent of sailors aboard the Charles de Gaulle, Frances flagship aircraft carrier, have become infected. And some reports suggest the virus might have been present in Europe much earlier than thought.\n\nHere is where you can find more detailed information:"
