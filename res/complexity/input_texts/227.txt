Dog abandoned at Scotland train station with suitcaseThe Scottish Society for the Prevention of Cruelty to Animals is investigating an incident of a dog abandoned at a train station along with a suitcase.The SPCA says the dog was found Jan. 2 tied to a railing at the Ayr railway station in South Ayrshire, Scotland. The suitcase was filled with possessions, including a pillow, a toy, food bowl, and food, according to the SPCA.Inspector Stewart Taylor said the dog's name is Kai.Officials said the male shar-pei crossbreed, who is 2 or 3 years old, had a microchip and they were able to track down the last registered owner."Unfortunately they could not tell us the address of the person who bought him. This case highlights the potential consequences of selling an animal online as it often leads to the impulse buying of pets that people know very little about," according to the SPCA website.The SPCA says the society will look after him until a suitable owner is found.In the country, abandoning an animal violates the Animal Health and Welfare Act of 2006. The SPCA says, "Anyone found guilty of doing so can expect to be banned from keeping animals for a fixed period or life."Follow @JessicaDurando on Twitter
