Yet it remains all too possible that health care reform will fail , as it has so many times before I'm not that worried about the issue of costs Yes , the Congressional Budget Office 's preliminary cost estimates for Senate plans were higher than expected , and caused considerable consternation last week But the fundamental fact is that we can afford universal health insurance even those high estimates were less than the 1 8 trillion cost of the Bush tax cuts Furthermore , Democratic leaders know that they have to pass a health care bill for the sake of their own survival One way or another , the numbers will be brought in line The real risk is that health care reform will be undermined by centrist Democratic senators who either prevent the passage of a bill or insist on watering down key elements of reform I use scare quotes around centrist , by the way , because if the center means the position held by most Americans , the self proclaimed centrists are in fact way out in right field What the balking Democrats seem most determined to do is to kill the public option , either by eliminating it or by carrying out a bait and switch , replacing a true public option with something meaningless For the record , neither regional health cooperatives nor state level public plans , both of which have been proposed as alternatives , would have the financial stability and bargaining power needed to bring down health care costs Whatever may be motivating these Democrats , they do n't seem able to explain their reasons in public Please verify you 're not a robot by clicking the box Invalid email address Please re enter You must select a newsletter to subscribe to You agree to receive occasional updates and special offers for The New York Times 's products and services Thank you for subscribing An error has occurred Please try again later You are already subscribed to this email Thus Senator Ben Nelson of Nebraska initially declared that the public option which , remember , has overwhelming popular support was a deal breaker Why \?

Mr Nelson softened his stand after reform advocates began a public campaign targeting him for his position on the public option And Senator Kent Conrad of North Dakota offers a perfectly circular argument we ca n't have the public option , because if we do , health care reform wo n't get the votes of senators like him Honestly , I do n't know what these Democrats are trying to achieve Yes , some of the balking senators receive large campaign contributions from the medical industrial complex but who in politics does n't \? If I had to guess , I 'd say that what 's really going on is that relatively conservative Democrats still cling to the old dream of becoming kingmakers , of recreating the bipartisan center that used to run America But this fantasy ca n't be allowed to stand in the way of giving America the health care reform it needs This time , the alleged center must not hold A version of this op ed appears in print on , on Page A21 of the New York edition with the headline Health Care Showdown
