Find Out More 14 , 798 There is a group of old Hollywood guys who have an annual dinner party where the main dish is human Every guest is allowed to bring a plus one A few years ago , when I was new in town , I got invited by a good friend , I should n't say his name I guess , said Perry , who also explained that each year a new host is selected for the following year by drawing straws , you know \? It is the new host 's responsibility to provide the main course , and it has to be human If he ca n't find a suitable person to serve as the meal Well the joke , I think it 's a joke , is that the host will be eaten instead ! I was a bit squeamish about the idea of going to this dinner party , but when I heard who else was going I jumped at the chance I was like , People die all the time and their bodies just go to waste If we can use their organs for medical purposes why should n't we eat their meat \? ' Asked what happened at the dinner party , Perry explained , It was a huge , lavish feast Oh my god The featured dish was what they called Foie Humaine You guys should appreciate that , being French It 's a pun on foie gras , get it \? But instead of force feeding a duck and then eating it 's liver , this was the liver of a human who had force fed themselves on junk food A fatty liver fit for the kings of Hollywood Describing herself as not terribly fond of organ meats , Perry passed on the liver dish , but did enjoy sampling human flesh during the multiple course Bacchanalian feast It tastes like pork , the singer explained of human meat But a little bit bitter , stronger Katy Perry promoting Illuminati symbolism Katy Perry 's cannibalistic confession is merely the latest in a long line of public dalliances the singer has shared with the dark side After starting her career as a Christian country singer , the she reinvented her image as a raunchy pop star , flashing Satanic hand gestures and promoting Illuminati symbolism as she rode to the top of the charts Since establishing herself in the global consciousness as a Devil worshipping entertainer , Katy Perry has attempted to sugar coat her image , however the disturbing conversation she held with the French radio host suggests she is far from a reformed character , and she has openly embraced the darkest forces in our society The incident has also sparked fears around the world that the Illuminati have moved onto the next phase of the masterplan , and have begun openly promoting dark spirituality as a viable religious choice for those seeking guidance
