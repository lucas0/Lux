b'During these times, there are so many Americans who have really risen to the challenge, done more than anyone could ask, more than anyone could expect. We want to make sure that we remember them and we thank our heroes of today. I know that I feel a grave responsibility to our frontline workers, our essential workers who understood the dangers of this Covid virus, but went to work anyway because we needed them to. We needed the nurses and the doctors to perform phenomenal service in the hospitals. We needed the police, the fire department, the E.M.S. to show up. We needed the frontline workers in grocery stores to show up, so others could stay home and be safe. And in many ways that is a microcosm of what were here talking about today on Memorial Day. But, as John F. Kennedy said, Remember with your actions. And today were saying we honor that service and were going to make sure that every government in the state of New York provides death benefits to those public heroes who died from Covid-19 during this emergency. I also believe the federal government should be doing the same: honoring the frontline workers, showing Americans that we appreciate what you did. That you showed up when it was hard. That you worked when it was hard. You appeared for duty when it was, it was troubling to do so. And Im sure many people were afraid to show up, but they showed up anyway.'
