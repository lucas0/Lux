Update, 3:02 pm ET: Apparently there's no link between the annual tradition of presidential adoptions and the Argentine "lobizon" myth:According to Argentine historian Daniel Balmaceda, there is no link between the two traditions. "The local myth of the lobiz√≥n is not in any way connected to the custom that began over 100 years ago by which every seventh son (or seventh daughter) born in Argentina becomes godchild to the president," he said.The legend seems ridiculous, but the Independent reports that fear of the creature was so widespread in 19th century Argentina that some families even murdered their babies. Fear and panic gave rise to the unusual practice of adoption by Argentina's president in 1907, which is meant to quell the deadly stigma ad demystify the folklore that was causing the abuse of children. Now a time-honored tradition, any family with seven sons or daughters today gets the president as their official godparent, a gold medal and a full educational scholarship.The boy's parents, Shlomo and Nehama Tawil, had written the president's office requesting the adoption in 1993, the Jewish Telegraphic Agency reported. President Kirchner reportedly described the adoption as a "magical moment," calling the Tawils a "marvelous family."Giphyh/t New York Daily News
