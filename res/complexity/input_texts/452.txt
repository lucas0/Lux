Darkside shatter dab , made by TC Labs for Natural Remedies in Denver Courtesy of Ry Prichard CannabisEncyclopedia comBrad Melshenker , owner of the Boulder , Colo based 710 Labs , knows his operation , with its extensive ventilation systems , industrial hygienist approved extraction machine , vacuum ovens , and workers wearing respirator masks looks like something out of a marijuana version of Breaking Bad It 's why he calls his lab manager , Wade Sanders , Walter , after the show 's protagonist , Walter White And like the famously pure and powerful blue meth White cooked up on Breaking Bad , the product produced by 710 Labs' fancy equipment is extremely concentrated , powerful , and coveted butane extracted hash oil \( BHO \) The lab 's finished BHO might not look like much a thin , hard , and shiny brown slab , like peanut brittle without the peanuts but when a piece of this shatter , as it 's called , is placed on the nail of a specially designed pipe that 's been superheated by a blowtorch , it vaporizes and delivers a direct hit of 70 to 90 percent THC , three times the potency of the strongest marijuana strains As Melshenker puts it , if smoking regular pot is like drinking a beer , dabbing , as this process is known , is a shot of hard liquor Vice calls the result , The smoothest slow motion smack in the face of clean , serene stonedness that you 've ever experienced Rolling Stone reports , Your head spins , your eyes get fluttery , a few beads of sweat surface on your forehead and , suddenly , you 're cosmically baked Some pot aficionados vow to never smoke the old way again Gucci Earwax , a butane extraction , made by Mahatma Extreme Concentrates for Karmaceuticals in Denver It won the first place medical concentrate trophy at the High Times 2013 Denver U S Cannabis Cup Courtesy of Ry Prichard CannabisEncyclopedia comHash , in other words , is no longer just a way to make use of leftover marijuana trim It 's now becoming the main attraction \( Butane is n't the only way to extract hash oil from marijuana , either some concentrate makers use carbon dioxide or water based extraction methods \) At Greenest Green , Melshenker 's Boulder dispensary , the inventory used to be 60 percent marijuana flower , 30 percent BHO , and 10 percent edibles Now it 's the opposite 60 percent BHO , 30 percent flower , and 10 percent edibles And roughly 40 dispensaries statewide contract with 710 Labs to turn their marijuana into shatter or budder , a gloopier version \( Because of delays in Boulder 's regulation process , 710 Labs wo n't be able to produce recreational BHO until Feb 17 \) AdvertisementHash oil is even fueling its own subculture Forget 4 20 dab heads or oil kids light up at 7 10 \( Turn the digits upside down and you have

dab gear , made by companies like Grassroots There 's a whole industry here , says Melshenker , whose business card doubles as a stainless steel dabber , the tool used to apply BHO to an oil rig 's superheated nail A production process laden with volatile chemicals a highly concentrated , easily transportable final product incredibly stoned kids with blowtorches Colorado 's thriving dabbing scene could just be one more bit of proof that the state is becoming a global mecca for marijuana After all , the state 's legalized marijuana experiment has so far been an unqualified success Despite the surprisingly limited number of recreational pot shops that opened their doors on Jan 1 and the hefty crowds waiting in line to patronize them the state has n't experienced widespread product shortages or weed prices high enough to trigger an Uber style backlash Yes , there was that story about 37 deadly marijuana overdoses on the first day of sales , but it turned out to be an obvious hoax The few pundits who 've complained about Colorado 's legalized pot , like David Brooks and Nancy Grace , have found their arguments blasted full of holes , not to mention lambasted on Saturday Night Live The Justice Department is looking into ways to help banks play nice with marijuana businesses a very serious problem and even President Obama in a recent New Yorker profile conceded it 's important for the experiment to go forward Soon enough , then , Colorado 's small scale experiment should spread far and wide , with controversial drug laws getting the boot , millions of clandestine tokers coming out of the closet , and governments reaping the benefits in taxes and fees That is unless something goes terribly wrong , derailing the whole legalization movement AdvertisementSuch a gloomy outcome is n't out of the question The only reason that Colorado is enjoying fame as the first place to legalize pot is thanks to a combination of fortunate timing , plucky advocates , forward thinking lawmakers , and a remarkable lack of snafus Colorado 's 2012 legalization attempt very well could have floundered if the effort had n't enjoyed remarkably positive media coverage Considering the precipitous rise of the state 's medical marijuana industry and lawmakers' keen efforts to moderate it , all it could have taken was the right bad headline a high profile crime or a boneheaded political move to set the endeavor back considerably Recall that alcohol prohibition was built on the temperance movement 's carefully crafted tales of woe and violence As Salvation Army Commander Evangeline Booth once put it Drink has drained more blood Dishonored more womanhood , Blasted more lives , Driven more to suicide , andDug more graves than any other poisoned scourge that ever swept its death dealing waves across the world Mixed shatter slab by TC Labs The product is broken prior to packaging to fit into the 1 gram or less packaging requirements Courtesy of Ry Prichard CannabisEncyclopedia comIn Colorado , however , there have been very few sordid marijuana tales that could be used to demonize the drug so far Weed fueled horror stories could still emerge in the state and with the world watching , such calamities could have an international impact So what are the biggest potential risks \? A major concern is diversion , taking Colorado 's legal pot and offloading it to the black market or selling it out of state While Colorado has established an extensive tracking system to prevent this from happening , there will always be tourists trying to take home a pot infused souvenir Beyond diversion , there 's the menace of crime not just the threat of burglaries and organized crime in a largely cash based industry , but also the distant possibility of banks or other financial institutions getting slapped with federal money laundering charges if they accept any of that free flowing marijuana cash Finally , there 's the prospective collateral damage , such as kids accidentally eating pot brownies something that 's already in the news or a violent pot related car crash If any of these calamities do occur , Colorado 's red hot dabbing scene could in fact be the source of the problem Dabbing certainly appears on the surface to be dangerous Kids are freebasing marijuana ! It looks like they 're smoking crack ! But it 's important to remember that there 's no evidence that it 's possible to overdose on pot \( Compared to say , acetaminophen , overdoses of which killed more than 1 , 500 Americans during the past decade \) So you can smoke the strongest dab imaginable or even , if you 're a showboat , smoke 50 dabs in a row and science says it wo n't kill you It will just get you really , really high Mars OG ISO dab , an isopropyl alcohol extraction made by Pink House Labs in Denver Courtesy of Ry Prichard CannabisEncyclopedia comAdvertisementBut just because something wo n't poison you the way alcohol can does n't mean it ca n't lead you to do something stupid enough that will kill you And there seem to be enough disconcerting variables associated with dabbing culture a production process laden with volatile chemicals a highly concentrated , easily transportable final product and incredibly stoned kids with blowtorches it seems only a matter of time until somebody in the scene does something very stupid and possibly fatal Yes , dabbing might not be as inherently dangerous as , say , a bar full of binge drinkers But it 's important to remember that recreational marijuana is n't necessarily replacing alcohol use it 's just adding a new legal vice to the options people already have While some researchers predict legalized marijuana will decrease alcohol use , others predict it could lead to heavy drinking and carnage on our highways So will folks really reach for a dabbing pipe instead of a shot glass or will they reach for both \? Top CommentNobody tell these fellows about vaporizers They 're going to worry about them detonating the atmosphere , or causing glaciers to melt , or something More J P McMahonJoin InQuestions like this have led California and Washington to outlaw the production of smokeable marijuana concentrates Colorado , however , has gone the opposite route In November it released a draft of proposed concentrate production rules , positioning itself to become the only place in the world where marijuana concentrate production is both legal and regulated The idea is to police the blooming subculture , to stay on top of it , so it ends up more akin to tattooing than meth If we outlaw concentrates , people will make them in their basements and blow themselves up , says Norton Arbelaez , co owner of the Denver dispensary RiverRock Wellness , which operates a concentrate production facility But just because a concentrate extraction system is certified by a third party industrial hygienist , as will likely be required by Colorado 's concentrate rules , does n't mean that system ca n't still accidentally blow up It makes sense that Colorado is at the vanguard of legalized dabbing It 's made a habit of taking risks when it comes to marijuana Colorado ca n't regulate away the chance that dabbing or some other marijuana related endeavor will lead to a spectacular accident , either industrial or personal But so far its legalization effort has taken pains to thoughtfully minimize such risks and so far , it 's working
