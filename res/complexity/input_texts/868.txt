Malia Obama has gotten herself into trouble yet again after a stupid Thirsty Thursday night stunt Every week , college students drink themselves into oblivion the day before the last day of classes for the week , and Malia Obama who is under the legal drinking age of 21 is no different Apparently , the elder Obama daughter had a bit too much to drink and , according to Harvard Campus Safety , took a dare from her friends to streak across a parking lot with her boyfriend The Harvard Sentinel reports Two students were cited after campus security observed them streaking across the Northeastern parking lot near the McDonnell Dormitory at around 1 30 a m Friday morning Malia Obama , 19 , and Dmitri Noonan , 24 , were seen holding hands and running through the parking lot while yelling what appeared to be how you like me now expletive deleted The pair will be charged with public indecency , fined 500 each by the school , and placed on academic probation for the remainder of the semester Another offense could lead to expulsion This is not Malia Obama s first time embarrassing her embarrassment of a family this year Earlier in the school year , she was caught smoking pot in her dorm and was busted at a party that was broken up by the police just two weeks ago Malia Obama is a trainwreck of a human being , and she should be ashamed for acting like such an uncivilized tramp They should throw her in jail where her whole family belongs As a Harvard graduate , I take particular exception to her little stunt , and they need to throw the book at her before she damages my school s reputation further
