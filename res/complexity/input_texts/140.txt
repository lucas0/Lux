b'The reopening and relaxing of social distancing restrictions in some states may be contributing to the first noticeable nationwide increase in coronavirus fatalities since April, when the pandemic initially peaked.\n\nThe number of cases in late June surged higher than during the outbreaks first peak. At this same time, daily Covid-19 fatalities decreased slightly, leading President Trump to proclaim that deaths were way down. But that divergence may have come to an end last week, when the average number of new deaths per day began steadily rising again.\n\nWhere deaths have increased since June 1 Daily new deaths since June 1 Maine Alaska Wis.

Treatment has improved and young people, who are less likely to die from Covid-19, make up a larger share of new cases.\n\nAdditionally, more widespread testing means cases are caught sooner, on average. That means that the lag between diagnosis and death would be longer than in March, when tests were in critically short supply.\n\nThat lag may have come to an end last week, as the number of new deaths began to rise. Many of the states that reopened early are the ones seeing the biggest increases, while New York, the countrys hardest-hit city, has seen a 64 percent drop since June 1.\n\nDeaths in New York, New Jersey and Connecticut 500 1,000 deaths March 1 July 15 Many deaths from unspecified days Last 10 days Deaths in rest of the United States March 1 July 15 7-day average\n\nWhile the growth rate of new deaths has flattened slightly in the past few days, data suggest that the recent increase in deaths may continue. Most of the states seeing the sharpest increase in deaths also have some of the countrys highest positive test rates, as well as soaring hospitalization rates, an indicator that many more residents may be gravely ill.\n\nIn addition, a high share of positive tests most likely signals that there are a larger number of people whose infections are going undetected in a states official numbers.\n\nHow the number of deaths per day has changed since June 1 Daily deaths\n\nper million per 1M Change Change hospitalized\n\nper million per 1M Positive\n\ntest rate Arizona 9.6 +319% 500 25% Texas 3.3 +307% 380 16% Oregon 0.8 +267% 60 6% Tennessee 2 +252% 190 8% Idaho 1.1 +225% 80 13% Florida 4.4 +204% 400 19% Nevada 3.1 +163% 360 14% Utah 1.5 +113% 80 9% Alabama 4.5 +91% 280 16% South Carolina 3.3 +90% 310 18% Arkansas 1.4 +88% 150 11% Washington 1.8 +60% 50 6% California 2.4 +38% 210 7% Oklahoma 0.9 +19% 140 9% Louisiana 3.7 +10% 290 10% South Dakota 2.1 +8% 70 7% Kansas 0.8 +6%  11% Mississippi 4.9 -2% 370 17% North Carolina 1.8 -10% 110 7% Kentucky 1.1 -19% 100 6% New Mexico 2 -29% 80 4% Georgia 2.2 -33% 270 15% Missouri 1.2 -43% 140 6% Virginia 1.5 -53% 130 6% Nebraska 0.8 -61% 60 6% Iowa 1.7 -61% 60 9% Ohio 1 -62% 90 6% New Jersey 3.4 -63% 100 1% Maine 0.4 -64% 10 1% Pennsylvania 1.6 -65% 50 5% Indiana 1.1 -66% 130 8% Colorado 1 -70% 70 6% New York 1.2 -73% 40 1% Maryland 1.6 -74% 70 5% Washington, D.C. 1.5 -75% 140 2% Michigan 1 -76% 50 3% New Hampshire 0.9 -77% 20 2% Illinois 1.3 -78% 110 3% Minnesota 0.9 -79% 50 4% Wisconsin 0.4 -80% 50 7% Massachusetts 2.6 -80% 80 2% Delaware 0.9 -83% 50 5% Connecticut 1.5 -83% 20 1% Rhode Island 2.2 -86% 60 3% Sources: New York Times database from state and local governments; the Covid-19 Tracking Project\n\nNote: Data is as of July 15, 2020.
