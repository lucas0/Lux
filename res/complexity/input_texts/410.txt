1 33KUT 's Syeda Hasan reports What I find is that leaders of the other party are against efforts to crack down on voter fraud , Abbott said The fact is that voter fraud is rampant In Texas , unlike some other states and unlike some other leaders , we are committed to cracking down on voter fraud In an interview with the Texas Tribune CEO and Editor in Chief Evan Smith on Friday , Obama said that leaders in Texas are partly to blame for low voter turnout in the state The folks who are governing the good state of Texas are n't interested in having more people participate , Obama said Obama has been previously critical of Voter ID laws like the one Texas passed in 2011 A federal judge ruled last year that the Texas law had a discriminatory effect by restricting access to the polls for black and Hispanic Texans Last week the full U S 5th Circuit Court of Appeals announced that it would hear arguments over whether the law violates the Voting Rights Act The law requires most citizens to show one of a handful of forms of allowable photo identification before their election ballots can be counted One specific policy that Obama suggested the state should adopt to increase turnout would be online voter registration But Abbott appeared uninterested in the proposal when asked about it at a press conference following the announcement that California based Pegasus Foods is building a new , 80 , 000 square foot manufacturing facility in Rockwall , Texas We do n't want to open the system up to methodologies or ways of voting that would promote or allow voter fraud , Abbott said To the contrary to the president 's comment , the fact is despite our voter registration laws we had the highest level of turnout than ever before in the primary that occurred just a few weeks before he made that comment While Texas did witness historic voter turnout in the 2016 primaries , the state still had one of the lowest voting age participation rates of the states that have held primaries so far at 21 5 percent , besting only Louisiana as of last week But Abbott did not attribute those figures to the state 's election laws , instead pointing to the lack of faith in government among voters Voters and citizens repeatedly say , Why go vote if we 're going to have corrupt leaders in office \? ' Abbott said So we need to root out and eliminate corrupt leaders and root out and eliminate corruption in the voting process , and that means greater ballot security , not less ballot security Abbott noted that he personally prosecuted voter fraud cases across the entire state of Texas while he was the state 's attorney general from 2002 to 2015 As U S Sen Cory Booker , D New Jersey , pointed out last year in light of the 50th anniversary of the Voting Rights Act , Voter fraud remains by many accounts a rare phenomenon in Texas You 're more likely to get struck by lightning in Texas than to find any kind of voter fraud , U S Sen Cory Booker , D New Jersey , said last year , an assertion that PolitiFact found to be true As of last year , there had been a total of 85 election fraud prosecutions resolved in Texas , including 51 guilty or no contest pleas and 9 convictions , according to PolitiFact Lorraine Minnite , a Rutgers professor and author of the book The Myth of Voter Fraud , determined that four cases in Texas from 2000 to 2014 involved in person voter fraud Tags
