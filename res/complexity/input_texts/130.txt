We 're here to help educate you Jenny Kane RGJ That statement is too much It 's too much as far as I'm concerned , said Dr Noah Kaufman , an emergency medicine specialist based in Northern Colorado Because that is saying confidently that this is the first case We 've got one ! ' And I still disagree with that It 's widely accepted as fact that marijuana overdoses are not fatal The U S Drug Enforcement Administration fact sheet on pot says simply that no death from overdose of marijuana has been reported and the National Institutes of Health says there is insufficient evidence to link THC overdose to fatalities The claim that an overdose death happened in Colorado has the potential to change the way people think about the steady march toward marijuana legalization in the U S The controversyBoth published accounts of this case clearly state that the autopsy shows that the 11 month old boy died of myocarditis \( inflammation of the heart muscle \) which caused the heart to fail The Nappe Hoyte published case study takes the diagnosis a step further , theorizing that the myocarditis was caused by cannabis overdose , which then caused the baby boy 's heart to fail That diagnosis of this heart condition is at the core of the medical debate over this case study Myocarditis is rare in children , and can often be fatal when diagnosed In children , fatal myocarditis is usually caused by a virus called Coxsackievirus The authors of the case report say that virus was ruled out in this case CLOSEA recent poll says Americans believe marijuana is less harmful than opioids in pain relief , but are less comfortable with its use by children and pregnant women for medical conditions WochitMyocarditis has a long list of other known causes , mostly from infections by bacteria , viruses , fungi , and parasites We extensively ruled out almost every other cause that we can think of , Dr Hoyte said Myself , our team , plus the primary team taking care of the patient , plus the coroner who did the post mortem on the child And we found no other reason why this young kid ended up having inflammation on his heart Drs Hoyte and Nappe both worked on the case as physicians on staff at the poison control center More New 'Potcast' to dive into how marijuana legalization is changing AmericaWe do not know if this case has led to a criminal investigation Hoyte and Nappe declined to share the identity of the deceased child or even the name of the hospital in Colorado where the death took place , for fear of revealing his identity They report finding a high concentration of THC \( the psychoactive drug found in marijuana \) in the child 's urine and blood Short of that , they have no evidence that explains the child 's death We just wanted to make sure that we 're not going to call this a marijuana related fatality if there was something else that we could point at And we looked and looked and could n't find it , Hoyte said Their case report points to other research that shows myocarditis as a symptom associated with THC consumption , but those cases involved the presence of other drugs and do not propose a mechanism by which marijuana might bring on myocarditis None of those cases involved fatalities This hints at a scientific limitation of this study The doctors do n't have a proof positive way to demonstrate that marijuana caused the death in this 2015 case What they can do is demonstrate a presence of marijuana in the boy 's system , and that they ruled out a lot of other possible explanations for his death The child did n't leave the house between being normal and being sick The child had THC in the blood and in the urine and there were marijuana products in the house , Hoyte said I feel very comfortable with the workup that we did and how much we ruled out in this particular case This conclusion leaves other doctors curious , but skeptical that this truly is the world 's first documented death by marijuana overdose This child 's death in 2015 was previously noted in a 2016 paper published in the Journal of the American Medical Association Pediatrics In that paper , written by Dr George Wang of Children 's Hospital Colorado , said that marijuana could not be determined as the cause of myocarditis in this case However , Dr Wang says that his study focused on a wider review of years of data and not the relationship between this type of heart problem and evidence of marijuana found in that boy 's system Multiple ER doctors and medical researchers were interviewed for this story Many praised the Rocky Mountain Poison and Drug Center as a top tier institution for researching the issue , but none accepted this case as bulletproof evidence of a marijuana overdose death , though some were more open to the idea than others One spoke on the record I'm going to have to call BS' on this one , Kaufman said I'm not saying that it 's not But I think it 's a pretty big leap to say that it is Other possible causesWhile the study notes that the child tested positive for marijuana and that his case involved an unstable motel living situation and parental admission of drug possession , including cannabis , the doctors admit in their published report , the myocarditis could have been caused by something doctors ca n't test for A lot of the times the cause of myocarditis is infectious Or unknown , Hoyte said Dr Kaufman agrees about the number of unknown causes of myocarditis Hoyte may be pretty confident , Kaufman said , But I'm not I think that it 's more likely that there 's not a relationship There 's so many things that cause the problem that this poor baby had , that we 're not even close to saying it was definitively a marijuana overdose , Kaufman added Allergies can cause this What if the kiddo was allergic to the carnauba wax , or whatever is in the gummy that 's not the marijuana \? Kaufman also points out that there are thousands of known cases of accidental ingestion of marijuana by kids of all ages and while symptoms can be bad , none of those cases have proven fatal To him , that suggests there may be some other reason that a small segment of the population is more sensitive to overdose on THC than most people The case report on this death itself is missing some key information Hoyte and Nappe wrote that the boy ate an unknown dose of THC , and said they are n't sure exactly what product was involved or precisely when he ate it Based on the blood levels of THC metabolite they found , the doctors estimate that consumption took place 2 6 days before death Some context and adviceDoctors on both sides of the debate agree on what parents should learn from this case It 's the same advice they 've given since marijuana first became legal in Colorado keep it away from kids Even if I'm not convinced that it could kill your kid , you need to be really careful because it could make them really sick , Dr Kaufman said It needs to be locked up away in a medicine chest because it can cause seizures It can cause real big problems in kids that can lead to other problems Concerned parents can also learn the warning signs for marijuana ingestion , which include lack of balance , unusual and sudden sleepiness , and breathing difficulty , according to Children 's Hospital Colorado Hoyte and Nappe report that this baby displayed those symptoms for a day or so before he had a seizure and went to the ER Colorado has taken recent steps aimed at preventing accidental ingestion by children In the years since legalization , the state has imposed new restrictions on the potency and design of edible marijuana products New rules that took effect last month ban edibles that resemble existing non marijuana candies and also bans shaping edibles in the form of people , animals , or fruit Dr Hoyte was careful to point out that even though he does believe THC led to this death , there are plenty of more harmful substances parents also need to worry about We 're far more concerned about opioids in that case of a kid getting really sick than we are of marijuana , Hoyte said Even if Hoyte and Nappe 's determination is confirmed , it 's worth noting that we would have more confirmed deaths from swallowed laundry and dish detergent pods than from marijuana , according to poison control researchers at Nationwide Children 's Hospital in Columbus , Ohio The doctors who spoke agree further study may be warranted , including animal testing , to shed more light on possible links between myocarditis and marijuana More post mortem studies of the heart tissue from cannabis users who pass away could also be useful , Hoyte suggested However , he says that if he 's right , this phenomenon may be extremely rare Cases of kids ingesting cannabis have increased since Colorado legalized the drug , but Hoyte admits pot may not be causing enough serious health complications to study these issues extensively We 're not getting calls from kids getting sick from marijuana or even adults getting sick from marijuana getting sick to the point of having bad outcomes , Hoyte said We 're not getting these every single day They 're very few and far between Was this a rare case of marijuana death , or something else \?
