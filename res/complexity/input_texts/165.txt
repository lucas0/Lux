Burdick has been a longtime proponent of gun control legislation Along with Oregon sheriffs , she sponsored a 2000 initiative approved by Oregon voters that required background checks on purchasers at gun shows She sponsored the initiative after she fell just short of getting the Oregon Legislature to pass a similar bill UPDATE Lobbyists for gun owners blasted Burdick and said they did n't think limiting the size of gun clips would have any value There 's no particular reason to pick a number of rounds a person should have , said Kevin Starrett of the Oregon Firearms Federation He said that if these restrictions were adopted , shooters could still use multiple clips or weapons According to news reports , the shooter yesterday was able to rapidly fire about 60 shots This terrifying situation exemplifies the danger of large capacity magazines in our community Large capacity magazines can dramatically increase death tolls and have no legitimate place in our neighborhoods Burdick said she introduced similar legislation in 2011 but was unable to get a hearing on the bill She said the Clackamas shootings along with a spate of other shootings involving a gunman able to rapidly fire a large number of shots might lead to more political support for her proposal I'm not saying this will end gun violence , said Burdick But if people ca n't go waltzing into a gun shop and buy a 50 round magazine , I think that is a positive step The draft of Burdick 's bill would ban gun clips containing more than 10 rounds of ammunition Even hunters are restricted from using large capacity magazines there is a five cartridge limit for large game hunting , and three for bird hunting If we limit capacity for hunting animals , why do we not extend that principle to guns that may harm our neighbors \?
