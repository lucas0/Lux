0 Comments COUNT Oklahoma State Rep George Faught argues that rape and incest are the will of God while defending anti abortion legislation Tuesday the Oklahoma House approved House Bill 1549 , also called the Prenatal Nondiscrimination act of 2017 The controversial legislation would prohibit abortion when the fetus is diagnosed with Down syndrome or any other birth defect Discussing the legislation before Tuesday 's vote , Faught , the bill 's author , said when it comes to abortion , people are being allowed to play God While discussing Faught 's legislation on the House floor Rep Regina Goodwin asked At what point did you decide that that 's within your ability to decide for all women in Oklahoma \? Faught replied One of the things that I campaigned on was to protect life , and I believe life begins at conception At one point Rep Cory Williams \( D \) asked Faught if rape is the will of God Faught responded Well , you know , if you read the Bible , there 's actually a couple circumstances where that happened The Lord uses all circumstances I mean , you can go down that path , but it 's a reality unfortunately Williams followed up , asking if incest is the will of God Faught said Same answer Does n't deal with this bill Williams continued , asking why the bill does not include exceptions for rape and incest which are allowed in most anti abortion legislation You wo n't make any exceptions for rape You wo n't make any exceptions for incest , and you are proffering divine intervention as a reason why you wo n't do that Williams Continued I think it is very important \( to know \) , do you believe rape and incest are actually the will of God \? After a brief pause , Faught replied You know it 's a great question to ask And obviously if it happens in someone 's life , it may not be the best thing that ever happened , but so you 're saying that God is not sovereign with every activity that happens in someone 's life and ca n't use anything and everything in someone 's life and I disagree with that Bottom line For Rep Faught , God is sovereign , and everything that happens is part of God 's plan even rape and incest Sounds like Faught 's God is a moral monster Good thing God does n't exist , but it is terrifying that legislators like Faught are making laws based on their ridiculous and dangerous religious superstitions \( H T Raw Story Watch a video clip of the exchange between Faught and Williams below \) Oklahoma State Rep George Faught
