Missouri state Sen Maria Chappelle Nadal , D University City , wrote during a morning Facebook exchange , referring to Republican President Donald Trump She quickly deleted her post , but not quickly enough By midafternoon , the political verdicts of her own party were rolling in U S Sen Claire McCaskill , D Mo I condemn it Its outrageous And she should resign U S Rep William Lacy Clay , D St Louis \( C \) alling for the assassination of the President is a federal crime \( She is \) an embarrassment to our state She should resign immediately Missouri Democratic Party Chair Stephen Webber The Party will absolutely not tolerate calls for the assassination of the President I believe she should resign Missouri Senate Democratic Caucus leader Sen Gina Walsh \( She \) should be ashamed of herself for adding her voice to this toxic environment Republican Gov Eric Greitens said in a statement We can have differences in our country , but no one should encourage political violence The senator should resign Lt Gov Mike Parson , a Republican , and state Auditor Nicole Galloway , a Democrat , also called for Chappelle Nadals resignation In an interview , Chappelle Nadal acknowledged she wrote the offending line on her personal Facebook page in response to another commenter before deleting it I didnt mean what I put up Absolutely not I was very frustrated Things have got to change , Chappelle Nadal told the Post Dispatch It was in response to the concerns that I am hearing from residents of St Louis I have deleted it , and it should have been deleted , but there is something way more important that we should be talking about She added later I am not resigning What I said was wrong , but I am not going to stop talking about what led to that , which is the frustration and anger that many people across America are feeling right now Chappelle Nadal said her comment stemmed from frustration over the events in Charlottesville over the weekend , in which a white supremacist protester allegedly rammed his car into a group of counterprotesters , killing a 32 year old woman 1 Trumps reaction to the tragedy , which included the assertion that both sides of the protests were to blame for the violence , has drawn criticism across the political spectrum There are people who are afraid of white supremacists in the aftermath of Charlottesville , she said There are people who are having nightmares There are people who are afraid of going out in the streets Its worse than even Ferguson According to a screenshot of the now deleted conversation obtained by the Post Dispatch , another commenter named Christopher Gagne was writing about a cousin of his who he said was on Trumps Secret Service detail But , what I posted earlier , I truly believe will happen , sooner not later , he wrote In a subsequent interview with the Post Dispatch , Gagne said that wasnt a reference to assassination , but to his earlier stated belief that Vice President Mike Pence will use the 25th Amendment of the Constitution to have Trump removed from office Damn , Gagne then wrote , now Ill probably get a visit from the Secret Service He followed that comment with smdh , an abbreviation for shaking my damn head Chappelle Nadal responded No I will I hope Trump is assassinated ! The U S Secret Services St Louis field office is looking into this , the office confirmed Thursday Kristina Schmidt , special agent in charge , told the Post Dispatch that hypothetically in such investigations , agents try to determine intent , to determine if there was a violation of federal law If there is , then we refer it to the U S attorney Our primary goal is to determine if there is intent and meaning behind it , Schmidt said Richard Callahan , former U S attorney in St Louis , said that generally in cases involving such threats , we try to distinguish between stupid and \( actual \) intent He said the bottom line is the question of whether the person was serious about making the threatened action happen Another factor , he said , is whether its a person of influence You look at the persons station in life , whether they might have influence over others In addition to partywide condemnation of Chappelle Nadals post , state Rep Joshua Peters , D St Louis , issued a formal request Thursday to the Missouri Senate committee that deals with member ethics asking for Chappelle Nadals removal from office , calling her an embarrassment nationally for the Missouri General Assembly The furious responses from Chappelle Nadals own party might at least partly reflect her history of internal political strife as an outspoken critic of people on both sides of the aisle First elected to the House in 2004 , she served three terms before winning a four way primary for the Senates 14th District in 2010 In January 2015 , she filed a proposal in the Senate seeking the ouster of former Gov Jay Nixon , a Democrat , for his actions in relation to the August 2014 death of a black teenager in Ferguson by a white police officer In her proposal , she said Nixon seems only to acknowledge the existence of the African American community on or about election day The measure went nowhere But her attacks on Nixon never dimmed In a tweet at the time of the protests in Ferguson , Chappelle Nadal wrote You dont know s because you never communicate F you , governor ! Shes also tried to exert political payback against her foes She spent nearly 20 , 000 on negative ads against Rep Joe Adams , whom she had defeated in her race for the Senate five years previously She got into a fight with Sen Jamilah Nasheed , D St Louis , at a Lil Wayne concert at Scottrade Center in 2011 over legislation regarding local control of the city police department Last year , she unsuccessfully challenged Clay , the St Louis based congressman , in the Democratic primary During the most recent legislative session , Chappelle Nadal focused her efforts on a controversial buyout program for homeowners in the Spanish Village neighborhood of Bridgeton who have been impacted by pollution in the nearby Westlake Landfill Initially , she wanted her colleagues to approve a 12 million program and threatened to shut down the Senate with a filibuster if it didnt move forward She backed off when the Senate endorsed a 1 million pilot program But the House didnt agree and she left the Capitol in May with nothing Kurt Erickson and Joe Holleman of the Post Dispatch contributed to this report ndn video player 3 ndn embedded ndn floatContainer margin top 10px margin bottom 20px
