that happened every couple of minutes He asked if he could walk me to my car and I said yes , but that is when everything went dark When I woke up , I was in this basement and I saw that guy I was with earlier taking saws up the stairs I cried for help and that is when he stuffed me into a freezer where I saw dead bodies I must have passed out from shock or something but I am happy you guys found me , said to police by the victim Officer Douglas , who was searching for Thompson , found him in a crawl space in the basement Police ran a background check on him and discovered that he was
