The family home of Judge Brett Kavanaugh was a scene right out of a frat party gone wrong yesterday , as over 200 left wing protesters , many wearing masks , shouted profane slogans , waved signs , and threw calendars , bricks , and bottles at the property Kavanaugh himself was not in the residence , as he is currently in Washington for a symposium on anger management His wife and children vacated the premisis and are currently housed in an unknown location for their own safety Neighbors snapped this photo as they were sipping appletinis and counting how many islands they own The Judge s home , located at 1512 Whiteman Street in Mayo Lake , PA , was deluged early in the morning , at the 9 00 hour , as the protesters arrived by van and poured out onto the sidewalk and lawn areas Neighbors and witnesses reported screaming and loud jungle drum like noises and local police were notified Officers were shown protest permits , most signed by Diane Fienstien and Kamala Harris , and chose to remain at the scene in a public safety capacity No charges were filed , and the authorities left the area by noon It was then that the crowd became riotous , and caused upwards of 11 , 000 worth of damage The most annoying part was this man , who simply played the fill in from In the Air Tonight over and over According to assessors , the front door and side windows are hopelessly stained with what appears to be human excrement , and will need to be completely replaced A willow tree in the yard is covered with toilet paper and has offensive phrases carved into it s base A small bird bath and fountain is overflowing with urine and marijuana cigarette butts The entire lawn has been trampled flat , and in one area , destroyed completely , appearing as if one or more vandals had been doing donuts with an all terrain vehicle Also , if anyone knows who left this sweet 78 Pinto behind , I ll give you 200 for it The Kavanaugh family is reported to be hiding in a bedroom with their hands pressed over their mouths
