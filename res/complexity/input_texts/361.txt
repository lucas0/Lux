Four days after Irma , millions of Floridians are still stuck without power in the sweltering summer heat Those outages have now killed eight elderly people trapped in a Hollywood nursing home without air conditioning , due to circumstances that FPL was warned about at least two days before the tragedy Many of those powerless residents are now asking hard questions of the area 's power monopoly , which has spent millions of dollars fighting policies that would have strengthened the grid in the event of a major storm like Irma and , more broadly , stemmed the carbon fueled climate change likely fueling monster storms I am one of the many that has now been without power for more than two days as a result of Hurricane Irma , Elise McKenna , a West Palm Beach resident , told New Times via email My confusion came when so many of us lost power during the early hours of the storm that basically avoided us We 've been told time and time again that rate increases were to help prepare us for future storms McKenna is far from alone FPL 's workers on the ground seem to be doing all they can to fix downed lines and restore power to homes , and they deserve huge credit for working around the clock in awful conditions But the company 's corporate and government relations wings have serious questions to answer this week after quashing regulations that could have made the energy grid stronger at a slight expense to FPL 's billion dollar bottom line But after Irma , which by most reports brought only Category 1 strength winds to South Florida , by some measures the company did even worse Despite all of those upgrades , an even larger percentage of FPL 's customer base But after Irma , which by most reports brought only Category 1 strength winds to South Florida , by some measures the company did even worse Despite all of those upgrades , an even larger percentage of FPL 's customer base 4 4 of 4 9 million customers , almost 90 percent lost electricity this past weekend Granted , Wilma and Irma were different storms Irma was larger and raked South Florida with its powerful dirty side During Wilma , many Miamians were trapped without power for two weeks or more , and FPL promises it will fix most of Florida 's east coast within a week But the company also says harder hit customers on the state 's Gulf Coast could be out of power for 12 days or more The same would likely have been true in Miami had Irma 's eye wall churned through Dade County instead of Naples Even worse , some of FPL 's highly touted storm ready technology did n't work after Irma Before the hurricane hit , FPL directed residents to regularly check its mobile app and online service map to see if their homes had power but on Tuesday , FPL was forced to apologize after many residents said they were either unable to access the map or were repeatedly given inaccurate information \( Two New Times reporters were given wrong info this week one was told her power was back on , only to travel home and find out she was still in the dark \) Communication systems across Florida were impacted by Irma , causing issues with our reporting systems , FPL 's website said Tuesday We apologize if you were provided with incorrect status updates We ask that you please re report your outage if your power is still out The fiasco , naturally , has angered some Floridians , who are already fairly ornery after being trapped in homes without air conditioning and hot water for multiple days The website gives no indication as to when individuals can expect power to be restored , McKenna , the reader in West Palm , says Their official , blanket statement says 'end of the upcoming weekend ' How are things this bad after tropical storm winds and spotty Cat 1 gusts \?

trick customers into giving up their rights to solar power The law 's language would have paved the way for Florida to kill net metering rules This past April , the Energy and Policy Institute caught an FPL lobbyist straight up drafting anti solar laws for Fort Myers state Rep Ray Rodrigues , who also took a 15 , 000 campaign contribution from FPL this year FPL has also resisted some seemingly foolproof solutions to avoid storm outages , such as burying more lines In a city that names its sports teams for hurricanes , a huge portion of FPL 's power lines still sit above ground and get blown apart even in tropical storm conditions The company 's stubborn stance on burying lines has been on full display in an ongoing fight over 88 miles of new power lines it wants to build connecting to

governments sued This year , FPL and the City of Miami settled their suit , and the company agreed to bury five miles of lines as long as the city dropped the rest of its complaints The settlement meant a different , larger stretch of lines would remain above ground for the next 40 years If If insideFPL buried its wires underground its monopoly profits would be a bit lower but millions of its

plant upgrades The company Instead of funneling money toward those extremely basic fixes , FPL has instead forced the public to pay for massive fossil fuel and nuclear energy plant upgrades The company hiked rates by more than 811 million last year to build a back up natural gas power plant and is urging state regulators to hand the company a blank check to build two new nuclear reactors at Turkey Point Those upgrades do n't really help when power lines are blown to shreds , and both plants will end up spewing carbon pollution into the air Hurricane Irma marks yet another moment to question whether Florida 's four regulated , private power monopolies make any sense in a world threatened by climate change According to a March 2016 According to a March 2016 news release announcing a rate hike , FPL has apparently been studying the damage major storms such as Wilma and Hurricane Sandy caused to various electric grids FPL 's updated storm hardening plan , also filed with the Public Service Commission today , outlines the company 's 2016 2018 grid strengthening initiatives , which build on the successes of improvements made since the program began in 2006 and incorporate lessons learned from major storms , such as 2012 's Superstorm Sandy By strengthening power lines and related infrastructure , hardening initiatives are designed to reduce outages and enable FPL to
