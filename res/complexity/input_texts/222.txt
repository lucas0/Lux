On 10 16 17 at 4 00 PMYes , we 're \( still \) rehashing the 2016 election Timothy A Clary AFP GettyShareUpdated Sure , it 's been more than 340 days since Donald Trump beat Hillary Clinton , but there 's still one very narrow , highly unlikely and entirely unprecedented way that Clinton could become president But you never know In light of the ongoing probe into Russia collusion , Harvard University professor Lawrence Lessig posted on Medium a series of if then scenarios that would lead to House Speaker Paul Ryan handing the White House keys to Clinton Related Hillary Clinton losing to Trump was like Jesus 's crucifixionTo be clear , constitutional law expert Lessig is not calling for a Clinton ascendancy , but was merely playing out a hypothetical chain of events should a conspiracy be proven If number 1 If Trump is definitively found to have colluded directly with Russia , he would be forced to resign or be impeached If number 2 If Trump is removed , Vice President Mike Pence would become president If number 3 If Pence becomes president , he should resign too , given that he benefited from the same help from Mother Russia If number 4 If Pence resigns before appointing a vice president , Ryan would become president If number 5 If Ryan becomes president , he should do the right thing and choose Clinton for vice president Then he should resign The answer seems unavoidable He should nominate the person defeated by the treason of his own party , and then step aside and let her become the president , Lessig writes Without doubt , if Ryan did the right thing , that would be the most extraordinary event in the history of America since the Confederate Army fired on Fort Sumter But unlike that , this event would build the union , not divide it Lessig , who briefly ran for the Democratic nomination in 2015 , adds that Clinton would then appoint Ryan to be veep out of political goodwill Americans can only assume that while busy being a president who can read policy documents longer than one page , she 'd stop her endless press tour and figure out how to keep the nation from getting nuked Lessig apparently is n't the only one with Clinton on the brain Clinton has made it clear she wo n't run for office again , telling CBS Sunday Morning that she 's done with being a candidate But Trump himself tweeted about the possibility Monday I was recently asked if Crooked Hillary Clinton is going to run in 2020 \? he wrote My answer was , 'I hope so ! ' Only time will tell if the Russia cloud clears up by then Story was updated to clarify that Lessig was not advocating for the if then scenario , but merely laying it out
