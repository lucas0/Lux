Tweet on Twitter Trump is on target for what he promises to all Americans The left is n't that happy about the way he introduced the campaign , and told everyone that he dreams of big and safe America Hillary 's supporters and the media came up with everything they could ever think of in order to get Trump out of the game Not so fast , people ! Your audio does n't mean a thing Even Graham told everyone how he sees things , and that brought joy to everyone who cares about this country Unlike people who hate Trump , he said a few good words that surprised us all In a good way , of course In your face , haters ! Via Patriot JournalThey are epitome of hypocrisy Most of the people decrying Trump give a pass to Bill Clinton , when as president he committed adultery with an intern They continue to give a pass to Hillary , who protects her husband despite allegations of rape And they ignore serious crimes Hillary committed when secretary of state On the other hand , conservatives , who believe in such virtues as forgiveness , have been willing to look passed Trump 's remarks We have enough common sense and decency to know everyone messes up , now and again , and needs our understanding and forgiveness From Conservative Tribune While the media could n't understand why , Rev Franklin Graham did He wrote a stirring Facebook post that moved Trump so much that he re posted it on his Facebook account A lot of people are slamming evangelicals for supposedly giving Donald J Trump a pass , Graham began That 's simply not true No one is giving him a pass I'm certainly not , and I 've not met an evangelical yet who condones his language or inexcusable behavior from over a decade ago However , he has apologized to his wife , his family , and to the American people for this He has taken full responsibility This election is n't about Donald Trump 's behavior from 11 years ago or Hillary Clinton 's recent missing emails , lies , and false statements , Graham continued This election is about the Supreme Court and the justices that the next president will nominate Evangelicals are going to have to decide which candidate they trust to nominate men and women to the court who will defend the constitution and support religious freedoms My prayer is that Christians will not be deceived by the liberal media about what is at stake for future generations , Graham added The left do n't understand this , because they are mostly secular humanists They are unable to appreciate such a powerful virtue as forgiveness , because they do n't believe in a God who can forgive our every trespass They are under the delusion that you must be perfect or else Either you live up to their warped standards or they 'll throw you under the bus That 's what happened to Alec Baldwin a few years ago , when TMZ accused him of a homophobic remark All his liberal buddies were quick to disown him , despite any real evidence The left will never be able to understand , because they refuse to They simply have their own agenda to protect , at all costs , and cannot conceive the ability to grow or change Pro Hillary Americans ca n't understand that Trump is what this country needs They are aware of his potential , but still refuse to admit it Well , we know that , and we support Trump Nobody cares about your opinion , Dems !
