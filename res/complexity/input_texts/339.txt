November 4 , 2007Patrick Stewart Keep on trekkin'From the USS Enterprise to the London stage , Patrick Stewart has had a brilliant career So how come he left the rave reviews till last \? Bryan AppleyardJust over 20 years ago , in his mid forties , Patrick Stewart was doing pretty well as an actor He did n't have any savings , but he had a nice house in Chiswick and could afford to send his two children to private schools My career , he says , had been chugging along in an okay way Then he appeared in Peter Shaffer 's Yonadab at the National Theatre It was Shaffer 's only flop , and Stewart found himself playing to an almost empty house Next came Who 's Afraid of Virginia Woolf \? with Billie Whitelaw at the Young Vic It was a hit and ready to transfer to the West End , but Whitelaw did n't want to go The money man said the loss of Whitelaw was a problem He could n't take it into the West End without a star people had heard of It really hurt , that remark All those years of work at the RSC But I guess it was a pragmatic point of view I was n't bankable , and he could n't sell this production on my name So , in 1987 , he took a television job in Hollywood Everybody told him to do it he could make some money , be seen by millions and then come home It was no big commitment , he was assured , as the series would certainly bomb It sounded like a great plan It was a great deal That 's why I did it The series was certain to fail because it seemed like little more than a desperate attempt to revive an old one Furthermore , Stewart was to be cast as the most unAmerican hero imaginable , an earl grey drinking , vaguely aristocratic , vaguely naval type with a French French ! name , who preferred talking to fighting On the face of it , the series only made sense as some sort of tax scam Stewart and the rest of the cast thought nothing of signing up for six years But , of course , Star Trek The Next Generation lasted for seven years , and Stewart was Captain Jean Luc Picard of the Starship Enterprise for 178 episodes Then it turned into a series of films , culminating in Star Trek Nemesis , in 2002 It came to a point where I had no idea where Picard began and I ended We completely overlapped His voice became my voice , and there were other elements of him that became me Stewart was now unbankable in a wholly new way No director in Hollywood wanted to cast this grand , deep voiced , bald English guy because everybody knew he was Picard and could n't possibly be anybody else In the event , he effectively reprised the part as Professor Charles Xavier a grand , deep voiced , bald English guy in the X Men films I do n't have a film career , he says wryly , I have a franchise career In 2004 , however , homesick , pining for the stage and with his second marriage coming to an end \( he now lives with the actress Lisa Dillon \) , he came home with , for a Shakespearian star , a gaping hole in his CV There comes a point where you have to start ticking off these roles I 've missed out on Hamlet and Romeo , probably Richard III , too I was even uncomfortably aware when I took on Macbeth that people were saying I was a little old for it I 've not done Lear , but Ian McKellen has closed that door for a good few years If I could fit in only one more Shakespeare role , it would be Falstaff I 've always thought of him as a middle aged Hamlet It 's a great role He 's 67 now and so absurdly buff that he could pass for an absurdly buff 50 We meet at the stage door of the Gielgud theatre or , rather , we fail to meet , because he rushed in with a Huddersfield Town cap pulled over his face He does n't like the hooker and thug infested bit of Soho around Rupert Street , and he and the rest of the cast leave by the front entrance in the evening , hence the speed of his entry and the disguise He 's doing his Macbeth at the Gielgud , and both he and the show are magnificent , mesmerising The reviews are raves , and it 's just about to go to New York It was , I say , the play that turned me on to Shakespeare when I was 14 He laughs I think you 'll find a lot of people will say that I got a sniff of it when I was 14 I thought I was going to play it , and somebody said to me , Stewart , you 're going to get a lot of opportunities to play parts like this we 're giving it to somebody else ' As it happened , that production did n't eventually happen There seem to be three important things about Stewart 's childhood his luck , his dad and the Yorkshire countryside He was lucky because , in spite of abject academic failure he skived off on the day of his 11 plus he was spotted by a smart English teacher and was taught outside school by a brilliant drama teacher It was clear where he was going , and , after a spell on the local paper , he became a full time actor It was a smart move , bunking off the 11 plus I would never have met Cecil Dormand a great man and I would have been a grammar school failure His father had been in the army for 10 years and then enlisted again in 1939 He was an imposing man , regimental sergeant major in the Parachute Regiment He had a terrific voice , better than mine Somebody said when my father walked on the parade ground , the birds stopped singing The Macbeth production is set in a modern , military state Stewart has grown a sergeant majorish moustache for the part When I put my uniform on and look in the mirror , he stares straight back at me From the first , he was a workaholic , an affliction that , he admits , made him a bad father , remote like his dad I always chose work over the family I regret that , I really do I have a great relationship with my children now , terrific , but I did n't always have it I missed out so much And I do n't think I supported their mother as much as I might have done It would never occur to me to put family first It 's still a struggle It was n't because I did n't love them , I just loved the job so much He did bits of film and television , but everything else was theatre He pursued his craft with awesome austerity , a habit that backfired on him when he got on the Star Trek set At an early shoot , he snapped at the rest of the cast We 're not here to have fun , we 're here to work He says now I came to think there was too much fooling around on set I was very aware of the clock ticking I was the oldest person on the set , and we were working until midnight or beyond , and it took more of a toll on me than on them The others also concluded he had a poverty mentality , another aspect of his austerity He was in denial about what he was being paid for playing Picard For 15 minutes' overtime , he earned an extra 125 , exactly what he had been making in a week at the Young Vic But he still lived above somebody 's garage After a year , he did buy a new car a Honda The rest of the cast were in Mercedes and Fer raris But the point was and this , I am sure , is why his Star Trek was easily the most successful iteration of the franchise that he took Picard seriously I'm very proud of the series I think we did really good work Every now and then we did absolute crap , but it was 178 episodes We really fought to keep the standards high the script , the language , the story lines , everything We also acquired an astonishing number of eminent fans several secretaries of state , chiefs of staff , chancellors of universities Frank Sinatra never missed Earth is released on November 16 www bryanappleyard com a show , and Tom Hanks knows the name of every episode Perhaps the key was that Stewart was such a team player He speaks warmly of the cast , and they are plainly still friends , especially Jonathan Frakes , who played Riker , Picard 's deputy , and whose shouting of Red alert ! gave me and my daughter hours of innocent delight He mentions proudly that Marina Sirtis , the pompous counsellor Deanna Troi , had lunch with him in London recently Best of all , he loves the movie Galaxy Quest , a sublime Star Trek spoof Jonathan told me to see it I said I did n't want to see the piss taken out of me by Alan Rickman and the rest He told me to see it in Santa Monica on a Saturday night I did , and it was perfect , fantastic , one of my all time favourites They got it exactly right that 's how it was , and the ending was right at the heart of the spirit of Star Trek He was missing theatre from the beginning And so , in his room above the garage , he constructed a series of one man shows that he took to universities and drama schools in California The best , A Christmas Carol , made it to Broad way The first few nights were full of Trekkies , many in uniform But now , he 's back His rich voice provides the narration for the movie Earth , made by the BBC Natural History Unit , a feature length version of Planet Earth And , best of all , he is immersed , for at least two years , in the theatre and Shakespeare This makes him very happy He revels in the ensemble and he wallows in the language When Macbeth starts , I have three hours to inhabit this role , this man who 's saying these amazing things It 's not just a great story , it 's mind expanding just getting your head round this imagery and this language It 's like a drug there 's nothing to match it And that third important thing , the countryside \? Well , he used to cycle up to the Dales as a boy Turning back to go home was a physical pain and the landscape infected him for life In Hollywood , he pined for English hills and valleys Now he has a house in the south Dales He reckons he could walk northeastward for three days from there and never see a road He has also learnt to love southern England He has just done up a house in Oxfordshire And he remembers a walk he took over the South Downs One evening that I did n't have a show , I had been rehearsing and I went home It was midsummer , so it was light , and I started walking I walked for hours and got to some high point looking down on this valley He sighs and his eyes are damp And smoke was coming up I was overwhelmed with feelings I could n't articulate Overwhelmed It moved me so much Great actor , good man As the Vulcans used to say , live long and prosper , Captain Picard sorry , Patrick Stewart I live in Ann Arbor , Michigan and it was a little over a year ago that I saw Patrick Stewart performing here with the Royal Shakespeare Company and I enjoyed the performances immensely What moved me most I think was the awareness that here 's someone who sets the example for one who has found a love in his own work that we should all strive to find in ours Chris Kaltwasser , Ann Arbor , Michigan USI was a pretty big Star Trek TNG fan when I was a kid Patrick Stewart is an amazing actor And kind of hot for an old bald dude \) I heard he 's a Beavis and Butthead fan That blows my mind And is awesome Sarah , Virginia , USAPatrick Stewart was also good in the original version of Dune Kerry Rose , Houston , TexasI 've seen a lot of Macbeths over the years of my professional career , and Mr Stewart 's made me hear the words as if newly written for him alone It was a magnificent , mindaltering performance And , to bow to my inner geek , to be in the same room with Picard was a thrill Long live Patrick Stewart ! Robert A Wright , Atlanta , Geogia , USAAround the early 80s I bump into Mr Stewart on a video of Derek Jacobi s Hamlet in a High School British Literature Class Needless to say , due to being in high school , I was not that consistently interested in it I think I sleep through half of it over a four day period of classes Then as an insatiable curious budding actor studying Shakespeare in an Illinois college library , I came across John Barton s Playing Shakespeare Video Series which introduced me again to Mr Stewart From then on I was hooked and keep track of what he was doing And now , in light of where he has taken his career in these last two years , I am inspired It serves as a model to be constantly evolving and challenging oneself in a life 's work Mr Stewart Thank You !
