The Latest News Entertainment Calling All Mothers Who Received An Epidural From 2010-2014 10/26/2016 321 Comments An government anesthesiologist came out and said during the years of 2010-2014, the federal government knowingly injected mothers with a vaccine mixed in an anesthetic shot known as an Epidural. What was that vaccine? Well according to Henry Rothschild, (no relation to the Rothschild family allegedly) the vaccine is known as Terminar.Terminar which is Spanish for terminate, according to Mr. Rothschild Terminar was design to break down African American/Black women ovaries exposing them to different germs and multiple diseases which will likely produce a child with serious birth defects and serious illnesses.The government ran a secret operation releasing the anesthetic to predominately black areas. They figure it was best to distribute it through an Epidural so it will go unnoticed. Mr. Rothschild child is asking both black and white women to find out what illnesses may run in your family. If you received an Epidural between 2010-2014 and later gave birth anywhere from 2011 until present, if your child was born with any illness that's not normal this may be the reason why.

The last two are twin girls and when I had them one of the twins have an extra thumb and sickle cell trait. But I had soooooo many complications when I had my last 3 bcuz of the epidural. Couldn't breathe, shaking, cold, couldn't feel anything from my waist down and serious back pains. So who do I talk too?

Taylor 10/31/2016 04:40:55 pm Kartoon, everything you described is what an epidural is supposed to do. If anyone believes this they are naive. Not true. MiMi 10/31/2016 06:48:54 pm Just a bit of information sickle cell trait is not acquired from any form of vaccine. Either you or your partner also carry the trait and it is genetically passed to our children like eye color, hair color etc. When we found out my daughter carries the trait her father and I got tested and we found out he is a carrier. Which means that if she later has children with a carrier they will have a 50% chance of having a child with full blown sickle cell. Rebecca 11/1/2016 12:49:40 am I had an epidural in 2011 when my son was born. Only this year 2016 i was trying for another baby aad had a mmiscarriag.

Karla 11/1/2016 11:07:28 am I had an epidural with all 3 of my kids my first kid was born in 2004 and every since I had the epidural in 2004 the middle part of my back has stayed numb and I had another one in 2011 when I had my daughter and then won again in 2006 when I had my middle age Shannon 11/1/2016 11:37:52 am I had my youngest son July of 2011. We were in and out of CHEO for almost 8 months because when doing his blood work, it came up he had insufficient enzymes showing up in his results. He later ended up with a hemmamgioma ( not sure of the spelling) and he was then put on this medicine which was new and was basically used as and guinea pig. The medicine they put him on was used for elder patients with heart conditions. Anyways, something was very wrong about this . He has been off this medicine for 3 years now but still has terrible issues with his body regulating his temperature. HE gets excessively hot in the summer and crazy cold in the winter. I'D like more information about where I go or who do I contact to dissect this more? Thanks in advance!SINCERELY,Shannon Schryburt Jennifer link 10/28/2016 08:52:31 pm I had an epideral with both of my last 2 daughters i had complications with both my 2nd daughter alexis was born with the cord wrapped around her neck and chest and some of her oxygen was comprimised she has a learning disability to this day and she was born in 2004 i was in labor for 31 hours thankgod shes ok to this day i said that when i had that epideral something wasnt right and i had a very prolonged labor my last and final daughter was born on oct 8 2010 emergency forceps delivery i felt very nausiated and i could not feel anything with my epideral i had is that normal and it took a while to wear off my back hurts to this day thank god shes ok but she also has a learning disabilty and some of her oxygen was cut off for a little while and she didnt cry at first and she had a little fluid in her but i hope this wasnt from the epideral my back still hurts especially when it rains is this normal? Reply Megan 10/28/2016 10:11:32 pm Yes, unfortunately back pain does happen after you have an epidural. I have had 3 2008, 2011, 2013, after my epidural I couldn't feel my legs for hours and I didn't even know I needed to pee due to my bladder being numb. But the nurses said that I had received 2 IV bags so I either had to go to the bathroom or use a bed pan. I had to have 2 nurses help me from the bed to the wheelchair and then on to the toilet and back again. Sadly from what you are saying the lack of oxygen was a result horrible but regular occurrences. I'm glad your babies were not seriously harmed during birth. Lauren 10/28/2016 10:24:04 pm My second daughter was born December of 2011 and she was born not breathing and also has been diagnosed with spd, she is delayed, and she is taking speech therapy!!! I have had her in therapy since she was one... She was taking occupational therapy, play therapy, and speech every week but she is now just taking OT and speech. I recently got her on a iep plan at school so she could get more help... But if this is true I want to know more about what state this was used in and who I need to talk to!!!! I am calling my doctor first thing Monday to look at my records!!! michelle 10/29/2016 08:50:14 am you all sound so uneducated. epidurals are SUPPOSED to numb you from the waist down - that's the whole point - so you don't feel any pain. It's common for women to have to get a catheter or wear a diaper for a few hours up to a day after having an epidural because they are still numb and can't tell when they have to pee. This is NORMAL. And yes, you will have some back pain, have you SEEN how big those shots are?! Do you think a huge needle going into your spine is supposed to make your back feel good? Educate yourselves. All of these things you're complaining about are normal. Anyone who works around women delivering babies or just has a common knowledge of how it works, would know that there is nothing abnormal about anything you've described. You just look stupid. anonymous 10/30/2016 11:10:38 am i have back problems from when i git an epidural in 2010 and in 2013. but my epidural in 2013 went wrong i ended up getting a blood patch a few weeks later Laci 10/31/2016 03:53:54 am Your daughter has a learning disability because her oxygen was deprived due to the cord being wrapped around her neck. How could an epidural cause that? It couldn't. It just happens. Christins 10/31/2016 06:00:10 pm To MichelleYour the one wwho looks stupid and like an idiot these things are not normal children being born with extra thumbs and persistent ongoing back pain they're not talking about just that day dumbass they're talking about STILL you need a edumacation ( education in case you think I can't spell) to learn how to differentiate sentences!!! Heather 11/1/2016 09:22:41 am Epidurals usually will slow down labor since once it's administered you can't get out of bed and are just laying there. Moving around and working through contractions is ideal since it doesn't stop labor. Her cord was probably wrapped around her for a while since the closer you are to your due date the less room a baby has to move around. I also have back pain from my first epidural in 2014 and can't sit straight up from bed or get up fast from sitting in the floor. Gwendolyn A. Jones 10/28/2016 10:23:12 pm I received several epidurals 2014 to present Reply Janay Williams 10/29/2016 10:39:27 am Well I had my child in 2012 with an epidural and he is 100% percent healthy and normal functioning and is now 4 and the top reader of his kindergarten class and has been reading since he was 3 I however will not be getting a epidural with my next child after being educated on all the things they put in this stuff they give but to each its own most of these problems I'm reading sounds like it's from the parents or just natural causes not an epidural Gwendolyn Wright 10/31/2016 08:38:27 am I had an epidural with all five of my children from 1992- 2012. All have no problems. My son that was born in 2007 has G6pD and this dissase is supposed to affect only males. I have the trait so why wasnt my other son who was born in 19992 affectsd. Amanda 10/31/2016 04:37:54 pm To Michelle maybe u should educate yourself before u make comments I had an epidural in 1998 with first son and yes couldn't feel anything for 24 hrs but my last epidural in 2005 I was numb but still could walk around shower do everything except feel the worst of the pain and you will find most of these women are talking about ongoing back issues because of epidural Barbara 10/31/2016 06:45:37 pm While a baby is in utero a lot of things are going on, so many things in fact, I am relived when I deliver a full term, healthy baby. It truly is a miracle. Unfortunately when babies are born with extra digits, cord around the neck,sickle cell or other unusual things, they have NOTHING to do with an epidural. They are congenital, traits or genes that parents have passed on, or things that happen while growing inside. The numbness is normal and back pain can last for years, unfortunately. Also having a to get a blood patch is uncommon, but does happen.

Id love to talk more about your child being one sided deafness though. Catch me at 603 583 8284 Che 10/30/2016 08:16:38 am It's 'staph' not staff. No there's no possibility it was injected into you. You'd be dead! Educated yourself. Lauren 10/30/2016 03:03:41 pm I am 30 and I was born with total deafness in my right ear. Mine was from a part of the inner ear not fully developing which may be the case in your situation, but you will not know until you go to a specialist. Mine was not noticed until I failed the hearing test in kindergarten, and then that's when I went. There is still no treatment though. Good luck with your child.

Educated is past tense Sbwilson 10/29/2016 01:31:32 am None of your points are really valid. Autism is a rare condition not a illness or disease it cannot be spread. And neither is lower back pain, neither is a cord being wrapped around the neck, not an illness, that is simply something that can happen during childbirth. Reply Lindsey Scott link 10/29/2016 04:44:15 am not sure if this may have anything at all to do with this, but my child was born in 2013, and to this day i have to hold my peepee forabout 3 hrs, then once i go to the bathroom i only pee a small amout.. never had this problem before or during my pregnancy... can it affect the mother as well, or is it only expected to affect the child????? Bettyb 10/29/2016 08:31:46 am Exactly!! Lana 10/29/2016 09:42:30 am SBWILSON you are spot on. So many people believe everything they read on the internet and it's ridiculous.

It is also NOT rare with current statistics showing 1:48 anonymous 10/30/2016 11:16:09 am i think this whole stiry is to just get ppl worked up over nothing. all the things these woman are saying is normal. kate 10/31/2016 01:46:23 am Autism can be genetic.so many stupid people know here. Dead set.Back pain will be experienced.You got a giant friggen needle into your spinal chord ffs.And twins dying, the smallest one sometimes dies. That's just what happens. The epidural hasn't caused any of this shit with your children.I had one and my daughter is advanced by about a year and healthy as anything!Yeh I get bad back pain but what can I expect... I had someone inject foreign fluid into my spinal chord through a thick needle.Of course you're gunna get back pain.Specially around the time each year that you had it.Mine plays up bad every September til early December.Stop believing this bullshit. Your children have not been injected with health problems. If anything, you'd be the sick one. Not them. Pmangum 10/31/2016 05:36:57 pm SBWILSON will the drug that was "put" in the epidural cause Burkitt lymphoma, acute lymphoblastic leukemia, sickle cell traits, seizures or miscarriages? Is there such a drug asTerminar or Terminor? Christina 10/29/2016 08:57:59 am It's crazy because I got the epidural in 2021,2013,2016 and when I had my twins in March my twin A which was my daughter passed away on April 24th 2016....

They said it was from the epidural my chest stayed heavy like I couldn't breath. After I had Liam when the epidural wore off I got really sick and had terrible pain where my kidneys were.

Autism was a listed side effect of some childhood vaccines and it's also part of the reimbursement program in the vaccine injury court.So many people are unaware of vaccine injuries and just how the natural immune system.Autism is not a genetic disorder. It does not run in the family. It can not be tested for.. Autism is a group of specific symptoms. Those symptoms are side effects of carcinogens.

I do believe that it exasperates the already existing disorder whether it's visable at the time or not. My son is severely Autistic. His labor was induced via pitocin bc he was 2 weeks late, & I did have an epidural.. Any # of factors could have come in to play in the severity of his diagnosis which was BEFORE the age of "2"..Over the years we've been able to weed out some environmental factors that make him act out more (gluten foods, artificial flavors & sugars, dairy, perfumes, dyes, etc) Autism in my opinion is genetic and environmental. One doesn't exist w/o the other. He is now 12. We still give him vaccines, but ONLY the necessary ones..-Brendens Mom- Shina 10/29/2016 09:08:06 pm Umm don't listen to the ppl who DONT have kids with autism saying vaccines don't cause it cuz it does and I'm so sick of these judgmental stuck up ppl saying we re dumb and we don't know ..YOU Blair and the rest of u can really go read a fkn book and ask Drs if they vaccinate heir kids or rich ppl cuz they don't or your dumb for not educating yourself on what you are making your kids ingest! Until I have a child w any type of thing they WASNT BORN with then u can come say something you have personally experienced for yourself! Go do research and tell me what? I know what it is and it's the govt that wants to dumb down our children over time and obvisously they got to one baby boomers who don't know their ass from their elbow ! Shut up and keep putting Mercury and aluminum into your kids cuz u think a diseases will kill them ..just sit and watch the Mercury eat away your child's brain and heir development ! Keep your dirty no good comments to yourself ! Ur a piece of dog shit and u should be hit with 4-6 needles and watch u suffer for years! Coward and a shot talker and I'm women No one knows better than a mother ! Not even a dr who gets paid thousand by the cdc and pharmasuits to make sure u vaccinate your kids (again do some research before u open ur trap) Rachel 10/30/2016 04:50:10 pm Omg really my son had melingitis as a baby so his vaccines were put back till he was over 2 we discovered he had autism at 18 months so explain how vaccines caused his autism go educate yourself properly before commenting on something you know nothing about anne voepel 10/28/2016 11:15:21 am Was your child vaccinated? Reply Pamela 10/29/2016 12:15:09 am My back pains are sever I had to get disability for it Gena 10/29/2016 08:22:43 am Calling people stupid, or referring to them as stupid, shows just as much ignorance on your part. Also, if YOU have vaccinated your children and you yourself are vaccinated, then you shouldn't be concerned about sicknesses that can come from nonvaccinated people. Isn't that the purpose of them?You may also want to pay attention to the Studies done on the Amish, who don't vaccinate and have very few cases of autism, 3 I believe, and 2 of those children were known to have been vaccinated. Try NOT to believe everything the government and Big Pharma tell you ;-) Lana 10/29/2016 09:34:45 am Gena- you clearly don't know how vaccinations work if you think that people who get vaccines can never get that illness. That's not how it works.It's not so simple as "if you don't get a vaccine, you're going to get that disease" or "if you do get a vaccine, you won't get that disease."It's a population thing. If everyone is vaccinated, then we WIPE OUT deathly diseases that used to kill people by the thousands, even millions.Why would you want your child to get Polio? Why would you want to make your child suffer and possibly even DIE from something that was virtually wiped out of the country until a few uneducated parents decided that "vaccines were bad"?I'm not name calling, but you are definitely the one that needs to be doing the research. Go get your degree as a doctor so you'll actually know how things work instead of believing some stupid conspiracy theories that the government and everyone is out to get you. Jen 10/29/2016 12:32:08 pm No, my son was not actually vaccinated for other reasons until he was 9 years old. So he did not get autism from vaccines. No epidural either sadly. Who is left to blame? Anyone saying there is no genetic component to autism should meet my son AND nephew. Both with autism. Renee 10/28/2016 12:21:52 pm OMG... Me too.. My daughter was diagnosed with Austin in July..

The 12 month mmr vaccine has been proven to cause autism Reply Niki 10/28/2016 10:03:06 pm My twins have been vaccinated since they were released from the hospital and nothing is wrong with them. It's helped keep them from getting sick unlike other children. I don't believe that vaccinations cause children to get diagnosed with autism. Id rather protect them then hurt them. Not vaccinating them can cause serous illness and lead to death. I don't want to lose my children because of children that are vaccinated. This real business. Which means your child won't be able to attend school because they aren't vaccinated which can lead to social issues. Do your research love! Amanda 10/28/2016 11:20:35 pm Niki, Did you just say that not attending school can lead to social issues? As in not attending a PUBLIC school can cause social issues? Are you saying homeschoolers are unsocialized? Yeah, I know... That's a lot of questions. Lana 10/29/2016 09:28:09 am Most of you sound so uneducated I feel sorry for you.Autism doesn't run in families... that's not how it works.

Reply Amber dace 10/28/2016 12:20:50 pm Do your own research autism can be caused in different ways some are born with it others develop it....before u bash people look into the issues.... There are countless studies that link vaccines too thousands of vaccine induced injuries...autism being one Reply Someone 10/28/2016 03:34:24 pm Those studies are mostly correlational I believe and that doesn't mean that vaccines cause autism. Correlational is not cause and effect. Also most of those studies are wack. A researcher recently got in trouble for it because he lied about it. It was all made up. Maybe you should know how to do research! People are ignorant! Can't believe everything you see on the internet. Was this study redone multiple times with the same output probably not. Was it peer reviewed probably not. It was probably just something you seen on Facebook that used big words and said the words vaccine and autism. Malina 10/28/2016 05:21:49 pm One cannot conduct an experiment where they're injuring or effecting ones life, like "giving" someone autism. It's only correlations.

I'm a specialist with developmental disabilities and autism. The "research" on autism and vaccinations has been disqualified. It's being over diagnosed.

I could walk but I could pick my legs up off the bed. And I was holding my own legs to my head to push. Both times the doctors thought it was weird that I could move my legs. You could pinch them and I felt nothing. But it was a pretty cool experience. My feet were so far to my head I could watch both my kids come out. Also I could feel their bodies, it didn't hurt. But I guess seeing it helped me feel it. It was weird but pretty cool at the same time. I am a very blessed mother.

My opinion, most of these do not even seem to have anything to do with an epidural. My son was born in 2012, I had an epidural, but my son is absolutely healthy with no complications during delivery. Things happen for a reason. I wouldn't personally blame it on the epidural as soon as you see something on the internet.

I don't know if this article is true or not. But if it's not true like you girls are saying why would ( I think it was Tabitha not for sure but I will scroll up and see) you say that the epidural affects the second child not the one you are delivering. If this story is false an epidural should not affect any deliveries. So the story maybe something to it or you are contradicting yourself. But epidural and spinal do cause back pain and headaches. That is the side affects from them, but you choose to have one so that is no ones fault. Like I said don't know if this is true or not but I wouldn't put anything passed the government to do something to the epidural's. They are evil and crooked.

My dr actually thinks it mite have been bc of the epidural injection.Some of u women that r commenting being rude what is being an adult about that?For all u mother's who children didn't make it my heart goes out to u. I recently on 10/28/16 had a miscarriage with what wud have been my 3 child. I'm still all to pieces. Reply Nicky 10/31/2016 03:50:16 am Just been reading through these comments and what I dont understand is how you all think that the epidural made your babies sick. They are fully developed when you get the needle so how do you think it caused heart defects or such when the organs and brain are mostly formed in the first trimester. It all sounds ridiculous to be honest. The epidural does cause numbness in the legs its supposed to thats the whole point and as for backache well its the strain of the pregnancy that weakens our backs more than the injection. The source of this article is not even verified. I dont believe a word of it. Pregnancy and labour is always risky & unfortunately sometimes things do go wrong but I wouldn't be blaming the epidural.
