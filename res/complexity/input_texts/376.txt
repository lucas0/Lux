Script Small Caps Defaults Done Melania Trump weighs in on immigration 00 59 An administration official briefing the media before the visit said most children at an HHS funded and regulated facility such as this one remain there for approximately 58 days , receiving medical , dental , vision and psychological care , as well as what the official described as the ability to be inside a safe and happy environment The official emphasized the predominant mission at this stage of the process , for unaccompanied children is to place them back with appropriate sponsors Those sponsors can be their parents , if the parents are not involved in the judicial or criminal process or they can be other approved family members already living inside the United States If neither of those options is possible , which is the case in about 10 of the unaccompanied children , they are placed with vetted foster families or volunteers All of this information was something the first lady wanted to learn in person , said Grisham , who told the media Trump informed her staff and her husband , President Donald Trump that she had decided she needed to see for herself the family intake and unaccompanied children facilities The facilities have dominated the news for days on end , causing heated political battles from the White House to Capitol Hill , ricocheting around the world in an uproar of disbelief and consternation A readout of the trip from the White House on Thursday night included this statement from the first lady Today 's visit impacted me greatly I was very impressed with the center and the hardworking staff and leadership there and thank them for all of their hard work The children were eager to learn and were kind and in good spirits Spending time with them reinforces the fact that these kids are in this situation as a direct result of adult actions It is my hope that Members of Congress will finally reach across the aisle and work together to solve this problem with common sense immigration reform that secures our borders and keeps families together How it came together 'I'm headed down to Texas , ' is what Grisham said the first lady told her husband , and he was supportive Grisham confirmed the trip would have taken place whether or not the President had signed an executive order on Wednesday intended to stop the separations This was 100 her idea , said Grisham of Trump 's decision to travel to McAllen , making clear the first lady is not on a mission assigned by the President nor is she acting as his emissary She wanted to come down The first lady intends to inform the President of what she sees She will continue to update her husband , said Grisham , confirming what was reported first Wednesday by CNN , that the first lady had been lobbying the President behind the scenes , encouraging him to stop the separation of children as swiftly as possible , either via legislative process or executive power The latter was ultimately the route the President chose , in a stunning reversal of his previous rhetoric As with many topics she will continue to give her husband her opinions , Grisham said Like most of the country , the first lady has been watching media reports about children taken from their parents and placed in holding facilities It is unclear what , exactly , Trump intends to accomplish from this visit to Texas , outside of seeing firsthand what is happening Since becoming first lady , Trump has said she wants to champion helping children , yet has been for the most part vague about how exactly she intends to accomplish her goal In May , Trump unveiled her Be Best platform , which outlined three predominant avenues of focus health and well being kindness and safety online , and highlighting the effects of the opioid crisis on children and families
