Regional data for Northern Ireland was not reported by health authorities. Circles are sized by the number of people there who have tested positive, which may differ from where they contracted the illness.\n\nHeres how the number of cases and deaths are growing in England, Scotland, Wales and Northern Ireland:\n\nReported cases by country and local area Cases Per 100,000 Deaths Per 100,000 + England 151,856 271 34,193 61 + Scotland 15,382 283 2,353 43 + Wales 13,913 443 1,331 42 Northern Ireland 4,709 260 522 29 Note: Detailed death data was not available for some areas.\n\nBritain has the highest number of Covid-19 deaths in Europe, surpassing Italy and Spain in early May. New cases in Britain continue to grow, but officials have expressed optimism that the rate of growth in cases and deaths is slowing. The nation continues to report around 4,000 new cases each day, the vast majority of which are in England.\n\nPrime Minister Boris Johnson has issued a conditional plan to ease Britain out of its seven-week lockdown. In a televised speech, he said those who cannot work from home may return to work, and that people can freely exercise and spend time outdoors. However, a mandatory quarantine on travelers who fly into the country was also put in place.\n\nBritain waited until March 23 to impose a national lockdown, later than other European countries, following a debate over how aggressively it should try to curb the spread of the virus. It also got a slow start in testing and contact tracing, with frontline doctors and nurses unable to get tested. As capacity increased, the British government extended testing eligibility to care home residents and staff, including those without symptoms. People over 65 and those who work outside the home with symptoms can also apply under new measures.\n\nBritains exit strategy hinges on low levels of infection throughout the country. A group of 100,000 randomly selected citizens will be asked to carry out at-home tests, providing data on how many people are infected and whether restrictions can be lifted. The British government will trial a new contact tracing app on the Isle of Wight, however concerns over potential privacy risks may discourage widespread use of the app.\n\nBritain will enforce local lockdowns to contain regional virus flare-ups after the country eases restrictions, and the National Health Service will begin use of remdesivir, an antiviral drug used to combat Ebola, that appears to improve coronavirus recovery time.\n\nHow Cases Are Growing\n\nOn April 29, the governments daily death toll included those who died of Covid-19 in hospitals as well as nursing homes for the first time, causing a large spike in the number of deaths reported that day. Heres how the number of new cases and deaths are changing over time:\n\nNew reported cases by day in the United Kingdom 0 2,000 4,000 6,000 8,000 cases Feb. March April May 7-day average New cases Note: The seven-day average is the average of a day and the previous six days of data.\n\nNew reported deaths by day in the United Kingdom 0 2,000 4,000 deaths Feb. March April May 7-day average New deaths Note: Scale for deaths chart is adjusted from cases chart to display trend.\n\nThe New York Times has found that official tallies in the United States and in more than a dozen other countries have undercounted deaths during the coronavirus outbreak because of limited testing availability.\n\nThe Office of National Statistics is also tracking Covid-related deaths in the country as confirmed on death certificates, but its figures are delayed around two weeks.\n\nWhere You Can Find More Information\n\nRead more about how a deadly outbreak in a Scottish nursing home gave rise to a scandal,\n\nthe British minority communities struggling to bury their dead, the Oxford laboratory racing to find a vaccine, the elusive scientific advisory group guiding the British government and how Britain paid $20 million for faulty coronavirus tests.\n\nHere is where you can find more detailed information:'
