Destroying America will be the culmination of my life s work George Soros In their twisted view , in order to create a New America , the old one must be destroyed and erased These are the veterans and decedents of the Radial Left from the 1960 s These are terrible ingredients a volatile mixture sitting dangerously close to open flames There are those who wish to do nothing more than to fan these flames In their twisted view , in order to create a New America , the old one must be destroyed and erased These are the veterans and decedents of the Radial Left from the 1960 s Others are merely useful idiots in this plot who have fallen victim to the visions of utopia of a completed society of equals in every way imaginable equal in squalor equal in misery Charles Kenny , Foreign Policy Magazine Defense cuts would allow the United States to tend to a few other priorities , which just might take Americans minds off the fact that their country is no longer No 1 Perhaps the United States could focus on constructing a high speed rail line or two , or maybe even finish the job on extending health care After all , of the large economies that enjoyed a AAA rating from Standard Poor s last week , the United States ranked at the bottom of the list in terms of life expectancy , and it was the only country without universal health care Perhaps America could also spend a little more on basic education the United States was at the tail end of the AAA club when it came to believing basic scientific truths like evolution , and it scored lowest out of all those countries on international tests of students math skills The rest are incompetent boobs with no direction , no solutions , and no sense of soul They are equally dangerous In over their heads nincompoops who think by defending the very programs and policies that promise to destroy our nation , they are being good stewards of government That is to say nothing of the run of the mill thieves and prostitutes who plunder our treasury for votes and comfortable seats in power There is an alternative to this , though We do have elections coming up Elections are the only legitimate and lawful actions that can be taken by which to change the direction of government But unless there is a wholesale change in the way our government performs , a chance to see a reversal is unlikely Elections should be , as they were always intended to be , the solidification of the will of the people the final seal of approval from a fully engaged public As I stated in the original post , we are the gatekeepers Gatekeepers are not passive They do not man turnstiles and collect tickets They control access and grant entrance into a sacred hall It is a rigid system based on predefined conditions , but it is a fair system For far too long , the gates have gone unmanned As a result , our society has been infiltrated and is being destroyed from the top down , inside out It s time to man the gates again Tell the Silent Majority they have been replaced by the Majority Come to Washington DC as I said Bring a couple million with you Email the strong and influential personalities and Tea Party groups that share your concern and have the ability to help Let s meet up in the National Mall and then take a stroll down Pennsylvania Avenue lock stepped together As I also stated , no crying is allowed Pick up after yourselves and tip generously While there , we ll give them our list of demands We ll direct them to our website They can read about our positions Learn about who we are We ll bring the next election to proper focus We won t rally to them They must rally to us Afterwards , we ll gladly go back to our homes and to our jobs until we are needed again If the Majority remains silent , America will pass with barely a whimper \( If you don t mind the sounds of rioting , that is \) The radical few and incompetents must be stopped Find comfort in the fact you will not be alone and we are not starting from scratch We ll even have entertainment from talented Patriots Go and check out James Kole Just as the anti war artists of the 60 s expressed their political views through music , so too are an increasing number of artists of the TEA Party movement who refuse to keep silent about the destruction of this great nation by many who ironically subscribed to those radical , anti government views of the 60 s counterculture movement From the comments pulled from the original post RickOden It has no choice , it IS an American Revolution FinbarOS A pre revolutionary moment , but with modern means and strategies pilgrim shadow We DO want to take our country back Meanwhile , our politicians are more than happy to sell us problems disguised as solutions chopper Yes no crying allowed This will not be a teary American Revolution !
