ABC needs to pull The View and Whooping Goldberg off the air IMMEDIATELY. Who of any sound mine would make this comment about anyone who has lost a spouse, let alone a military wife. You are sick!! I lost my husband in October, and he was the love of my life. I am not off crying in a corner of my house because that is not how I grieve. The grief journey is different for everyone. You could see the pain on this woman’s face and feel it through the TV. She is so new in the grief process she doesn’t know what to do or where to go. She just wants her partner in life back and wants to honor him, and maybe, just maybe, by honoring him there at the center of our democracy that he lost his life for, she will feel him next to her again. I think you said you do not even believe in God, Whoopi, and I do not think that even my God could see through your black heart. You are alone Whoopi. You have no husband, no girlfriend, are widely despised around the world, you have not done anything with your career except to sit and spin at The View helping spew hate. When I break down at the grocery store because I realize I do not need to buy my husband’s favorite cereal, I am not looking for attention, you bitch. That courageous woman put herself in the spotlight because it is honoring her husband, even though her profound grief was on display for the world to see. I will pray for you Whoopi, even though you probably will not care.
