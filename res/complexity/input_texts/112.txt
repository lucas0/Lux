Flashback Hillary Clinton 's Longtime Support for Sanctuary CitiesAP Photo Frank Franklin IIby Caroline May 8 Jul 2015 08 Jul , 20158 Jul , 2015While Democratic presidential candidate Hillary Clinton now says cities should comply with federal immigration requests , she has been a supporter of sanctuary city policies in the past In 2007 at a Democratic debate in New Hampshire Clinton expressed support for sanctuary city policies NBC'S Tim Russert Senator Clinton , would you allow the sanctuary cities to exist \? Clinton Well , in addition to the general points that have been made , that I agree with , why do they have sanctuary cities \? In large measure because if local law enforcement begins to act like immigration enforcement officers , what that means is that you will have people not reporting crimes You will have people hiding from the police And I think that is a real direct threat to the personal safety and security of all the citizens So this is a result of the failure of the federal government , and that 's where it needs to be fixed Russert But you would allow the sanctuary cities to disobey the federal law Clinton Well , I do n't think there is any choice The ICE groups go in and raid individuals , but if you 're a local police chief and you 're trying to solve a crime that you know people from the immigrant community have information about , they may not talk to you if they think you 're also going to be enforcing the immigration laws Local law enforcement has a different job than federal immigration enforcement The problem is the federal government has totally abdicated its responsibility During an interview with Bill O'Reilly in 2008 , highlighted this week by MRCTV , Clinton was equally on board with the idea of sanctuary policies O'Reilly Are you going to crack down on the sanctuary cities \? Clinton No , I'm not And I 'll tell you why O'Reilly Whoa Clinton I'm not , I'm not because the reason why a lot of those folks do it in New York , why do police officers turn a blind eye \? O'Reilly Because they want them to report crimes Clinton They want them to report crimes Because O'Reilly Does n't override Clinton the well , sometimes you have two competing values You want to report crime , you want to protect people and the violence spills way beyond whatever community In the wake of the murder of Kate Steinle at the hands of a multiple deportee , multiple felon Clinton is now saying cities should cooperate with federal officials CNN 's Brianna Keilar Last week , an undocumented immigrant who had been deported five times , killed a 32 year old woman , Kate Steinle , in San Francisco , a sanctuary city where local law enforcement does not enforce federal immigration laws When you last ran for President you supported sanctuary cities In light of this terrible incident , does that change anything about your view on this \? Clinton Well what should be done is any city should listen to the Department of Homeland Security , which as I understand it , urged them to deport this man again after he got out of prison another time Here 's a case where we 've deported , we 've deported , we 've deported , he ends back up in our country and I think the city made a mistake The city made a mistake not to deport someone that the federal government strongly felt should be deported So I have absolutely no support for a city that ignores the strong evidence that should be acted on However , there are , like if it were the first time traffic citation , if it were something minor , a misdemeanor , that 's entirely different This man had already been deported five times , and he should have been deported at the request of the federal government Read More Stories About Comment count on this article reflects comments made on Breitbart com and Facebook Visit Breitbart 's Facebook Page BREITBART CONNECT
