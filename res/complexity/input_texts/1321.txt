On my Facebook wall I posted more than two years back, that he is coming in UN as a Head after leaving White House. People can think and give remarks whatever, but I said truth in God's Spirit... and it is coming according to GOD's will, God have already planned in HIS times (We called 'Dispensation' or GOD's plan for the ages) for this world and human being as His creation to have fellowship.As I was taking Study from the Word of GOD about "End Times" 'Last days'. Yes! we are edge of the last days, Lord Yeshua is coming on air any time and His people "Ekklesia" [called and set apart] will be caught (Gk. Harpazo; Latin: Raptus; English: Rapture). As soon as 'Ekklesia" go up, the evil man from Satan (we calls - Anti-Christ) will come out (appear) from the world. He will be One World Leader, in One World Order (under UN). This is One World Leader will make false peace with Nation of Israel (God's chosen people), but actually he will be enemy of Israel with other nations, he will be against them, against GOD, he will call himself their GOD, and he will force them to worship him, if they will not do he will kill them.According to Zechariah 12:10, then Israel will repent and call LORD God and their Messiah, then surely then their Messiah will come as king of Kings and Lord of lords, and he will kill this anti-Christ and bind Satan for 1,000 years, and rule the world with His people. So far I still believe that this anti-Christ (son of evil) and the One Leader of the World will be none other than Obama. He still alive and demonic people still like him, Satan is preparing him for coming days, still it is not declared and not appeared because The HOLY SPIRIT & Ekklesia still on earth ( Read 2Thess. 2:6,7). All signs are appearing towards Barak Obama. Just watchful & pray to be ready for the coming of our LORD Yeshua... God's judgement is coming.
