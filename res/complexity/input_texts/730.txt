CNN has released new audio tonight in the Michael Brown case, and it reportedly confirms Darren Wilson shot at Brown 11 times—five from behind and six face-to-face. You can even hear a significant pause between the two strings of fire.This new audio also matches up with the statements made by Piaget Crenshaw and Tiffany Mitchell. And while it doesn't necessarily confirm everything they've said, it certainly adds to its credibility. Both women say they saw Brown and Wilson wrestling in the doorway of the police car before Brown ran away and was shot at from the back. Then, they say, Brown turned around with his arms up and was shot at once again.How much more information like this has to come out before we see charges pressed?Please enable Javascript to watch this video[via @ShaunKing​]
