The Force may be with us a little sooner than expected as the latest Star Wars: The Force Awakens buzz seems to indicate that the much-awaited sci-fi's release date may be advanced, presumably amid mounting clamor by impatient fans. While different sources suggest conflicting release dates, they all indicate a much earlier premier than the originally announced December 18.Rumor has it that director J.J. Abrams is getting fed up with the constant plot and image leaks, The Telegraph said quoting yet other industry sources. Disney has, for its part, started to go after those illegally releasing content from the film, when it asked a judge to subpoena a website that displayed a blurred image of what appeared to be a "Sith Lord" last week, the same report stated.There are apparently very real fears that the story may become public knowledge even before the movie actually hits theaters before yearend. So, advancing the release date may be the director's idea of averting a potentially costly, not to mention embarrassing catastrophe, by mounting a Death Star-level pre-emptive strike on spoilers!With a quick search of You Tube, fans can watch a one and a half minute "official trailer" supposedly released by Disney last November. This particular video clip begins with a helmetless Storm Trooper wandering about what could possibly be the desert of planet Tatooine. However, there could also be dozens of unofficial material floating about the Internet today!The big question, therefore, is exactly when will the Force Awaken? Speaking at the Visual Effects Society Awards 2015 recently, director Abrams was quoted as saying that he is pushing for a summer release date for Star Wars Episode 7, according to MoviePilot.If Abrams and Disney make good on a summer release, this would put the latest Star Wars flick head to head against other much-anticipated films such as Avengers 2: Age of Ultron, Ant Man and Jurassic World, the report added.
