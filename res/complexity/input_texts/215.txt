The fact that the source they cite in the article says this is fake news is likely why mainstream media is n't going to report it DeeBar 1 day agoI'm a retired commercial fisherman \( Alaska \) and I will not eat fish caught on the west coast You cannot pump this poison into the Pacific and believe this is n't going to effect the fish And how many years has this been going on \? Six years and how many billions of gallons of the nastiest crap on earth \? Pam 1 day agoAgain , check the article 's source material You may find that you are buying into click bait propaganda that not even overly dramatic activist 's are willing to support Mggie 1 day agoDo you mean to tell us that the radiation 's Not pouring into the Pacific it 's Not affecting the wildlife in the Pacific \? There 's no way you can say this is n't so smhPam 1 day agoNo I am telling you to look at their source , which is actually directly contradicting the content in the article Do n't be a blind sheep that begins bleating everything a news outlet will report without actually checking the facts they are providing SMH lenaz 1 day agoIt may be a fake source but Japan never could fix the radiation spill and their stuff from the tsunami reached our beach radiation has been pouring and one day the west coast will be evacuated Pam 1 day agoWhatever you say Chicken Little But according to real scientists , and even the activist this article tries using to justify its content with , they say the sky is n't falling Jan Casebolt 20 hours agoPam , please define a real scientist \? Science is by nature built on hypotheticals Science is in itself , imperfect and always debunking it 's self with a newer version of proven truth Ask yourself who would lose if the truth that radiation is affecting our ocean was openly reported There are scientific journal reports showing the radiation plume reaching the west coast of the US Common sense dictates that if radiation is present in the Pacific Ocean , the fish will contain it as well Pam 19 hours agoA real scientist comes to their conclusions with empirical or measurable evidence subject to specific principles of reasoning which is submitted for peer review So what exactly does fish being contaminated with radiation pouring so much that and one day the west coast will be evacuated \? Again , reading comprehension is critical Not once have you read where I said that the fish were not being affected I am simply stating this article is BS and even their source says it I am pointing out the danger in articles such as this And now even moreso the danger in the bleating of sheep who are running with the BS and adding to it , such as coastal evacuations , pouring of radiation in current tense , etc Cathy Farris 23 hours agoOf course they do We ca n't have panic , now can we \? Pam 21 hours agoSo your scientific , peer reviewed evidence that support your claims that the west coast will have to be evacuated is where \? Oh right , it has been held from the public to stop panic That has to be the ticket , because we never see alarmist scientists looking to make a name for themselves ever SMH Mitch Mandell 9 hours agoIf the sky is not falling Please tell me what is the truth , You can dispute this article as fake news but the reality is there was a Tsunami , there was a meltdown , there is radiation spilling into the pacific , the only thing you dispute is that it 's doing damage to the ocean \? Pam what are you saying about the spill \? Are you saying nuclear waste is safe \? Pam 6 hours agoWhy are you asking what I am saying when I have said it in the comments over and over \? I get from your comment that your reading comprehension is poor , but come on now you are just being stupid My contention is not with the danger of the meltdown , but rather the danger such fake news presents The reporter openly cites a source that says the article is fake , full of false information and represents statements that were not made He relies on his readers being too stupid to even look at the source he links to And apparently he is right , most of the people commenting did n't even bother Instead they shared and went on and on about something that people who will check the source laugh will laugh at and essentially make the whole topic dismissed as fake news Pam 19 hours agoMark Mayhem 19 hours agoShhh Do n't tell her Let her continue to make herself look stupid Jim Porter 21 hours agothat is some funny shit Hooch 21 hours agoJapan has given up building endless storage containers , now their answer is to just dump it in and let the ocean dilute it Patrick J Herbert 1 day agoQuestion the facts also Question everything Pam 1 day agoThe facts presented in the article were questioned The individual and website they cite as a source says the content in these articles are from old interviews and many things ascribed to individuals were simply not said Patrick J Herbert 1 day agoAh , I see what you are saying I completely misread you I apologize !
