Fish is a low fat , high protein food that has a range of health benefits However , given what we know of fish and its sources today , we may have to re examine this statement Fish can either be one of the best foods for you or detrimental to your health depending on where it 's sourced There is a world of difference between a fish that is caught in the wild vs farm bred or farm raised fish The most common farm raised fish are salmon , tilapia , catfish , swai , sea bass , and cod \( the last two surprise a lot of people \) Tilapia , in particular , became extremely popular in aquaculture and aquaponics across Asia , Mexico , Central America and the U S because it grows very quickly , is tolerant of stocking density and is adaptable So what 's wrong with that \? Well , it all depends on how the fresh or frozen tilapia filets were raised and where What are the exact dangers of eating farm raised fish \? 6 Reasons Tilapia Farming Is Dangerous to Your Health 1 Recent studies have found that farm raised tilapia may cause more inflammation Farm raised tilapia has always been a popular source for fish , not only because it 's widely available in the U S , but it 's also very inexpensive \( 1 \) However , before you stock up on tilapia , you may want to know about its correlation to inflammation Recent studies have shown that eating tilapia may worsen inflammation , which can lead to heart disease , arthritis , asthma and a world of other serious health problems People who resort to eating more fish as a way to get their dose of omega 3 fatty acids and lessen their risk of heart attacks may want to hold off on the tilapia In fact , a scientist from Wake Forest University has found that the inflammatory potential of tilapia is far greater than that of a hamburger or pork bacon , and therefore make it a fish you should n't eat \( 2 \) 2 Farmed salmon may have at least 10 times the amount of cancer causing organic pollutants compared to the wild variety This can most likely be attributed to the feeds that are used on farm raised fish If you knew what went into the feeds of farm raised fish , you would be horrified Apparently , chicken feces is one of the main ingredients that go into farm fish feed Not only that , the transfer of pig and duck waste to fish farms is also a very common practice , such as with Chinese tilapia 3 Farm bred fish have been found to have high concentrations of antibiotics and pesticides Where do farm bred fish get their antibiotics \? The crowded conditions of fish farms cause the fish to be more susceptible to disease To keep them alive , farm owners give antibiotics to the fish to stave off disease similar to what occurs in confined feedlot operations for cattle \( 3 \) Farm bred fish , such as Chinese tilapia , are also treated with pesticides to combat sea lice The pesticides used to treat these fish are so deadly that they will kill wild salmon that are accidentally exposed to them These pesticides are also eventually released in the ocean , where they get into the bodies and systems of other marine life 4 Farm bred fish also have lower levels of healthy nutrients Many of us consume fish , hoping to reap the omega 3 fatty acid benefits that come with it However , did you know that the omega 3 acids that are found in farm raised fish are less usable in our bodies compared to wild bred fish \? Farm raised fish also has a lower protein content Not only that , because farm raised fish are kept in cages , they have the tendency to be fattier , and can have a higher concentration of omega 6 acids The problem with getting too many omega 3 and omega 6 acids is that they , again , may cause inflammation to the body 5 Dibutylin levels , a chemical used in PVC plastics , is said to be six times higher in farm raised mussels compared to wild ones Dibutylin is toxic and can impair immune system function while also contributing to inflammation Dibutylin may be the reason as to why there is a rise in asthma , obesity , allergies and other metabolic disorders in recent years \( 4 , 5 \) 6 Dioxin levels are 11 times higher in farm bred salmon compared to wild salmon According to the Environmental Working Group , the first ever tests of farmed salmon from U S grocery stores show that farmed salmon are likely the most dioxin like PCB contaminated protein source in the U S food supply \( 6 \) Dioxin is actually a very toxic chemical that can contribute to cancer and other complications The problem with dioxin is that once it enters our system , it can take a very long time until it leaves Grimly , the half life of dioxin is about 7 to 11 years ! 7 Excessive mercury levels among even lake grown fish and especially dangerous for pregnant women In a study by Dr J K McCrary published in the Environmental Pollution journal , total mercury concentrations in the water and fish of Lake Managua and Lake Apoyo were measured A considerable one fourth of the commercially fished tilapia in Lake Managua exceeded maximum recommended mercury levels for consumption among pregnant women and other at risk groups \( 7 \) As a result , the study recommended much closer mercury monitoring among freshwater fish that is meant for international commerce These are only some of the dangers that have been linked back to eating farm raised fish What does this tell us \? No 1 , we need to find out where our fish is coming from Not all fish are created equal , and sad to say , farm raised fish , instead of helping us , may even harm us History of Tilapia , Tilapia Facts Types of Tilapia The common name for nearly a 100 species of cichlid fish , it comes from three distinct genera Oreochromis , Sarotherodon and Tilapia Mainly a freshwater fish , tilapia live in shallow streams , ponds , rivers and lakes and adapt well to being farmed Historically , tilapia became popular in so called artisanal fishing in Africa and soon became popular in aquaculture and aquaponics outside of Africa Because North African tilapia grow quickly , are tolerant of stocking density and are adaptable In modern aquaculture , the wild type Nile tilapia \( the healthiest variety \) are not too often seen , because the dark color of their flesh is considered undesirable by many customers Tilapia are farmed extensively in many parts of Asia and the U S They are increasingly found in outdoor fish farms in tropical countries like as China , Papua New Guinea , the Philippines and Indonesia In temperate zone climates , such as in U S , tilapia farming operations need energy in order to warm the water to tropical temperatures \( 8 \) The largest tilapia producers in the world are China , then Egypt \( ! \) Currently , it 's the fourth most consumed fish in the U S Going way back , the aquaculture using Nile tilapia began in Ancient Egypt In fact , tilapia is considered one of the three main types of fish caught from the Sea of Galilee during Biblical times Today , the three most commonly fished and eaten species of tilapia are Nile , Blue and Mozambique Oreochromis niloticus , or Nile Tilapia , are the oldest variety of tilapia Nile Tilapia is one of the most adaptable fish , as it can be raised in various ways , such as ponds and in pristine lakes and can be one of the most sustainable farmed fish The best fresh tilapia eaten in the U S is all natural \( not using chemicals or antibiotics \) and lake grown Most lake grown tilapia actually comes from Honduras or Mexico \( 9 \) Therefore , if you ever do eat tilapia , make sure you ask were it was raised Seafood Watch recommends to buy tilapia \( izumidai in sushi \) farmed worldwide in recirculating aquaculture systems , Ecuador in ponds and Peru in raceways \( 10 \) Blue Tilapia is found in Florida 's lakes , rivers and streams and it can live both in saltwater and freshwater Because it does n't grow as quickly as Nile Tilapia , it 's not as commonly farmed Meanwhile , Mozambique Tilapia was introduced into the U S for sport fishing and as a means of aquatic plant control Farmed Shrimp the Dirtiest of All Seafood There are a lot of shrimp nutrition facts , but shrimp actually holds the designation of being the dirtiest of all seafood , says Marianne Cufone , director of Food and Water Watch She says it 's hard to avoid , as 90 percent of shrimp sold in the U S is imported \( 11 \) Imported farmed shrimp comes with a whole bevy of contaminants antibiotics , residues from chemicals used to clean pens , filth like mouse hair , rat hair , and pieces of insects , Cufone says And I did n't even mention things like E coli that have been detected in imported shrimp Part of this has to do with the fact that less than 2 percent of ALL imported seafood \( shrimp , crab , catfish or others \) gets inspected before its sold , which is why it 's that much more important to buy domestic seafood What to Eat Instead of Tilapia Recipes Fish can be an incredible health building food if you go with wild caught fish liked sockeye salmon , which has proven health benefits It 's loaded with healthy fats and can help your brain , joints , muscles and skin ! But rather than buying cheap , frozen tilapia filets , a better option that is both inexpensive and easy to make is a homemade salmon patties recipe that is high in omega 3 fats and protein Plus , salmon contains astaxanthin , which has been proven to be more powerful than almost any other antioxidant at absorbing free radicals If you are not consuming salmon or another wild caught fish during the week , then I highly recommend you consume a benefit rich fish oil supplement with astaxanthin When I eat out , I also ask my server if the fish is farm raised or wild caught Most servers know this answer or can quickly go ask the head chef As a quick rule of thumb for salmon , if it 's Pacific or Alaskan , it 's most likely wild caught if it 's Atlantic salmon , it 's almost always farm raised Read Next 17 Fish You Should Never Eat From the sound of it , you might think leaky gut only affects the digestive system , but in reality it can affect more Because Leaky Gut is so common , and such an enigma , I'm offering a free webinar on all things leaky gut Click here to learn more about the webinar
