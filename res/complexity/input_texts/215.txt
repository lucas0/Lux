After allowing factories and construction sites to reopen and eateries and bars to offer takeout in early May, on Monday, restaurants, bars, hairdressers and beauticians were given a green light  as long as they observed social distancing and strict hygiene protocols. Shops could also open their doors, though the many shuttered doors and For Rent signs on storefronts throughout Italy show the fallout of months of inactivity.\n\nAs of Monday, religious celebrations were also allowed, as long as the faithful remained apart. Some dioceses held masses shortly after midnight to celebrate. Italian Prime Minister Giuseppe Conte said Italy was facing a calculated risk, by loosening the lockdown, citing recent data suggesting that infection rates remained low, even after Italians picked up their pace. But the government was aware that the epidemiological curve could go back up.\n\nFor now, Italians can only freely travel within their own region. But in the next phase of reopening, which begins June 3, Italians will be able to move between regions and abroad, barring another outbreak.\n\nHow Cases Are Growing\n\nHeres how the number of new cases and deaths are changing over time:\n\nNew reported cases by day in Italy 0 2,000 4,000 6,000 cases Feb. March April May 7-day average New cases Note: The seven-day average is the average of a day and the previous six days of data.\n\nNew reported deaths by day in Italy 0 500 deaths Feb. March April May 7-day average New deaths Note: Scale for deaths chart is adjusted from cases chart to display trend.\n\nThe New York Times has found that official tallies in the United States and in more than a dozen other countries have undercounted deaths during the coronavirus outbreak because of limited testing availability.\n\nDaily data at the regional and provincial level is provided by the Italian Department of Civil Protection in Italian and English. The data includes the number of confirmed cases, deaths, recoveries, hospitalized patients and the number of people in intensive care. The data on the number of swabs undertaken each day reflects the number of tests performed, and the Civil Protection has recently started providing the number of people tested as well.\n\nThe head of Italys Civil Protection agency estimated that the number of cases could be as much as ten times higher than the current figure. A new study by Italys national statistics agency strongly suggests that many more Italians may have died from the coronavirus than the official numbers indicate.\n\nWhere You Can Find More Information\n\nRead more about the toll the virus has taken on Italian families, the healthcare system, the poorer south, and some particularly vulnerable populations such as priests and nuns, supermarket clerks and the homeless.
