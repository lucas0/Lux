CANADA’S Prime Minister has said he “will not be intimidated” after a terrorist today killed a ceremonial guard before being shot down in the halls of Parliament.Terror struck at the heart of Canada earlier today when a gunman shot dead a 24-year-old reservist soldier at the national war memorial in Ottawa, before running to the nearby Parliament building where he was shot dead.Mr Harper said the shootings today and earlier this week in Quebec showed that “Canada is not immune to terrorist attacks”.While much of Ottawa was in lockdown yesterday amid reports of shots from the roof of Parliament and at a nearby mall, police concede now that there was only one gunman.Ottawa police Constable Marc Soucy confirmed to AP that police are satisfied there was one attacker, while Ottawa police Chief Charles Bordeleau told the Canadian Broadcasting Corp. that “there is no longer a threat to public safety.”‘I CRY FOR THE VICTIMS, NOT FOR MY SON’‘I ASKED HANDSOME GUARD FOR A PHOTO’The lone gunman — who has been named as Michael Zehaf-Bibeau — is said to have calmly walked up to Corporal Nathan Cirillo, pulled out a rifle and shot him in the stomach “multiple times” at point blank range.He then reportedly raised his arms in triumph before fleeing the scene.BREAKING | This is a photo of Michael Zehaf-Bibeau, gunman in this morning's shootings in Ottawa. #cbcOTT #OTTnews pic.twitter.com/OLSxlYPelj — CBC Ottawa (@CBCOttawa) October 22, 2014Zehaf-Bibeau, a recent convert to Islam, reportedly was already on a Canadian terror-watch list as a “high risk” suspect and had his passport revoked in order to prevent him travelling to Syria to join the Islamic State.After shooting dead Corporal Cirillo, the gunman then headed to the nearby Parliament buildings.He burst into the vaulted entrance hall of Canada’s Parliament house and opened fire before he was shot dead by the Parliament’s Sergeant-at-Arms Kevin Vickers.Vickers has a ceremonial role but is also a former policeman.As Canada reeled from the attack, Mr Harper said he had every confidence that Canadians would band together.He added: “In days to come, we will learn more about the terrorist and any accomplices. We will redouble our efforts to fight against terrorist organisations around the world. They will have no safe haven.ABBOTT OFFERS CONDOLENCESIn a statement to Parliament this afternoon, Prime Minister Tony Abbott said Australia stood “shoulder to shoulder with our Canadian comrades”.“We are both multicultural federations with British institutions. They speak our language and they share our heritage and our danger.More than 100 Canadians are believed to be fighting with the Islamic State and other terrorist groups in the Middle East, he said.“Today more than ever Australians and Canadians are family.“We feel Canada’s shock, pain and anger.”Mr Abbott said he had visited Canberra’s Parliament and war memorial.“I regard Stephen Harper, their Prime Minister as a friend and almost a brother.“So an attack on their Parliament is an affront to this Parliament too.”Both Mr Abbott and Opposition Leader Bill Shorten recognised the country’s High Commissioner who was present in the Parliament.HOW THE ATTACK UNFOLDEDThe incident comes just one day after 25-year-old Martin Couture-Rouleau ran over a Canadian soldier, killing him before being shot dead by police as he emerged from his wrecked car wielding a knife.'Remember how one person's life has been taken — from his family, from his friends ...' http://t.co/VJGGz4xTCj pic.twitter.com/Zn5MdyP72B — CBC Toronto (@CBCToronto) October 23, 2014The Parliament building in Ottawa today immediately went into lockdown and the city was on terror alert amid the confusion, with fears of as many as three gunmen being on the loose.Terrified MPs used chairs to barricade themselves inside the office within the building amid the chaos.Jan Luchtenburg, a tourist, told TV news station CBC he witnessed today’s shooting.“We were waiting there for a city tour and suddenly I heard four shots.“Suddenly I saw a small guy with long black hair... with a long rifle, and he ran away after the shots, across streets in the direction of Parliament Hill.”Shooting suspect Zehaf-Bibeau had recently converted to Islam and his passport had been revoked, it was reported. He is also understood to have had a criminal record involving drugs and robbery.Zehaf-Bibeau was raised in Laval, a town just north of Montreal.

They have since been discharged.Corporal Nathan Cirillo died while undergoing emergency surgery.While Corporal Cirillo and his companion were carrying rifles, guards are not issued ammunition while on ceremonial duties.

One was carrying a rifle, and opened fire towards the Ceremonial Guard in front of the Monument of the Unknown Soldier.Passers-by told reporters that a bearded man had gunned down the soldier and hijacked a passing vehicle to take him the short distance to Parliament Hill, on a bluff over the Ottawa River.Tony Zobl, 35, said he witnessed the soldier being gunned down from his fourth-floor window directly above the War Memorial, a 21-metre, arched granite cenotaph, or tomb, with bronze sculptures commemorating World War I.Surreal to be locked down in my hotel while SWAT teams hunt gunmen in Parliament across the St. pic.twitter.com/vdzAM5bMem — Penny Campbell (@pennyc) October 22, 2014“I looked out the window and saw a shooter, a man dressed all in black with a kerchief over his nose and mouth and something over his head as well, holding a rifle and shooting an honour guard in front of the cenotaph point-blank, twice,” Mr Zobl told the Canadian Press news agency.“The honour guard dropped to the ground, and the shooter kind of raised his arms in triumph holding the rifle.”Man getting CPR at war memorial on Parliament Hill - reportedly shot #cdnpoli #breaking pic.twitter.com/6xFfYPQkMZ — Laura Stone (@l_stone) October 22, 2014Witnesses said the gunman then entered Parliament, a few hundred yards away, where dozens of shots soon rang out.One witness, parliamentary aide Marc-Andre Viau, said he saw a man run into a caucus meeting at the Parliament, chased by police armed with rifles who yelled “take cover.” That was followed by “10, 15, maybe 20 shots,” possibly from an automatic weapon, he said.“I’m shaken,” said Mr Viau.CBC had video of the gunman going to his car alone with his weapon after the shooting at the memorial.

The killer had been on the radar of federal investigators, who feared he had jihadist ambitions and seized his passport when he tried to travel to Turkey.The incident happened in Saint-Jean-sur-Richelieu, 40 kilometres southeast of Montreal.Canada had raised its domestic terror threat level from low to medium on Tuesday because of what it called “an increase in general chatter from radical Islamist organisations.”“Canada will not be terrorised or intimidated,” senior cabinet minister Jason Kenney declared on Twitter.In a statement released on Tuesday Jason Tamming, a spokesman for Minister of Public Safety Steven Blaney, said the decision to raise the level was linked to an increase in “general chatter” from radical Islamist organisations like Islamic State, al-Qaeda, the extremist group al-Shabaab and others who pose a threat to Canadians.
