Restaurants, bars, shops and hairdressers reopened in May, and gyms, museums, spas and most gathering places were given a green light in June  as long as they observe social distancing rules and strict hygiene protocols.\n\nThe government also allowed theaters and cinemas to reopen, provided they keep people one meter apart and limit audiences to 200 indoors and 1,000 outdoors. Religious celebrations have been reinstated, as long as the faithful remain socially distant. Masks are compulsory across the country in all public indoor spaces.\n\nPrime Minister Giuseppe Conte said Italy was facing a calculated risk by loosening the lockdown, citing recent data suggesting that infection rates remained low even after Italians began to ease out of lockdown. But the government was aware that the epidemiological curve could go back up  as it has in Belgium and Spain.\n\nOn June 3, the Italian government dropped travel restrictions to and from European Union member states, Schengen area countries and the United Kingdom. As of July 1, travelers from Australia, Canada, New Zealand and nine other countries are now permitted. Visitors from 16 other countries, including Bangladesh, Brazil and Serbia, cannot enter the country until July 31.\n\nHow Cases Are Growing\n\nHeres how the number of new cases and deaths are changing over time:\n\nNew reported cases by day in Italy 0 2,000 4,000 6,000 cases Feb.

Read more here Note: Scale for deaths chart is adjusted from cases chart to display trend.\n\nThe New York Times has found that official tallies in the United States and in more than a dozen other countries have undercounted deaths during the coronavirus outbreak because of limited testing availability.\n\nDaily data at the regional and provincial level is provided by the Italian Department of Civil Protection in Italian and English. The data includes the number of confirmed cases, deaths, recoveries, hospitalized patients and the number of people in intensive care. The data on the number of swabs undertaken each day reflects the number of tests performed, and the Civil Protection has recently started providing the number of people tested as well.\n\nThe head of Italys Civil Protection agency estimated that the number of cases could be as much as ten times higher than the current figure. A new study by Italys national statistics agency strongly suggests that many more Italians may have died from the coronavirus than the official numbers indicate.\n\nWhere You Can Find More Information\n\nRead more about the toll the virus has taken on Italian families, the healthcare system, the poorer south, and some particularly vulnerable populations such as priests and nuns, supermarket clerks and the homeless. Italy, the unfortunate vanguard of Western democracies grappling with the virus, is now weighing different options on how to reopen the country, and having the right antibodies might play a role in determining who gets to work and who does not.\n\nAnd as the country gets ready for a partial reopening on May 4, in the hardest-hit areas, Italians are looking to hold someone accountable.\n\nHere is where you can find more detailed information in Italian:'
