Boston Marathon Bomber Tsarnaev Severely Injured In Prison , May Never Walk Or Talk AgainPosted on Like 0FORT DEVENS , Massachusetts Infamous Boston Marathon bombing suspect Dzhokhar Tsarnaev , 22 , was the victim of an unfortunate accident yesterday at Ft Devens Detention Center in Massachusetts , just a few short months after his high profile trial and sentencing , according to warden Paul Jacobson Corrections officers reportedly found the terror suspect face down in a pool of his own blood in his cell a banana peel was found on the floor nearby It initially appeared as though Tsarnaev slipped on a discarded banana peel and hit the floor with such force that his head bounced off the hard tile surface , probably 16 or 17 times There was blood everywhere all over the walls , the floor , even the toilet The injuries have caused massive brain trauma , said prison investigator Joe Goldsmith We determined though , through expert analysis , that it would be impossible for these injuries to have occurred through a fall Our investigation has shown that that it was the Aryan Brotherhood who initiated an attack on Tsarnaev Yes , it was the brotherhood who took care of that bomber , said Miles Smith , head of the Aryan Nation inside Devens The other gangs , they wanted him , too We paid the guards the most money to have a shot They stood aside , and let us do what we do On the way out , they shook our hands , told us Thank you ' Well , You 're welcome You 're welcome , Boston You 're welcome , America ! Normally , an attack this violent , this cruel , on another inmate would get any offending party more time added to their sentence , said warden Jacobson Because of the nature of Tsarnaev 's crimes , though , we have decided to actually reduce the sentences of the Aryan members who were involved They have done our prison and our country a great service , and we appreciate it immensely They are heroes in the eyes of not only this institution , but also in the eyes of the people of the Commonwealth of Massachusetts Tsarnaev had pled not guilty to all thirty charges filed against him , but was found guilty on all counts in April He was sentenced to the death penalty per the crimes committed
