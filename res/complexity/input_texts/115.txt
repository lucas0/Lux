ago 10According to reports from World Net Daily , a New Jersey township that was sued by a group of Muslims for refusing to approve a massive mosque project is now returning to court because of a settlement agreement that restricts anyone from commenting on Islam or Muslims It 's important to note that a key tenet of Shariah bans any negative comments about the religion According to the Thomas More Law Center who sued the township on behalf of two residents whose home is within 200 feet of the proposed mega mosque , the settlement reads more like an instrument of surrender The Islamic Society of Basking Ridge won a decision in federal court after its mosque proposal was rejected based on traffic and other concerns The Township agreed on a 3 5 million payment and a public hearing to approve the settlement Residents Christopher and Loretta Quick challenged the agreement , arguing it restricts speech and violates the Establishment Clause The Quicks reside within 200 feet of the proposed mosque construction in a zoned residential area , Thomas More explained Yet , the settlement agreement prohibits them from describing the many unique features of Islamic worship which will impact the design of the building , traffic density , water and sewage , traffic control problems , road construction , and parking arrangements According to the settlement agreement , ISBR is permitted to make statements concerning Christians and Jews and their places of worship , but in contrast , the agreement prohibits commentary relating to Islam or Muslims In fact , ISBR has previously discussed the Christian and Jewish religions and their places of worship Richard Thompson , chief counsel for Thomas More , said the Islamic center has taken the extraordinary step of concealing significant links on their website to a radical group named by the federal government as an unindicted co conspirator in the largest terrorism financing trial in America history , the Islamic Society of North America \( ISNA' \) Thompson said that while claiming that the township had a religious animus against Muslims , ISBR hid from the public view its animus toward Christians and Jews , by not only hiding anti Christian and anti Semitic verses published on its website but also hiding its significant ties to ISNA Instead of standing up to defend its citizens against ISBR 's hate filled anti Semitic and anti Christian bias , the township colluded with ISBR 's Civilization Jihad' by capitulating to payment of millions of dollars to ISBR , allowing the construction of the new mosque and Islamic center in violation ISBR is setting a dangerous unconstitutional precedent by abusing a court process to chill and trample on the First Amendment rights of private citizens whose only involvement was to speak out against the mosque at public hearings , Thompson said earlier this year He asked for the subpoenas to be thrown out because the U S Supreme Court has held that speech at a public place on a matter of public concern is entitled to special protection 0
