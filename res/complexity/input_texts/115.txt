Playing Christmas Music Before Thanksgiving Now A Federal CrimeNovember 7 , 2017Tweet on Twitter U S It 's easy to focus on everything going wrong with our country , so much so that we often do n't stop to take a minute and be thankful for the good things our leaders accomplish from time to time Take the most recent legislation passed by Congress , for instance as of Tuesday , it is now a federal crime to play Christmas music before Thanksgiving Any storefront , home , or radio station playing songs like Baby It 's Cold Outside , Rockin Around the Christmas Tree , or Last Christmas is subject to immediate search by federal authorities , who have been instructed to arrest the perpetrator onsite and bring him or her to a secret CIA facility for questioning Upon conviction , the suspect is subject to up to 20 years in federal prison The move passed the House with a historic unanimous vote of 435 0 , skated through the Senate with another unprecedented vote of 100 0 , and finally was signed into law in the very same day by President Trump At long last , we can all unite around our hatred for being forced to listen to sappy Christmas standards months before December 25 , a Congressional representative said While we may all disagree on just about every other social issue of our day , at least we can come together on this It 's great that our country can finally agree on something during these tumultuous times !
