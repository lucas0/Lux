b'MANCHESTER, N.H.  Former Vice President Joseph R. Biden Jr. is shaking up his campaign leadership just days ahead of the New Hampshire primary, an acknowledgment that his bid for the Democratic presidential nomination is in major trouble after a disastrous fourth-place finish in the Iowa caucuses.\n\nMr. Biden is giving effective control of the campaign to Anita Dunn, a veteran Democratic operative and top adviser to him.\n\nShe will be working closely with us on campaign strategy and overall coordination on budget and personnel as we build a bigger campaign for the next phase, according to a campaign email obtained by The New York Times.\n\nBut two senior Biden officials said Ms. Dunn is doing more than that  and that she will have final decision-making authority, a decision that came at the behest of the former vice-president. The Biden advisers spoke on the condition of anonymity to discuss internal planning.'
