Secret US Mission To Iran By Sorcha Faal , and as reported to her Western Subscribers A new Foreign Military Intelligence \( GRU \) report circulating in the Kremlin today is saying that United States Secretary of State Hillary Clinton photo 2nd left was injured , and a top US Navy Seal Commander killed when their C 12 Huron military passenger and transport aircraft crash landed nearly 3 weeks ago in the Iranian city of Ahvaz near the Iraqi border Iranian intelligence agents quoted in this GRU report confirm that the C 12 Huron aircraft is still in their possession in Ahvaz , but will only admit that the plane was forced to land because of technical problems The US Navy Seal member reported killed in this bizarre incident , this report says , was indentified as Commander Job W Price photo 3rd left who as a leader of this highly specialized American Special Forces unit protects high ranking diplomats traveling in Middle Eastern and Asian combat zones Curiously , US media reports on Commander Price s death say it being investigated as a possible suicide as he died from what the American Defense Department describes as a non combat related injury Equally as curious , US media reports state that Secretary Clinton will return to work next week after her having suffered what they describe as a nasty bout with stomach flu and a concussion which have kept her missing from public view the past three weeks This GRU report , however , states that US military flight logs recorded by Russian air and space forces confirm that Commander Price , and other members of US Navy Seal Team 4 , left their base in Urozgan Province , Afghanistan on a flight to US Naval Support Activity Bahrain where they met up with Secretary Clinton and all of them transferred to the C 12 Huron that began a flight path to Baghdad , Iraq Within minutes of leaving Bahrain airspace , this report says , the C 12 Huron carrying Secretary Clinton and her US Navy Seal protectors , without notice , deviated from their assigned flight path heading , instead , directly towards Iran s Ahwaz International Airport where , coincidentally , Iranian President Mahmoud Ahmadinejad had previously landed on an unscheduled visit Important to note , GRU analysts say in this report , was that when the C 12 Huron entered into Iranian airspace neither American nor Iran air force units responded clearly indicating that this secret mission was sanctioned Upon the C 12 Huron landing at Ahwaz , however , this report says it encountered extreme turbulence causing it to leave the runway where its main landing gear then collapsed causing it to crash Within seconds of the C 12 Huron crashing , this report continues , Iranian emergency and security personal responded freeing the victims , including Secretary Clinton who was reportedly unconscious and bleeding profusely After emergency aid was given , GRU agents stationed in Iran state that another US military flight was dispatched from Bahrain to Ahwaz which evacuated all of those wounded and killed in the crash including Secretary Clinton Strangely to note , this report says , is that in the aftermath of this crash , Iran s main oil company announced today that they were buying the Ahwaz airport with the intention of moving it because , they say , oil was discovered beneath it To what the Americans mission to Iran was about this report doesn t speculate upon , other than to note that with the Gulf State Monarchies rapidly approaching a union of their oil rich nations to counter Iranian power , and with President Obama signing a new law this past week to strengthen American borders against threats from Iran , and with the highly publicized Velayat 91 Iranian military exercises now taking place across a wide area from the Strait of Hormuz , a new and catastrophic war in this region is much closer to being a reality than many realize To if Secretary Clinton s mission was meant to forestall such a war it is not in our knowing , other than to note , that with the United States continued backing of some of the cruelest dictatorships in the world , our entire planet is but one spark away from a fire that could very well consume us all December 30 , 2012 EU and US all rights reserved Permission to use this report in its entirety is granted under the condition it is linked back to its original source at
