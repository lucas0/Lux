b'Ms. Stimson said the company had to replace only 20 components for about 30,000 machines. Thats a very low number for a statewide voting system rollout across 159 counties, she said.\n\nMany of the problems, she said, involved difficulties activating voter verification cards  which are inserted into the machines to start voting.\n\nThe potential for problems with the new system was somewhat well known from the states small-scale test in the 2019 elections, when a software glitch in the electronic poll books caused delays in most of the six counties where the test took place.\n\nA lot of people saw this coming, this meltdown, months in advance, said Andrew Appel, a computer scientist at Princeton who studies voting machines.\n\nCalling it way too complex, Marilyn Marks, the executive director of the Coalition for Good Governance, which had argued for a slower rollout of the equipment, described the technology as a Rube Goldberg contraption with way more components than are needed.\n\nThe promise of the new system, in part, was that it would be able to provide a variety of customized options  ballots in different languages, audio ballots for the visually impaired and the like. Yet it has not only proved hard to use in the early going; it is also something of a long and winding digital road to the same end as the old hand-marking systems  a marked ballot fed into a scanner.\n\nIn the new systems, voters begin the process by checking in at an electronic poll book, maintained on a digital tablet. There, the voter verification card with a microchip in it is programmed with the voters information. The card is then brought over to a big touch-screen tablet and inserted into a reader to display the voters ballot. After making the selections on the touch screen, the voter clicks print ballot. Then the paper receipt is brought over to the digital scanner, where the voter drops it off.'
