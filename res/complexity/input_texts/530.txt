By a final vote of 77 70 , the House killed the FGM ban in a mostly party line vote Last week House Democrats passed a toothless bill that wouldn t actually ban FGM Why did they do this \? Flagrant Islamopandering , trying to get the votes of Maine s growing Somali Muslim community FGM is mandated in Islamic law Circumcision is obligatory \( for every male and female \) \( by cutting off the piece of skin on the glans of the penis of the male , but circumcision of the female is by cutting out the bazr clitoris this is called khufaadh female circumcision \) Umdat al Salik e4 3 , translated by Mark Durie , The Third Choice , p 64 Why is it obligatory \? Because Muhammad is held to have said so Abu al Malih ibn Usama s father relates that the Prophet said Circumcision is a law for men and a preservation of honour for women Ahmad Ibn Hanbal 5 75 Narrated Umm Atiyyah al Ansariyyah A woman used to perform circumcision in Medina The Prophet \( peace be upon him \) said to her Do not cut severely as that is better for a woman and more desirable for a husband Abu Dawud 41 5251 Unless and until its Islamic justifications , which everyone seems to want to cover up and deny , are addressed , FGM will never be eradicated Anti FGM movements will tell Muslim women \( and men \) about the health risks of FGM , and about how barbaric it is to work to deny women sexual pleasure and try to control them , and none of it will stop FGM All that will wash over believers and what will be left will be the fact that it is justified in Islam and that is the one thing the anti FGM campaigners refuse to address So they will , unfortunately , never succeed
