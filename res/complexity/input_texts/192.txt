Easter is a time for remembering that Muslims killed Jesus , according to Donald Trump People ask me why I do n't like Muslims , and I say duh' , it 's because they nailed Jesus to the cross with those Muslamic nails of theirs Page 545 of the Bible I think it is , there in black and white , Muhammad Pilate and his henchmen killing Jesus I do n't hear other candidates reminding Americans that Muslims killed Jesus Is this yet another thing Hillary has conveniently forgotten \? Lyin' Ted Cruz says he 's a Bible man but he has n't mentioned it either has he even read page 545 \? \? The reason no one talks about the Muslims killing Jesus is political correctness , plain and simple Well I 've never worried about being political , and I 've never worried about being correct , I just say what I think said Trump Trump 's comments saw his popularity soar to new highs , and it now seems increasingly likely that come November , the White House will turn a hideous shade of orange Share this Twitter Facebook Reddit Pinterest Like this Like Loading
