A child's party invitation would not create legal relations with either the child "guest" or its parents.If it is being argued that the contract is with the child, it is inconceivable that a five-year-old would be seen by a court as capable of creating legal relations and entering into a contract with a "no show" charge.It's amusing to imagine what a children's party invitation seeking to create a contract might say: "I, the 'first party', hereinafter referred to as the 'birthday boy', cordially invite you the 'second party', hereinafter referred to as 'my best friend', to the party of 'the first party'.His parents said they had no contact information for Ms Lawrence at that time.They found the invoice in a brown envelope in his schoolbag last week.Mr Nash said: "It was a proper invoice with full official details and even her bank details on it."I can understand that she's upset about losing money. The money isn't the issue, it's the way she went about trying to get the money from me.Image caption The invoice lists a "Party No Show" fee"She didn't treat me like a human being, she treated me like a child and that I should do what she says."In a short statement, Ms Lawrence said: "All details were on the party invite. They had every detail needed to contact me."Mr Nash said he had been told he was being taken to the small claims court because he was refusing to pay.The party was held at the Plymouth Ski and Snowboard Centre.In a statement, the centre said: "We would like all our customers to know that this invoice has nothing to do with Plymouth Ski and Snowboard Centre."No invoices are ever sent out from the centre to private individuals. This is a disagreement between the two parents involved and the fact that the centre has been named on the invoice is fraudulent."When booking a party there is a small deposit to pay on booking, confirmation of numbers and final balance are due 48 hours before the party."On the extremely rare occasion that people don't attend parents are generally offered other activities in compensation."The unwritten rules of children's parties?Image copyright ThinkstockBirthday boy/girl must be given preference for starting activity. Small guests pushing past should be restrained by attending adultsParty bags or gifts for each attending child - the children will always remember "that party" when they didn't get oneIf you don't RSVP don't think you can just turn up. And if you do, don't expect a party bag (see above)Avoid party talk around the parents of the uninvitedHost child MUST win at least one round of pass the parcel. Sweets within each layer for everyone elseChildren must be given 15 minutes at the buffet before adults are allowed to hoover up the cocktail sausagesRead more from the BBC Magazine on the politics of partiesHave you ever committed a kids party faux pas?
