Scorpion stings flier on Alaska Airlines flight from L.A.A scorpion stung a woman on an Alaska Airlines flight from Los Angeles to Portland, Ore., Saturday night, according to media reports from the West Coast.The incident happened after the plane pulled back from the gate and was taxiing out, airline officials told ESPN. The aircraft returned to the gate so the woman could be treated.The flight also happened to be carrying the Oregon State University men's basketball team, which was on its way back to Oregon after games in Los Angeles. Wayne Tinkle, Oregon State's head coach, tells ESPN the scorpion situation occurred just two rows in front of him."The plane was coming from Mexico before us, and [the scorpion] was on the plane,'' Tinkle tells ESPN's Andy Katz. "The woman was a real champ. She acted like it was a mosquito bite. They got it off her but the needle was stuck."Tinkle's account mirrored other eyewitness descriptions."No one seemed frantic at all, not even the woman who was stung," passenger Mike Parker, a sports announcer for Oregon State, says to CNN. "The flight attendants did a great job, as did the captain," saidAs for the woman, she was treated by medical personnel for a sting on the arm, Alaska Airlines spokesman said Cole Cosgrove tells CNN. The woman declined additional treatment.The Oregonian newspaper also confirms Tinkle's account of how the scorpion made it onto the aircraft, writing: "Passengers were told the scorpion hitched a ride in the carry-on bag of a passenger who had been to Mexico."The flight was delayed by about 30 minutes to respond to the sting. Alaska Airlines officials tell ESPN that an attendant killed the scorpion and that the carrier would have an exterminator "thoroughly check the plane" upon arriving to Portland.
