Is there any doubt he built a time machine as well, probably out of bits of an old fireplace, a motorcycle saddlebag, some pearl buttons and a knitting needle? 2010-03-22 07:52:47 PM AdolfOliverPanties : However, the old man and lady next to the time traveler have the same or similar lighting on them as our ersatz epoch sojourner, indicating that something out of frame is casting a shadow on some of the crowd.If you were to remove the sunglasses and add a big mop of long curly hair to the time traveler, you would see that it is none other than a young Brian May, guitarist from Queen and Doctor of Astrophysics.Dude built his own guitars from scratch.
