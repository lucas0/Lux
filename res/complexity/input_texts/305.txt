Facebook Employee Admits To Bernie Sanders Blackout Posted By admin March 30 , 2016This is really scary , I'm a member in a lot of different groups from cars and trucks to Bernie Sanders even Hillary or Trump groups on Facebook I use them all to promote Bernie , trying to change 1 mind a day Today I was talking to a Hillary supporter within a group called Hillary VS Bernie It was a very good conversation that lasted over 2 hours with a total of 86 comments The Hillary supporters main subject was about how Hillary Tells The Truth I was trying to explain to her how Hillary lies over and over She then turned the subject into saying So does everyone even Bernie After about an hour of asking her to show any REAL proof of Bernie lying she gave up and said Look it up your self and I do n't have time for you \( These statements come after 2 hours of conversation \) My last comment was going to be , Clearly you ca n't post any proof nor can I because he never lies But when I hit enter I got this popup I though it was just a glitch , so I refreshed the page but same thing happened \? \? \? I clicked the link and was sent to a Facebook appeal form I filled it out saying I have done nothing wrong A few hours went by and I got an email titled Your Facebook appeal PLEASE READ It was not from abuse facebook com or any of the Facebook email addresses so I first thought spam , then I was like how can anyone know I'm blocked from posting anything on Facebook besides me \? The email was a guy saying he works for Facebook and to contact him via Skype This was extremely weird , but I was curious to see where this was going I added him on Skype He accepted me right away and said I'm going to tell you something you may or may not believe All I ask is you do not share my email or Skype I replied back Ok but why not just contact me via a fake email and Skype then \? He said They are fake but I still feel I could be traced I said Fair enough , but what is this all about \? He said I work for Facebook , and I'm reaching out to people who have been blocked on Facebook after posting keywords like FeelTheBern At this point I'm kinda freaking out How does anyone know I have been blocked from posting \? They also have my personal email and know about me posting FeelTheBern He then began to explain to me Facebook is actively and automatically blocking millions of accounts with a algorithm that detects people who post keywords like FeelTheBurn I for example was banned from posting anything for 30 days due to the fact I posted FeelTheBernHe also said Quote In a staff briefing everyone was told to deny any appeal that happened due to posting political opinions \( As he laughed and said these members are banned due to spamming give them time to calm down \) I asked him why not go public with a widely viewed TV network or huge websites like HuffingtonPost \? He said I have emailed a few local news TV stations plus all the big well known websites and 100 's of Facebook users , yet I have n't seen this story get viral I told him most likely the reason huge websites or news stations wo n't talk about it is because they are scared to post something without having a face to back it up with But I understand why he is scared to come out He can be sued for breach of contractHe will lose his good paying jobHe would never be hired after leaking company information I promised I would do my best to get this information out to the world This is insane ! I knew the corrupt corporations ran the media but I never thought it would get down to blocking people from Facebook What can you do \? Share this post on Twitter , Facebook , YouTube , etc Contact HuffingtonPost asking them to reply to the emails sent Contact Woodland Hills , CA News station ABC7 to reply to the emails sent We can not let this subject get swept under the rug This is a 1000 times worse then corrupt corporations running Fox News This is like YouTube or Google removing any blog or video that says anything good about Bernie
