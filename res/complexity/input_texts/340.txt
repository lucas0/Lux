Consider setting rules on when and where your kids have access to devices or specific apps.\n\nMaybe theyre not allowed to use tablets in their rooms with the door closed, and instead have to use them in common areas. Perhaps they can do certain activities (like online reading) in their rooms but others (like chats and video chats) must be done in shared spaces, where you can check on what theyre doing. If that sounds intrusive, consider that when your kids have real-life play dates, youre likely to pop in every so often to check in and offer snacks; digital play dates should be no different, said Devorah Heitner, Ph.D., the founder of Raising Digital Natives and the author of Screenwise.'
