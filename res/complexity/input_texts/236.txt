Five and a half years after Senator John McCain killed off what was left of The Maverick the independent thinking , not afraid to tell it like it is character he d been LARPing since the 2000 Republican primary in order to win a contentious primary against Tea Party challenger J D Hayworth , he s facing the prospect of the end of his career once again This time , it s against a state senator who s perfectly content with grifting votes at a Donald Trump rally McCain s seat has been targeted by conservative groups for years now to no avail , but this time , it s a fair question to ask if McCain s heart is in it anymore And even if it is Does anyone even care \?
