8 CommentsQUOTE OF THE DAY We understand your desire to attend our games as an escape and chosen form of entertainment In that , we feel there is significant commonality in all of us that allows our community to be so special That commonality should include aspirations for social justice , freedom of speech in its many forms , and equal opportunity for education and economic advancement regardless of race , ethnicity , gender , sexual orientation or religion Manu Ginobili , in a tweet on Thursday , according to the San Antonio Express News Before Wednesday 's game , Spurs players along with retired legends Tim Duncan and David Robinson locked arms as the above message was displayed on screens inside the AT T Center BIG NEWSChris Gaspard helps remove ruined items from his friend Bryan Parson 's home brought on by flooding in the wake of Hurricane Harvey in Dickinson , Texas Photo by Win McNamee Getty ImagesBad DealThe city of Dickinson , in Galveston County , was among the hardest hit places when Hurricane Harvey 's torrential rains slammed Texas Residents now seeking Harvey relief face a strange ultimatum agree not to boycott Israel , or your application for aid will be denied According to the Houston Chronicle , the city 's hurricane repair grant application , which allows residents to apply for funds to help rebuild a home or business impacted by Hurricane Harvey , includes a surprising stipulation By executing this Agreement below , the Applicant verifies that the Applicant \( 1 \) does not boycott Israel and \( 2 \) will not boycott Israel during the term of this Agreement , it states The application has gotten the attention of the American Civil Liberties Union , which called the prohibition unconstitutional on Thursday The First Amendment protects Americans' right to boycott , and the government cannot condition hurricane relief or any other public benefit on a commitment to refrain from protected political expression , Andre Segura , the legal director of the ACLU of Texas , told the Chronicle Dickinson 's requirement is an egregious violation of the First Amendment , reminiscent of McCarthy era loyalty oaths requiring Americans to disavow membership in the Communist party and other forms of subversive' activity MEANWHILE , IN TEXASReal TalkFormer President George W Bush delivered a harshly worded speech on Thursday He condemned the divisive actions of President Donald Trump , though he stopped short of actually calling out the president by name We 've seen our discourse degraded by casual cruelty , Bush said during a sixteen minute address at The Spirit of Liberty event in New York , sponsored by his presidential center Bullying and prejudice in our public life sets a national tone and provides permission for cruelty and bigotry The only way to pass along civic values is to first live up to them Bush said our political system has been corrupted by conspiracy theories and outright fabrication , and cautioned against the U S turning inward under Trump We 've seen nationalism distorted into nativism , forgotten the dynamism that immigration has always brought to America , Bush said We see a fading confidence in the value of free markets and international trade , forgetting that conflict , instability and poverty follow in the wake of protectionism We 've seen the return of isolationist sentiments , forgetting that American security is directly threatened by the chaos and despair of distant places He took aim at white supremacy too Our identity as a nation unlike many other nations is not determined by geography or ethnicity , by soil or blood , Bush said This means that people of every race , religion , and ethnicity can be fully and equally American It means that bigotry or white supremacy in any form is blasphemy against the American creed On the BrinkThe Houston Astros face a must win situation Friday night in game six of the American League Championship Series against the New York Yankees If they win , they live another day , forcing a series deciding game seven in Houston on Saturday If they lose , their season is done As ESPN notes , this is an unusual spot for the Stros to be in They 've held onto first place in the American League West for 178 of 183 days during the regular season , every day since April 12 , and they held a lead at the end of 25 of 36 innings in the previous round of the playoffs Even in the ALCS , they were leading or tied through the series 's first nineteen innings , jumping out to a 2 0 series lead On Friday , the team will turn to starting pitcher Justin Verlander , who dominated the Yankees in the second game of the series , striking out thirteen batters while allowing one run over nine spectacular innings They 'll also have the support of their home crowd Our backs are against the wall , catcher Brian McCann told ESPN We 'll be ready This team , we 've played extremely well all season long , and nothing 's going to change We 'll be ready for game six We 've responded all year long Fast Food BeefWhataburger is typically considered the undisputed champ of the fast food scene here in Texas , but according to a new ranking by Business Insider , Texans actually prefer California based chain In N Out Yes , we know , this is truly a travesty Business Insider 's methodology here is hardly scientific , as it relies solely the publication data from Foursquare , a social media app which lets users check in at certain locations , to determine which fast food restaurant was most popular in each state For the study , we looked at which chains received the most visits on average in every state based on the total number of visits to each chain divided by the number of locations in that state , Business Insider wrote Somehow , that research showed In N Out as the top choice among Texans As the Houston Chronicle notes , In N Out only has 35 restaurants in Texas , while Whataburger has nearly 200 locations in the Houston area alone We think Whataburger still has a leg up on In N Out , regardless of what Business Insider says WHAT WE'RE READINGSome links are paywalled or subscription only Laura
