b'But in cities where the virus has continued to rage, efforts at compromise solutions have increasingly proven unworkable  a shattering realization for families that have strained for months to cobble normalcy out of a situation that is pitting their childrens development and education against parental livelihoods and household health.\n\nMahogany Taylor, a 39-year-old mother of two and the president of the San Diego Unified Council of PTAs, said the loss of in-person instruction was particularly destructive for elementary school students  many of whom cannot type  and for low-income students, who often lack internet access, and who make up nearly 60 percent of San Diego Unifieds students.\n\nAt the same time, Ms. Taylor said, a districtwide survey showed that 40 percent of parents already were planning to insist on remote instruction. We obviously believe that school is the best place for kids, she said, but we also want them to be safe.\n\nAll across the nation, school officials are trying to balance safety against learning losses. Initial research showed that during the first round of school closures, American children were set back, on average, by seven months in their reading and math learning, with children from low-income families, and students of color, experiencing even bigger losses.\n\nStill, district leaders in Los Angeles and San Diego said, California was not in a position to reopen schools.\n\nThose countries that have managed to safely reopen schools have done so with declining infection rates and on-demand testing available, the statement said. California has neither. The skyrocketing infection rates of the past few weeks make it clear the pandemic is not under control.\n\nMr. Beutner, whose district is the nations second largest, said in an interview that schools cant just tap our heels together like Dorothy in The Wizard of Oz and pretend its appropriate to bring people back despite skyrocketing rates of new infections.'
