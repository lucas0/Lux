b'[See our map of coronavirus cases in California by county.]\n\nWhat are the phases for reopening?\n\nIn April, state leaders unveiled a timeline for how California plans to reopen schools, businesses and public spaces. The framework, which consists of four phases, lays out how the state will inch toward those goals. Counties that were approved for a variance from the statewide order can move further into Stage 2, including opening retail stores and dine-in restaurants, with strict modifications.\n\nStage 1, which the state has passed, means government and private organizations are working to make it consistently safer for essential workers, like grocery employees or nurses. Those workers need more protective equipment and a more robust testing and tracing system.\n\nStage 2, which California entered in early May, is when some lower-risk businesses and public spaces can reopen, with strict modifications that allow for social distancing.\n\nStage 3 will be when higher-risk businesses may reopen, with modifications.\n\nStage 4 will be the end of the states stay-at-home order.\n\nRead more about each phase, including what will remain closed.'
