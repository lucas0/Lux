Turner 's father asked members of the press Or maybe Angelina Jolie , I hear she 's also trying out as a director \? Maybe Mel Gibson , he 's been through a lot and is always on the lookout for crazy , new talent \? No \? Too bad Because I think that girl definitely deserves a shot at Hollywood , she was that good I 've heard of faking orgasms , but faking a rape \? She 's something else Great things await that girl in the future , if not in Hollywood , then she could always do porn I mean , she 's obviously a natural Look , sex is a natural urge and I get that If my son told me , Dad , she was so hot and inviting , I just could n't resist her , it was the best sex of my life , ' I would have been like , what the heck , do your time proud son , it was worth it ' Instead , he 's going to have to live with the fact that he wasted 20 minutes of his time for nothing Nothing more I can say , except that I hope his judgment will improve when he gets out of jail Or at least , that he 'll learn to hide better next time , he concluded
