b'The unintended consequence of Mr. Garners death must have a consequence of its own. Therefore, I agree with the deputy commissioner of trials legal findings and recommendations. It is clear that Daniel Pantaleo can no longer effectively serve as a New York City police officer. In carrying out the courts verdict  verdict in this case, I take no pleasure. I know that many will disagree with this decision and that is their right. There are absolutely no victors here today, not the Garner family, not the community at large and certainly not the courageous men and women of the police department, who put their own lives on the line every single day in service to the people of this great city. Today is a day of reckoning, but can also be a day of reconciliation. We must forward  we must move forward together as one city, determined to secure safety for all: safety for all New Yorkers and safety for every police officer working daily to protect all of us.'
