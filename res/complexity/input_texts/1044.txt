b'State Highlights\n\nBy Peter Lattman\n\nWith President Obamas victory in Minnesota, Democrats have now carried the state in the last 10 presidential elections.\n\nMinnesotans voted down a state constitutional amendment that would have limited marriage to a man and a woman. The victory for gay-rights advocates came as voters in Maine and Maryland also approved same-sex marriage initiatives. A referendum to legalize same-sex marriage in Washington State also passed, with 51.8 percent of the vote.\n\nSenator Amy Klobuchar, a Democrat, handily won re-election, overwhelming Kurt P. Bills, a high school economics teacher, to win a second term.\n\nIn one of the countrys most expensive and highest-profile House races, Representative Michele Bachmann, a former candidate for the Republican presidential nomination, narrowly defeated Jim Graves, a Democrat. Mr. Graves, the founder of the AmericInn hotel chain, had depicted Mrs. Bachmann, an outspoken champion of the Tea Party and a ubiquitous cable-television presence, as too preoccupied with her national profile to focus on Minnesotans.\n\nIn an upset, Representative Chip Cravaack, the first-term Republican incumbent, was ousted by Rick Nolan, a Democrat who represented the state as a congressman in the 1970s. The campaigns final weeks featured attack ads suggesting that Mr. Cravaack did not live in Minnesota because his wife and two young sons moved to New Hampshire last year to be closer to her job as a pharmaceutical executive.\n\nSix incumbents held on to their House seats: four Democrats, Betty McCollum, Tim Walz, Keith Ellison and Collin Peterson; and two Republicans, John Kline and Erik Paulsen.'
