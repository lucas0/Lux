b'Reporter: On Roger Stone, isnt your tweet political interference? No, not at all. He was treated very badly  nine years recommended. If you look at what happened  I want to thank the Justice Department for seeing this horrible thing. And I didnt speak to him, by the way, just so you understand. They saw the horribleness of a nine-year sentence for doing nothing. You have murderers and drug addicts, they dont get nine years  nine years for doing something that nobody even can define what he did. Somebody said he put out a tweet, and the tweet, you based it on that. We have killers, we have murderers all over the place, nothing happens. And then they put a man in jail and destroy his life, his family, his wife, his children  nine years in jail. Its a disgrace. In the meantime, Comey walks around making book deals. The people that launched this scam investigation, and what they did is a disgrace.'
