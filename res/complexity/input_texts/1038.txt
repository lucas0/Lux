b'Were working with religious institutions, right now. They can have up to 10 people with strict social distancing guidelines at religious gatherings. Weve asked them to consider drive-in and parking lot services for religious ceremonies. But were going to be working with our Interfaith Advisory Council. I understand their desire to get back to religious ceremonies as soon as possible. As a former altar boy, I get it. I think it  even at this time of stress, and when people are so anxious and so confused, I think those religious ceremonies can be very comforting. But we need to find out how to do it, and do it safely and do it smartly. The last thing we want to do is have a religious ceremony that winds up having more people infected. Religious ceremony, by definition, is a gathering right? Its a large number of people coming together. We know from New Rochelle, Westchester, the first hot spot, that religious ceremonies can be very dangerous. So we all want to do the same thing. The question is, how do we do it?'
