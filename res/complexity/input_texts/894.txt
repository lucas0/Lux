b'The new health protocols illustrate the extraordinary nature of hosting a national political convention amid a public health pandemic that continues to spread across the country. In addition to submitting to daily testing, convention attendees will be required to self-isolate for 72 hours before traveling to Milwaukee, wear a mask at all times in Milwaukee and avoid bars, restaurants and other locations where social distancing is not possible or not practiced.\n\nAll attendees must wear a mask that covers the nose and mouth at all times until departing unless their job function specifically requires temporary removal of the P.P.E., the protocols said. In addition, eye protection such as goggles or a face shield are strongly recommended.\n\nConvention planners did not indicate how they would build the capacity to test every convention attendee every day.\n\nDemocratic planners will establish a health and safety perimeter outside the Wisconsin Center, the Milwaukee convention center where the scaled-down event has been moved. It had originally been scheduled for the citys professional basketball arena, which can hold thousands of visitors.\n\nThe Democratic convention, which in almost any other year would be an hourslong event for each of its four days, now will be limited to two hours a night, from 9 p.m. to 11 p.m., and be arranged to serve a television and online audience. Former Vice President Joseph R. Biden Jr. intends to accept the partys nomination in Milwaukee, according to convention organizers, but other party surrogates most likely will participate remotely from other locations.'
