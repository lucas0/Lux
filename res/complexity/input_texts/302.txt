May 17 , 2012 4 CommentsI am in the process of preparing the data on the first several hundred children I have observed with GcMAF therapy for elevated nagalase activity The preliminary data is extraordinary But not everyone who thinks they understand GcMAF therapy gets it Many are using hugely too much and hurting children in the process Please do n't overdose the children if you are using the right GcMAF it takes very little to help Our process involves homeopathic activation using classical techniques And when our techniques are used properly this is what we are hearing from the families so often Dear Dr Bradstreet , What has happened to my child \? Could it be that it was only a few months ago that my little boy preferred sitting alone at the computer or lining up toy cars and planets in his room \? It seems like it 's been a lifetime Now , I look at my happy , interactive , responsive , 6 year old child with amazement J began using GcMAF since 27 weeks ago and we noticed changes for the better almost out of the starting gate Only 3 weeks in , my son asked to ride his bike My husband and I looked at each other with dread Unfortunately , in the recent past it took all three of us to make that bike go My husband and I would use our hands to push his feet on the pedals while one of us attempted to steer It was a backbreaking ordeal Our son just could n't coordinate the mechanics of it But , not this time he jumped on that bike and rode all over the neighborhood We could n't believe our eyes Could it be the GcMAF \? We just were n't sure The IEP meeting was scheduled We were just 4 weeks into the new school year and 4 weeks into using GcMAF The teacher presented me with written work from the beginning of the year , then placed Jayden 's most recent work alongside it Surely , it was from two different children The earlier writing was erratic , with one letter written over top of the other , it was disproportionate , and trailed sloppily down the edge of the page His recent work was neat , orderly , and consistently sized It was even on the line The teacher started gushing about his performance He was starting to read and was learning full curriculum kindergarten academics He was specifically excelling in math Everyone around the conference table verbally gave each other a high five for their achievement Now hold on , I interrupted , the success must primarily be attributed to the biomedical approach and the diet that we 've implemented I gave them a brief explanation and we left the meeting feeling excited for what the future might hold It was not a steady climb up the staircase , however We experienced some regression following dental surgery , but quickly got back on track \( by resuming GcMAF \) Previously , I had a difficult time getting my son to respond when I called out his name He would run out into the street without looking , if I did n't stop him He was able to parrot back canned answers to rehearsed questions Now , here we are , 6 months later , and my son 's cognition has exploded He laughs at jokes and is able to tell his own He has started to ask and answer questions cognitively He initiates and organizes the family during playtime activities Recently , while in the pool , he touched his Dad 's hair and said , Nice haircut , Dad At breakfast , after drinking his juice he asked , Was that mango juice \? I wanted pear juice The morning after I went to see a show he awoke and said , Good morning Mommy How was the show \? Just 2 months ago , a van from a local karate school brought children to the playground that we were at My son was excited to play and ran over to a boy and gave him a two handed chest shove I apologized and quickly led him away before he got a karate chop Just last week , we went back to that same playground I watched nervously as J ran over to a group of three boys I heard him say , Come on guys , let 's play Chase me ! And , you know what they did ! My boy led this group of normal boys all over that playground One of the boys asked him what was his name He told him , My name is J As I glanced around at the other parents scattered about the playground I wondered if I was the only one there who saw a miracle that day My son did experience some symptoms while using GcMAF There was occasional regressive stimming , a rare fever up to 102 , a few shooting head pains with sensitivity to light that lasted for only a few seconds , and he was often tired But , those symptoms were easily lost in the shadows of the exceptional gains that we were experiencing The best part about GcMAF is that Jayden now frequently and spontaneously speaks those words , that for years , I 'd longed to hear , I love you , Mommy And , if that 's not a good enough reason to stick your kid with a needle 27 times , I do n't know what is Dr Bradstreet , there are no words adequate enough to express my sincere and heartfelt appreciation for everything that you 've done for J Thank you for including us in your personal journey of discovery and healing God bless you and your family Sincerely , Dr Bradstreet 's 1 FanShare this
