As some of you know I work at a store in the Mall out in flint I worked a closing shift tonight so me and the girls I work with always walk out together to make sure we are safe in the parking lot I got to my car and locked the doors behind me immediately as I always do and noticed that there was a blue flannel shirt on my windshield There were two cars near me and one was running so I immediately felt uneasy and knew I could n't get out to get it off At first I thought maybe someone had just thrown it on my car for some odd reason I used my windshield wipers to try to get them off but the shirt was completely wrapped around my wiper blade I had seen posts lately about people finding things under their windshield wipers in the burton Flint area as an attempt to get girls out of their cars and distracted Luckily I knew better than to remove the shirt with cars around me so I drove over to a place where I was safe and quickly rolled down my window and got the shirt off I do n't know why the shirt was on my car but it had to have been intentional the way it was put on there I really ca n't think of another reason as to why someone would put it on my car Tomorrow I am informing security of the situation and making them walk me to my car from now on It definitely frightened me a little bitI'm so glad my parents had informed me that it was happening in our area , I just never thought it would potentially happen to my car
