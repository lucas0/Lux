Trump Administration Eases Nursing Home Fines in Victory for IndustryBy JORDAN RAUContinue reading the main storyPhotoSeema Verma , administrator for the Centers for Medicare and Medicaid Services , has said that the agency 's regulations were taking doctors away from what matters most patients Credit Al Drago for The New York TimesThe Trump administration is scaling back the use of fines against nursing homes that harm residents or place them in grave risk of injury , part of a broader relaxation of regulations under the president The shift in the Medicare program 's penalty protocols was requested by the nursing home industry The American Health Care Association , the industry 's main trade group , has complained that under President Barack Obama , federal inspectors focused excessively on catching wrongdoing rather than helping nursing homes improve It is critical that we have relief , Mark Parkinson , the group 's president , wrote in a letter to Mr Trump in December 2016 Since 2013 , nearly 6 , 500 nursing homes four of every 10 have been cited at least once for a serious violation , federal records show Medicare has fined two thirds of those homes Common citations include failing to protect residents from avoidable accidents , neglect , mistreatment and bedsores AdvertisementContinue reading the main storyThe change in policy aligns with Mr Trump 's promise to reduce bureaucracy , regulation and government intervention in business Dr Kate Goodrich , director of clinical standards and quality at the Centers for Medicare and Medicaid Services , said in a statement that unnecessary regulation was the main concern that health care providers raised with officials Rather than spending quality time with their patients , the providers are spending time complying with regulations that get in the way of caring for their patients and does n't increase the quality of care they provide , Dr Goodrich said But advocates for nursing home residents say the revised penalties are weakening a valuable patient safety tool They 've pretty much emasculated enforcement , which was already weak , said Toby Edelman , a senior attorney at the Center for Medicare Advocacy Medicare has different ways of applying penalties It can impose a specific fine for a particular violation It can assess a fine for each day that a nursing home was in violation Or it can deny payments for new admissions The average fine in recent years has been 33 , 453 , but 531 nursing homes amassed combined federal fines above 100 , 000 , records show In 2016 , Congress increased the fines to factor in several years of inflation that had not been accounted for previously AdvertisementContinue reading the main storyThe new rules have been instituted gradually throughout the year In October , the Centers for Medicare and Medicaid Services discouraged its regional offices from levying fines , even in the most serious health violations , if the error was a one time mistake The centers said that intentional disregard for residents' health and safety or systemic errors should still merit fines A July memo from the centers discouraged the directors of state agencies that survey nursing homes from issuing daily fines for violations that began before an inspection , favoring one time fines instead Daily fines remain the recommended approach for major

remedies but were pointless when applied to past errors that had already been fixed by the time inspectors discovered them What was happening is you were seeing massive fines accumulating because they were applying them on a per day basis retrospectively , Mr Gifford said But the change means that some nursing homes could be sheltered from fines above the maximum per instance fine of 20 , 965 even for egregious mistakes In September 2016 , for instance , health inspectors faulted Lincoln Manor , a nursing home in Decatur , Ill , for failing to monitor and treat the wound of a patient whose implanted pain medication pump gradually slipped over eight days through a ruptured suture and protruded from her abdomen The patient died The Centers for Medicare and Medicaid Services fined Lincoln Manor 282 , 954 , including 10 , 091 a day for 28 days , from the time the nursing home noticed the problem with the wound until supervisors had retrained nurses to avoid similar errors An administrative law judge called the penalties quite modest given the appalling care The fines were issued before the new guidelines took effect if the agency had issued a one time fine , the maximum would have been less than 21 , 000 Lincoln Manor closed in September Its owner could not be reached for comment , and his lawyer did not respond to an interview request AdvertisementContinue reading the main storyAdvocates for nursing home residents say that relaxing penalties threatens to undo progress at deterring wrongdoing Janet Wells , a consultant for California Advocates for Nursing Home Reform , said the changes come as some egregious violations and injuries to residents are being penalized finally at a level that gets the industry 's attention and is n't just the cost of doing business In November , the Trump administration exempted nursing homes that violate eight new safety rules from penalties for 18 months Homes must still follow the rules , which are intended , among other things , to reduce the overuse of psychotropic drugs and to ensure that every home has adequate resources to assist residents with major psychological problems In June , the Centers for Medicare and Medicaid Services rescinded another Obama administration action that banned nursing homes from pre emptively requiring residents to submit to arbitration to settle disputes rather than going to court We publish nearly 11 , 000 pages of regulation every year , the agency 's administrator , Seema Verma , said in a speech in October That paperwork is taking doctors away from what matters most patients Janine Finck Boyle , director of health regulations and policy at LeadingAge , a group of nonprofit nursing homes and other entities that care for older people , said the group 's members had been struggling to cope with regulations If you 're a 50 bed rural facility out West or in the Dakotas , she said , you do n't have the resources to get everything done from A to Z Jordan Rau is a
