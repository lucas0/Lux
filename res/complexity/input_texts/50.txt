We do n't know These cases are invariably referred to as accidents in media reports But as Everytown for Gun Safety , a group that advocates for stricter gun laws , argues , many incidents like this are preventable In a study of accidental shootings by children of all ages \( not just toddlers \) , they estimate that more than two thirds of these tragedies could be avoided if gun owners stored their guns responsibly and prevented children from accessing them There are policy and technical responses to preventable childhood gun deaths as well States and localities could require guns to be locked up at home , a policy supported by 67 percent of Americans Various types of smart gun technology , which prevent anyone other than their owners from firing a given gun , exist as well But gun lock requirements and smart guns have been vehemently opposed by the National Rifle Association and its allies Instead , the NRA continues to promote a response that seeks to solve gun problems with more guns , and aims to broaden the saturation of firearms in nearly every sphere of public and private life , from homes to schools to churches to bars to airports and beyond In a country with more guns than people , it 's only natural that a certain number of small children are going get their hands on an unsecured firearm , with tragic consequences Guns in America For every criminal killed in self defense , 34 innocent people die Depending on where you stand on gun policy , you may feel that 13 dead toddlers in 10 months is too many Or , you might reason that stuff happens , and that this is part of the price we must pay to protect our gun rights I 've included my tally of toddler shootings below News sources are linked in the City column Know of any this year that I missed \?
