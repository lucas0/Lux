Stephanie Lewis started this petition to Senior Curator , Guggenheim Museum Alexandra Munroe and 11 othersThe Guggenheim is gearing up for a special exhibit to air for three months beginning Oct 6 , 2017 called Art and China after 1989 If the Guggenheim 's plans stay as they are , the exhibit will feature several distinct instances of unmistakable cruelty against animals in the name of art In one example , artists Peng Yu and Sun Yuan tether four pairs of American pit bulls to eight wooden treadmills for a live exhibit The dogs are faced off against one another , running at each other but prevented from touching one another , which is a stressful and frustrating experience for animals trained to fight The dogs get wearier and wearier , their muscles more and more prominent , and their mouths increasingly salivate At this live 2003 performance in China , a video was recorded , complete with close up shots of the dogs' frantic , foaming faces This 7 minute video will be on display at the Guggenheim exhibit \( information from NY Times article Where the Wild Things Are China 's Art Dreamers at the Guggenheim \) In another example , artist Xu Bing stamped meaningless characters all over the bodies of two pigs , a boar and a sow , who were put on display , mating , in a museum exhibit in Beijing in 1994 The Guggenheim will feature the video of that performance as well Finally , this exhibit will feature live animals \( reptiles , amphibians , insects \) that are trapped in a glass enclosure for attendee viewing According to the NY Times article , During the three month exhibition some creatures will be devoured others may die of fatigue The big ones will survive From time to time , a New York City pet shop will replenish the menagerie with new bugs Help us send a message to the Guggenheim by signing this petition Let them know that animal cruelty holds no place in art in the United States , nor should it anywhere in the world This assault on animals in the name of art will not be tolerated or supported Guggenheim please do what you know in your heart is right Take a stand with our animal cohabitants of this planet , and pull the pieces employing these cruel methods from your upcoming show Guggenheim tell the world what you stand for bold , controversial art that breaks barriers and challenges social norms , which does NOT include the promotion of cruelty against innocent beings Start a petition of your ownThis petition starter stood up and took action Will you do the same \?
