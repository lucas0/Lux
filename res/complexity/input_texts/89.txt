In the first place , Gingrich loves government more than I do He has no Hayekian modesty to restrain his faith in statist endeavor I'm for national greatness conservatism , but this is a little too great Furthermore , he has an unconservative faith in his own innocence The crossroads where government meets enterprise can be an exciting crossroads It can also be a corrupt crossroads It requires moral rectitude to separate public service from private gain Gingrich was perfectly content to belly up to the Freddie Mac trough and then invent a Hamiltonian rationale to justify his own greed Then there is his rhetorical style He seems to have understood that a moderate Republican like himself can win so long as he adopts a bombastic style when taking on the liberal elites Most people just want somebody who can articulate their hatreds , and Gingrich is demagogically happy to play the role Please verify you 're not a robot by clicking the box Invalid email address Please re enter You must select a newsletter to subscribe to You agree to receive occasional updates and special offers for The New York Times 's products and services Thank you for subscribing An error has occurred Please try again later You are already subscribed to this email Most important , there is temperament and character But they have very different temperaments Romney , Levin observes , has an executive temperament organization , discipline , calm and restraint Gingrich has a revolutionary temperament intensity , energy , disorganization and a tendency to see everything as a cataclysmic clash requiring a radical response I 'd make a slightly similar point more rudely In the two main Republican contenders , we have one man , Romney , who seems to have walked straight out of the 1950s , and another , Gingrich , who seems to have walked straight out of the 1960s He has every negative character trait that conservatives associate with '60s excess narcissism , self righteousness , self indulgence and intemperance He just has those traits in Republican form As nearly everyone who has ever worked with him knows , he would severely damage conservatism and the Republican Party if nominated He would severely damage the Hamilton Theodore Roosevelt strain in American life It 's really too bad We could have had a great debate about the progressive conservative tradition President Obama is now embracing Roosevelt Gingrich has tried to modernize this tendency But how you believe something is as important as what you believe It does n't matter if a person shares your overall philosophy If that person does n't have the right temperament and character , stay away A version of this op ed appears in print on December 9 , 2011 , on Page A39 of the New York edition with the headline The Gingrich Tragedy
