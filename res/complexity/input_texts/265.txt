Linkedin Google Whatsapp Pinterest Reddit Stumbleupon Buffer Tumblr Pocket Line When Robert Mueller begins slapping handcuffs on the first batch of Donald Trump 's co conspirators tomorrow , will Trump 's son in law Jared Kushner be among them \? No one seems to know for sure Suffice it to say , however , that Kushner is suddenly acting more than a bit suspiciously In fact , Kushner just boarded a commercial jet and secretly left the country and Trump 's White House is refusing to answer any questions about what 's going on Kushner flew to Saudi Arabia , in what was clearly supposed to be a secret trip , as the White House refuses to say why he went there or what he did once he got there He supposedly returned to the United States on Saturday night , according to a Politico report \( link \) but considering the suspicious circumstances , that too could be a cover story there 's no known proof that he actually did return to the U S There are scattered reports that Kushner may have had dinner with Ivanka Trump in Washington on DC on Saturday night , which we 're still working to track down This raises a number of questions Kushner was accompanied by a deputy national security adviser , so this does n't appear to have been some harebrained attempt at fleeing the country That would have been a phenomenally stupid idea anyway Although Saudi Arabia does not have an extradition treaty with the United States , it 's far too close of an ally to want to provide such controversial refuge But this may have been a \( perhaps mis timed \) attempt at conveniently being out of the country as Robert Mueller begins making arrests In any case , Donald Trump 's White House 's refusal to answer any questions about Jared Kushner 's trip makes it all the more suspicious If this were a legitimate diplomatic mission , it would be easy for the White House to provide a plausible explanation for the trip Instead the obfuscation strongly suggests that Kushner staged the trip as some kind of bizarre response to the impending arrests Help fund Palmer Report Thanks for reading Palmer Report Check out this great content Keep up to date with the latest Palmer Report articles via email Get the latest content first Email AddressAs new articles are addedDaily
