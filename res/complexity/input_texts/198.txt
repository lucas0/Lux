Tom Goldstein , the publisher of the highly influential SCOTUSblog , has described Kagan as extraordinarily almost artistically careful Kagan has apparently wanted to be a judge or justice since adolescence \( she posed in judicial robes for her high school yearbook \) There was a brief period , in her early 20s , when she expressed opinions on legal and political matters But that seems to have ended pretty quickly She has become a legal scholar without the interest scholars normally have in the contest of ideas She 's shown relatively little interest in coming up with new theories or influencing public debate Her publication record is scant and carefully nonideological She has published five scholarly review articles , mostly on administrative law and the First Amendment These articles were mostly on technical and procedural issues Please verify you 're not a robot by clicking the box Invalid email address Please re enter You must select a newsletter to subscribe to You agree to receive occasional updates and special offers for The New York Times 's products and services Thank you for subscribing An error has occurred Please try again later You are already subscribed to this email One scans her public speeches looking for a strong opinion , and one comes up empty In 2005 , for example , she delivered a lecture on women and the legal profession If ever there was a hot button issue , it 's the mommy wars , the tension between professional success and family pressures Kagan deftly summarized some of the research showing that while women do well in law school , they are not as likely to rise to senior positions at major firms But she did n't exactly take a stand What I hope to do is start a conversation , she said Kagan 's sole display of passion came during her defense of her decision to reinstate a policy that banned the military from using Harvard Law School 's main career office for recruiting But even here , she argues that her position was not the product of any broad opinions She was upholding the antidiscrimination regulations of Harvard University She told the Senate in written answers to questions during her confirmation hearings for solicitor general , The position I took does not entail a view on the exclusion of R O T C from college campuses , and I never expressed a position on the exclusion of R O T C What we have is a person whose career has dovetailed with the incentives presented by the confirmation system , a system that punishes creativity and rewards caginess Arguments are already being made for and against her nomination , but most of this is speculation because she has been too careful to let her actual positions leak out There 's about to be a backlash against the Ivy League lock on the court I have to confess my first impression of Kagan is a lot like my first impression of many Organization Kids She seems to be smart , impressive and honest and in her willingness to suppress so much of her mind for the sake of her career , kind of disturbing A version of this op ed appears in print on May 11 , 2010 , on Page A23 of the New York edition with the headline What It Takes
