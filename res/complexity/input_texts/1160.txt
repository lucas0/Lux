The lockdown, which went into effect on March 25 and was extended until at least May 17, led to the shutdown of businesses and transportation. State borders have been sealed, schools and religious sites were closed, and officials are urging people to stay inside as much as possible.\n\nIn early May, the government eased some restrictions to help revive the economy, including allowing construction and plantation work to resume and many shops to reopen, including salons, pet and home hardware shops and liquor vendors.\n\nBut the authorities have moved cautiously, fearing rapid viral spread in Indias dense urban neighborhoods. At many junctures over the past six weeks, officials have faced daunting challenges enforcing the restrictions.\n\nWhen Prime Minister Narendra Modi announced the lockdown, thousands of migrant workers were initially stranded in cities without a way to reach their home villages. Some started 100-mile journeys on foot. With supply chain disruptions across the country, others have relied on the government for food handouts.\n\nHow Cases Are Growing\n\nIndias lockdown has helped blunt the spread of the coronavirus, slowing the nations doubling rate from around four days in late March to about 10 days.\n\nNew reported cases by day in India 0 2,000 4,000 6,000 cases Feb. March April May 7-day average New cases Note: The seven-day average is the average of a day and the previous six days of data.\n\nNew reported deaths by day in India 0 100 200 deaths Feb. March April May 7-day average New deaths Note: Scale for deaths chart is adjusted from cases chart to display trend.\n\nThe New York Times has found that official tallies in the United States and in more than a dozen other countries have undercounted deaths during the coronavirus outbreak because of limited testing availability.\n\nSo far, the virus has remained largely confined to just a few states, with around a third of the countrys cases traced to two cities -- Mumbai and Delhi -- and superspreader events, including a large March gathering of Muslim missionaries at an Islamic seminary in northern India.\n\nBut some parts of India have reported a recent surge in cases and public health experts have warned that the countrys testing figures were still far too restrictive, with slightly more than a million tests administered, or less than one for every thousand people.\n\nStates like Tamil Nadu and Gujarat are witnessing sharp increases in cases. Officials in West Bengal have been accused of sitting on high mortality figures. In Punjab, the rate at which new cases were doubling dropped from 18 days to four this past week, largely because of an aggressive outbreak among religious pilgrims returning from Maharashtra, Indias worst affected state.\n\nWhere You Can Find More Information\n\nRead more about how Muslims in India have been blamed for spreading the virus, the steep drop in air pollution and life under lockdown in New Delhi, and how half a billion people could slip into destitution during the outbreak.\n\nHere is where you can find more detailed information:'
