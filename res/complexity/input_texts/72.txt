6th Graders Taught How to Use Strap On DildoExplicit 11 12 year olds given sex toy lesson in Jacksonvilleby Paul Joseph Watson September 15 , 20149 , 23530931Shocking images out of a classroom in Jacksonville , Florida illustrate how 11 12 year olds in 6th grade are being taught how to use strap on dildos amidst a debate about sexual content finding its way into other Common Core subjects , material which has been attacked by some as pornographic The pictures were taken by a student with a cellphone camera They show a teacher demonstrating how to use a strap on sex toy in a number of different positions In one image , the teacher even shows how to insert the strap on while her buttocks are in the air and her legs up over her head In another image , the woman shows the children how to wear a harness to which the strap on is attached Clinton Middle School in Duval County hired 39 year old Sharon Mercer to teach the sex education class but after the photos emerged she was suspended and the school refused further comment Mercer claimed her suspension was an act of bigotry because she was a proud member of the LGBTQ community Newly implemented Common Core educational standards have been assailed for their attempt to create a lowest common denominator form of teaching which many assert only works to dumb down lessons and prevent smart students from excelling The teaching of so called alternative sexual lifestyles is being practiced in many states under Common Core as a result of sexual content finding its way into other subjects A school district in Arizona banned a Common Core approved book last year after it was found to contain sexually explicit passages that described scenes of bondage Common Core , which is being federally imposed on states across the nation , is a huge shift in teaching which opponents assert will eviscerate critical thinking and generally lower standards in the name of inclusiveness and political correctness Numerous examples have emerged of Common Core style exam questions which only serve to cause more confusion and frustration Perhaps the most infamous example of how Common Core will manifest itself in America 's schooling system was illustrated by a bizarre video in which a Common Core curriculum director said that 3 x 4 11 could be considered a correct answer so long as students could explain how they reached that number Common Core 's sex education content has also faced fierce criticism , with one group even claiming that it represents pornography which serves to desensitize children to sexual contact and could lead to an increased chance of molestation within the schooling system Common Core approved book aimed at 11th graders contains sexually explicit scenes of bondage What is taught includes teaching inappropriate sexuality skills , that should n't even be taught in college , writes Joseph R John According to child psychologists , the children are not mentally equipped to understand the detailed sexual indoctrination starting in kindergarten , they are indoctrinated in sexual practices that they should never be exposed to There is a heavy socio political content of sex throughout Common Core curriculum being taught in every grade and in every subject , the student is taught that there is a sameness of gender , there is no longer simply boys and girls according to Common Core , notes John The sexual content of Common Core crosses into every curriculum taught , from teaching sexuality skills in sex education courses by specially skilled and trained sex education teachers Sexual activities and content in included in every subject taught Sex is taught in the English curriculum , is included in the language curriculum , sex is woven into the science curriculum , in the math curriculum , in the social studies curriculum , and of course in biology As the backlash grows , more and more states are considering abolishing Common Core altogether , with Indiana 's decision earlier this year to ditch the program seen as a victory for conservatives FOLLOW Paul Joseph Watson https twitter com PrisonPlanet Paul Joseph Watson is the editor at large of Infowars com and Prison Planet com Print this page
