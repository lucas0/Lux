Every parent is terrified of making a mistake Not even concerning the big things It could be as easy as I hope that was the kind of sandwich he likes when packing your son 's lunch But the worst nightmare of every single parent is having your kids taken away from you For one mom in Cambridgeshire , this nightmare became reality after she did something most parents have probably done The mother , who remains unnamed , had her two young children stripped from her hands after continually ignoring advice That advice \? Do n't let your kids sleep in your bed Social workers raised concerns after they saw bruises on both kids Social workers advised both parents to stop letting their kids sleep in the family bed , but they did not take the advice A judge says he believes the bruises are unintentional , but were still caused by excessive force and rough handling by both parents The youngest boy had bruises and a broken wrist when he was just months old The case is kind of odd , because the judge says he has no doubts this mom loves her kids and keeps saying she was n't intentionally hurting her kids , but he says she 's still abusing them by co sleeping He also was shown evidence how this mother always thinks she knows best and ignores everyone 's advice The children were both taken from their parents and , at the judge 's discretion , were put up for adoption The claim is that after being warned by professionals since the birth of her first child to not allow the children to co sleep with them , neither parent took any measure to protect their children The entire case seems fishy , and as though they 're not revealing more aspects of the story that would make everything connect It 's still a scary thought , though Thinking your kids could be taken away from you due to something so simple What do you think \?
