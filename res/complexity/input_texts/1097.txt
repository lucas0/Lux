The skeletal remains removed from a shallow grave at the Clinton estate in Chappaqua, New York has been identified as Miriam Loomis, who went missing in 1985 from Houston, Texas. Loomis, who was 20 when she disappeared, told friends she was headed to the Big Apple to be a dancer. She was described as beautiful, funny and outgoing but not overly street smart.How did a dancer from Texas end up buried on the grounds of the Clinton Estate 32 years later? That will be the question the FBI has to answer. The Clintons havenâ€™t owned the estate that long, so if they were somehow responsible, how did she get there? Bill would have had to have traveled with her remains and buried them when he put down roots.The other theory being floated around is that the girl was held captive and killed later on. The medical examiner is currently trying to determine cause and date of death. Until then all we know is a young woman who would fit the type Bill Clinton likes was found dead on his property. That seems like a pretty good start to a serious investigation. Facts can come later.
