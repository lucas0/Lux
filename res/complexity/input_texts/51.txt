12 52 p m April 7 , 2015Getting his Republican friends and supporters to say this was all a misunderstanding does not change the fact that Rep Hurd was appointed to the committee and that he himself is the one who said he was quitting the committee to focus on other committees If anyone mischaracterized the events it 's Rep Hurd I think any rational person would think that if this was all a clerical error then you would expect that to be stated in the letter Instead of just saying it was a clerical error , he gave an entirely different reason If anyone here was being dishonest , it 's Rep Hurd But I would also add that I find it incredibly difficult to believe that Rep Hurd and his staff only found out about the appointment from a committee press release on 1 23 The Congressional Record from the 1 13 , the day that committees were announced , lists Hurd as being on the small biz cmte It was announced on the House floor , approved by unanimous consent and printed in the record Here 's the link and I also attached as a pdf http thomas loc gov cgi bin query D \? r114 3 temp r114zfJ0fa That does n't prove or disprove our statement but , considering how much anticipation there is for committee assignments , I find it completely implausible to believe that neither Rep Hurd nor any member of his staff either saw the announcement on the House floor or read the congressional record So perhaps he was appointed in error but this was not a typo on a press release all the things we said were true according the the record , he clearly was in fact appointed to the committee , and according to his own letter , he did resign and he did give as his reason a desire to focus on his other committees
