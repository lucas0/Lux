Well, this is about as shame-inducing as it gets.A new viral video, produced by Everlast (yep, the boxing company), shows young men in Lima, Peru getting a big surprise during a catcall session.

After the young men embarrassed themselves with offensive exclamations like "tasty panties" and "Hello, piggy," the women revealed themselves.
