INTRODUCTIONChina is mass producing China is mass producing plastic rice – and it causes some very serious health problems. China’s Wuchang rice is extremely popular and well-known due to its fragrant smell and distinct taste – costing almost double the price of normal rice.With the demand for Wuchang rice so high, companies have started to exploit the opportunity and create fake rice which they sell for the same high price.It is thought that China has been producing this fake “Wuchang rice” for at least four years, recreating the popular product using potatoes, It is thought that China has been producing this fake “Wuchang rice” for at least four years, recreating the popular product using potatoes, sweet potatoes and some poisonous plastic for good measure.

Companies have managed to get away with selling this According to, distributors have stated that selling artificial rice is extremely profitable, particularly in the enormous quantities that are currently in demand. Companies have managed to get away with selling this synthetic product for over four years until they recently started to distribute it outside of China to countries such as India, Vietnam and Singapore.The National Food Authority of the Republic of the Philippines is now in the process of investigating reports of The National Food Authority of the Republic of the Philippines is now in the process of investigating reports of plastic rice and is utilizing a spectroscopy device to detect whether or not the rice in question is legitimate.

Bisphenol A has the ability to disrupt the functions of our hormones, particularly estrogen. It has been linked to effects on reproductive development in several animal studies.Meanwhile, phthalates are a group of “plasticizers” that are found in various products, despite having been banned in the EU since 2005. Phthalates can also Meanwhile, phthalates are a group of “plasticizers” that are found in various products, despite having been banned in the EU since 2005. Phthalates can also disrupt hormones ; however, unlike bisphenol A it is testosterone that is affected.Each of us likely has a detectable amount of both phthalates and bisphenol A in our bodies due to the contamination of food products that are stored in plastic containers.

His surprising tactics could make your life easier and give you the peace of mind you deserve.Don't just take my word for it... Don't just take my word for it... watch his short video and decide for yourself.To begin, I apologize for the dark nature of today's email. To begin, I apologize for the dark nature of today's email.However I promise what you'll discover today will be completely worth it.Imagine a rotting corpse draped over your body from head to toe......suffocating tissue, restricting blood flow, damaging joints and infecting your healthy cells.Shockingly, that nightmare is a reality for most :64% of women and 74% of men carry too much body fat according to the National Institutes of Health.It's choking their organs, assaulting their metabolism and sucking their energy dry.But here's the worst part:For most, this bodyfat has become "calorie-resistant":It's completely unaffected by even the strictest diets... and most intense exercises.This zombie fat is essentially... "dead tissue".That's important for those who have 10, 25 or 50 or more pounds to lose...AND for those who aren't technically overweight, but have what's called "pocket obesity"......unsightly patches of fat that cling to specific places, like:just above your hips, lower belly, where your butt and legs meet... and even arms, neck and face.However, there's good news:Obesity researchers have now discovered a "metabolic jumper cable":It jolts dead bodyfat back to life.This allows your metabolism to burn it as calories and re-energize your entire body.First though, here's the #1 reason why bodyfat becomes calorie-resistant:It lacks blood flow. This has 3 effects:Not enough oxygen or nutrients reach fat cells, so they become unresponsive.. Released fat can't be sent to other tissues to be burned, so fat cells suck it back in... 3) Metabolic hormones carrying the "burn calories" message don't reach the fat cell...All this means one thing:Your body can't transform into energy, the 135,000+ of calories the average person stores as fat!You become a metabolic zombie: NO energy to think. NO energy to move. NO energy to motivate.Update: calorie-resistant bodyfat can be now removed...The discovery of this "metabolic jumper cable" can now reverse this process:It wakes up un-responsive bodyfat with a powerful calorie-burning hormonal jolt....It wakes up un-responsive bodyfat with a powerful calorie-burning hormonal jolt.... It pops open fat cells, sucks out the fat, sending it off before its yanked back in...It pops open fat cells, sucks out the fat, sending it off before its yanked back in... It shuttles fat to your brain, heart, lungs, kidneys - even your bones - to be burned as energy.Not only do those layers of "zombie fat" start coming off, but your entire body just works better.Plus, as your whole body burns more calories, those patches of pocket obesity whittle away.This "metabolic jumper cable" isn't any exercise, machine or pill.It's a little-known, calorie-burning hormone we all have... just waiting for the right spark to come alive.It's not It's not thyroid , leptin, ghrelin, insulin, adiponectin, HGH or any other "fat loss" hormone you may know.And on And on this next page , you'll find out precisely how to unleash its calorie-burning power:PS - Studies show that not only can healthy levels of this powerful calorie-burning hormone devour bodyfat and fortify soft muscle, but it can also reduce your risk of diabetes by 53.7%, a heart attack by 83.3% and stroke by 51.4%.

And all these foods are stripped of the anti-oxidants and anti-inflammatories that help your body detox. The result? Your body expends huge amounts of calories to eliminate some toxins—the rest, it stores in your fat to protect you. This is why most people are hungry all the time. They’re not getting energy they need.”“So… what’s going on with me? Why am I losing weight but not going hungry?”Liz paused, then dropped the bombshell.Your body is designed to burn fat. You just have to let it.“What? I thought we were designed to store fat?!?” We were Skyping and I was practically shouting. Then I heard Liz say…What good is a fat reserve if you can’t burn it?Mind blown.Liz continued: “You’re drinking smoothies packed with phytonutrients, anti-oxidants and anti-inflammatories that pull toxins out of you like a tractor beam. Allowing your body to burn those toxin-filled fat stores… and releasing tremendous amounts of stored energy.”So that’s why I’m losing weight without going hungry.Watch Liz’ free presentation.
