PREMIER ballerina Darcey Bussell took centre stage at the launch of a series of prints of paintings of herself commissioned by a Gerrards Cross company to help raise funds for the Alzheimer's Society.The limited edition prints were unveiled at the Royal Opera House last month, produced from three original water colour portraits by Chalfont St Peter water colour artist Gordon King.They were commissioned by Ever English Ltd and 1,000 limited edition prints have been produced of each portrait which will be sold either direct from the company or over the internet.Ever English hopes to donate more than £50 from the sale of each print to the Alzheimer's Society.The Darcey Bussell collection was the first venture for Neil Buckley since he set up the company last year.Mr Buckley, who already has an import business, decided he wanted to start up an export business and at the same time help a charity. He has had personal experience of the effects of Alheimzer's through his late father-in-law and chose to donate part of the proceeds to the charity.Mr Buckley said: "I have known Gordon King for about 20 years. I approached Darcey Bussell out of the blue and she was very willing to help from the start." He accompanied Mr King to the Royal Opera House to do the original sketches and photographs.The launch also provided the latest project for website design company E-creation, also in Gerrards Cross, which Mr Buckley found through the Register of Accredited Service Providers supported by Thames Valley Business Link.He said: "It was not only the quality of service, but the level of support that E-creation provided which was impressive."The prints, priced between £225 and £265 are being sold either direct from Ever English Ltd at 31 Howards Wood Drive, Gerrards Cross, Bucks SL9 7HR or via the internet at www.everenglish.com
