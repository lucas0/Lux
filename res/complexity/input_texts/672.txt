US Defense Department said it is now investigatingTurkey's president has said it was wrong for the United States to deliver military supplies to Kurdish fighters defending the Syrian city of Kobane after some of the weapons ended up in ISIS' hands.The Pentagon claims the vast majority of the U.S. supplies dropped over the weekend had reached the Kurdish fighters despite an online video showing jihadists in possession of a bundle.Tayyip Erdogan today said the mission had been a mistake - adding that he could not understand why the U.S. was so keen to defend Kobane as there were no longer any citizens in the city.The weapons drop had been considered a highly sensitive subject for Turkey, who says the Kurdish fighter provided with American weapons are linked to the Kurdish People’s Protection Unit (YPG) – a group Ankara considers to be a terrorist organisation.Scroll down for videoError: Turkish president Tayyip Erdogan said it was wrong for the United States to deliver military supplies to Kurdish fighters defending the Syrian city of Kobane after some of the weapons ended up in ISIS' handsA still from an Islamic State (ISIS) video, purportedly shows an IS militant displaying the content of a crate carrying grenades near the town of Ain al-Arab, known by the Kurds as Kobane, on the Syria-Turkey borderSpeaking at a news conference in Ankara today, Erdogan described the weapons drop as a mistake.'What was done here on this subject turned out to be wrong. Why did it turn out wrong? Because some of the weapons they dropped from those C130s were seized by ISIL,’ he said, using an alternative acronym for ISIS.Asked about a plan for Turkey to facilitate the passage of Iraqi Kurdish peshmerga fighters to Kobane to help in its defence, Erdogan said he proposed this move in a telephone call with Barack Obama at the weekend.'I have difficulty understanding why KobanE is so strategic for them because there are no civilians there, just around 2,000 fighters,' Erdogan said.'At first they didn't say yes to peshmergas, but then they gave a partial yes and we said we would help.'He added that talks were continuing among officials on the details of the peshmergas' transit through Turkey.One Turkish journalist close to the government said on Wednesday some 500 of them were expected to cross into Kobani this weekendA U.S. military airdrop of weapons meant for Kurdish fighters fell into the hands of their jihadist foes near the Syrian battleground town of Kobane, the Syrian Observatory for Human Rights saidEarlier, the US Defense Department said is investigating video footage appearing to show Islamic State fanatics with at least one cache of weapons airdropped by coalition forces that was meant for Kurdish militiamen battling the extremist group in a border town.The cache of weapons included hand grenades, ammunition and rocket-propelled grenade launchers, according to a video uploaded by a media group loyal to the Islamic State (ISIS) group.The video appeared authentic and corresponded to The Associated Press' reporting of the event.The Britain-based Syrian Observatory for Human Rights, which bases its information on a network of activists on the ground, said the militants had seized at least one cache.The caches were airdropped early Monday to Kurds in the embattled Syrian town of Kobane that lies near the Turkish border.The caches were airdropped early Monday to Kurds in the embattled Syrian town of Kobani that lies near the Turkish borderA container filled with meals ready to eat and fresh water being dropped from a C-130 Hercules during an operational resupply airdrop near the area of Bayji, IraqThe militant group has been trying to seize the town for over a month now, causing the exodus of some 200,000 people from the area into Turkey. While Kurds are battling on the ground, a U.S.-led coalition is also targeting the militants from the air.Yesterday ISIS loyalists on social media posted sarcastic thank you notes to the United States, including one image that said 'Team USA.'But the lost weapons drop was more an embarrassment than a great strategic loss.The Islamic State militants already possess millions of dollars-worth of U.S. weaponry that they captured from fleeing Iraqi soldiers when the group seized swaths of Iraq in a sudden sweep in June.On Tuesday, the U.S. Central Command said U.S. military forces conducted four airstrikes near Kobani that destroyed IS fighting positions, an IS building and a large IS unit.Also Tuesday, Syrian government airstrikes hit a rebel-held town along the country's southern border with Jordan, killing at least eight people.Militant: ISIS has been trying to seize the town for over a month now, causing the exodus of some 200,000 people from the area into TurkeyCheckpoints: The Islamic State already has millions of dollars-worth of U.S. weaponry that they captured from fleeing Iraqi soldiers when the group seized swaths of Iraq in a sudden sweep in JuneActivists with the Local Coordination Committees and the Observatory said the number of those killed was likely to rise as there are more victims under the rubble.The LCC said Syrian government planes dropped crude explosives-laden canisters on the town of Nasib on the Syria-Jordan border.The airstrikes are part of battles between Syrian government forces and Islamic rebel groups for control of the area.
