Ally Louia , a 26 year old girl went to the hospital yesterday to visit her grandpa , who was suffering from lung cancer When the nurse and other family members were n't present , the young girl decided to disconnect the life support from her grandpa , because she needed to charge her phone Let 's see my phone was at 1 , which can be described as a critical situation Besides , my mother asked me to text her how my grandpa was doing right after getting to the hospital , so I had to do it , Louia said in the defense Not only she sent a message to her mom , Ally decided to take some pictures of her grandma to upload them to Instagram No way , I just did it to prove them that he was okay And yes , it 's true that he was turning blue , but I thought that that was an Instagram filter , Ally said , referring to the moment when the old man started suffering the lack of oxygen People could have also warned me , instead of just tapping Like' , she complained Fortunately , the old man could reach a control and call the infirmary , and doctors got there on time to help him They freaked out when they realized that the respirator was turned off I asked them if there was another socket in the room but they did n't answer I think it 's unfair that there was only one socket , said Louia After the incident , Ally 's family is completely angered I understand your anger and I share it But we gotta look for solutions We either buy one of those external batteries for my phone or we buy another one , Ally concluded
