Plus, North Koreans love whisky.”It would be the second North Korean government restaurant to open in Europe after one popped up in Amsterdam in 2012.The food outlets channel 30% of their takings back to the capital Pyongyang but critics think the cash will be trousered by Kim to fund his own lavish lifestyle.As well as being hooked on whisky, Kim is addicted to Swiss Emmental cheese, which is partly to blame for his huge weight gain.It is claimed he imports vast quantities of the fatty treat into North Korea at huge expense despite millions of his countrymen living in abject poverty.Mr Madden said: “The restaurants are one of the few ways to experience North Korean culture without having to go there.“They are done like a franchise with the state renting the brand out to other Koreans to run but they tailor the menus to suit.”North Korea expert Jenny Town said she believed the country has “warmed” to Scotland in recent months.She added: “North Korea is going to support any country that is struggling for independence as it continues to seek validation and recognition of its own legitimacy.”The North Korean Embassy in London did not respond to requests for a comment.
