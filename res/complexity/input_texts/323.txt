b'A coalition of online retailers backed by Amazon began a seven-figure advertising blitz on Wednesday opposing President Trumps demand that the beleaguered United States Postal Service ratchet up its package delivery rates to avoid bankruptcy amid the coronavirus crisis, its top lobbyist said.\n\nThe coalition intends to spend more than $2 million on the campaign in an attempt to whip up Republican opposition to Mr. Trumps idea, pressing lawmakers instead to support a multibillion-dollar rescue package proposed by Democrats that would help the Postal Service survive the sharp drop in revenue and mail volume caused by the pandemic.\n\nThe ads began running nationally Wednesday night on Fox Newss Hannity  one of Mr. Trumps favorite programs  and will be featured on Rush Limbaughs radio show on Thursday. They do not mention the president, but label his proposal to jack up delivery prices by 400 percent a massive package tax on small businesses and Americans who rely on the mail for prescription drugs and other goods.\n\nAmazon, CVS and others involved in the campaign rely on the Postal Service for delivery of millions of packages a year and could see significant business disruptions if the agency had to sharply increase rates or went bankrupt.'
