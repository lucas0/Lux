Thank god for Ron Howard because I will not go to see nor support anything that she now has a part in ! I'm disgusted by her lack of commitment to our country What she did was an absolute disgrace and embarrassment to herself and any company that endor ses her To get up there and talk down about anyone is humiliating how would she like it if the golden globe awards got up there publicly and stated what a terrible horrific actress she is or how homely of a woman she is \? How would she feel \? She has ruined what career she had left in my eyes I'm done with her ! Julia Roberts , George Clooney , Angelina Joelle , all of them ! Im disgusted by the very nature of them now These people are filthy rich and yet I do n't see them talking about the poor disabled white boy recently kidnapped and brutally beaten and cut up and stomped on and the horrific acts these 4 black vigilantes did to him I do n't see any of them covering that recent act of racist hate crime , nope not a one of those bastards are talking about it , but yet she has time to talk about Donald Trump , whom btw has done nothing All of these rich celebrities and not one of them have created any jobs or built any factories or manufacturing plants to employee people here in the USA In fact , not one of them own a mission or organization for the homeless people here in the USA either so why do these losers even have a voice \? They have millions and millions of dollars and yet they do n't build low income housing for the needy or build hospitals to help the poor people None of them They are all greedy bastards They all disgust me Angelina Jolle being at the top of the list ! Move out of our country , now and take your stupid range rovers and Gucci hand bags with you ! You are all an embarrassment to the world
