Tidal deformations of the Earth due to motions of the Sun and Moon cause changes in the stress state , which may trigger earthquakes The possibility of tidal triggering of earthquakes has been investigated since the 19th century1 , and numerous studies have examined this topic2 , 3 , 4 , 5 , 6 , 7 , 8 Statistically significant correlations between seismicity and tidal stress have been discovered using large data sets , but the correlations are generally limited to special regions or circumstances For example , seismicity was correlated with tidal stress changes before three large earthquakes in Sumatra7 and before the 2011 Tohoku Oki earthquake in Japan8 While such observations are of interest in the field of probabilistic earthquake forecasting , the governing mechanism that underlies the correlations is unknown In more general cases , tidal stress changes on the order of several kPa are considered too small to control the dynamic rupture processes of earthquakes , which are characterized by stress changes on the order of MPa The recent discovery of deep tectonic tremors in plate boundary regions has slightly modified our view of the relationship between tidal stresses and earthquakes , as these tremors are sometimes highly sensitive to tidal stress changes9 , 10 , 11 , 12 , 13 , with tremor rates showing an exponential increase in proportion to the applied encouraging stress11 , 12 , 13 Thus , even stress changes of only a few kPa can amplify the tremor rate by several orders As tremors reflect slow slip on the plate interface , tidal stresses also accelerate the slow slip on the plate interface The slow slip may not be restricted in deep plate boundary regions , rather it can be ubiquitous in seismic regions Therefore , such accelerated slow deformation can change the stress state on the entire seismic region , and hence increase the probability of earthquakes While such slow deformation is dependent on the amplitude of the tidal stress , most previous studies on this topic have investigated only the phase of the tidal stress rather than its amplitude The amplitude of the tidal stress increases at times of syzygies \( new moon or full moon \) and spring tides in the ocean , which occur at periodicities of 14 8 days Several studies have investigated the relationship between syzygies and earthquakes Kennedy et al noted that large \( M7 0 \) earthquakes appear to occur more frequently near times of syzygies , but they could not confirm the relationship statistically5 In fact , the relationship tends to weaken and disappear as smaller events are considered To investigate the possible effects of the tidal stress amplitude on earthquake occurrence , we calculated temporal changes in tidal stress components on a known earthquake fault plane , as described in the Methods 21 , 22 , 23 , 24 , 25 Figure 1 shows tidal shear stresses before and after the three most recent large earthquakes The 2004 Sumatra and 2010 Maule earthquakes both occurred near the time of a full moon , close to the peak of the tidal shear stress The 2011 Tohoku Oki earthquake , on the other hand , occurred near the time of a neap tide \( Fig 1b \) Nevertheless , the tidal shear stress showed consistently large amplitude around the time of the Tohoku Oki earthquake Many very large earthquakes have occurred close to the time of large shear stresses caused by syzygies , as shown in Supplementary Fig 1 However , the correlation between the tidal shear stress and earthquake occurrence is not always clear , as at least three events \( 15 11 2006 , 13 01 2007 , and 12 09 2007 \) in Supplementary Fig 1 did not correlate with large tidal stress , and a deterministic relationship has not been demonstrated Figure 1 Tidal shear stress for the period 30 days before and after three large earthquakes a , The 2004 Sumatra earthquake b , The 2011 Tohoku Oki earthquake c , The 2010 Chile Maule earthquake Left Location maps and focal mechanism Right shear stress changes resolved on the fault plane in the direction of slip Stars represent the timing of the earthquakes and the stress levels at that time Full size image Because the amplitude variations of the tidal stress are not always regular \( Fig 1 and Supplementary Fig 1 \) , a simple phase analysis that assumes a constant period may not be effective in examining the effect of tidal stress on seismicity Therefore , as an alternative , the relationship between the maximum tidal shear stress during the one day preceding an earthquake \( the coseismic maximum \) and the daily maxima during the 15 days before the event \( the preseismic period \) were examined , and the ranking \( 1 for the lowest , 15 for the highest \) of the coseismic maximum was recorded \( Supplementary Fig 2 \) The coseismic maximum rankings for the Sumatra , Tohoku Oki , and Maule earthquakes are 11 , 13 , and 15 , respectively The choice of a one day period was based on the assumption that slow deformation due to tidal stresses has a certain duration , and also because some preparation processes might occur before an earthquake The assumption of a one day period is convenient for also capturing the potential effects of the normal stress4 , which is often correlated \( positively or negatively \) with the shear stress , and the timing of both the positive and negative peaks of the normal and Coulomb stresses typically falls within the one day period Nevertheless , since the period measuring the coseismic maximum \( coseismic period \) is arbitrary , we also test two cases , by recording the ranking of the coseismic maximum in half day or two days in 15 or 14 days of the preseismic period , respectively The calculations of rankings were made for all events in the Global Central Moment Tensor \( CMT \) catalogue14 exceeding M w 5 5 Figure 2 shows histograms of rankings for shallow \( depth 100 km \) events in the Global CMT catalogue , with different thresholds for the minimum magnitude Figure 2a , b shows the dominance of large rankings \( 75 or 40 in the five large rankings \) for the largest 12 and 123 events , respectively The differences between bins diminish as the number of events increases , and the difference is small for earthquakes exceeding M w 5 5 \( 10 , 000 events \) \( Fig 2d \) The distribution in Fig 2d is indistinguishable from the distribution made by random sampling of event timing Thus , if only the frequency of medium and large earthquakes is examined , a correlation between earthquake occurrence and the amplitude of the tidal stress would be rejected , as concluded by Kennedy and colleagues5 Figure 2 Histograms of stress level ranking for different magnitude thresholds a d , Ranking of the maximum shear stress on the day of an earthquake , as compared with the daily maxima during the 15 days before the event , for earthquakes larger than magnitude thresholds of M w 8 2 \( a \) , M w 7 5 \( b \) , M w 6 5 \( c \) and M w 5 5 \( d \) Results are based on the Global CMT Full size image A more complex but better fitting interpretation of the data in Fig 2 , however , is that for more than 10 , 000 events of M w 5 5 in the catalogue , an event that occurred under a large tidal stress had a greater likelihood of growing to an M w 8 event Such an interpretation would indicate that the slope of the power law size frequency statistic \( that is , the b value of the Gutenberg Richter relationship \) is different for each ranking of the tidal stress Figure 3a shows size frequency statistics and b values \( with standard deviations \) estimated using the maximum likelihood method26 As expected from Fig 2 , the b value decreases as the stress ranking increases For the bottom five stress rankings , the b value is 1 15 , but the b value decreases to 0 93 for the top five stress rankings The difference is statistically significant , as confirmed by Utsu s test27 \( see Methods \) Similar results are obtained for different coseismic periods \( Supplementary Figs 3 and 4 \) Figure 3 Estimated b values and size frequency statistics a , Global shallow earthquakes larger than M w 6 5 b , Low angle thrust type earthquakes in northeastern Japan , larger than M w 4 5 c , Strike slip type earthquakes in southern California , larger than M 2 5 Top open circles show the b values independently estimated for 15

Bottom magnitude frequency statistics Each line represents the statistics for a shear stress level shown in the corresponding colour in the top panel Three dashed lines show distributions corresponding to b 0 9 , 1 0 , and 1 1 Full size image In the global catalogue , differences in b values are less clear for events of M w 6 5 , possibly because the catalogue includes events with various focal mechanisms in diverse tectonic environments , and hence mixes events with a wide range of b values17 , 18 To consider more homogeneous tectonic environments and less variable focal mechanisms , we also separately analysed earthquakes occurring in Japan and California \( see Methods \) Figure 3b shows results using the F net MT catalogue15 for a relatively homogeneous region in northeastern Japan , including the Hokkaido and Tohoku regions Only low angle thrust type earthquakes are considered because they have fairly uniform b value , although similar results are obtained for all events Since thrust type earthquakes have a relatively small b value18 , b values are generally small Moreover , the b values decrease with increasing stress levels , and very small b values \( 0 7 \) are observed in cases of large tidal stress levels Figure 3c presents another example of strike slip type earthquakes from The Refined Earthquake Focal Mechanism Catalog for Southern California 16 The b values are generally large , with slightly smaller values for higher tidal stress levels , although the significance is weaker than other two cases Similar results are obtained for longer coseismic periods \( Supplementary Fig 3 \) , but the trend is relatively weak for half day coseismic period \( Supplementary Fig 4 \) , suggesting the importance of diurnal tides In northeastern Japan , the separation of size frequency statistic curves is visible even for events of M w 5 \( Fig 3b \) , indicating that tidal controls are apparent for smaller earthquakes in some environments In Fig 3b , among the 237 and 263 events of M w 4 5 , 116 and 98 grew into events larger than M w 5 , for higher \( 11 15 \) and lower \( 1 5 \) rankings , respectively Assuming that the earthquake growth process between two sizes is governed by a binomial distribution with probability p 98 263 for low stress rankings , the chance that we have 116 events over M w 5 from 237 events of M w 4 5 is smaller than 10 4 The correspondence of small b values and earthquakes with large shear stresses is consistent with evidence from previous studies on acoustic emissions in rock experiments , showing decreasing b values with increasing differential stresses19 , 20 , variations in b values with the type of earthquake focal mechanism18 , and positive correlations between b values and the ages of subducting plates worldwide17 Although the growth processes of dynamic rupture are not fully understood , one hypothesis is that growth occurs via a cascading process in a hierarchical system , from a tiny rock failure to a giant earthquake28 , 29 Rupture is accelerated and decelerated controlled by energy balance , and small changes of stress distribution may determine growth and arrest of rupture29 , 30 Based on this type of model , it is possible to interpret the observation that large tidal stresses correspond to a high probability of cascading rupture growth , which is the probability of an event progressing from small to large scales Small tidal stress can enhance slow deformation in various scales , and resultant stress redistribution is likely to increase the cascading probability of nearly critical dynamic rupture
