Unfortunately they could not tell us the address of the person who bought him.(Image: PA)"This case highlights the potential consequences of selling an animal online as it often leads to the impulse buying of pets that people know very little about."Regardless of the fact Kai was left with his belongings, this was still a cruel incident and we are keen to identify the person responsible. If anyone can help we would ask them to get in touch as soon as possible."Kai is around two to three years old and is a lovely dog with a nice nature. We will look after him until we can find him a permanent and loving home."Station staff looked after Kai until the Scottish SPCA arrived at the scene on Friday.He is now being cared for at the charity's centre in Glasgow.The charity said abandoning an animal is an offence under the Animal Health and Welfare (Scotland) Act 2006 and anyone found guilty of doing so can expect to be banned from keeping animals for a fixed period or life.
