DID YOU KNOW \? Trump Won 3 , 084 out of 3 , 151 Counties Hillary Only Won 57DID YOU KNOW \? Trump Won 3 , 084 out of 3 , 151 Counties Hillary Only Won 57Politics By Eren Moreno December 1 , 2016Are you growing tired of liberals crying over the so called popular vote , as if Hillary Clinton is some beloved disenfranchised leader \? There are rules to the contest , and Trump won fair and square The rest is just noise and sore loser whining If she wants , Hillary can go be the governor of California , or President of Saudi Arabia Aside from her popularity in the ultra liberal strongholds California and New York , the final election breakdown of the numbers shows what an ass kickin' Hillary received from the American people From Allen West The keening and caterwauling we 've been treated to by the left since Hillary Clinton 's defeat has been monumental Most entertaining has been the snowflake retreat to safe spaces with puppies and coloring books to assuage their anguish Less entertaining were the violent protests whichwere paid foreruptedPutting aside Jill Stein 's quixotic effort to force a recount , the left has been loudest with its demands to dismantle the Electoral College After all it 's unfair Hillary Clinton won the popular vote so she should win , right \? Wrong Our Founders in their infinite wisdom created the Electoral College to ensure the STATES were fairly represented Why should one or two densely populated areas speak for the whole of the nation \? The following list of statistics has been making the rounds on the Internet and it should finally put an end to the argument as to why the Electoral College makes sense Share this with as many whiners as you can There are 3 , 141 counties in the United States Trump won 3 , 084 of them Clinton won 57 There are 62 counties in New York State Trump won 46 of them Clinton won 16 Clinton won the popular vote by approx 1 5 million votes In the 5 counties that encompass NYC , \( Bronx , Brooklyn , Manhattan , Richmond Queens \) Clinton received well over 2 million more votes than Trump \( Clinton only won 4 of these counties Trump won Richmond \) Therefore these 5 counties alone , more than accounted for Clinton winning the popular vote of the entire country These 5 counties comprise 319 square miles The United States is comprised of 3 , 797 , 000 square miles When you have a country that encompasses almost 4 million square miles of territory , it would be ludicrous to even suggest that the vote of those who inhabit a mere 319 square miles should dictate the outcome of a national election Large , densely populated Democrat cities \( NYC , Chicago , LA , etc \) do n't and should n't speak for the rest of our country Support the Trump Presidency and help us fight Liberal Media Bias Please LIKE and SHARE this story on Facebook or Twitter
