The entertainment industry is reeling this morning after one of their rising stars , Michelle Wolf , has been fired from her show on Comedy Central She was also dismissed as a contributing writer on The Daily Show The move comes after Wolf 's brutal takedown of Sarah Huckabee Sanders at the White House Correspondent 's dinner I think she 's very resourceful , like she burns facts and then she uses that ash to create a perfect smokey eye Maybe she 's born with it , maybe it 's lies What she obviously meant , if you listen to just about anyone , was that Sanders is a fat pig with lazy eye Is n't it obvious \? Comedy Central thought so and dropped the hammer CEO Art Tubolls released a statement Comedy Central does n't take it lightly when a member of our team throws a compliment out that the whole world takes as an insult It was uncalled for Michelle should have anticipated people 's reaction and softened the speech to suit the needs of the room Yes , that seems perfectly reasonable Wolf , who 99 3 percent of conservatives had never heard of before this morning 's news that she was n't funny , is suing for wrongful termination We 'll keep you updated
