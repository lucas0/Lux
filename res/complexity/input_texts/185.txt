According to The Guardian , Obama 's new database would be gathered by asking individual volunteers to log into Obama 's reelection site using their Facebook credentials Consciously or otherwise , The Guardian states , the individual volunteer will be injecting all the information they store publicly on their Facebook page home location , date of birth , interests and , crucially , network of friends directly into the central Obama database Facebook had no problem with such activity then They do now There 's a reason for that The former Obama director of integration and media analytics stated that , during the 2012 campaign , Facebook allowed the Obama team to suck out the whole social graph Facebook was surprised we were able to suck out the whole social graph , but they did n't stop us once they realized that was what we were doing She added , They came to the office in the days following election recruiting were very candid that they allowed us to do things they would n't have allowed someone else to do because they were on our side Not so with Trump As soon as Facebook realized that Cambridge Analytica had pursued a similar strategy , they suspended the firm Again , this is n't surprising Since Trump 's election , Democrats in search of a rationale for their favored candidate 's defeat have blamed a bevy of social media outlets Senate Democrats trotted out pathetic Russian created memes on Facebook , viewed by a handful of human beings , as an excuse for Hillary 's loss Democrats claimed without evidence that fake news had swamped Facebook and thus led to Trump 's victory Democrats have also insisted that Facebook be regulated Sen Dianne FeinsteinDianne Emiel Feinstein The unintended perils of investigating Kavanaugh Overnight Energy Groups want Senate to probe Interior watchdog controversy Puerto Rico eyes plan for 100 percent clean energy Dems say Congress already rejected part of EPA car emissions plan Dems Congress rejected part of Trump 's car emissions rollback MORE \( D Calif \) raged , You 've created these platforms , and now they 're being misused , and you have to be the ones to do something about it Or we will Facebook 's former privacy manager called for the government to step into an oversight role regarding Facebook In February , Wired magazine ran a cover story specifically dealing with Facebook 's role in the election of 2016 , and their subsequent attempts to fix the problem After the election , Mark ZuckerbergBarack Hussein Obama Obama takes jab at Trump Nobody in my administration got indicted' Trump creates national monument in Kentucky Election Countdown Latest glimpse at fundraising highlights Dem edge Cook moves Menendez race to toss up Heated Missouri Senate debate O'Rourke scrambling to win Latino voters Bloomberg spending big for Dem candidates DNC talks 2020 debates MORE , apparently in an attempt to convince Obama that he was serious about stopping the misuse of the platform And in February , Zuckerberg said he wanted to re jigger the algorithms on his platform to benefit content that Facebook deems trustworthy , informative , and local Wired celebrated You ca n't make the world more open and connected if you 're breaking it apart The result of Facebook 's algorithmic changes conservatives have been slammed And that 's the point A study from The Western Journal found that conservative sites have lost an average of 14 percent of their Facebook traffic leftist sites saw a minor increase Even major publications saw that effect The New York Daily News saw a bump of 24 18 percent , while the New York Post dropped 11 44 percent And that 's the goal in covering Cambridge Analytica , and Russian interference on Twitter , and all the rest even without any serious information suggesting that such interference shifted votes , the left can rest assured that its Silicon Valley allies will act to de platform Republicans and conservatives There 's a reason Twitter has suspended alt right racists but continued to recommend that others follow Louis Farrakhan there 's a reason YouTube is being sued by Prager University there 's a reason Google used automatic fact checking on right wing sites but did no such thing for left wing sites We 're in the midst of a radical reshifting in social media Ironically , the people who have stumped against regulation conservatives are those being targeted by social media companies If companies like Facebook , YouTube , Google and Twitter do n't start acting like platforms again rather than like motivated left wing outlets , Republicans likely wo n't let principle outweigh practicality for long Ben Shapiro \( BenShapiro \) , a lawyer and conservative commentator , is founder and editor in chief of The Daily Wire The author of seven books , he hosts a daily political podcast , The Ben Shapiro Show
