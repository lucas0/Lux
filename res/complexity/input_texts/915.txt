b'Mr. Stahl is less well known. In a post he appears to have written to his former high school classmates online, Mr. Stahl described his as a quiet life of a die-hard conservative but gave no hint of the racist bent of his views.He said he worked for three decades in the semiconductor industry, after serving in the Navy for six years. Never married but once engaged, Mr. Stahl described himself as an avid runner, with five marathons under his belt, a four-day-a-week golfer and a failed congressional candidate who learned from that experience that it was a big mistake challenging an entrenched incumbent.'
