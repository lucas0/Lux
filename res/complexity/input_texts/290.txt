The biggest was 22st and 2.78m long, and was also from the Po Delta.Wels catfish can grow as long as 4m and up to 62st. However, it is rare to catch one that is over two meters long.(Image: Facebook)The fish has a ferocious appetite and will consume anything it comes across. They have been filmed eating pigeons that get too close.In December 14-year-old Sam Lee caught a 15st catfish while on holiday in Spain.The Chester schoolboy was with dad Peter when the 2.5m carnivorous fish snatched the live bait at the end of his line.It immediately bolted 100m downstream, but Sam hung on - and eventually landed it after a 35 minute battle.He then posed for a traditional photo to secure bragging rights before letting the creature swim back into the water at the River Ebro in Catalonia.
