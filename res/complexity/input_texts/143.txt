Democrat Senators Fred Marken , Louis Kearns and Gerald Harmon are all under investigation for taking bribes from a PAC fund tied to none other than George Soros The PAC , DemWatch2020 , is run by notorious liberal troublemaker Sandy Batt who has declined to comment Soros , who enjoys Hungarian citizenship , says he does n't care who knows that he buys Congressmen When Charles Koch does it , he 's a patriot When I do it , I'm a criminal The three senators could be guilty of taking dark money if it 's determined that Soros' cash came from overseas At any rate , the timing is criminal in and of itself No elected official is supposed to take campaign contributions of any kind based on a single vote It 's under those pretenses that the House Ethics Committee will investigate
