b'I just had an opportunity to speak with the Floyd family, a group of them  most of them. Theyre a close, decent honorable family, loving one another. Once again, we had the words, heard the words and they heard them, I cant breathe. An act of brutality so elemental, it did more than deny one more black man in America his civil rights and his human rights. It denied him of his very humanity, it denied him his life. You know, this is no time for incendiary tweets. Its no time to encourage violence. This is a national crisis. We need real leadership right now. Leadership that will bring everyone to the table so we can take measures to root out systemic racism. Its time for us to take a hard look at the uncomfortable truths. Its time for us to face that deep open wound we have in this nation. We need justice for George Floyd. We need real police reform, and hold cops to a higher standard that so many of them actually meet. That holds bad cops accountable and repairs relationship between law enforcement and the community theyre sworn to protect. We need to stand up as a nation with the black community, with all minority communities, and come together as one America. Thats the challenge we face.'
