Most Gracious Regent and Lord ! I was born in Kallstadt on March 14 , 1869 My parents were honest , plain , pious vineyard workers They strictly held me to everything good to diligence and piety , to regular attendance in school and church , to absolute obedience toward the high authority After my confirmation , in 1882 , I apprenticed to become a barber I emigrated in 1885 , in my sixteenth year In America I carried on my business with diligence , discretion , and prudence God 's blessing was with me , and I became rich I obtained American citizenship in 1892 In 1902 I met my current wife Sadly , she could not tolerate the climate in New York , and I went with my dear family back to Kallstadt The town was glad to have received a capable and productive citizen My old mother was happy to see her son , her dear daughter in law , and her granddaughter around her she knows now that I will take care of her in her old age But we were confronted all at once , as if by a lightning strike from fair skies , with the news that the High Royal State Ministry had decided that we must leave our residence in the Kingdom of Bavaria We were paralyzed with fright our happy family life was tarnished My wife has been overcome by anxiety , and my lovely child has become sick Why should we be deported \? This is very , very hard for a family What will our fellow citizens think if honest subjects are faced with such a decree not to mention the great material losses it would incur I would like to become a Bavarian citizen again In this urgent situation I have no other recourse than to turn to our adored , noble , wise , and just sovereign lord , our exalted ruler His Royal Highness , highest of all , who has already dried so many tears , who has ruled so beneficially and justly and wisely and softly and is warmly and deeply loved , with the most humble request that the highest of all will himself in mercy deign to allow the applicant to stay in the most gracious Kingdom of Bavaria Your most humble and obedient , Friedrich Trump
