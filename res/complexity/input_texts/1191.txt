Seth Rogen just landed the role to play Christian Bale’s sidekick in Sony’s upcoming biopic on Steve Jobs.Rogen will reportedly don the mantle of Steve Wozniak, according to Variety, in the film written by Aaron Sorkin and directed by Danny Boyle.The film is based on Walter Isaacson’s biography on Steve, and is said to be divided into three long scenes that take place backstage before Apple product launches. Sorkin says the film will portray Jobs as part-hero, part anti-hero, leaving Rogen plenty of room to bring in some comedic relief.Steve Wozniak co-founded Apple with Steve Jobs and was the engineer behind the Apple I and Apple II computers that made Apple a household name in the 1970s. Woz left Apple in 1987, but he still pops up at Apple events and in the headlines with his commentary on the state of tech.Rogen starred in ‘Neighbors’ earlier this year and will be in ‘The Interview’ with James Franco. Other actors haven’t been announced for the Steve Jobs film, but Scott Rudin Mark Gordon and Guymon Casady have been tapped as producers, with shooting rumored to start in Spring of 2015.
