Bart didn’t have a cat in hell’s chance of coming back from the grave — but after being buried for five days, he clawed his way back.The miracle feline’s misfortune started when he was struck by a car and his grief-stricken owner laid him to rest.“The cat appeared to be lifeless and the owner buried him. Five days later, the cat showed up in a neighbor’s yard — alive!” the Humane Society of Tampa Bay in Florida told ABC7.com.The badly hurt, weak and dehydrated kitty dug himself out of the grave and crept back slowly.Bart needed treatment for facial wounds, a broken jaw and a ruined eye — but his owner couldn’t afford a vet, so he took his pal to the Humane Society.There is no purrfect ending yet, however, because Bart — who can’t eat due to pain — still has a lot of recovering to do.He was scheduled to undergo surgery Tuesday to wire his jaw, fix his palette, place a feeding tube and remove his destroyed eye.Despite the difficult days ahead, the Humane Society expects that Bart will be back home soon — enjoying another of his remaining eight lives.
