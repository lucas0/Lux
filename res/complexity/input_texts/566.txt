b'To help provide a detailed picture of the past, present and future of the coronavirus pandemic in the United States, here are five ways of thinking about it in hundreds of metro areas across the country, using data compiled by The New York Times. This page will be updated regularly.\n\n1. The Big Picture: New Cases and Deaths\n\nThe simplest way to track the progress of an outbreak is by seeing how many new cases and deaths are reported in a given area each day. For the United States as a whole, these counts appear to have peaked or are starting to flatten:\n\nNew cases per day United States 0 10,000 20,000 30,000 cases March April May 7-day average New cases New deaths per day United States 0 1,000 2,000 deaths March April May 7-day average New deaths\n\nUse the search box below to see this relationship for any metropolitan area in the U.S., here or in any of the tables below. (Weve set it to the New York City area by default.)\n\nx\n\nNew cases per day New York City area 0 5,000 10,000 15,000 cases March April May 7-day average New cases New deaths per day New York City area 0 500 1,000 1,500 deaths March April May 7-day average New deaths Metro and micropolitan areas are bigger than just the city limits of a given place  they often include the surrounding suburbs and exurbs.\n\n2. Where the Outbreak Is Worst Now\n\nThe metro areas with the most recent cases and deaths, relative to their population, in the last two weeks:\n\nNew cases, last two weeks Metro or micro area Growth in cases Recent cases Per 1,000 1 Gallup, N.M. flat or decreasing 561 7.76 2 Huntsville, Texas flat or decreasing 498 5.71 3 Show Low, Ariz. flattening 575 5.21 4 Sioux City, Iowa flat or decreasing 858 5.08 5 Vineland-Bridgeton, N.J. flat or decreasing 721 4.78 6 Yakima, Wash. flat or decreasing 1,194 4.75 7 El Centro, Calif. still growing 848 4.66 8 Racine, Wis. flat or decreasing 732 3.72 9 Laurel, Miss. flat or decreasing 314 3.70 10 Faribault-Northfield, Minn. flat or decreasing 241 3.62 11 Marion, Ohio flat or decreasing 221 3.39 12 Farmington, N.M. flat or decreasing 418 3.34 13 Salem, Ohio still growing 342 3.33 14 Fargo, N.D. flat or decreasing 770 3.14 15 Montgomery, Ala. still growing 1,162 3.11 79 New York City area flat or decreasing 27,242 1.36 0.5 1 2.5 5 10 20 New deaths, last two weeks Metro or micro area Growth in deaths Recent deaths Per 1,000 1 Milledgeville, Ga. flattening 32 0.60 2 Gallup, N.M. flat or decreasing 35 0.48 3 Farmington, N.M. flat or decreasing 31 0.25 4 Meridian, Miss. flat or decreasing 25 0.25 5 Reading, Pa. flat or decreasing 104 0.25 6 Laurel, Miss. still growing 19 0.22 7 Worcester, Mass. flat or decreasing 210 0.22 8 Trenton-Princeton, N.J. flat or decreasing 80 0.22 9 Sioux City, Iowa still growing 36 0.21 10 New Haven, Conn. flat or decreasing 174 0.20 11 Providence, R.I. flat or decreasing 328 0.20 12 Marion, Ohio still growing 13 0.20 13 Kokomo, Ind. still growing 16 0.19 14 Atlantic City, N.J. flat or decreasing 51 0.19 15 Hartford, Conn. flat or decreasing 225 0.19 31 New York City area flat or decreasing 2,497 0.12 0.025 0.05 0.1 0.2 0.3 0.4 Limited to areas with at least 50,000 people. Flattening means that the number of new cases is still increasing, but the rate of growth is slowing.\n\nHere, weve limited the window of cases to those within the last two weeks. Scaling those cases by the population of the area can help give a sense of the prevalence of the illness there and how strained a communitys health care system may be. Places with curves that are flattening or flat are likely to move down this list over time; those where new cases and deaths continue to increase are on track to move up. (Of course, case counts are subject to variable rates of testing  cases could fall in places simply because fewer tests are being done  so moderate changes in rankings on these tables may not always be meaningful.)\n\n3. Where Outbreaks Might Come Next\n\nThe virus has begun cropping up in new places as it spreads across the country. To identify places that could flare up next, its helpful to look not just at the number of cases but how fast they are rising.\n\nHighest avg. daily growth rate of cases Metro or micro area Recent cases Daily growth rate cases double every... 1 Huntsville, Texas 498 13% 5.6 days 2 Fayetteville-Springdale, Ark. 633 10% 7.1 days 3 Salem, Ohio 342 8% 9.1 days 4 Yuma, Ariz. 619 8% 9.4 days 5 Decatur, Ala. 154 7% 10.0 days 6 Chattanooga, Tenn. 751 7% 10.2 days 7 Abilene, Texas 180 7% 10.3 days 8 Tuscaloosa, Ala. 502 6% 11.7 days 9 Montgomery, Ala. 1,162 6% 12.9 days 10 Longview, Texas 115 5% 13.6 days 11 Valdosta, Ga. 201 5% 13.6 days 12 Winchester, Va. 249 5% 14.1 days 13 El Centro, Calif. 848 5% 14.8 days 14 Hickory-Lenoir, N.C. 363 5% 14.9 days 15 Omaha 2,288 5% 15.2 days 305 New York City area 27,242 0% 191.8 days 1 2 3 4 7 30 Highest avg. daily growth rate of deaths Metro or micro area Recent deaths Daily growth rate deaths double every... 1 Lumberton, N.C. 10 12% 6.2 days 2 Laurel, Miss. 19 11% 6.6 days 3 Fresno, Calif. 19 9% 7.9 days 4 Burlington, N.C. 12 9% 8.1 days 5 Racine, Wis. 17 9% 8.4 days 6 Kokomo, Ind. 16 8% 8.8 days 7 Sioux City, Iowa 36 7% 9.8 days 8 California-Lex.Park, Md. 11 6% 11.1 days 9 Providence, R.I. 328 6% 11.4 days 10 Tuscaloosa, Ala. 13 6% 11.7 days 11 Greenville, Ohio 5 6% 12.7 days 12 Lebanon, Pa. 14 5% 13.0 days 13 El Paso 32 5% 13.5 days 14 Utica-Rome, N.Y. 24 5% 14.5 days 15 Bowling Green, Ky. 16 5% 14.6 days 207 New York City area 2,497 0% 191.3 days 1 2 3 4 7 30 Growth rates are averaged over the previous week. Limited to areas with more than 250 cases and 50,000 people. The table showing the average daily growth of the death rate is limited to areas with more than 20 deaths.\n\nGrowth rates are useful measures in epidemics because they tell us whether things are getting better or worse. In places where the growth rate is high but the number of cases is relatively low, a community may still have time to flatten its curve before an outbreak becomes widespread.\n\nCommunities with a lot of cases and a high growth rate are on track to have a serious problem. A high growth rate on top of a large number of cases means that a still larger number of people are on track to become ill or die.\n\n4. Where There May Be Good News Ahead\n\nHere, the metro areas where new cases and deaths have decreased the most, on a population-adjusted basis, in the last week:\n\nWhere new cases are decreasing most Metro or micro area A week ago Now Change per 100k 1 Amarillo, Texas 1,421 318 -415 2 Kankakee, Ill. 583 264 -290 3 Sioux City, Iowa 1,193 858 -198 4 Sioux Falls, S.D. 719 272 -168 5 Salisbury, Md. 1,525 838 -168 6 St. Cloud, Minn. 689 418 -136 7 Pine Bluff, Ark. 339 232 -120 8 Providence, R.I. 5,381 3,622 -108 9 Gallup, N.M. 626 561 -89.9 10 Bowling Green, Ky. 459 305 -86.8 11 North Wilkesboro, N.C. 264 205 -86.1 12 Baton Rouge, La. 1,515 813 -84.4 13 Grand Island, Neb. 187 119 -79.9 14 Worcester, Mass. 2,790 2,109 -71.8 15 Farmington, N.M. 501 418 -66.4 38 New York City area 33,525 27,242 -31.4 -500 -250 0 250 500 Where new deaths are decreasing most Metro or micro area A week ago Now Change per 100k 1 Gallup, N.M. 51 35 -22.1 2 Huntsville, Texas 25 8 -19.5 3 Marshall, Texas 17 5 -18.0 4 Bloomsburg-Berwick, Pa. 9 -3 -14.3 5 Trenton-Princeton, N.J. 121 80 -11.1 6 Nacogdoches, Texas 10 3 -10.7 7 Hudson, N.Y. 13 7 -10.0 8 Columbus, Ind. 11 4 -8.5 9 Vineland-Bridgeton, N.J. 33 21 -7.9 10 Natchez, Miss. 5 1 -7.9 11 Salem, Ohio 16 8 -7.8 12 Ocean City, N.J. 15 8 -7.6 13 Show Low, Ariz. 18 10 -7.2 14 Hartford, Conn. 307 225 -6.8 15 Boston 1,027 696 -6.8 19 New York City area 3,620 2,497 -5.6 -5 -2.5 0 2.5 5 Limited to areas with at least 100 cases and 50,000 people. Figures are sorted by the difference between the number of cases or deaths in the two weeks ending seven days ago compared with the last two weeks. The table showing the change in the number of deaths is limited to areas with more than 20 deaths.\n\nThe places on this list are not necessarily those where the outbreak is no longer severe. But sustained decreases in new cases and deaths are signs that a place is going in the right direction.\n\n5. The Places Hit Hardest\n\nBelow, the metro areas that have had the highest cumulative case and death rates since the start of the outbreak:\n\nCumulative confirmed cases Metro or micro area Population cases Per 1,000 1 Marion, Ohio 65,256 2,657 40.72 2 Gallup, N.M. 72,290 2,348 32.48 3 Sioux City, Iowa 169,045 4,621 27.34 4 New York City area 20.0 mil. 480,077 24.03 5 Grand Island, Neb. 85,088 1,642 19.30 6 Trenton-Princeton, N.J. 369,811 6,775 18.32 7 Pine Bluff, Ark. 89,515 1,510 16.87 8 Albany, Ga. 153,009 2,580 16.86 9 Fairfield County, Conn. 943,823 15,409 16.33 10 Show Low, Ariz. 110,445 1,752 15.86 11 New Orleans 1.3 mil. 18,706 14.72 12 Vineland-Bridgeton, N.J. 150,972 2,209 14.63 13 Boston 4.9 mil. 70,028 14.36 14 Yakima, Wash. 251,446 3,502 13.93 15 Sioux Falls, S.D. 265,653 3,595 13.53 0.5 1 2.5 5 10 20 Cumulative confirmed deaths Metro or micro area Population deaths Per 1,000 1 New York City area 20.0 mil. 37,904 1.90 2 Gallup, N.M. 72,290 104 1.44 3 Albany, Ga. 153,009 215 1.41 4 Fairfield County, Conn. 943,823 1,257 1.33 5 Trenton-Princeton, N.J. 369,811 466 1.26 6 Hartford, Conn. 1.2 mil. 1,425 1.18 7 New Haven, Conn. 857,620 957 1.12 8 Springfield, Mass. 631,761 655 1.04 9 New Orleans 1.3 mil. 1,295 1.02 10 Detroit 4.3 mil. 4,288 0.99 11 Boston 4.9 mil. 4,786 0.98 12 Farmington, N.M. 125,043 115 0.92 13 Milledgeville, Ga. 53,171 48 0.90 14 Meridian, Miss. 100,948 88 0.87 15 Worcester, Mass. 947,866 760 0.80 0.025 0.05 0.1 0.2 0.3 0.4 Limited to areas with at least 50,000 people.\n\nAs the pandemic progresses, the number of cases and deaths per capita can provide a good measure of the prevalence of coronavirus in a community, even if the deadliest period of the outbreak has passed, as it may have in places like Seattle, New York and New Orleans.\n\nThere are other measurements that would be helpful in understanding the progress of the epidemic in different places, such as the number of new hospitalizations, the number of tests administered or the number of people showing any symptoms of respiratory illness. But confirmed coronavirus cases and deaths, however incomplete, are the most useful daily statistics currently available at a local level everywhere in the country.'
