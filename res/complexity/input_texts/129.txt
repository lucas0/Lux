...I don't usually agree with or watch or participate in FOX news at all...but this was one of the few places I could read up on this claim of Bernie wanting to tax churches. My father has spent his life in the ministry. He lived a humble and upright life. No hookers, no condos in Florida, just well-deserved family vacations to Florida. I think that the blanket term "tax the Chruches" needs some rules, guidelines or restrictions. I agree that mega churches and TV churches could use some checks and balances. But the vast majority of churches that dot the interior of the United States would have to close their doors if they were taxed, especially at the 90% rate cited here. The church (like Muslims/terrorist) is not completely full of deceitful, greedy leaders. For many followers of Christ, they know only the church life they were brought up with, lead by decent human beings, who do not misuse tithes.ï»¿
