To the victor go the spoils, and for Tiger Woods, winner of 14 major golf championships and one of the richest athletes on the planet, the spoils include, among other things, a private island in Sweden.Found near Stockholm, the 62-acre island was purchased by a Swedish businessman in 2006 and developed as a retreat for the golfer and his then wife, Elin Nordegren. A deal for the property was never consummated, however, and the couple divorced in 2010. The island is now on the market with an asking price of about $7.1 million.------------For the RecordJanuary 12, 5:15 p.m.: An earlier version of this article stated that the island is owned by Woods. The island is owned by a Swedish businessman who developed the property for the golfer, according to AOL. Messages left for Vladi Private Islands, the agency representing the property, were not returned.Advertisement------------Situated in Lake Mälaren, the private island features a villa, a hunting lodge, guest quarters, horse stables, a dock and a landing strip for propeller planes, as well as a structure of historical significance: an 11th century Viking stronghold.The main villa, fashioned in log cabin style, spans about 2,475 square feet with a chef’s kitchen, a dining area and a living room fireplace. Adjacent from the villa is a spa and a pool built around a rock outcrop.Elsewhere on the grounds are six golf tee boxes.AdvertisementTwo smaller islands and a 494-acre water area for hunting and fishing are included in the sale. What’s not included is the furniture; the property is being marketed as unfurnished, according to Vladi Private Islands, the real estate agency that holds the listing.Woods, whose career earnings eclipsed the $1.3-billion mark last year, announced that he would take part in the Waste Management Phoenix Open starting Jan. 29, followed by Torrey Pines in La Jolla in February. He was limited to seven PGA Tour events last year due to injury.Twitter: @NJLeitereg
