Women retain and carry living DNA from every man with whom they have sexual intercourse , according to a new study by the University of Seattle and the Fred Hutchinson Cancer Research Center The study , which discovered the startling information by accident , was originally trying to determine if women who have been pregnant with a son might be more predisposed to certain neurological diseases that occur more frequently in males But as the scientists picked apart the female brain , the study began to veer wildly off course As it turns out , the female brain is even more mysterious than we previously thought The study found that female brains often harbor male microchimerism , or in other words , the presence of male DNA that originated from another individual , and are genetically distinct from the cells that make up the rest of the woman According to the study 63 of the females \( 37 of 59 \) tested harbored male microchimerism in the brain Male microchimerism was present in multiple brain regions So 63 of women carry male DNA cells that live in their brains Obviously the researchers wanted to know where the male DNA came from Anyone care to guess \? From the women s fathers \? No Your father s DNA combines with your mother s to create your unique DNA So where else could it come from \? Through the study the researchers assumed that the most likely answer was that all male DNA found living in the female brain came from a male pregnancy That was the safe , politically correct assumption But these researchers were living in denial Because when they autopsied the brains of women who had never even been pregnant , let alone with a male child , they STILL found male DNA cells prevalent in the female brain At this point the scientists didn t know what the hell was going on Confused , they did their best to hide the evidence until they could understand and explain it They buried it in numerous sub studies and articles , but if you sift through them all you will find the damning statement , the one line that gives the game away and explains exactly where these male DNA cells come from What are they so afraid of \? CONCLUSIONS Male microchimerism was not infrequent in women without sons Besides known pregnancies , other possible sources of male microchimerism include unrecognized spontaneous abortion , vanished male twin , an older brother transferred by the maternal circulation , or SEXUAL INTERCOURSE Male microchimerism was significantly more frequent and levels were higher in women with induced abortion than in women with other pregnancy histories Further studies are needed to determine specific origins of male microchimerism in women So according to the scientists , the possible sources of the male DNA cells living in the women s brains are an abortion the woman didn t know about a male twin that vanished an older brother transferred by the maternal circulation sexual intercourse Considering the fact that 63 of women have male DNA cells residing in the recesses of their brain , which of the above possibilities do you think is the most likely origin of the male DNA \? The first three options apply to a very small percentage of women They couldn t possibly account for the 63 figure The fourth option \? It s rather more common The answer is 4 Sex This has very important ramifications for women Every male you absorb spermatazoa from becomes a living part of you for life The women autopsied in this study were elderly Some had been carrying the living male DNA inside them for well over 50 years Sperm is alive It is living cells When it is injected into you it swims and swims until it crashes headlong into a wall , and then it attaches and burrows into your flesh If it s in your mouth it swims and climbs into your nasal passages , inner ear , and behind your eyes Then it digs in It enters your blood stream and collects in your brain and spine Like something out of a scifi movie , it becomes a part of you and you can t get rid of it We are only now beginning to understand the full power and ramifications of sexual intercourse Sources
