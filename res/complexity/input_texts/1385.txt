b'james poniewozik\n\nBecause I have a very sedentary job even by sedentary job standards, I like to do squats in my chair. I will just lift myself up. People at home wont see this, but I literally like to  just every once in a while, this yogic squat is very  malasana, I think they call it. This is just really good for your legs every hour or something like that.\n\n[music]\n\nHi, Im James Poniewozik, and Im a TV critic for The New York Times. Other than the fear of death and social collapse and economic catastrophe, the day-to-day of my life has not really changed that much. I always work from home. This thing that everybody is dealing with now  you know, how do I keep myself from going insane if I dont go outside  thats been my life for years. Were all kind of stay-at-home TV critics now. Welcome to my world, America. Particularly as a TV critic, Im very attuned to the fact that there is a lot of language of shame that is built around our consumption of TV. People who watch TV are couch potatoes. And there might be a feeling that if youre quarantined inside and watching six episodes of something on Netflix, that youre doing something shameful and unproductive. And I am here to tell you, as a professional TV watcher, that you should not feel ashamed. Consuming entertainment, experiencing good or even brilliantly dumb art is a form of self-care. It is something salutary that you are doing for your brain. To help your brain deal with the often painful process of living in the world in this really crazy time. Art, whether it is a marble statue or a network sitcom, is human beings trying to express something that they cant express in literal language, and how to process all of the overwhelming things that humans have to deal with. Honestly, that was probably a big aspect of my childhood. I think my parents and I often communicated with each other more through the shows we were watching at the same time than through things that we directly said to each other.\n\n[m*a*s*h theme music]\n\nI remember watching M*A*S*H during the afternoon and the early evening, when it would rerun, with my dad. My dad drove a beer and liquor delivery truck. He was a Teamster, which was a very physically punishing job. Like, he destroyed his back and his knees. And so when he would come home, he would  for some reason this felt good to him  would lie down on the living room floor in front of the TV. And my memory of watching M*A*S*H is me on the living room couch and my dad in front of me, maybe propped up on one arm on the floor, watching the TV sort of at my feet.\n\narchived recording (m*a*s*h) Beans, beans, beans, beans. Potatoes, potatoes, potatoes. Applesauce, applesauce, applesauce. You got that?\n\njames poniewozik\n\nMy dad was not of the generation where you would, you know, you purposely do things to bond with your children. But it was something that  it was something that we did. It was a routine.\n\narchived recording 1 Howd he take it, Frank? archived recording 2 Are you kidding? My palms are sweating off. Im afraid to tell him. archived recording 3 You better show him the orders, Radar. archived recording 4 Hell hit me.\n\njames poniewozik\n\nSo right now its my wife and I, and we have two kids at home. My younger sons in high school. My older son is in his first year of college and is now around the house. And \n\n["survivor" theme music]\n\n were not really a sports family. But Survivor, its our competition. There is a great deal of meta Survivor analysis that occupies much of the time in our household.\n\narchived recording Go!\n\njames poniewozik\n\nI tend to get shushed a lot while were watching Survivor.\n\narchived recording  right in it!\n\njames poniewozik\n\nBecause I make comments or have questions for my son, the Survivor expert \n\narchived recording You didnt do anything! You were made fun of! And you come here and you \n\njames poniewozik\n\n that kind of break the spell or interrupt somebodys dialogue. And then somebody has to rewind.\n\narchived recording You didnt do anything! You were made fun of! And you come here, and you tell me, dont bite the hand that feeds you? I feed myself!\n\njames poniewozik\n\nAnd Im in trouble, and I am reminded that watching Survivor is a privilege and not a right.\n\narchived recording I took myself out of this game!\n\njames poniewozik\n\nIve been watching Bobs Burgers. Thats the show that just Andre and I  my younger son and I  watch together. My wife is not particularly into the show. My older son can take it or leave it. So that will be if everybody else has gone to bed or is doing something else. And we do have a little dance that we do sitting on the couch. Theres the theme song. Its on I think ukulele.\n\n["bob\'s burgers" theme music]\n\nDun, dun, dun, dun, dun, dun, dun. And theres this, like, percussion thing. Boom! And we lean into each other and bump shoulders. Boom! Back the other way. Boom! And bump shoulders again. Just us.\n\njames poniewozik\n\nWhat are some of other regular shows? My older son, whos a music major in college, he was able to airdrum, beginning to end, all the percussion moments in the Friday Night Lights theme song.\n\n["friday night lights" theme music]\n\nHe had all these gestures that I cant reproduce or whatever. This is one of the most beautiful shows ever made for television thats not just about football.\n\narchived recording (coach taylor) Everybody wrote us off. Everybody.\n\njames poniewozik\n\nBut about community. About the connection among people. And about how a society needs every one of its members to contribute for the good of all.\n\narchived recording (coach taylor) There are a few out there who do still believe in you, fewll never give up on you. You go back out on the field. Those are the people I want in your minds. Those are the people I want in your hearts.\n\njames poniewozik\n\nNever underestimate just how much you need to hear Coach Taylor.\n\narchived recording (coach taylor) Clear eyes, full hearts. archived recording (team) Cant lose! Lets go!\n\njames poniewozik\n\nI cant change the fact that every human on earth has a real existential problem right now. And I cant change how, even some of the shows that I love and that simply entertained me before are now, in many ways, painful reminders. But I can deal with them, and make it a little easier to tolerate, and even enjoy getting through it, through the people that I watch with and through the rituals that we have of watching. Sharing TV with people you love, whether theyre with you or on the other end of a Zoom chat, can be a really valuable way to get through this.\n\n[music]\n\ntejal rao\n\nHi, Im Tejal Rao. Im the California restaurant critic for The New York Times, and Im also a columnist for The New York Times Magazine. Well, its been really strange, because there isnt much use for restaurant criticism right now. The restaurant industry is suffering, and so many restaurant workers are out of work. And Im really, really worried. Im really missing going out to restaurants and being in public spaces, and the luxury of other people cooking for me. And Im cooking a lot at home, but Im also doing this really slightly strange thing, which is rewatching food scenes in movies that I love. Because I havent had that kind of contact in public spaces, and restaurants are so important to me. So theres something about seeing people being together, and cooking, and eating in a film or in a TV show thats just really doing it for me right now.\n\n[music]\n\nOK, so over the weekend, I watched Big Night.\n\narchived recording (claudio villa) [SINGING IN ITALIAN]\n\ntejal rao\n\nSo I intended to just watch the dinner scene, which is kind of an epic, Italian-style dinner, set in the 1950s. But when the movie opened, its Claudio Villa singing this very beautiful song with his operatic voice.\n\narchived recording (claudio villa) [SINGING IN ITALIAN]\n\ntejal rao\n\nWaves are rolling on the Jersey shore, and I just ended up watching the whole movie. I feel like I just want to explain a tiny bit of the movie to you. So \n\narchived recording What?\n\ntejal rao\n\nIts about two brothers.\n\narchived recording More salt.\n\ntejal rao\n\nStanley Tucci, Tony Shalhoub.\n\narchived recording Not too fine. Sometimes you cut it too fine, then all you taste is the garlic.\n\ntejal rao\n\nWho are running a restaurant on the Jersey shore. And its a classic setup. The restaurant across the street from them is super successful. Meanwhile, their restaurant is really quiet, kind of failing. They owe the bank a lot of money. And part of it is that they just refuse to cook Italian-American food.\n\narchived recording 1 But I get a side order of spaghetti with this, right? archived recording 2 Why? archived recording 3 Well, no. archived recording 4 I thought all main courses come with spaghetti. archived recording 5 Well some, yes. But, you see, risotto is rice, so it is a starch. And it doesnt go really with pasta.\n\ntejal rao\n\nYou know, people want spaghetti with meatballs, and they want tons of seafood in their risotto.\n\narchived recording 1 There are no meatballs with the spaghetti? archived recording 2 No. Sometimes spaghetti likes to be alone. [LAUGHTER]\n\ntejal rao\n\nAnd Tony Shalhoub plays this perfectionist chef, who refuses to compromise.\n\narchived recording 1 Just make me a side order of spaghetti please. archived recording 2 What? Why? archived recording 3 She likes starch. I dont know! Come on!\n\ntejal rao\n\nAnd they only want to make very traditional Italian stuff.\n\narchived recording Who are these people in America? Shes a criminal. I want to talk to her.\n\ntejal rao\n\nThere are moments  I dont want to be mean to Stanley Tucci  but there are moments, where its almost like, you know how the French accents are in Monty Python?\n\narchived recording I dont want to talk to you no more, you empty-headed \n\ntejal rao\n\nWhere theyre just so absurd and silly and over-the-top.\n\narchived recording I fart in your general direction.\n\ntejal rao\n\nThere are few moments where \n\narchived recording They both are a starch. Maybe I should make a mashed potato for on the other side.\n\ntejal rao\n\n their Italian accents get a little cartoonish.\n\narchived recording Shes a Philistine. Im not going to talk to her. She no understand anyway.\n\ntejal rao\n\nBut its so charming. Its so charming all the same that its fine.\n\narchived recording [SINGING IN ITALIAN]\n\ntejal rao\n\nOne of my favorite moments is just, like, Stanley Tucci and Tony Shalhoubs hairy forearms making the pasta. Theres something about seeing these bare, hairy forearms making a huge mess with egg yolks and flour, and kneading it directly on the table, where one of the cooks also sleeps. Were all being so careful right now, as we should be, with gloves and masks. And the intimacy of the two of them cooking together and also cooking for other people, its a really, really beautiful scene. So, the rival restaurant across the street thats doing really well, its run by this showboat restauranteur, who lights stuff on fire to create a scene in the dining room. And the brothers run this very quiet, simple restaurant. And the rival restauranteur says, you know what? Im friends with Louis Prima, and hes coming to town next week. And Ill tell him to come to your restaurant. So why dont you cook a special dinner for Louis Prima. And so they plan this big night to cook for a celebrity. And theyre waiting and waiting. And people start drinking and dancing and eating snacks. Wisps of hair coming undone, because people are starting to get a little wild. And they just sit down to eat dinner without Louis Prima.\n\narchived recording No, no, no. We dont have time for tour. Lets go. Come on. Come on. [INAUDIBLE] open the door.\n\ntejal rao\n\nThats where the magic of the movie happens. Its all at the table.\n\narchived recording 1 What is that? archived recording 2 Its timpano. Its a secret recipe that they brought from their hometown.\n\ntejal rao\n\nTheyre in this very plain dining room. The music is blasting, and theres always this moment at a dinner party when all of a sudden, people have had just enough to drink that they sort of start to loosen up. And you see it happen in real time in the movie.\n\narchived recording 1 [DISHES CLATTERING] archived recording 2 Dammit! archived recording 3 This is so [EXPLETIVE] good, I should kill you.\n\ntejal rao\n\nAll of a sudden \n\narchived recording [LAUGHTER AND CHATTER]\n\ntejal rao\n\n all the glasses start clinking. People are holding wine bottles and pretending to karaoke into them. And dancing. You can see all these women with their perfect red lips unobscured by masks. And everyones making sure that everyone elses glasses stay full all the time. It was like catnip for me. And it also emotionally kind of wrecked me to see people having so much fun. Theres something magical about seeing restaurants that are really, really alive and busy, and financially successful probably, too. Its so fortifying to remember that we can gather like that again on the other side of this.\n\n[music]'
