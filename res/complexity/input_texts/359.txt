May 3 , 2001 The Honorable Rosa DeLauro U S House of Representatives 2262 Rayburn House Office Bldg Washington , DC 20515 Dear Representative DeLauro On behalf of the American Medical Association \( AMA \) , I am writing to express our appreciation for your introduction of H R 536 , Breast Cancer Patient Protection Act of 2001 The AMA applauds this bipartisan effort aimed at providing coverage for the reasonable treatment of breast cancer Your bill focuses on the fundamental concept that medical decisions should be made by patients and their physicians , rather than by insurers The AMA feels that decisions regarding medical matters , including a patient s length of stay in a hospital , must reside with patients and physicians Moreover , decisions impacting an individual patient must be determined by the specific circumstances affecting that patient We believe that H R 536 meets these objectives The AMA will continue to work to ensure that appropriate medical decision making is left in the hands of physicians in consultation with their patients Respectfully , E Ratcliffe Anderson , Jr , MD
