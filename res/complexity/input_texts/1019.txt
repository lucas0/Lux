In 2012, a YouGov survey revealed 40% of women in London had been a victim of threats, harassment or lewd language in public places.The video was produced by sports equipment brand Everlast and ends with a request to "share this video so this message gets to all the stalkers around you."Have you ever been the victim of everyday sexism?
