For all of J K Rowling 's writing accomplishments , her tweeting accomplishments are n't far behind The creator of the Harry Potter series is well known for posting positive , progressive messages on Twitter , but when right wing internet trolls try to come at her , she savagely owns them like none other Two years ago , Rowling tweeted this , in support of refugees coming to Europe Naturally , a right wing troll tried to own Rowling \( who , before writing Harry Potter , was very poor and down on her luck \) The tweet picked up enough traction for Rowling to notice So she tweeted this back at him , and most people assumed she was messing around But she was very , very serious Before responding , Rowling had researched the man behind the troll , Luke Kocura , and found out he was struggling to make mortgage payments on his modest home in Sheffield , England Unless he turned things around within two years , he was at risk of foreclosure Rowling then closely monitored his situation over the next couple years , which , sure enough , only got worse So she pounced , repossessing the house from the bank , assuming Kocura 's mortgage , and now , she owns the house To celebrate the long game owning , she tweeted this at him Damn ! Actually going to the lengths of repossessing and owning someone 's house \? Now that 's how you own someone ! Never change , J K Never change
