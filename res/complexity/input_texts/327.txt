Virginia Gov Terry McAuliffe will no longer have to answer questions about his potential role in a Clinton administration And U S Rep Robert C Bobby Scott and a handful of Republican hopefuls can shelve their battle plans for a special election to fill Kaines seat As Donald Trumps stunning victory over Hillary Clinton rocks national politics , few states are feeling the consequences as swiftly as Virginia Kaines failure to ascend to the vice presidency simplifies Virginias electoral calendar , but Trumps win shook up the 2017 governors race thats already underway Corey Stewart , a 2017 GOP gubernatorial hopeful who served as chairman of Trumps Virginia campaign for almost a year but was fired last month for aggressively protesting the Republican National Committee , declared in an interview that Trumps victory propels him to frontrunner status for the GOP nomination He attacked Republican rival Ed Gillespie , an early leader in gubernatorial fundraising and endorsements , as being insufficiently loyal to the president elect Ed Gillespie treated Donald Trump like he had typhoid , Stewart said He would not appear with him on stage He would not mention his name unless he was condemning him A former Republican National Committee chairman , Gillespie has kept his distance from Trump while voicing support for the GOP ticket He introduced Indiana Gov Mike Pence , Trumps running mate , at two rallies , but was noticeably absent from the Trump campaigns Virginia leadership committee that included the other two Republican gubernatorial candidates , Rep Robert J Wittman , R 1st , and state Sen Frank W Wagner , R Virginia Beach In a statement , Chris Leavitt , executive director of Gillespies political action committee , said Gillespies support for the Trump Pence ticket was clear from the beginning Nows the time to bring our country and party together , but once again Corey is putting his personal political ambitions first , Leavitt said And if he wants to anoint himself , thats fine We see how well Hillary Clintons coronation went With no U S Senate vacancy for McAuliffe to fill , the governors race will unfold without the added drama of a special election for Kaines seat McAuliffes pick would have had to defend the seat in a special election next year and again in 2018 when it comes up for its regularly scheduled election Scott , D 3rd , was widely seen as the favorite to get the nod from McAuliffe , who declined to publicly discuss Senate prospects until after Election Day Wittman was rumored to be considering switching to run for Kaines Senate seat if it came open A spokesman said Wednesday that his plans for 2017 remain the same , adding that Wittman is thrilled to be a part of the chance that Republican victories in the House , Senate and White House represent Wittman was easily re elected to his congressional seat Tuesday With the Senate seat now a moot point for next year , all eyes will be on the governors race Virginias race is expected to draw national interest as one of only two gubernatorial races along with New Jerseys scheduled for what will be Trumps first year as president Though Clinton lost nationally , she won Virginia by roughly 5 points , continuing the streak of statewide wins for Democrats She ran up large margins in the key counties of Fairfax , Loudoun , Prince William and Henrico , a sign that Democrats hold demographic advantages that Republicans have struggled to overcome in state races The Republican candidate for governor who is selected in a June primary will face Democratic Lt Gov Ralph S Northam Democrats have sought to link the four Republican candidates to Trump The Democratic Party of Virginia launched a website late last month intended to hold Republican gubernatorial candidates accountable for supporting and enabling the most dangerous candidate to ever be nominated by a major party But instead of Trump serving as a past embarrassment for Republicans looking to move on , Trump will have taken up residence across the Potomac as Virginians choose a new leader In a statement , Northam congratulated Trump and said he was disappointed in the result but proud of Clinton and Kaine We will continue to advocate for our values like defending womens access to reproductive health care and equality while building on our economic progress by focusing on workforce development , attracting new industries and promoting our quality of life , Northam said Stewart , a Prince William supervisor , said he hopes to implement the Trump agenda on a state level by cracking down on illegal immigration , replacing the Affordable Care Act and scrapping regulations on businesses But Stewarts decision to take part in a protest outside the RNCs headquarters in Washington seems to have burned bridges with the Trump campaign Mike Rubino , the Trump campaigns Virginia state director , said Stewart acted like a petulant child and hurt Trumps chances by dividing the party He constantly pitted people against each other , Rubino said He was actively running for governor on my bosss coattails while my boss was seeking the highest office in the land That , to me , is disloyalty Stewart called his alliance with Trump a Hail Mary pass thats now paying off Ive embraced Trump and defended him when other people wouldnt , Stewart said And I believe that loyalty will be returned inform video player 3 inform embed margin top 10px margin bottom 20px
