he says I realized that day , regardless of whatever my decision was , neither one of them was going home an innocent man All he could think about was getting his life back , going home , playing football , finishing his high school education , enrolling at USC They put him in a room and gave him 10 minutes to make his decision He sat there crying I was unable to speak to my mom I was denied that right , he says At the age of 17 , I felt like 90 days was doable after already spending a year behind bars He underwent the 90 day observation The psychologist and counselor recommended probation The judge gave him six years He had never been in trouble before , not even a speeding ticket He sat in the holding cell , held both hands up , shaking uncontrollably as he figured out that he would have to serve 85 of the six years He had already served one year That meant he still had just over four years remaining Just the trauma and the stress that I had already dealt with that first year , it was unimaginable how I was going to do another four years , he says He went to jail with career criminals He was angry , depressed , hostile He saw fights , stabbings , killings right in front of him , riots , lockdowns He saw hell Banks lost 10 years of his life , a frightful five years and two months in prison followed by five years of high custody parole After his release in 2007 , he moved back in with his mother , a second grade schoolteacher who had sold her house and car to pay his attorney fees At 22 he tried to resume his football career at Long Beach City College He played in a game two days after his release , a good way to take out aggression But after playing a handful of games before the season ended , a new law went into effect in California requiring sex offenders to wear an ankle GPS tracking device , making it impossible for him to play football He had already registered as a sex offender and could n't live within 2 , 000 yards of a school or park He had trouble finding work I wanted revenge , Banks says I wanted people to be held accountable for the things that happened to me The past is the past It already happened Tomorrow is a mystery Life 's not fair , Banks thought I'm an innocent man Three years ago , Banks was checking his Facebook account and got a start He had been home for four years working odd jobs , still carrying the label of sex offender But there , staring him in the face , was a friend request It was her , Banks says , the girl who had accused me nine years ago Banks still does n't know her reasoning for selling him down the river when she knew they never had sex and there was no DNA trace on her underwear Maybe it was the 1 5 million she collected from the Long Beach school system , claiming it was an unsafe environment \( the city is trying to recoup 2 6 million from her now \) Banks thinks maybe Gibson was afraid her older sister , who went to the same high school , would find out she made out with him and tell her mother Or that he would brag to friends Maybe she thought he would just be suspended He does n't think she was trying to put him in jail He also thinks perhaps a school security guard saw her leaving the stairwell with him , asked what she was doing and if she wanted to do it Oh well , then he raped you , Banks surmises the guard said We do n't really know what the truth really is as to why she lied , he says I never really got a clear reason Banks never had contact with her from the day they made out until that day on Facebook in 2011 He asked why she would request him I was hoping we could let bygones be bygones , Banks says Gibson wrote I was immature back in the day , but I'm much more mature now Let 's hang out I 'd love to see you I 've seen your picture on Facebook You look real good I would love to hook up Banks obviously had no interest His parole agreement did n't allow him any contact with her Banks called a private investigator and said he felt there was an opportunity for her to tell the truth and he wanted it recorded In the event that I violated my parole conditions coming into contact with her and was sent back to prison , I wanted them to at least know what was said , Banks says I took a big risk I knew this was the only opportunity to prove my innocence by her admitting she lied In 2013 , Atlanta 's Brian Banks faces Cincinnati \( Kevin C Cox Getty Images \) He invited Wanetta Gibson to the investigator 's office They spoke with the investigator monitoring in another room Banks wanted her to understand what she did to his life He asked her to come back the second day to speak to the investigator Did he rape you \?
