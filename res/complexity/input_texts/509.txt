Mrs Obama also donned a sheer black veil when she met the Catholic Pope in Vatican City.To: maggiefMaybe they are not all that bad.To: OldeconomybuyerShe is blurred anyway...Disclaimer: Opinions posted on Free Republic are those of the individual posters and do not necessarily represent the opinion of Free Republic or its management.
