About this data The map shows where the average number of reported cases over the past two weeks is increasing, decreasing or about the same. Countries with an increase in the rate of cases are shaded darker. Countries with fewer than 100 cases over the past two weeks are not shaded. Data for the West Bank and Gaza was reported together by the Palestinian Health Ministry and includes only Palestinian-controlled land. Russia is reporting data for Crimea, a peninsula it annexed in 2014 in a move that led to international sanctions. Data for some countries, like the United States and France, include counts for overseas territories. Japans count includes 696 cases and seven deaths from a cruise ship that docked in Yokohama.\n\nThe coronavirus pandemic is ebbing in some of the countries that were hit hard early on, but the number of new cases is growing faster than ever worldwide, with more than 200,000 reported each day on average.\n\nCases Deaths Total\n\ncases Per 100,000 Total\n\ndeaths Per 100,000 Cases\n\nin last\n\n7 days Per 100,000 Deaths\n\nin last\n\n7 days Per 100,000 Weekly cases per capita Fewer More Aruba 1,048 990 4 4 539 509 1 <1 Jan. 22 Aug. 15 Turks and Caicos Islands 298 791 2 5 128 340   Sint Maarten 300 738 17 42 123 303   Bahrain 46,430 2,958 170 11 2,801 178 9 <1 Panama 80,665 1,931 1,746 42 7,014 168 137 3 Peru 516,296 1,614 25,856 81 52,421 164 5,207 16 Colombia 456,689 920 14,810 30 79,819 161 2,270 5 Faroe Islands 372 767   75 155   Maldives 5,679 1,101 22 4 781 151 3 <1 Brazil MAP  3,317,096 1,584 107,232 51 304,684 145 6,755 3 Show all Weekly cases per capita shows the share of population with a new reported case for each week.

As of Sunday afternoon, at least 5,389,700 people across every state, plus Washington, D.C., and four U.S. territories, have tested positive for the virus, according to a New York Times database, and at least 169,600 patients with the virus have died.\n\nSee our page of maps, charts and tables tracking every coronavirus case in the U.S.\n\nAfter case numbers fell steadily in April and May, cases in the United States are growing again at about the same rapid pace as when infections were exploding in New York City in late March. But the hotspots are now mainly spread across the southern and western parts of the country.\n\nThe New York Times is engaged in an effort to track the details of every reported case in the United States, collecting information from federal, state and local officials around the clock. The numbers in this article are being updated several times a day based on the latest information our journalists are gathering from around the country. The Times has made that data public in hopes of helping researchers and policymakers as they seek to slow the pandemic and prevent future ones."
