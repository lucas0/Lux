A new study suggests men’s beards are disgusting and filled with poopLove them or hate them, beards have become the latest trend in male fashion. For those of us that love wearing a beard, there are plenty of social media websites to illustrating an unconditional love for facial hair.However, a new study has shown that beards are basically filled with more bacteria than the inside of a toilet. According to KOAT Albuquerque, several anonymous men allowed a microbiologist to swab their beards for bacterial testing. A few of the beards contained standard stuff while others revealed fecal matter. While the microbiologist recommended a good beard scrubbing and regular hand-washing to diminish the amount of germs, he didn’t explain how a man’s beard could end up with poop in the first place.So the next time you see someone with a long and gorgeous beard, remember there is a good chance it has fecal bacteria crawling through it.Are YOU going to keep your beard?
