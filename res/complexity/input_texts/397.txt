Crawford Jr said security footage of the shooting and the time leading up to it which he and family lawyer , Michael Wright , have viewed shows that his son was standing in an aisle of the pet department holding the air rifle with his left hand with the barrel pointing to the floor Crawford III was talking on his cell phone to Johnson with his back to the officers when he was shot , his father said The footage we saw , he did n't know the officers were in the store There was no reaction \( from him \) at all by the time the trigger was pulled , Crawford Jr said We were waiting to see him menacing , waving this thing in a threatening position with women or children None of that happened from the footage we saw He was n't doing anything He was just standing there The final analysis is that my son was murdered All this nonsense of \( them saying \) 'Put the weapon down' two or three times There was no reaction from him There could n't have been a cadence given Ohio Attorney General Mike DeWine has refused to release the surveillance video to the public while the Ohio Bureau of Criminal Investigation \( BCI \) , a branch of DeWine 's office , investigates the shooting to determine if Beavercreek Officers Sean Williams or Sgt David Darkow broke the law Wright said the coroner has told him that Crawford III was shot twice The final autopsy report has not been completed Crawford Jr said the family has not been told which of the two officers shot his son Williams remains off duty , while Darkow has returned to work The Greene County prosecutor has asked for a special prosecutor to avoid any appearance of a possible conflict of interest because DeWine whose office would typically prosecute the case used to be Green County prosecutor and his daughter now is an assistant prosecutor there Assistant Hamilton County Prosecutor Mark Piepmeier is now leading the prosecution team as special prosecutor Wright has asked the U S Attorney 's Office to take over the investigation and look into potential civil rights violation He wants DeWine off the case altogether , saying DeWine is too close to people at the center of the investigation It 's a demand DeWine has refused DeWine 's spokesman Dan Tierney said there 's no conflict because DeWine is not directly involved in the investigation Beavercreek police officials asked for BCI to investigate the shooting because it was a conflict for them to fairly investigate their own officers , Tierney said Greene County Prosecutor Stephen Haller sought a special prosecutor from the attorney general 's office , but DeWine suggested Piepmeier because of his experience in prosecuting use of force cases Taking the investigation away from BCI and handing it over to another agency would cause a delay because the new agency would have to start from scratch , Tierney said Our goal is to do a very thorough investigation but to make sure it is concluded in a compressed length of time to allow closure to the family , he said Crawford Jr thinks that race played a factor in the shooting I think there would have been more tolerance We are not inside the cop 's head But I would be not honest with you if I did n't \( say \) there was a little bit of racial undertone in this whole situation , Crawford Jr said That 's why Wright and the family are trying to get the U S Department of Justice involved in the investigation We do believe there was a violation of his civil rights and that does have to do with race , Wright said
