b'Many of the nations largest districts have yet to announce plans, although Mayor Bill de Blasio of New York suggested on Friday that all of the citys 1.1 million students are unlikely to return full-time during the pandemic. One day theres going to be a vaccine, he said, and I think thats the day when youre going to see things go back 100 percent  to every kid in the classroom  as normal.\n\nReopening decisions are likely to vary greatly based on the size and density of districts, as well as region. In the South and West, where political leaders have been more eager to reopen their economies despite a recent upswing in coronavirus cases, school systems may be more likely to return to a full-time schedule, albeit with distance restrictions, new sanitation procedures and mask recommendations.\n\nBut for districts that hope to closely follow guidance from the Centers for Disease Control and Prevention, it would be nearly impossible to maintain sanitation and social distancing with normal school attendance. Class sizes in many schools would need to be cut by more than half. And while health experts generally recommend face coverings for both staff and students, some educators and parents say that is not realistic, especially for the youngest children.\n\nThose complications are likely to prompt many districts  where administrators must decide how to implement the broad guidelines from federal and state health officials  to adopt a hybrid model in which students will spend some time in the classroom but a significant portion of the week at home.\n\nAlthough that reality has been apparent to many educators for weeks, it is just beginning to confront parents. Some are finding out this week that their scramble to balance their own jobs with their childrens education and daily care will continue for many months, if not all of next school year.'
