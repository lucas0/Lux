The exiled Tibetan leader requested the meeting during a visit to Rome but it was declined 'for obvious reasons concerning the delicate situation' with China. The Catholic Church in China is divided in two; the official Church overseen by the Chinese Communist Party, and an underground community that swears allegiance to the Pope. But the main bone of contention is over which side should have the final say in the appointment of bishops. A Vatican official said the Pope's decision was 'not taken out of fear but to avoid any suffering by those who have already suffered'.The longest serving Pope - Pius IX - who was the leader of the church from 1846 to 1878 believed animals had no consciousness and therefore could not have an afterlife.Pope Francis's predecessor, Pope Benedict XVI, had also denied the idea of pets entering heaven and said their death simply meant the end of their existence on EarthBut it is perhaps unsurprising that Pope Francis, aged 77, supports the idea of pets and animals having a place in paradise as he took his papal name from St. Francis of Assisi, the patron saint of animals.It's not the first time Francis, an Argentine Jesuit who took over from Pope Benedict XVI last year, has courted controversy.
