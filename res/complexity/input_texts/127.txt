The three-inch pet went on to make a full recovery after the 50-minute operationVet Faye Bethell, 29, was then tasked with carefully administering anaesthetic before using tiny instruments to remove a lump close to the fish's backside.A second lump was removed from his dorsal fin before the fish was returned to water and handed back to his grateful owner.Ms Bethell said the three-inch fish made a full recovery after the 50-minute operation and said it would have died if it was left untreated.She said: 'I have never done a procedure like that on a goldfish, although I have done it before on more valuable fish like a carp.Vet Faye Bethell, 29 (pictured), carried out the delicate £300 operation on the constipated goldfish'The actual surgery is quite straightforward but administering the anaesthetic is quite complicated.'The issue was the fish couldn't poo and it would have eventually become toxic and it would have died.'There was nothing special about the fish. He just liked it a lot. People love their pets - but that was an expensive little goldfish.'The delicate procedure involved introducing a carefully-measured anaesthetising agent into the fish's water.It was then removed from its tank and placed on a waterproof drape before anaesthetic water was put into its mouth via a tube and bubbled over its gills.Ms Bethell then used a miniature heart-rate monitor to check that the fish was properly 'under' before using a mini scalpel to remove the lumps.She then sewed each cut with three stitches before using a special 'glue' to cover and waterproof the fish's scales before it was gradually re-awakened.Goldfish can live up to 10 years and this ailing pet was two years and 10 months old at the time of its operation.The Toll Barn practice opened a year ago and specialises in exotic animals as well as the more usual pets.Ms Bethell revealed that in the past year she has carried out a string of bizarre operations including the removal of a 12g skin tumour from a two-inch long hognose snake.She has also successfully taken out a stone from the 5mm-wide ureter of a guinea pig and last week castrated a skunk.Earlier this year, Melbourne veterinarian Dr. Tristan Rich (pictured) - head of exotics and wildlife medicine at Lort Smith Animal Hospital - performed micro-surgery on a goldfish called George to remove a cancer tumourThe 10-year-old goldfish had a large tumour on his head, making it difficult for him to breathe and swimDuring the 'fiddly' operation, the tumour - which had stretched down to the fish's skull - was cut out (pictured)It is not the first time a goldfish has undergone a traumatic operation to save its life.Earlier this year, Melbourne veterinarian Dr. Tristan Rich - head of exotics and wildlife medicine at Lort Smith Animal Hospital - performed micro-surgery on a goldfish called George.The 10-year-old pet had a large tumour on his head, making it difficult for him to breathe and swim.
