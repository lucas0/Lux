Thumbing through the J.C. Penney Christmas Catalog, Antiwar.com's Administrative Assistant Anastasia Kellar came across this horrific picture in the toys section.Here is what J.C. Penney's says about this product:Forward Command Post$44.99Take command of your soldiers from this fully outfitted battlezone. 75-piece set includes one 111/2"H figurine in military combat gear, toy weapons, American flag, chairs and more. Assembled dimensions; 32x16x32"H. Plastic. 10 lbs. Ages 5 and up.This looks like the sort of toy that Norman Podhoretz or Bill Kristol would buy for their kids.I was a pretty inventive kid. If I had had a younger sister I am confident I could have converted her Barbie Dream House and saved the $45.You may want to tell J.C. Penney's how you feel about this atrocity. Their corporate office can be reached at 972-431-1000. Personally, I will be cutting my card in half and sending it with a letter to their corporate office at 6501 Legacy Drive Plano, TX 75024-3698.It is worth noting that, during the Kosovo war, J.C. Penney's added Antiwar.com to their list of websites blocked on all their corporate computers.We have also located similar products at two online toystores, eToys and KB Toys.
