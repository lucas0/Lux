b'In an unusual situation, both of Mississippis Senate seats are in play this year: Senator Roger Wicker is seeking re-election to one of them, and the seat Thad Cochran vacated this spring is open. Mr. Wicker advanced to the general election on Tuesday; the special election to replace Mr. Cochran will take place in November.\n\nRead more\n\nElectorally speaking, Mr. Cochrans retirement was good news for Mr. Wicker. Chris McDaniel  a conservative firebrand who almost unseated Mr. Cochran in 2014  was expected to mount a strong primary challenge to Mr. Wicker this year, but he is now running for the open seat instead. Mississippi is one of the most solidly Republican states in the nation, so Mr. Wickers re-election is basically assured.'
