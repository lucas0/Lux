Actor Seth Rogen, famous for comedic roles in hits like "Superbad" and "Knocked Up," will reportedly appear in the upcoming Steve Jobs biopic written by Oscar winner Aaron Sorkin, and is set to take on the role of Apple co-founder Steve Wozniak.Rogen's role in the highly anticipated Sony production was revealed on Thursday by film industry publication Variety. Rogen will star opposite Christian Bale, who will play the role of Steve Jobs.The project has attracted top-level talent, as it will be directed by Danny Boyle, who won an Oscar for Best Director in 2008 for the film "Slumdog Millionaire." Sorkin won his Academy Award in 2011 for "The Social Network," while Bale won Best Supporting Actor in 2011 for his performance in "The Fighter."Sorkin's script is expected to be loosely based on Walter Isaacson's official Jobs biography. The screenwriter has said the movie will consist of scenes that take place before the unveilings of three key products: the original Mac, NeXT and the iPod.Wozniak left Apple in early 1987, which would put him at the company for just the launch of the original Mac. But Sorkin's films are not known to stick closely to historical facts, as seen in his depiction of Facebook founder Mark Zuckerberg in "The Social Network." Sorkin himself has said the film will be more akin to a painting rather than a photograph.The upcoming movie will be the second attempt at a Steve Jobs feature after indie film "Jobs," the ill-received Ashton Kutcher vehicle released in 2013.
