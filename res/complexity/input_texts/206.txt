parentingBeware of Homemade SlimeI'm writing this to let you know our experience with homemade slime I am not a doctor or a scientist or a chemist I just do n't want what happened to my daughter to happen to anyone else If you have elementary age kids , you are probably familiar with the current slime obsession My daughter and her friends became obsessed with it a few months ago and could n't get enough of it So much so that they decided they would start making it themselves at home , a simple endeavor providing you have the right ingredients Basically , homemade slime consists of BoraxShaving CreamFood Coloring \( optional \) You might have also heard how stores ca n't even keep enough glue in stock True story we had a horrible time finding Elmer 's Glue at our local Walmart , Hobby Lobby and Target There are variations of the above for sure , but these ingredients are what my daughter and her friends were using to create their slime We are a pretty healthy family We get our flu shots each year and my kids have never had strep or flu or bronchial illnesses They have never had more than your basic cold that lasted a few days When my 12 year old got sick , we thought it was the same basic cold Symptoms were the same cough , sore throat , stuffy nose She was also complaining about headaches and general achiness Assuming her symptoms would be relieved in a few days , we did n't pay them much mind Unfortunately , they did n't go away At all Weeks later , we were still left wondering what on earth was going on To the doctor we went We had her take a throat culture , check her lungs , and ears and sinuses She found nothing Other than your basic cold symptoms , there was n't anything wrong with her on the surface You know how as a parent you just kind of the get the feeling that there is more to something than meets the eye \? My husband was actually the one who connected the dots He told me one night , Do you think it could have something to do with the slime she 's been making \? It was like a lightbulb went off It kind of made sense all of a sudden From that moment , we banned her from making , holding , touching or even looking at that darn slime The very next day , her headache went away Her throat did n't hurt anymore She still had some congestion , but was n't coughing Two days later , the congestion started going away She was breathing better and talking better No more achiness What the what \? \? \? Could the homemade slime have been poisoning my daughter \?
