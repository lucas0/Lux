Middle East and Afghanistan used a special hotline to contact their Russian counterparts directing Russia s own intervention in Syria Arriving over At Tanf , the American pilots apparently spoke directly to the Russian aviators Pilots CAN communicate with one another on a communications channel set up to avoid air accidents , Central Command confirmed in a statement to The Daily Beast Washington and Moscow had established the hotline as part of a so called Safety of Flight Memorandum of Understanding that the two governments signed in October specifically in order to avoid the kind of aerial confrontation that occurred over Syria last week With the American jets flying close enough to visually identify the Su 34s , the Russians departed the air space over At Tanf Some time shortly thereafter , the F A 18s ran low on fuel and left the area in order to link up with an aerial tanker That s when the Su 34s reportedly returned to At Tanf and bombed the rebels again According

continued strikes at At Tanf , even after U S attempts to inform Russian forces through proper channels of on going coalition air support to the counter ISIL forces , created safety concerns for U S and coalition forces , Cook continued Department officials requested Russian responses to address those concerns Russian Defense Ministry spokesman Igor Konashenkov confirmed , via the country s state owned media , that the teleconference took place but he did not specify the results of the extraordinary meeting Russian warplanes had Russian warplanes had previously shadowed planes belonging to the U S led coalition over Syria , but the coalition always described the Russians behavior as professional By contrast , in April Russian Su 24 bombers repeatedly buzzed the U S Navy warship USS Donald
