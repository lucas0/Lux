To ParentsThe urge to create is equally strong in all children. Boys and girls.It’s the imagination that counts. Not skill. You build whatever comes into your head, the way you want it. A bed or a truck. A dolls house or a spaceship.A lot of boys like dolls houses. They’re more human than spaceships. A lot of girls prefer spaceships. They’re more exciting than dolls houses.The most important thing is to put the right material in their hands and let them create whatever appeals to them.
