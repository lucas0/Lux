TOPBy Wayne LaPierreBefore I tell you how the NRA and our members are going to Stand And Fight politically and in the courts , let 's acknowledge that all over this country , tens of millions of Americans are already preparing to Stand And Fight to protect their families and homes These good Americans are prudently getting ready to protect themselves It has always been sensible for good citizens to own and carry firearms for lawful protection against violent criminals who prey on decent people During the second Obama term , however , additional threats are growing Latin American drug gangs have invaded every city of significant size in the United States Phoenix is already one of the kidnapping capitals of the world , and though the states on the U S Mexico border may be the first places in the nation to suffer from cartel violence , by no means are they the last The president flagrantly defies the 2006 federal law ordering the construction of a secure border fence along the entire Mexican border So the border today remains porous not only to people seeking jobs in the U S , but to criminals whose jobs are murder , rape , robbery and kidnapping Ominously , the border also remains open to agents of al Qaeda and other terrorist organizations Numerous intelligence sources have confirmed that foreign terrorists have identified the southern U S border as their path of entry into the country When the next terrorist attack comes , the Obama administration wo n't accept responsibility Instead , it will do what it does every time blame a scapegoat and count on Obama 's mainstream media enablers to go along A heinous act of mass murder either by terrorists or by some psychotic who should have been locked up long ago will be the pretext to unleash a tsunami of gun control No wonder Americans are buying guns in record numbers right now , while they still can and before their choice about which firearm is right for their family is taken away forever After Hurricane Sandy , we saw the hellish world that the gun prohibitionists see as their utopia Looters ran wild in south Brooklyn There was no food , water or electricity And if you wanted to walk several miles to get supplies , you better get back before dark , or you might not get home at all Anti gun New York City Mayor Michael Bloomberg had already done everything he could to prevent law abiding New Yorkers from owning guns , and he has made sure that no ordinary citizen will ever be allowed to carry a gun He even refused to allow the National Guard into the city to restore civil order because Guardsmen carry guns ! Meanwhile , President Obama is leading this country to financial ruin , borrowing over a trillion dollars a year for phony stimulus spending and other payoffs for his political cronies Nobody knows if or when the fiscal collapse will come , but if the country is broke , there likely wo n't be enough money to pay for police protection And the American people know it Hurricanes Tornadoes Riots Terrorists Gangs Lone criminals These are perils we are sure to face not just maybe It 's not paranoia to buy a gun It 's survival It 's responsible behavior , and it 's time we encourage law abiding Americans to do just that Since the election , millions of Americans have been lining up in front of gun stores , Cabela 's and Bass Pro Shops exercising their freedom while they still have it They are demonstrating they have a mass determination to buy , own and use firearms Millions of Americans are using market forces like never before to demonstrate their ardent support for our firearm freedoms That 's one of the very best ways we can Stand And Fight Inevitably , the anti gun media and the gun ban lobbies are demonizing the purchase of firearms They call us extremists because we wonder whether we will be able to buy a semi auto in three years or , even in some states , later this year That 's despite the fact that President Obama long ago made clear that he wants to ban them all ! The media try to make rank and file Americans feel guilty about buying a gun The enemies of freedom demonize gun buyers and portray us as social lepers But we know the truth We know that responsible gun ownership exemplifies what is good and right about America Responsible Americans realize that the world as we know it has changed We , the American people , clearly see the daunting forces we will undoubtedly face terrorists , crime , drug gangs , the possibility of Euro style debt riots , civil unrest or natural disaster Gun owners are not buying firearms because they anticipate a confrontation with the government Rather , we anticipate confrontations where the government is n't there or simply does n't show up in time To preserve the inalienable , individual human right to keep and bear arms to withstand the siege that is coming the NRA is building a four year communications and resistance movement The enemies of the Second Amendment will be met with unprecedented defiance , commitment and determination We will Stand And Fight First , we are going to devise legal capability like never before I fervently hope that President Obama does not get to appoint another anti gun Supreme Court justice like Sonia Sotomayor or Elena Kagan But he probably will , and we must meet that challenge His chances of appointing a replacement for one of the five pro rights justices in the 5 4 Heller and McDonald majorities are high And there 's no doubt he is going to appoint a huge number of new judges to lifetime positions in the lower federal courts YOUR GUN RIGHTS ARE UNDER CONSTANT ATTACK !
