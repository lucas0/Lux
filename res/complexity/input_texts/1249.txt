b'Yes. Go to this page on the I.R.S. website.\n\nHow do I know if I will get the full amount?\n\nIt depends on your income. Single adults with Social Security numbers who have an adjusted gross income of $75,000 or less will get the full amount. Married couples with no children earning $150,000 or less will receive a total of $2,400. And taxpayers filing as head of household will get the full payment if they earned $112,500 or less.'
