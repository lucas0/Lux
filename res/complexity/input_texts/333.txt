Travis Barker tweeted this morning Now we will never go there again ! ! ! ! knottsberryfarm4lyfe Legally , Disney has the right to refuse entry to anyone they please because the parks are their private property While we respect individuals' freedom of expression through tattoos , we do not think that ink has any place in the Magic Kingdom , Enga ar told Inked For those who did n't bring long sleeves or have neck tattoos we opened gift shops in front of our gates so that they can buy a Disney sweatshirt or scarf to cover their tattoos up before entering our theme parks For years it has been rumored that Disney CEO Bob Iger has despised tattoos , not just for the aesthetic quality , but because of tattoo artists making money for inking Disney logos and characters without compensating his corporation Ownership of trademarks in this country means that nobody can profit off of your intellectual property , he wrote in an internal memo that was leaked to Breitbart com in 2014 But I have seen thousands of Disney tattoos on patrons of our theme parks and I have n't seen one dime coming from any of those tattoos It is like we are being mocked in our own house Other than tattoos , Disney has also banned facial piercings other than earrings and nose studs That means no lip , eyebrow , septum or dimple piercings We asked Enga ar if nose rings and ear plugs tunnels were allowed but she did n't understand what those were , so she said she wanted to look into it Last year , Disney banned selfie sticks and hoverboards , but this is the first time the parks have restricted any form of body art or permanent cosmetics We at Inked applauded Walt Disney World and Resort for backing the Florida Competitive Workforce Act which pushed for LGBT rights in the workplace but we strongly believe that the banning of visible tattoos is a severe discriminatory practice Sadly , the parks are also removing seven of the pirates from their popular Pirates of the Caribbean ride because they have tattoos This is a zero tolerance policy beginning today , April 1st , Enga ar said Not even Johnny Depp will be allowed into our parks with short sleeves Available at INKEDSHOP COM Women 's Inked Logo V Neck T ShirtAnnounced today , Disney theme parks , including Walt Disney World Florida and Disneyland in Anaheim , are banning admittance to anyone with visible tattoos Per The Walt Disney Company 's spokesperson for Consumer Relations Theme Parks Division , April Enga ar We Advertisement
