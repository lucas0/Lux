Managing the site has become too stressful.“Facebook has gotten out of control,” reportedly said Zuckerberg in a press conference outside his Palo Alto office, “and the stress of managing this company has ruined my life. I need to put an end to all the madness.”Zuckerberg reportedly went on to explain that starting May 15th, users will no longer be able to access their Facebook accounts. That gives users (and Facebook addicts) a year to adjust to liwithout Facebook.“After May 15th, 2013 the whole website shuts down,” said Avrat Humarthi, Vice President of Technical Affairs at Facebook. “So if you ever want to see your pictures again, I recommend you take them off the internet. You won’t be able to get them back after Facebook goes out of business.”Zuckerberg said the decision to shut down Facebook was difficult, but that he does not think people will be upset.“I personally don’t think it’s a big deal,” he said in a private phone interview to a source close to a friend. “And to be honest, I think it’s for the better. Without Facebook, people will have to go outside and make real friends. That’s always a good thing.”
