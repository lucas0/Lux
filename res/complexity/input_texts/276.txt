4 commentsIt 's so typical of radical liberals They pretend to be patriotic Americans , but immediately turn on their own the moment they do n't get their way REAL patriots love this country no matter what , and will always work to make it better Grammy nominated recording artist Lana Del Rey is not a real patriot Sure , she 's featured the American flag as a backdrop to many of her concerts in the past But because her candidate did n't win the last presidential election , she 's now banning the Stars and Stripes The 32 year old model turned singer told Pitchfork that she feels uncomfortable and less safe as an American living under President Trump As for using the American flag at her concerts I definitely changed my visuals on my tour videos I'm not going to have the American flag waving while I'm singing Born to Die ' It 's not going to happen I 'd rather have static I feel less safe than I did when Obama was president I say , if she 's going to boycott the flag , we BOYCOTT HER !
