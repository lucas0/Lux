K5 security robot The lights can change color \( red for trouble , orange for caution , etc \) If a K5 decides that there 's a situation , it can use one of its built in sirens to try and diffuse things or it can message HQ to summon a human If you step in front of the K5 , or otherwise interfere with it , it will gently warn you with some chimes but if you do n't move , an ear piercing alarm is triggered Other than its sirens and its rather imposing design , the K5 is n't equipped with any weapons or other tools for resolving situations \( Does anyone else think it looks like the lovechild of a Dalek and EVE from WALL E \? \) A slightly odd photo of a US sheriff holding a gun to the head of a K5 robotK5 is n't just for catching criminals , either If you find yourself in trouble danger , there 's also a button on the top of the robot that summons help from HQ Read Microsoft wants to be part of Judgment Day , tooThe purpose of the K5 , like most robots , is straightforward To replace expensive human workers The K5 can run for around 24 hours on a single battery charge , automatically navigates back to the charging point when it 's running low , and only takes 15 20 minutes to recharge Obviously , in the long run , this is cheaper and more efficient than a human security guard plus , as technology improves , the K5 will probably be more vigilant and capable of spotting smaller discrepancies than a human In theory , because of the lower cost , you could also field lots of K5 robots , reducing the number of potential holes in security coverage It goes without saying , though , that deploying a fleet of roughly human sized , autonomous robots is just a little bit scary At the very least , a 300 pound robot would cause a lot of damage if it ran into something a car , a shop window , a child In all likelihood , though , if these robotic security guards are popular , they 'll eventually be equipped with weapons perhaps a taser for subduing a suspect , and a tear gas launcher for clearing groups of people At that point , you need to be really sure that the AI is free of bugs
