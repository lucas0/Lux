Political Elite with Concealed Carry Permits a Symptom of Only Ones' NOT Support for Gun RightsNational Association for Gun RightsColorado \( Ammoland com \) Word of gun owners' victory at the Iowa Straw Poll is spreading Even one of America 's premier political news sites , Politico com , has picked up the story about how National Association for Gun Rights members just like you toppled Tim Pawlenty 's Presidential campaign The article even noted my subsequent call for NAGR members to lobby Governor Rick Perry to return the National Association for Gun Rights Presidential Candidate Survey However , Politco com writer Maggie Haberman missed the mark when she noted that Perry has a concealed carry permit by assuming he must be pro gun because he has a concealed weapon permit Senator Barbara Boxer \( left \) , seen here vilifying semi automatic rifles with Dianne Feinstein , has a permit to carry The Washington , D C elites just do n't get it They think that simply having a concealed weapon permit automatically makes any politician pro gun Do you think California Democrat Senator Barbara Boxer is pro gun \? No , I do n't think so , either But Barbara Boxer used her influence to secure an elusive concealed carry permit from California I can almost hear her trying to deceive gun owners Trust me , I have a permit Or how about New York Democrat Senator Chuck Schumer \? Schumer himself is reported to possess a New York concealed handgun permit , and both U S Senators regularly employed armed guards for their personal protection Just because a politician recognizes that being armed makes THEM safer , does n't mean they support YOUR right to keep and bear arms They think they 're different than you and me , that because of their title they 're entitled to MORE rights than we are The Second Amendment is about much more than just carrying concealed or hunting or sport shooting Your right to keep and bear arms is a bulwark against tyranny Chuck Schumer , one of the most anti gun Senators in Washington D C , obtained a permit to carry for self defense That 's why the National Association for Gun Rights sends Presidential Candidate Surveys to politicians like Tim Pawlenty and Governor Rick Perry Gun owners MUST know where they stand on important issues like banning magazine or bans on certain types of semi automatic rifles , or opposing the United Nations' Small Arms Treaty gun grab Please call Rick Perry 's campaign RIGHT NOW at \( 858 \) 483 4300 and demand that he return the National Association for Gun Rights Presidential Candidate Survey I hope you 'll also take a moment and re read my article about how AmmoLand readers like you toppled Tim Pawlenty 's Presidential aspirations Please , do n't forget to call Governor Perry at \( 858 \) 483 4300 and demand that he return the National Association for Gun Rights Presidential Candidate Survey For liberty , Dudley BrownAbout The National Association for Gun Rights is a nonprofit , nonpartisan , single purpose citizens' organization dedicated to preserving and protecting the Constitutionally protected right to keep and bear arms through an aggressive program designed to mobilize public opposition to anti gun legislation The National Association for Gun Rights' mailing address is P O 7002 , Fredericksburg , VA 22404 They can be contacted toll free at 1 877 405 4570 Its web address is www NationalGunRights orgEditorial Disclaimer The opinions and views expressed above do not necessarily reflect those of the staff , AmmoLand Shooting Sports News , or other sponsors and partners See the Editorial Review Process for more details 60 thoughts on Political Elite with Concealed Carry Permits a Symptom of Only Ones' NOT Support for Gun Rights Comment navigation
