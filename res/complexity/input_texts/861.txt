b'Reopening Regional reopening Reopening soon Shut down Click a state to see more detail\n\nThe United States has crossed an uneasy threshold, with all 50 states beginning to reopen in some way after the coronavirus thrust the country into lockdown. But there are substantial variations in how states are deciding to open up, with some forging far ahead of others.\n\nThe changes reflect the immense pressures weighing on the nations governors to respond to a crippled economy and an anxious public, even as epidemiologists warn of the potential for a second wave of cases. Cases were rising in about a dozen states in recent days, including several states that allowed early reopenings.\n\nHow States Shut Down These maps show which states had statewide stay-at-home orders in place on a given date. March 23 March 30 April 7\n\nThe New York Times is tracking when orders to stay at home are lifted in each state, as well as when broad reopenings are allowed. A state is categorized as reopening once its stay-at-home order lifts, or once reopening is permitted in at least one major sector (restaurants, retail stores, personal care businesses), or once reopening is permitted in a combination of smaller sectors. A state is categorized as regional reopening if, by and large, the governor permits certain counties or regions to open while others remain closed. States may shift categories as conditions change, or to account for changes in the national landscape.\n\nThis page will be updated regularly.\n\nSelect a location Alabama Alaska Arizona Arkansas California Colorado Connecticut Delaware District of Columbia Florida Georgia Hawaii Idaho Illinois Indiana Iowa Kansas Kentucky Louisiana Maine Maryland Massachusetts Michigan Minnesota Mississippi Missouri Montana Nebraska Nevada New Hampshire New Jersey New Mexico New York North Carolina North Dakota Ohio Oklahoma Oregon Pennsylvania Puerto Rico Rhode Island South Carolina South Dakota Tennessee Texas Utah Vermont Virginia Washington West Virginia Wisconsin Wyoming'
