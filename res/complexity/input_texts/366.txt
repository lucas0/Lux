The hearing was cut short so lawmakers could attend the floor session.The trouble started as lawmakers began reciting the Pledge of Allegiance.Adriana Espinoza, an activist sitting directly behind the main agitator, said a small group in unison added their own ending to the pledge by saying in liberty and justice for some.She said that prompted security to start pointing out disruptive people.Elizabeth Brown, a state Senate candidate who attended the hearing earlier, said one man was the most disruptive, chanting re-vote, but he left without incident when asked.Espinoza and Brown said a security official pointed out a man in a Guy Fawkes mask and wearing dreadlocks as an agitator, but they said he sat quietly as the main agitator led chants.Officers run toward the House of Representatives on March 28, 2016, after chaos in the House gallery.

Those around him started screaming that the police were out of line, and later that the police were choking him.Eventually DPS officers were able to pry him loose.Department of Public Safety Captain Damon Cecil said the Houses Sergeant of Arms wanted the man in the mask to leave and asked troopers to remove him.Cecil said he was yelling different slogans and was warned, but continued to be disruptive.Cecil also said its the Sergeant at Arms who decides who should be removed.The man will be booked into Maricopa County jail on suspicion of resisting arrest and trespassing, Cecil said.Cecil disagreed with witnesses who said the man wasnt disruptive.If he was peaceful, why wouldnt he just leave? Cecil said.No one was injured in the chaos.Share this:Click to email this to a friend (Opens in new window)Click to print (Opens in new window)Click to share on Facebook (Opens in new window)Click to share on LinkedIn (Opens in new window)Click to share on Twitter (Opens in new window)Click to share on Google+ (Opens in new window)
