I love biscuits , Mars bars , and all things chocolate so these were heaven in a pod to me I'm not quite sure what it is but minature products seem to really appeal to me , when I saw these tasty looking morsels in a combination of my 3 most favourite things there was no questioning over whether or not I was to try them The fact there were 40 to a box made me not feel so guilty , as I portioned them out into bags of 5 which seemed just the right number to hit that sweet sugar craving The crisp biscuit shell was the perfect thickness and texture with just the right amount of crunch to them The caramel was smooth and flowing , with a creamy , rich taste The caramel is a bit runnier in consistency than that of the standard Mars but to fair I do actually prefer my caramel to be this way Topped with thick creamy chocolate these are perfect I have served these up at Christmas before and they are always so quick to go , my family absolutely loves them They make a perfect sweet treat for a lunch box and a great snack for watching a movie or sports match , grab a handful and your good to go \( Alex \) Dated 1st of June , 2014 Review by alexmoulton This Review 6 8 10 Taste Portions Uniqueness Personal Choice Out of the 3 flavours I had tried , this was the one that I had the highest expectations for Mars bars , were always my favourite compared to Twix and Snickers That being said , I prefered Milky Way 's compared to Mars Bars , because despite how much I enjoyed the flavour , the Mars Bars , were big enough , that I 'd be over the sweetness by the end of it Milky Way 's were small enough to enjoy without overdoing it But its the nougat that I have always enjoyed the most in chocolate bars , It was light and fluffy , compared with the thick , rich , intense flavour of the caramel Which is why I was let down by these Pods , While the flavour was less intense than the Twix and Snickers flavours , it was still too sweet and sickening for me It was okay for a few , but I would never be able to eat a packet that big , so it is wasteful Without the separation of nougat and caramel , it just did n't appeal to me I am still curious to try the Bounty Bars Pods , as I do love the coconut bars , and their lack of caramel may provide a flavour that I will enjoy , but I will have to wait and see These Pods just did n't do anything for me \( Samantha \) Dated 30th of August , 2013 Review by samantha203 This Review 9 0 10 Taste Portions Uniqueness Personal Choice I had never tried these before despite the fact they had been around for so many years , I only heard of them by seeing the reviews on KIWIreviews ! I decided I had to try them as they had such great reviews and was real gutted that I could n't find any bounty ones as bounty is my favourite chocolate bar of all time My choice because of that was these Mars bar ones I was impressed by the taste , which was a crispy biscuit shell filled with yummy mars bar I found the caramel was a bit more free flowing than in a normal mars bar but that did n't bother me because I love caramel The chocolate had that great mars bar quality They are quite a good size for a quick snack for a chocolate fix being so bite sized you can have a relatively guilt free handful The only complaint I have is there is just not enough in a pack , because they are just so moreish and after sharing around you are left wanting more , more , more Overall a great product although I really would like to try the Bounty ones ! \( Karyn \) Dated 21st of December , 2012 Review by flabbergastered This Review 3 3 10 Taste Portions Uniqueness Personal Choice Gosh from reading the other reviews about this product I must be the only one out there who does n't like them ! ! I have never bought my own packet of Pods but have tried them on a couple of occasions at friends parties or work shouts , and I ca n't say they are anything special and I am a fan of both biscuits and Mars bars ! ! But put these two ingredients together and I can happily turn these Pods down I do n't really understand the concept of them and maybe that is the problem , but I woud n't go out of my way to look for these at the supermarket or even recommend them to family or friends I have n't tried these in a few years and maybe my tastes may have changed but for now I ca n't give a raving review on Pods \( Jo \) Dated 14th of April , 2012 Review by jopukeko This Review 8 8 10 Taste Portions Uniqueness Personal Choice A few years ago when Mars first introduced Pods it seemed like I could n't go to a gathering without someone providing some Everyone was talking about them and of course I had to try them They are definitely are party food They are in a packet that is made for sharing They come in a sealed bag inside a box I am thankful they are packaged like this as there are a few crumbs in the bottom of the bag but would be even more it there was n't a double layer of protection Unlike other Mars products they are not individually wrapped and look great in a small bowl The biscuit base meant that the pods were not as sweet as most chocolate treats There are several other varieties to try but the mars one remains my favourite They are an expensive way to enjoy what is essentially a chocolate biscuit but great when you need to take something to a party and have no time or energy to prepare a plate \( Rosie \) Dated 8th of April , 2012 Review by rosielee3 This Review 10 10 Taste Portions Uniqueness Personal Choice Mars Pods are the king of biscuits and chocolate treats ! The hard shell that encases the Mars filling is the perfect thickness and the Mars filling is not too sweet , nor too sickly I really like that these are unique and still there is nothing in the market that is remotely similar to pods I find it hard to locate Mars Pods these days , but i was an avid buyer of these a few years back The price of them seems accurate in accordance to the size Pods go under the mantra of once you pop you ca n't stop so make sure you have a friend to share with ! \( Tess \) Dated 8th of April , 2012 Review by tessak This Review 9 0 10 Taste Portions Uniqueness Personal Choice Mars pods the ingenious combination of mars and bikkie in one and these are so good Chocolaty , bite sized , light and crunchy 'pods' full of flavor that wont let you down And best of all they are a nice little price that will not break the bank , which is a good thing , because once you start you cant sop eating these delightful little morsels And best of all they come in more other flavors , so you wont get bored Pods are great as snack for when your feeling a little peckish , and a definite must have for movie or games nights too \( Kym \) Dated 15th of January , 2012 Review by kymmage This Review 9 0 10 Taste Portions Uniqueness Personal Choice I was first introduced to Mars Pods at a party , where they sat in a bowl next to the chips and dip Everyone wanted to try one and as a result of the sheer guest volume , I only got one However , it was a delicious morsel The next time I saw them was at the movie theatres \( not sure why I blanked on them being in supermarkets \) but it became a little tradition for me and my daughter , that we would attend movies and eat pods Eventually I did find them in the supermarket , and often have a bag of them in my purse just in case of an adventure trip to the movies \( I know , I know \) We get a bit of popcorn now as well , but pods have always been a favourite I think it 's partly the wafer bottom , the odd UFO shape , and of course the chocolatey yumminess hiding inside They taste just like a Mars bar , only feel less naughty because you can have a bite , two , three you get the picture though to be far I dont remember a time when we have opened a pack and found any left at the end Thank goodness they only come out as treat food ! We have only tried the Mars ones , would love to find the Bounty ones but have never had the pleasure And as for the Snickers ones , I have had many years of not eating nuts due to pregnancy , breastfeeding and then a fusspot daughter who does n't eat peanuts \( just smooth peanut butter \) , so that rules that flavour out Mars Pods are definitely our Pods ! \( Janine \) Dated 18th of May , 2010 Review by angel7801 This Review 8 5 10 Taste Portions Uniqueness Personal Choice Mars pods are awesome Great flavour Great price very unique idea Great for chocoholics Approx 40 per packet of delicious bite size pieces of creamy caramel with a nice biscuit crust and pure chocolate topping What more could you want \? A mouthful of gooey bliss in each bite They are very addictive You cant just eat one \( Andrew \) Dated 18th of March , 2010 Review by monkeyspoon This Review 10 10 Taste Portions Uniqueness Personal Choice With mars bar being my favourite chocolate bar , I decided trying mars pods would be a great idea and it was It comes with a fair price and a lot of flavour The combination of biscuit shell , mars bar centre and topped with chocolate , makes for a snack for serious snackers Though one box is plenty for most I would be inclined to by at least two at once So if you want a snack to share with friends and family or something full of taste to pig out on , I reccomend the mars flavour PODS \( Amanda \) Dated 26th of August , 2007 Review by mandaz79 This Review 8 5 10 Taste Portions Uniqueness Personal Choice I have tried all the PODS \( I think \) I love them all ! ! They are so moreish I can eat the whole box if not careful I think they are a great price and a great taste Love them ! ! \( Natalie \) Dated 24th of June , 2005 Review by goldfishstar This Review 9 0 10 Taste Portions Uniqueness Personal Choice Mars bars have always been good , and the Mars Pods are no different , they are good ! With a deeper chocolate flavour than the Twix ones , these are good if you want the chocolate rush Personally , I doubt that I would eat too many in one sitting , as I'm not a huge chocolate fan , but great to have there to nibble on \) \( Marcus \) Dated 23rd of June , 2005 Review by testbot This Review 9 8 10 Taste Portions Uniqueness Personal Choice Of all of the Pods flavours , this one is my favourite I used to be an avid muncher of Mars bars , until my doctor warned me that so much sugar would give me diabetes I had to cut right back then These are biscuits I would eat , but not to any great extent , I have lost a lot of my 'sweet tooth' in the last few years But I know that if I still craved sugar the way I used to , these would be what I would happily sit in front of the TV , slap on a movie , and munch down by the box load \( Wayne \) Dated 23rd of June , 2005 Review by mr wayne This Review 8 3 10 Taste Portions Uniqueness Personal Choice Having eaten four boxes of these things I can safely say that i know what they taste like I can also say that I feel rather ill but that is beside the point At first they struck me as rather gimicky without the long term appeal of more classical chocolate treats , that they should have been bigger and more buscuit like and with more filling This view has been altered after extensive testing and thinking about where you would have cause to eat them As far as a sit down and munch out on them snack with a movie they are not perfect , as after about half a dozen you do n't want any more as they are quite sweet , even more so than normal chocolates thanks to the cereal like biscuit outer However they make up for this thanks to the novelty value gained from trying to eat all the biscuit first or trying to separate the two peices \( like pulling apart liqorice allsorts \) I am of the opinion that they would be best suited towards a dinner party of some description , as they would fit in amongst the crackers and cheeses as well as the chips and pineapple pieces on sticks , small and interesting to tide you over till dinner This I think is reenforced by the fact that they are packaged in a box rather than in a bag , even if this is just to protect the fragile pieces it elevates them to classy snack status , like those chocolate wafer sticks and magnum icecreams Pods are a tasty treat , but not to be overdone , enjoy a few with a cup of \( insert ridiculously named coffee beverage \) and enjoy the moment safe in the knowledge that you are far trendier than anyone else in the vicinity Or impress your friends and collegues with pre dinner nibbles and knock off the Jones' for First Place on the neighbourhood coolest dinner party list For you ease and convenience I have ranked each flavour in terms of my preference I'm not saying that this is The Be All and End All to these Flavours , it 's just my opinion Pods are labelled as Ingeniously Crunchy and while they are definately crunchy the ingenious part remains to be seen , they may not be my cup of tea , but then I do n't drink tea either Mars Pods The Mars bar , malt and chocolate overload , and the only competition for a moro These pods had a dark biscuit shell and tasted just like a mars bar , easier to eat than the twix with a richer flavour I got through 8 before I felt ill , which is better than the 5 twix it took , still very sweet but the nicer flavour meant that they only just missed out on the top spot but it was close , very close \( Hayden \) Dated 22nd of June , 2005 Review by boggie This Review 9 5 10 Taste Portions Uniqueness Personal Choice Two words to describe num nums !
