Dog Found Abandoned With Suitcase Filled With His Belongings Scottish animal welfare officials are searching for the owner.Â— -- A dog was found abandoned at a Scottish train station next to a suitcase filled with its belongings and now the local animal welfare charity are looking for tips into who is the neglectful owner.The dog, a male shar-pei named Kai, was found sitting with a leash attached to a banister at the Ayr railway station on Jan. 2, according to the Scottish Society for Prevention of Cruelty to Animals."Kai is around two to three years old and is a lovely dog with a nice nature," Scottish SPCA Inspector Stewart Taylor said in the group's release.The group reported that the suitcase contained a dog bowl, food, a pillow and toy -- although that doesn't clear the owner from wrongdoing.Abandoning an animal is an offense in Scotland and, if they are able to determine who left the dog in the station, that person or persons could be banned from owning animals for life."Regardless of the fact Kai was left with his belongings, this was still a cruel incident and we are keen to identify the person responsible," Taylor said.Officials were able to determine the dog's name because the animal had been microchipped by a previous owner. When they contacted that individual, he reported that he had sold the dog in 2013 but did not have any information on the new owner.Taylor said that the group will care for the dog until they find an owner for Kai.
