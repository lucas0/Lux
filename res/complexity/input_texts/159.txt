I totally did n't expect for this to go the way it did and as fast as it did On the issue of obtaining a concealed carry weapon permitThe concealed weapons permit program here in the state of Florida , as far as I'm concerned , is a joke Literally , it 's three hours of PowerPoint , and then you go down to the range with a very , very low caliber handgun , and you have to put five out of 10 rounds on a paper plate at 5 feet Probably half the class that I had are people that had never touched a gun before in their life On the challenge to give up his AR 57After Las Vegas , I had thought long and hard about it , and thought , well , you know , it 's not hurting anything sitting in my gun safe here But it was n't really until this last tragedy at Stoneman Douglas where it really hit home with us and me Actually , one of my friends on Facebook rather sarcastically said , well , if you really feel this way , why do n't you go turn in your gun at Broward Sheriff 's Office \? I 'll even drive you And that 's what spurred me to think Even though he was being extremely sarcastic about it because he 's a very staunch conservative , gun rights activist person , it kind of spurred me to say , you know what \? Yeah , I 'll do that On what he plans to do nextFor me , to be honest , I'm not sure It 's a lot to process , and nothing that I had this grand master plan going into this for So I'm happy that this sparked a debate and hopefully causes some action I hope somebody be it the students , be it the next generation picks up the torch and does something NPR 's Digital News intern Asia Simone Burns produced this story for the Web NPR 's Rachel Gotbaum and NPR 's Kroc Fellow Adhiti Bandlamudi edited produced this story for broadcast Facebook
