With purpose and strength he came down from his towerTo snatch from a tyrant his ill gotten power Now the cry has gone up with a cheer from the crowd Come out for the Domhnall , the best of MacLeod ! When freedom is threatened by slavery 's chainsAnd voices are silenced as misery reigns , We 'll come out for a leader whose courage is true Whose virtues are solid and long overdue For , he 'll never forget us , we men of the crowd Who elected the Domhnall , the best of MacLeod ! When crippling corruption polluted our nation And plunged our economy into stagnation , As self righteous rogues took the opulent office And plump politicians reneged on their promise The forgotten continued to form a great crowd That defended the Domhnall , the best of MacLeod ! The Domhnall 's a giver whilst others just take , Ne'er gaining from that which his hands did not make A builder of buildings , employing good men , He 's enriched many cities by factors of ten The honest and true gladly march with the crowd Standing up for the Domhnall , the best of MacLeod ! True friend of the migrant from both far and near , He welcomes the worthy , but guards our frontier , Lest a murderous horde , for whom hell is the norm , Should threaten our lives and our nation deform We immigrants hasten to swell the great crowd Coming out for the Domhnall , the best of MacLeod ! Academe now lies dead , the old order rots , No longer policing our words and our thoughts Its ignorant hirelings pretending to teach Are backward in vision , sophomoric in speech Now we learn d of mind add ourselves to the crowd That cheers on the Domhnall , the best of MacLeod ! The black man , forgotten , in poverty dying , The poor man , the sick man , with young children crying , The soldier abroad and the mother who waits , The young without work or behind prison gates , The veterans , wounded , all welcome the crowd That fights for the Domhnall , the best of MacLeod ! Whilst hapless old harridans flapping their traps Teach women to look and behave like us chaps , The Domhnall defends the defenseless forlorn For , a woman 's first right is the right to be born Now the bonnie young lassies that fly to the crowd Have a champion in Domhnall , the best of MacLeod !
