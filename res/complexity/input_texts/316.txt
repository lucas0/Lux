It just makes good business sense Companies like Ben Jerry 's recognize that hiring formerly incarcerated individuals and working with suppliers that do the same is important for our business , our culture , and our bottom line Studies have shown that those with a criminal conviction can often make the best employees they are retained at higher rates than those with no criminal record , saving companies costs associated with hiring and training , which can be as much as 4 , 000 per employee Additionally , companies that hire people with criminal convictions are eligible for the Work Opportunity Tax Credit \( WOTC \) , which provides a maximum tax credit of 2 , 400 per employee Formerly incarcerated individuals are often the most motivated at work A study of army enlistees found that enlistees with felony records were 33 percent more likely to be promoted to sergeant than those with no conviction history , a testament to their dedication and motivation Ben Jerry 's is incredibly proud of our long relationship with the Greyston Bakery in Yonkers It was Ben who heard about the bakery and came up with one of our most successful flavors , Chocolate Fudge Brownie , specifically to allow our company to work with and expand the impact of the baker which , through its open hiring process , has helped thousands of returning citizens and their families rebuild their lives and their dignity It is in part because of our long relationship with the Greyston Bakery that we 've made changes to our hiring and recruiting process so that people are judged by their skill and qualifications , not the mistakes of the past There is no doubt , with 1 in 3 Americans having been convicted of a crime , if we were to use criminal conviction as screen for recruiting , we would be leaving very qualified candidates out of our process That 's just a bad business decision Across New York , the Cuomo administration has long been dedicated to providing employment for those with criminal convictions In 2012 , we launched the Work for Success Program , which matches qualified and appropriately trained job applicants with criminal convictions to open job listings In the last five years , we have placed more than 18 , 000 people in jobs , and each new company that signs on to our Work for Success Pledge also commits to listing job openings with the program In 2015 , the Council on Community Reentry and Reintegration took further steps to ensure equity in hiring by setting uniform guidelines that evaluate qualified applicants for state occupational licenses and adopting fair chance hiring for New York State agencies , meaning agencies will not ask about a job applicant 's criminal convictions until and unless the agency has interviewed the candidate and is interested in hiring him or her As a result of Reentry Council efforts in 2016 , New York is also the first in the nation to prohibit insurance companies from denying insurance coverage to businesses that hire people with criminal convictions These are small steps that can make a huge difference Together , by signing the Work for Success Pledge , businesses have a real opportunity to not only provide a helping hand to those who have been cut off from opportunities , but to also improve our bottom line New York State is dedicated to creating a true state of opportunity for everyone FollowFollowingUnfollowAndrew Cuomo
