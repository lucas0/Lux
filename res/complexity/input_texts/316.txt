Did Mantle swing the same way right handed and left handed \? What really happened to his knee in the 1951 World Series \? What happened to the red haired , freckle faced boy known back home as Mickey Charles \? I believe in memory , not memorabilia , Leavy writes in her preface But in The Last Boy , she discovers that what we remember of our heroes and even what they remember of themselves is only where the story begins Amazon Q A Bill Madden Interviews Jane Leavy Madden Your best selling biography of Sandy Koufax was a tour de force , partly because Koufax was a very private man whose life story had never really been told before Mickey Mantle s life is quite the opposite , it s been in the subject of a spate of different autobiographies , some of which he even wrote Under those circumstances , what made you want to take up another book about him \? Leavy Originally , I wanted to write about Willie , Mickey and The Duke in New York in the Fifties The publisher said , Do The Mick Everybody loves The Mick I was wary because so much had been written about him he left a paper trail as long as the drive from Commerce , Oklahoma to the Bronx , so I didn t expect to learn that he d been raised by a den of Alaskan she wolves My challenge was to strip away all the layers of myth that had accumulated and let Mickey breathe And he , of all people , was my worst source For example the knee surgery he said he had after tripping over a drain in the 1951 World Series trying not to run into Joe DiMaggio in centerfield In fact , he didn t have surgery until two years later I only learned that because I went through every day of the New York Times from October 1951 to November 1953 looking for the date the knife fell ! That s why this book took five years and nearly 600 interviews I wanted to try to understand why after all these years , and all these revelations , Mickey Mantle still means so much to so many people including me and the first step was to get the basic facts straight Madden You make the point early on in the book that Mickey was a childhood hero , but you also have a recurring sequence in the book of your first interview with him in Atlantic City in 1983 , where at one point he drunkenly makes a pass at you What lingering effect did this have on how you ultimately approached your book \? Leavy I was plenty nervous when I met him Mickey was my hero But , he was also a very particular kind of role model I was born two months prematurely \( in a hospital a mile from Yankee Stadium \) and came with some of the flaws that afflict those who don t incubate as long as we re supposed to Mickey taught me how to function with pain and without complaint his triumphs were mine I was devastated with how he acted After I d taken his hand from my knee , I called the only person I could think of still awake at that hour , a new mother , who basically told me to grow up The next morning , over breakfast , I vented my anger and disappointment , railing at him for , among other things , greeting my youthful autograph request with flatulence He was stunned and remorseful , albeit in a hilariously idiosyncratic manner He gave me an 8 x 10 glossy that said , Sorry , I farted , your friend , Mick For a moment , I felt I saw behind his crude fa ade I decided the only way I could write this book was to acknowledge my lack of dispassion and scrutinize him completely That s what happened that weekend in Atlantic City It forced me to see the world as it was , not how I wanted it to be Madden One of the people I wish I 'd been able to interview for my Steinbrenner book was Mantle , if only because I detected a very strained relationship between the two of them Steinbrenner made a point to deify DiMaggio and had memorial services for Joe , Billy Martin , Roger Maris and Mel Allen , but did nothing for Mickey when he died In your conversations with Mickey did he ever talk about Steinbrenner and anything that might have led to ill feelings toward each other \? Leavy When I told Mantle I d heard the Boss was thinking of turning Monument Park in centerfield into a water park for the disadvantaged youth of the South Bronx , Mantle was completely incredulous He told me , It was 480 in centerfield when I played It s 420 now and he s talking about bringing them in farther , and shook his head I was at a banquet one time and I said to him , they ought to let those boys throw the ball up and hit it That pissed him off Mantle was interested in Yankee history he grilled a friend who saw Babe Ruth lying in state in the rotunda at the Stadium about what it was like to be there that day But I don t think he had a whole lot of patience with Yankeeography It was a quick disillusionment When he signed with the Yankees , reporters asked which Yankee had been his childhood hero He said , Stan Musial George Weiss , the general manager , immediately corrected his memory and from then on Joe D was his hero Furthermore , I think he was deeply disappointed with the baseball community s response or lack of response when commissioner Bowie Kuhn banned him in 1983 because of his affiliation with the Claridge Hotel and Casino , a job he had taken to pay for his son Billy s treatment for non Hodgkin s Lymphoma He told me , I feel really kind of bad no one took up for me By no one I was pretty sure he meant Steinbrenner The Yankees did little more than observe a moment of silence when Mantle died Madden It would seem that most everybody pertinent to the book cooperated with you , especially the Mantle family I was grateful for the cooperation I had from George Steinbrenner s friends and associates when I wrote Steinbrenner , but I had an advantage that you didn t in that most of them knew me personally and , I suppose , trusted me As a stranger , did you meet any significant resistance \? Leavy Danny and David Mantle Mickey s sons and their late mother , Merlyn were extremely generous with their recollections and insights Their openness about their lives and their relationship with their father was extraordinary Like him , they are extremely honest There s no put on , as folks in Commerce , Oklahoma like to say I hope they ll come away from the book with a deeper understanding of the forces that formed him and contributed to his downfall , but I don t know how they ll react Madden This is the definitive warts and all biography of Mickey , with heavy emphasis on all of his demons How do you think Mickey himself would feel about the book \? Leavy I think it s an honest book and Mantle was a very honest man I don t see this is as a dark book I hope it s enlightening in the most literal sense of the word and I hope that critics and readers at large will agree I think the tragedy of Mantle is that he had so little time , at the beginning of his baseball career , and at the beginning of his sober life , to be his best self He was a decent man who was genetically pre disposed to alcoholism and enabled his whole life by the trappings of his celebrity That s his story As Billy Crystal told me about his movie , 61 , Mickey wouldn t have wanted the sugar coat His late wife , Merlyn , wrote about the sexual abuse he suffered as a young boy in the family memoir , A Hero All His Life and she elaborated on it when we spoke , as did several of his close friends It turned out that his half sister wasn t his only abuser and experts tell me that many of the destructive behaviors he manifested are seen in victims of childhood sexual abuse So , I came away with enormous compassion for him and , I hope , with an answer to the question posed by one of his minor league teammates Mickey , what happened \?
