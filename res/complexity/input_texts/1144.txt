As of July 20, the government imposed mandatory mask-wearing in enclosed public spaces.\n\nAll restrictions on travel within the country have been lifted, and schools, shops, cafs and restaurants have all reopened, with restrictions. The French government has ramped up its ability to identify and isolate new cases and trace their contacts. Several hundreds of clusters have emerged in the months since the lockdown lifted, with more than 100 still active, prompting authorities to warn that a second wave of the epidemic is possible.\n\nHow Cases Are Growing\n\nHeres how the number of new cases and deaths are changing over time:\n\nNew reported cases by day in France 0 2,000 4,000 6,000 cases Feb.

But the data skewed higher in the early weeks of April when previously unrecorded deaths were suddenly added to the nationally tally.\n\nGenerally speaking, France was late to increase its testing capacities compared to countries like Germany. The national public health authority has acknowledged that the reported number of test-confirmed cases was lower than the real number of cases.\n\nWhere You Can Find More Information\n\nRead more about the viruss impact on Frances economy and on its vaunted health system, the strain the epidemic is putting on poor urban suburbs, how Covid-19 has changed attitudes towards mask-wearing and how France was left defenseless against the virus.\n\nIn Paris, the city imposed a curfew on outdoor sports, and around the country people fled to their second homes. Nearly 60 percent of sailors aboard the Charles de Gaulle, Frances flagship aircraft carrier, were infected. And some reports suggest the virus might have been present in Europe much earlier than thought.\n\nHere is where you can find more detailed information:"
