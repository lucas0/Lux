I wanted to take this opportunity to provide again my sincerest apologies for the situation that took place last week during a Military Ball held at our property I take this matter very seriously and personally as I have a brother who is a Navy Veteran Two Supervisor level employees , who have since been terminated , made poor decisions including displaying a sign that they created , which we find very offensive Their actions were in no way associated with the values of the hotel management Their actions do not reflect our principles or beliefs , and this is not how we train our employees We deeply regret any offense to the service members and their guests , and have implemented a retraining of our employees to ensure this does not happen again We are honored and proud to support our Military community and their families , and look forward to continuing to serve those who serve us Again , we are very sorry for the situation that occurred at our property and welcome all Military service members , their families and community to our hotel Sincerely , Daniel Kammerer General Manager of the DoubleTree by Hilton Colorado Springs March 15 Statement from Daniel Kammerer , General Manager of the DoubleTree by Hilton Colorado Springs Our property has a proud history of hiring veterans and welcoming the military as our guests Last night two of our team members acted without the proper authority to close and exclude military guests from our hotel s bar This action is inconsistent with our values and we humbly apologize The two team members are no longer employed at the property We have attempted to contact the leaders of the group to apologize and confirm that our property is one that welcomes all , especially the men and women who serve our country
