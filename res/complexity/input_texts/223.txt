January 26 , 2016 by Bristol Palin COUNT Unless you 've been totally off social media for the past week or so , you 've probably seen how actress and Fox News personality Stacey Dash caused Twitter to explode when she said that BlackHistoryMonth and BET should n't exist She said Either we want to have segregation or integration , and if we do n't want segregation , then we have to get rid of channels like BET and the BET Awards and the Image Awards , where you 're only awarded if you 're black , she continued If it were the other way around , we 'd be up in arms It 's a double standard There should n't be a black history month We 're Americans , period Well , she definitely started a conversation and has agreement in unexpected places 1 Listen to what famous rapper Waka Flocka said He said But honestly , I always felt like that Like why the f k we got BET \? BET is for black people and MTV is for white people \? Think about it Why the f k we got Black History Month only in February \? How can the people that took our history , give us our history for one month \? Just think about it I have to admit , I do n't know who Waka Flocka is , or what he sings , but I agree with him on this ! 2 Listen to what rapper , writer , actor , director Ice Cube said about the OscarSoWhite controversy We do n't do movies for the industry We do movies for the fans , for the people , Ice Cube said Friday To cry about not winning an award is like crying because you do n't have enough icing on your cake ! Though he did n't mention Stacey by name , is n't it interesting how he echoed her sentiments exactly \? We should n't segregate ourselves or limit Black History Month to one month a year I wish things were really colorblind I do n't know what we can do as a society to come together as one Ss far as what I have seen about the OscarSoWhiteControversy , it seems Jada Smith started it because her husband was n't getting nominated I do n't know how other people think about it , but I hope my son sees early on that not everyone gets a trophy Buy my Mom 's new devotional , Sweet Freedom , in bookstores everywhere !
