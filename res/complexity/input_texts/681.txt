b'Should my child have a play date?\n\nWhether your child should have a play date is a personal decision, experts say. But parents need to be fully aware of the risks involved. I would still take a lot of caution, knowing that Im exposing my child to another child who comes with multiple exposures from their end, said Dr. Stanley Spinner, M.D., vice president and chief medical officer of Texas Childrens Pediatrics and Texas Childrens Urgent Care. How much risk are you willing to take? Parents also need to consider whether family members, relatives, or anyone else around them and their kids is older or has underlying medical conditions that might put that person at risk. A play date could potentially expose not only your child to the virus, but also those more vulnerable as well.'
