b'At his Saturday event here in the home of a local state senator, Mr. Booker delivered a broad lesson in economic policy and the racial wealth gap.\n\nWhen a child is born in America, and they become 18 years old, their ZIP code and their family income is a powerful determinant of their destiny, Mr. Booker said, as he cited statewide birthrate statistics and how they would be affected by his proposal, reading from an index card. We would actually take our stratifications of wealth in this country and begin to give people in the lower rung the ability to create wealth and grow.\n\nMr. Booker was introducing the audience to what is becoming a central component of his emerging platform, an economic proposal known as baby bonds that would create a government-run savings account for every child born in the United States. The program is designed to aggressively address the nations growing wealth gap, and the governments contributions would increase based on a familys economic standing.\n\nThough Mr. Booker introduced his baby bond proposal last year in the Senate, and has made passing reference to it in his stump speeches and town halls since, it had not yet played a central role.\n\nWhile other campaigns have enjoyed early surges, Mr. Booker has largely trod an under-the-radar, workmans path of reaching out to voters. One of the most prolific travelers in the crowded Democratic field, having visited at least 28 communities in March alone, Mr. Booker has attracted packed rooms at most events. But he has not had any breakthrough moments or introduced meaty policy proposals that have helped propel other candidates at least temporarily into the spotlight.'
