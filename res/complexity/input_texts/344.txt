b'[Joe Biden selected Senator Kamala Harris of California as his vice-presidential running mate.]\n\nJoseph R. Biden Jr. is expected to announce his vice-presidential choice within days. After missing one self-imposed deadline after another, he is running out of time to make his selection before the Democratic National Convention begins on Aug. 17.\n\nMr. Bidens advisers say he has spoken with several of the leading candidates in recent days, and it has been confirmed that he met in person in early August with Gov. Gretchen Whitmer of Michigan. We do not know exactly how many face-to-face interviews Mr. Biden has conducted with potential running mates. A small handful of women remain under serious consideration.\n\nAmong the candidates reviewed most closely by Mr. Bidens vetting team are Senators Elizabeth Warren and Kamala Harris, both former presidential candidates; Representatives Karen Bass of California and Val Demings of Florida; Senator Tammy Duckworth of Illinois and Susan E. Rice, the former national security adviser.\n\nThe lobbying for and against the various candidates has grown intense, and some prominent Democrats have spoken out in recent days against what appears to be a concerted effort by some Democrats to spread negative information about some of the contenders in hopes of boosting their own candidate of choice.\n\nBut people close to Mr. Biden acknowledge that, at this point, the V.P. choice is almost entirely in his hands. He has said all along that he wants a running mate with whom he has strong personal chemistry, and who could be a hand-in-glove partner in governing. Those criteria appear to have strengthened both Ms. Whitmer, with whom Mr. Biden developed a tight political bond this year, and Ms. Rice, who worked closely with Mr. Biden in the Obama administration.\n\nUltimately, only Mr. Biden can judge which person in this historically diverse vice-presidential field best meets his own view of what the job demands.\n\n[Follow along with The Timess coverage of Joe Bidens pick for vice president.]\n\nTop contenders\n\nKamala Harris\n\nImage\n\nBio: Senator from California since 2017; former presidential candidate; served as district attorney in San Francisco and state attorney general.\n\nHow seriously is she being vetted? Very seriously. Harris, 55, has long been seen as among the likeliest candidates to be chosen.\n\nSignature issues: Proposed cutting middle-class taxes; recently advocated policing reform; pushed a Senate bill to make lynching a federal crime; played a high-profile role in the confirmation hearings of Justice Brett M. Kavanaugh.\n\nRelationship with Biden: Harris had a friendly relationship with Biden before they competed in the 2020 primaries, and Harris knew his late son, Beau, when they served as attorneys general. But Harris also attacked Biden more harshly than any other Democrat in the 2020 race, rebuking him in the first televised debate for having worked with segregationist senators to oppose school busing policies in the 1970s.\n\nPros and cons: Harris is among the best-known Black women in American politics, with appeal to both moderates and liberals. But she ran an unsteady presidential campaign last year and struggled with questions about her law-enforcement record. The way she and her advisers handled the 2020 primary left some in the Biden campaign with significant reservations.\n\nOn being considered for vice president: I know that conversation is taking place in the press and among the pundits, and Im honored to even be considered, if thats the case.\n\nSusan Rice\n\nImage\n\nBio: National security adviser and ambassador to the United Nations under President Obama.\n\nHow seriously is she being vetted? Very seriously. Rice, 55, has been among the candidates furthest along in the vetting process.\n\nSignature issues: Closely identified with the Obama administrations foreign policy breakthroughs, including the Iran nuclear deal and the Paris climate agreement; recently called for statehood for Washington, D.C.\n\nRelationship with Biden: Rice served with Biden in the Obama administration for eight years, and their working relationship dates back to the 1990s when Rice was an assistant secretary of state and Biden was on the Senate Foreign Relations Committee.\n\nPros and cons: Rice has credentials on national security and foreign policy that no other candidate can match, as well as a deep working relationship with Biden. While she has never been a candidate, she is seen as an agile communicator on television who would likely fare well in a vice-presidential debate. But Rice has never been elected to office before, and putting her on the ticket would force Biden to relitigate some major controversies of the Obama administration  most significantly, the 2012 attack on the U.S. consulate in Benghazi, Libya.\n\nOn being considered for vice president: Im humbled and honored to be among the extremely accomplished women who are reportedly being considered in that regard.\n\nElizabeth Warren\n\nImage\n\nBio: Senator from Massachusetts since 2013; former presidential candidate; former Harvard Law School professor and bankruptcy expert; architect of the Consumer Financial Protection Bureau.\n\nHow seriously is she being vetted? Very seriously. Warren, 71, has been among the strongest contenders to be Mr. Bidens running mate.\n\nSignature issues: Has long criticized wealth concentration and corporate power; proposed plans to break up big companies, tax the extremely rich and use proceeds to fund new social benefits; recently called for investigations of how the Trump administration has distributed economic stimulus money and pushed a measure to strip the names of Confederate generals from military bases.\n\nRelationship with Biden: Warren and Biden have a relationship of mutual respect, framed by significant ideological differences. When Biden was a senator and Warren a Harvard professor, they clashed in a Senate hearing over bankruptcy regulation. But when Biden was mulling a campaign for president in 2016, he met with Warren privately and considered the idea of asking her to run with him.\n\nPros and cons: Warren would bring sterling progressive credentials and a forceful economic message to Bidens ticket. But she does not represent racial or generational diversity, and her populist record could unnerve some moderates.\n\nOn being considered for vice president: Im focused right now on this crisis.\n\nGretchen Whitmer\n\nImage\n\nBio: Governor of Michigan since 2019; former Democratic leader in the Michigan State Senate; delivered the Democratic response to President Trumps State of the Union address in February.\n\nHow seriously is she being vetted? Very seriously. Whitmer, 48, has acknowledged she has had contact with the Biden search team, but seems like a less prominent candidate than she was in the spring.\n\nSignature issues: Ran for governor on a platform of rebuilding Michigans broken roads, raising the minimum wage and investing in education; has grappled with the coronavirus pandemic reshaping her administration, putting public health and budgetary challenges at the center of her agenda.\n\nRelationship with Biden: Whitmer has described herself as having been friends with Biden for years, and he endorsed her campaign for governor in 2018. She returned the favor before the Michigan presidential primary in March.\n\nPros and cons: Whitmer is a popular young leader from a swing state, with a compelling story of leadership during the coronavirus pandemic. She is ideologically aligned with Biden and might help him lock down Midwestern and industrial battlegrounds  not only Michigan, but also Pennsylvania and Wisconsin. But Whitmer has only served half a term as governor, and if Biden selects her then Democrats would be putting forward an all-white ticket for the second consecutive election.\n\nOn being considered for vice president: I am making a little bit of time to stay connected to the campaign but the most important thing that I have to do right now is be the governor of my home state.\n\nKaren Bass\n\nImage\n\nBio: Representative from California since 2011; chair of the Congressional Black Caucus; former speaker of the California State Assembly.\n\nHow seriously is she being vetted? Very seriously. Bass, 66, joined the process later than some of the other candidates, but she has emerged this summer as a top contender for the vice presidency.\n\nSignature issues: Has been a prominent figure in the House debate over police reform; introduced legislation on public health, student debt and foster care; leads a House subcommittee on Africa, global health and human rights.\n\nRelationship with Biden: Bass and Biden do not have a deep relationship, but they appeared together at several events when he was vice president and Bass endorsed his candidacy in March.\n\nPros and cons: Bass has a longer legislative record  in Washington and California  than almost anyone else under consideration. She has a rich political record that has involved confronting civil unrest in Los Angeles and helping steer her state through the Great Recession. But she is little-known nationally and is only now receiving close scrutiny for aspects of her biography, including making multiple visits to Cuba under Fidel Castro.\n\nOn being considered for vice president: Im willing to serve my country in whatever way I am called upon.\n\nVal Demings\n\nImage\n\nBio: Representative from Florida since 2017; served as police chief in Orlando after a long career there as an officer.\n\nHow seriously is she being vetted? Very seriously. Demings, 63, has been interviewed at length and vetted intensively by the Biden team.\n\nSignature issues: Has been an outspoken voice in the House on issues related to gun control and law enforcement; served as an impeachment manager in the Senate trial of President Trump.\n\nRelationship with Biden: Demings and Biden do not have a longstanding relationship, but they campaigned together for Florida Democrats during the 2018 elections.\n\nPros and cons: Demings is a strong campaigner with a rsum that matches the moment, and she comes from a crucial part of the countrys biggest swing state. But she has not been closely vetted by the press and her experience in elected office is relatively brief.\n\nOn being considered for vice president: I hope, regardless of how it turns out, that when boys and girls and young men and women around this nation hear my personal story and theyve been told that they cant make it for whatever reason, that they will be inspired.\n\nTammy Duckworth\n\nImage\n\nBio: Senator from Illinois since 2017; served two terms in the House; former director of the Illinois Department of Veterans Affairs; a retired Army lieutenant colonel and helicopter pilot who lost both legs in combat while serving in Iraq.\n\nHow seriously is she being vetted? Very seriously. Duckworth, 52, has been interviewed by the Biden team and she has been asked to submit documents for vetting.\n\nSignature issues: Has been a prominent spokeswoman for her party on national security and the concerns of veterans and military families; championed policies to protect people with disabilities.\n\nRelationship with Biden: Duckworth does not have an especially close relationship with Biden, but as vice president he backed her 2016 candidacy to unseat a Republican senator, Mark Kirk. Duckworth introduced Bidens late son, Beau, as a speaker at the 2008 Democratic National Convention.\n\nPros and cons: Duckworths personal story could be powerful in a presidential campaign; she would be the first veteran on a national ticket since John McCain, and the first female veteran ever. She is a less prominent voice on some of the issues most central to the campaign, like policing and the economy.\n\nOn being considered for vice president: I can push back against Trump in a way others cant.'
