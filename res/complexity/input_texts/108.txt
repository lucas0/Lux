It all has to do with how we as humans have evolved Every part of the body has a purpose , and when we lose touch with ourselves and our bodies , we lose the true power we have Hair , like skin , is an extension of the nervous system , it may be correctly seen as exteriorized nerves , a type of highly evolved feelers or antennae that transmit vast amounts of important information to the brainstem , the limbic system , and the neocortex However , many people think hair is dead and does nothing for us as humans It is just an accessory I do not know who is right or who is wrong , but I am open to all possibilities Here is the man you need to hear it from This article was featured at Rense WakingTimes by C Young ShareTweetPin 1Share7K Shares
