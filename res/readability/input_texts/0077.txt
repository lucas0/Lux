(PP)- Friday a White House press release was inadvertently distributed early to news organizations announcing that President Barack Hussein Obama had signed an executive order giving himself a pay raise to $500,000 annually.

White House staff failed to squash the story as the press release was intended to be distributed late in the day on Friday, after the deadline when most news agencies are able to publish breaking news stories.

Critics of the President’s executive order say the move makes Obama seem “politically tone deaf” because he gave himself a raise at a time when the federal government is arbitrarily cutting services and benefits due to sequestration.

“What a Dick,” said a pizza delivery boy at The Palookaville Post’s news room.

Presidential pay raises are usually approved by Congress, the last increase being authorized by both Congress and Bill Clinton in 1999 and went into effect in 2001.

The Presidential pay raise also now includes a $50,000 annual expense account, a $100,000 nontaxable travel account and $19,000 for entertainment.

The Palookaville Post has learned that President Obama will be unavailable to comment on the executive order to increase his own pay, and that he will likely be putting a serious dent in his new expense account over the weekend.
