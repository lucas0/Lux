The founder of Facebook Mark Zuckerberg purchased an ultra-luxury yacht named “Ulysses” for $150 million in Monaco Yacht Show in September, which is normally listed at $195 million.

The yacht Ulysses has a private helicopter, a separate 24-meter tender boat, an extra 4x4 car and a motorcycle. Mark Zuckerberg, 10th reachest person in the world with an estimated wealth of $75 billion, saw 107-meter yacht Ulysses at the yacht show in Monaco and bought the yacht later on without making any advertisement by a secret. Zuckerberg made a huge discount on the price of the yacht just because the yacht is for sale more than a year. The estimated monthly cost of the yacht is $2 million.

Zuckerberg with his wife Priscilla Chan, who has been using the yacht Ulysses for the last five months, were seen in the Pacific lately.

Mark Zuckerberg purchased the yacht from Graeme Hart, a billionaire from New Zealand known for his strong passion for luxury yachts. Graeme Hart was born in 1955, worked as a bus driver and now has a fortune worth $8 billion. According to the Forbes 500 ranking, Hart, who owns the investment firm Rank Group, is the world’s 214th richest person.

The yacht Ulysses was built at the Kleven shipyard in Norway. The 107-meter Ulysses has a 24-meter tender vessel, a helicopter with its own hangar, ATVs and 4x4 vehicle. The ultra-luxury yacht can sail halfway around the world without refueling and is designed to endure the toughest weather conditions, including the arctic circles and the world’s hottest regions.

Ulysses can host up to 30 people in 15 private suits. The yacht has 43 crews and 20 rooms for crew members. It can reach a maximum speed of 15 knots.
