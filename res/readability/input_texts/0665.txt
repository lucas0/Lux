New York photographer Brian DeFrees recently set out on a roadtrip around the United States with the goal of creating a timelapse to chronicle his journey. He traveled 12,225 miles while capturing a photo every five seconds with his Canon 60D. Take a moment to watch this video, which will carry you across the United States and back in five minutes:

DeFrees mounted the camera just below the rear view mirror along with an intervalometer, which controlled the cameraâ€™s rate of picture taking. He captured 200,000 individual photographs and combined them into the previous video which has turned into a viral hit on YouTube.
