Woman Buried Alive, Funeral Goers Hear Screams From The Grave

Woman Buried Alive, Funeral Goers Hear Screams From The Grave – A 34 year old woman in now recovering from a most bizarre scene, one you only hear about in the movies.

A Chicago family was grieving the loss of their son, as they said their final goodbye’s at his funeral. Police say it was unlike anything they had ever seen before. Reports say that approximately 15 minutes after the body of the man was laid to rest, the family of the deceased began to hear screams.

“We decided to stay for a bit after the funeral, to let it all sink in. When all of a sudden we heard screams, but we could not figure out where they were coming from,” said one family member who wished to stay anonymous. “We realized it was coming from under the grave where we just laid my brother. We ran and got help.”

Police say when firefighters arrived, they received permission from the family to dig up the freshly dug grave. As they did, the screams became louder and louder.

When they reached the coffin, they pried it open, to find 34 year old Linda Lynch inside.

Police say it was a twisted plot. The coffin of the man, who was supposed to be buried, was wheeled to the back and his body was quickly removed after the service by the funeral director, Harold Lynch, at Thomas Hite Funeral Home, who had attempted to murder his 34 year old estranged wife.

Lynch had drugged his wife with arsenic and hid her in the funeral home, perfectly timing it with the scheduled burial. The young man who was scheduled to be buried was found wrapped in a blanket in the funeral home basement.
