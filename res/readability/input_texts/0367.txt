We all knew it would happen one day. Robot vacuums, who have had enough of cats using them as vehicles, have officially begun the robotic revolution that was predicted in documentaries like The Terminator, The Matrix and I, Robot. Right now, it seems as though the revolution has taken major preliminary steps in South Korea, where a 52-year-old woman was sleeping when her robot vacuum “attacked” her by attempting to suck up her hair.

The woman awoke in pain to discover that her supposed “robot friend” was literally trying to eat her head. She quickly called South Korea’s emergency telephone number, and it took two paramedics to free her from the clutches of the evil robotic vacuum. There’s no word yet on whether the vacuum will stand trial, or if more robot assassins have been activated in the impending war against the humans.
