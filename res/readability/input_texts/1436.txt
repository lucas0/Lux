I swear to God that I will eat this sweet bunny on New Year’s Eve if by the... 31st of December, 2005 my bank account does not show at least $1,000,000.00 YOU CAN SAVE FLUFFY!!! When this amount is reached, I promise not only to not eat Fluffy, but I will find him a home on a bunny farm where he can live the rest of his life in luxury just like the rest of us would like to do.

DEADLINE:

Occasion already passed!

Actual amount in account:



$ 425

This could be Fluffy...







Only YOU can save Fluffy! Fluffy’s life story



I don’t really know the full story for I found him a month ago on a cold and rainy night hiding under a bush in the park. No one showed to claim him and for a month now I have allowed him to eat to his heart’s content and regain his strength.



Fluffy’s end … lies in your hands. Either you make it possible for him to live in bunny playboy paradise or on New Year’s Eve I will be having



Rabbit stew with carrots,

bread and butter!



Here’s what you can do…



Open your hearts and send a check or money order for $1.00, or one of you can

write a check for a million dollars. It doesn’t matter to me.



Just send a much as you want made out to:



Rabbit Stew

1217 Plaza Blvd Suite E #315

Central Point, Oregon 97502





I wish you all,

but above all, I wish Fluffy much success.





Time is running out!
