Sugarhill Gang's Henry 'Big Bank Hank' Jackson has died at the age of 57, confirms David Mallie, who manages the group's two remaining living members.

Mallie said Jackson died from kidney complications due to cancer.

“[Wonder Mike and Master Gee] had been in contact with him in the past year," Mallie told FOX411. "They had some great times and created history.”

The former band members also expressed their condolences.

“Once I step out that door into the entertainment arena, we get crazy love everywhere we go,” Wonder Mike told FOX411 in 2013. “Like one of the Soul Train Awards years ago, Denzel Washington was in the audience, Danny Glover, Jay Z and Beyonce were doing the lyrics, and all of these people are saying the words right back to me.”
