Fighting Hunger in Uganda, One Vine At A Time

There's an ongoing food crisis in Uganda, thanks to widespread drought. One in three children is stunted due to undernourishment. It's heartbreaking. But with your help, we've provided 250 families with a special, nutrient-dense, healthy crop: the life-saving sweet potato. Sweet potatoes are rich in carbohydrates and vitamins A, C, and B12.

This unique, effective idea reduces suffering, maintains dignity, and helps families provide for themselves.
