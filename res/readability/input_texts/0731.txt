Finally, Pope Francis confirms what we've always known: All dogs go to heaven!

During his weekly address in St. Peter's Square, the Catholic leader tried to console a little boy who was heartbroken over the death of his beloved pup. According to multiple reports, Pope Francis told the boy, "One day, we will see our animals again the eternity of Christ. Paradise is open to all of God's creatures."

Of course, this viewpoint goes against the conservative Catholic ideology that because animals don't have souls (!), they can't go to heaven. Some theologians have cautioned, per the New York Times, that Pope Francis "had spoken casually, not made a doctrinal statement."
