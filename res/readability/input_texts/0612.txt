An open letter from Lego to parents about gender equality in 1974 is proving to be just as powerful for today's generation.

The egalitarian message was included in a select number of Lego doll house products sold 40 years ago.

It since been shared by thousands online after a picture was posted on Twitter.

The note, calling for parents to look past gender stereotypes, says: “The urge to create is equally strong in all children. Boys and girls.”

While many sceptics questioned the authenticity of the text, Lego confirmed it is indeed genuine.

“The text is from 1974 and was a part of a pamphlet showing a variety of Lego doll house products targeted girls aged 4 and up,” said Lego UK’s Emma Owen.

“It remains relevant to this day – our focus has always been, and remains to bring creative play experiences to all children in the world ... ultimately enabling children to build and create whatever they can imagine.”

A picture of the letter was first posted online by Reddit user fryd_ who found the pamphlet at his partner’s grandmother’s house.

"I had no idea this would blow up so much,” he explained.
