Antifa claims responsibility for Las Vegas attack 10/2/2017 0 Comments Well Melbourne Antifa has since taken this post down off Facebook, but the good thing is the photo is available. So basically what we have here is likely confirmation Antifa is behind the slaughter in Las Vegas where 50 are so far reported dead. With Nov 4th coming up in America that Antifa claims to take out the Trump administration, is Las Vegas today a dry run for Antifa...And did Antifa just become a bigger threat than ISIS? Antifa and Leftist will probably cry fake news over this, but it looks like Antifa has claimed responsibility...So now we have an official new form of terrorism that we can all simply call Alt-Left terrorism.

If this claim of responsibility by Antifa for the Vegas attack is legit...Then it's time for Trump to launch raids on Antifa across America. Remember also that Antifa's Las Vegas leader/ school teacher was arrested last week in Berkeley Yvette Falarca. America it's time to take serious attention to Antifa, because they may of just launched their first deadly attack on American soil. Stupid thing is Leftists are blaming Trump, his supporters, and guns for this Vegas attack, but why would Trump supporters ever use guns on a country concert? Like 12 0 Comments
