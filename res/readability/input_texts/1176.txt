Many in Iceland view Pence’s attempted trip to the island nation as a way to test the waters and see how serious the government is in keeping out religious fanatics. “The Americans just learned we mean business,” one anonymous Icelander stated. “Those people can’t even keep their own government running. What makes them think they can come over here and preach to us?”

Insiders report Vice President Pence never got off his plane. An irritated Pence vowed to drown the country in Chik-fil-A wrappers, American made cars that don’t work, and MAGA hats.

Icelanders aren’t taking the threats seriously. Most are waiting until 2020 and hoping the Democrats don’t mess things up again.
