Perth | A 600-pound woman has given birth to a 40-pound baby at Perth’s King Edward Memorial Hospital, a record-breaking weight that could possibly make the newborn the largest baby ever born, reports the Western Australian Herald this morning.

The baby of gigantic size surprised doctors and staff members who were not fully prepared for such an event but miraculously managed to give birth to the 40-pound (18 kilos) baby who remains in a healthy state, has confirmed a hospital spokesman.

The single mother who’s delivery necessitated a surgical incision in the mother’s abdomen and uterus was done to prevent any harm to the baby and mother’s health and was undergone without any complications.

The doctor who practiced the cesarean section first believed the woman to be pregnant with twins or even triplets.

“I have dealt with other women suffering from obesity before but this birth will stick with me until I die,” he told reporters with a large grin.

“I truly believed there was two or even three babies in there” he commented laughingly, “but no, it was just one big sturdy guy. He obviously has a career as a future rugby player” he added with humor.

The largest recorded baby in the world was previously thought to be a South African baby who is believed to have weighed 38 pounds (17.2 kilos) and was born in 1839.

The young boy of Zulu origin is reported to have grown to an impressive 7’6 feet or 2.28 meters high before he reached his 18th birthday.
