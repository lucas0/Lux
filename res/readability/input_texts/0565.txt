b'Her refusal to support a Medicare-for-all or single-payer health care system caused friction between her and her opponents  a former Detroit health director, Abdul El-Sayed, and a business mogul, Shri Thanedar  but Ms. Whitmer said she was proud to have the receipts from being on the front line as a progressive.\n\nIn recent days Ms. Whitmer had leaned in to her front-runner status, refusing to mention her primary opponents on the campaign trail and admonishing campaign crowds to not take anything for granted. She travels the state in a large bus marked with her trademark campaign slogan: Fix The Damn Roads.\n\nShe also claims her message is resonating with female voters in the state. Gender is a huge strength in this environment right now, Ms. Whitmer said in an interview this week. Women are turning out in droves. I find Republican women coming up to me saying they dont like whats happening in the White House and saying they dont particularly like their options.\n\nMr. El-Sayed, in particular, was touted by some as a insurgent progressive in the mold of Alexandria Ocasio-Cortez, the Bronx-born activist who shockingly defeated a leading Democrat, Joseph Crowley, in a New York City House primary in June. Following her victory, Ms. Ocasio-Cortez came to Michigan to campaign with Mr. El-Sayed, as did Senator Bernie Sanders, who held a rally with him on Sunday.\n\nOn the Republican side, the results again reinforced how Mr. Trump has refashioned the party in his own image while playing an influential role in many primary races. Both Mr. Schuette in the governors race and Mr. James in the Senate primary were backed by the president.'
