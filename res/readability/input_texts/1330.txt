Carrie Fisher has revealed she had an affair with Harrison Ford on the set of the original Star Wars in 1976.

Both Fisher and Ford recently reprised their iconic roles for Star Wars: The Force Awakens.

In her new memoir, The Princess Diarist, Fisher writes that she began an affair at the age of 19 with the then-33-year-old Ford after a birthday party for Star Wars creator George Lucas, and their fling continued for three months during filming, reports Entertainment Tonight.

"It was so intense," Fisher told People magazine. "It was Han and Leia during the week, and Carrie and Harrison during the weekend. I was so inexperienced, but I trusted something about him. He was kind."

After spending their first night together, "Fisher was wracked with self-doubt", says the magazine.

"I looked over at Harrison. A hero's face - a few strands of hair fell over his noble, slightly furrowed brow," she writes. "How could you ask such a shining specimen of a man to be satisfied with the likes of me?"

But the actress has appeared to go back on some aspects of the affair in a series of tweets in which she describes the excerpts as "out of context".

Ford has declined to comment on the story but received a draft copy of The Princess Diarist to look over before publication, says Sky News.

At the time, the Indiana Jones star was married to his first wife, Mary Marquardt, and the couple had two children. Ford and Marquardt filed for divorce in 1979.
