“Cutters disguised as name cards used to slash and rob car owners”

We note that a text message has been circulating alleging that several cases of slashing and robbery targeted at car drivers had occurred. Police have checked and confirmed that no reports have been lodged on such incident.

While it is understandable to warn friends and loved ones from becoming a victim of crime, the public is advised to first check on the truth of the information before sharing it. We would like to advise the public against spreading unsubstantiated information which may generate unnecessary public alarm, causing fear and panic in the community.

If anyone has information relating to any crime committed, please lodge a police report so that police can look into the matter.
