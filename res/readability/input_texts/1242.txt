b'The announcement by Mayor Bill de Blasio on Wednesday seemed to signal a new crackdown in the citys efforts to curb the spread of the coronavirus: Traveler registration checkpoints would be set up at bridges and tunnels, conjuring images of police officers stopping cars and detaining people from out of state.\n\nThe reality may be a lot less stark  and a lot more confusing.\n\nThe authorities will not be stopping every car. They will likely not be at every crossing on any given day. The Police Department wont even be involved.\n\nInstead of working to enforce the states mandatory quarantine for people coming from states with climbing coronavirus cases, the checkpoints, run by the citys sheriffs office, will focus on informing travelers about the rules.\n\nEven so, Mayor de Blasio presented the program as a crucial step in fending off the resurgence of the virus in the city, which was once the center of the pandemic but has maintained a low rate of infection in recent weeks.'
