An official of the Central Public Works Department (CPWD), who has been on furlough for the past 25 years, has been dismissed from service. On Thursday, Urban Development Minister M. Venkaiah Naidu issued orders to dismiss A.K. Verma for unauthorised absence from duty.

Mr. Verma, who joined the CPWD as an assistant executive engineer in 1980, went on leave in December 1990 and did not report to work thereafter. According to the Ministry, he continued extending his leave and defied directions to report to work.

An inquiry was instituted against him in September 1992 for major penalty for wilful absence from duty. “Owing to non-cooperation of Mr. Verma with the inquiry and for other reasons, it got delayed and a fresh charge sheet was issued in 2005,” the Ministry said.
