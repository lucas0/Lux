b'As the district attorney in Hennepin County, which encompasses Minneapolis, Ms. Klobuchar developed a tough-on-crime reputation 20 years ago that is a difficult fit with modern Democratic Party politics. Though she has rebutted criticism that she failed to prosecute police misconduct, her record was scrutinized during the presidential campaign and would quite likely have become a major headache for Mr. Bidens campaign had he selected her as the running mate.\n\nOne person she spoke with on Monday said Ms. Klobuchar relayed then that she understood she would not be selected, and said she cited the scrutiny of her record as prosecutor. A Klobuchar spokeswoman disputed the recollection of the call.\n\nMs. Klobuchars declaration that Mr. Biden should choose a woman of color created something of an awkward political dynamic for Senator Elizabeth Warren of Massachusetts, another former presidential rival who is being considered by Mr. Biden as a possible running mate. Ms. Warren is the most prominent and formidable white candidate in the running, and she is far along in the vetting process.\n\nOther white candidates under consideration include Senator Tammy Baldwin of Wisconsin, Gov. Gretchen Whitmer of Michigan and Gov. Gina Raimondo of Rhode Island.\n\nAsked by the MSNBC host Lawrence ODonnell if her past record as a prosecutor would have made it difficult for her to function as Mr. Bidens running mate, Ms. Klobuchar said it was not a factor in her decision.'
