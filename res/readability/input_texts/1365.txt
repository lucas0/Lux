"This was a matter of detaining people who were suspect and then hours later with additional follow-up and additional record checks and interviews, they confirmed back down to the field level that they were ISIS operatives."Hunter, a California Republican, had claimed that "at least 10" Islamic State fighters were captured trying to cross the Mexico border into Texas, but the Department of Homeland security has called his statements "categorically false."Hunter said on Fox News that he learned the information from the Border Patrol, saying "they aren't flying B1 bombers bombing American cities, but they are going to be bombing American cities coming across from Mexico."Farrell told Steve Malzberg that Mexico is a known haven for terror groups."There's an ISIS operational element in Juarez. I know that there are frantic efforts to identify exactly where they were and what they were doing," he said."Mexican Marines were literally kicking down doors, trying to find people, but no one should be surprised by this."There's a Hezbollah operation in Juarez that's a counterfeiting operation. It covers a taxi operation as the front end in order to move people, money and counterfeits dollars around."
