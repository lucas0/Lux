b'The coronavirus pandemic has killed so many Americans that the patterns of death in nearly every state look aberrant when compared to recent history. A New York Times analysis of estimates from the Centers for Disease Control and Prevention shows just how many lives are being lost in the pandemic, as some people die from the virus itself and others from the upheaval it has brought.\n\nU.S. Deaths Above or Below Normal Note: The chart shows the difference between measured deaths and expected deaths each week. Deaths above the expected number are considered to be excess deaths.\n\nNationwide, 211,500 more people have died than usual from March 15 to Aug. 1, according to C.D.C. estimates, which adjust current death records to account for typical reporting lags. That number is 56,000 higher than the official count of coronavirus deaths for that period. Higher-than-normal death rates are now widespread across the country; only Alaska, Hawaii and West Virginia show numbers that look similar to recent years.\n\nOur analysis examines deaths from all causes  not just confirmed cases of coronavirus  beginning in mid-March when the virus took hold. That allows comparisons that dont depend on the availability of coronavirus tests in a given place or on the accuracy of cause-of-death reporting. What it shows is that some places have seen staggering death tolls, while a few states have experienced fewer deaths, but enough to clearly differentiate this year from a typical one.\n\nNew York City, an early epicenter of the U.S. outbreak, has so far experienced the most extreme increase in deaths, which surged to seven times the usual number during the peak of its coronavirus outbreak. But as the pandemic has spread across the country, New York is not the only place where the death counts are far above normal levels.\n\nOver time, the number of states with deaths at least 10 percent above normal levels has grown, and includes states in not just the Northeast, but also the South, West and Midwest.\n\nWhere deaths are far above normal\n\nDeaths above or below normal, by location Deaths in these places are at least 10 percent higher than the normal level.\n\nCounting deaths takes time and many states are weeks or months behind in reporting. These estimates from the C.D.C. are adjusted based on how mortality data has lagged in previous years. Even with this adjustment, its possible they could be an underestimate of the complete death toll if increased mortality is causing states to lag more than they have in the past or if states have changed their reporting systems. Pennsylvanias death counts, for example, have lagged behind the states usual rate of reporting all year, according to the C.D.C.\n\nBut comparing recent totals of deaths from all causes can provide a more complete picture of the pandemics impact than tracking only deaths of people with confirmed diagnoses. Epidemiologists refer to fatalities in the gap between the observed and normal numbers of deaths as excess deaths.\n\nThrough Aug. 1, estimated excess deaths were about 37 percent higher than the official coronavirus fatality count. If this pattern holds, it would put the current death toll at more than 225,000 people.\n\nMany epidemiologists believe measuring excess deaths is the best way to assess the impact of the virus in real time. It shows how the virus is altering normal patterns of mortality. The high numbers from the coronavirus pandemic period undermine arguments that the virus is merely killing vulnerable people who would have died anyway.\n\nOur charts show weekly deaths above or below normal. They include weeks in which the C.D.C. estimates the data to be at least 90 percent complete or estimated deaths are above expected death numbers. Because states vary somewhat in their speed in reporting deaths to the federal government, these state charts show death trends for slightly different time periods.\n\nRecent totals were compared with a simple model of expected deaths based on the number of deaths in the past three years, adjusted to account for trends over time, like population changes.\n\nPublic health researchers use such methods to measure the impact of catastrophic events when official measures of mortality are flawed.\n\nMeasuring excess deaths does not tell us precisely how each person died. It is likely that most of the excess deaths in this period are because of the coronavirus itself, given the dangerousness of the virus and the well-documented problems with testing. But it is also possible that deaths from other causes have risen too, as hospitals in some hot spots have become overwhelmed and people have been scared to seek care for ailments that are typically survivable. Some causes of death may be declining, as people stay inside more, drive less and limit their contact with others.\n\nEven in a normal year, it takes up to eight weeks for full death counts to be reported by the C.D.C. But this is not a normal year, and it is possible that because of the unusual number of recent deaths and the stresses they are placing on medical examiners and public health officials, the totals will take even longer than usual to become complete. We will keep updating the numbers regularly as new data becomes available.\n\nWhere deaths are somewhat above normal\n\nIn another group of states, the increases in deaths were more modest but still higher than normal.\n\nDeaths above or below normal, by location Deaths in these places are elevated, but less than 10 percent above the normal level.\n\nWhere deaths look normal, in the data\n\nreported so far\n\nThere are only four states that appear to have been largely spared from an unusual number of deaths during this period and show death numbers that look similar to those in a normal year. Two of those states  Alaska and Hawaii  are outside the contiguous U.S.\n\nDeaths above or below normal, by location These places have few excess deaths.\n\nHow excess deaths compare with the official coronavirus counts\n\nIn many states with excess deaths, the total number of them exceeded the official number of measured Covid-19 deaths. Given the ongoing limitations on coronavirus testing in the United States, these gaps are not a big surprise. Similar gaps have been found in other countries with high numbers of Covid-19 deaths.\n\nArea PCT. above normal Excess deaths Reported Covid-19 deaths Gap United States United States\n\nMarch 15 - Aug. 1 +20% 211,500 154,858 56,700 New York City N.Y.C.\n\nMarch 15 - Aug. 1 +136% 27,100 23,006 4,100 New Jersey N.J.\n\nMarch 15 - Aug. 1 +66% 18,100 15,828 2,300 Texas Tex.\n\nMarch 15 - Aug. 1 +20% 15,700 7,477 8,200 California Calif.\n\nMarch 15 - Aug. 1 +14% 14,400 9,360 5,100 New York (excluding N.Y.C.)
