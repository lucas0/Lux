b'But some scientists and financial analysts question the viability of Inovios technology. While there are some early signs of promise with the companys vaccine, Inovio has only released bare-bones data from the first phase of clinical trials. It is locked in a legal battle with a key manufacturing partner that claims Inovio stole its technology.\n\nShareholders have sued Inovio, claiming it has exaggerated its progress on a coronavirus vaccine to inflate its stock price. Adding to the challenges, Inovios potential vaccine will have to be administered by a gadget  it resembles an electric nose-hair trimmer and is called the Cellectra  that would direct genetic material into millions of patients.\n\nAnd while the company has said that it is part of Operation Warp Speed  the flagship federal effort to quickly produce treatments and vaccines for the coronavirus  Inovio is not on the list of companies selected to receive financial support to mass-produce vaccines.\n\nThe absence of that funding, coupled with their ongoing litigation, coupled with the need to scale a device, coupled with the absence of complete Phase 1 data, makes people skeptical, said Stephen Willey, an analyst at Stifel, an investment firm.\n\nAs it tries to defuse the coronavirus crisis, the Trump administration is wagering, in part, on companies  like Moderna and Novavax  with spotty track records and penchants for self-promotion. In June, Inovio received $71 million from the Department of Defense to manufacture its battery-operated Cellectras.'
