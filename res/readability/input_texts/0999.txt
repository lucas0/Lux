Offers have been pouring in to re-home a dog found abandoned at a train station along with a suitcase filled with his belongings.

Kai’s heart-breaking story received media attention around the world after he was discovered tied to a railing outside Ayr station in Scotland.

The Scottish SPCA has received hundreds of messages online after Wimbledon champion Andy Murray and Trainspotting author Irvine Welsh tweeted about Kai.

A spokeswoman for the charity said it has received dozens of calls from members of the public offering Kai a new home.

“The phone’s been ringing off the hook all day. We’ve had over 100 offers to take him on. It’s really unusual to get that sort of interest,” the SSPCA said.

It seems a despicable act to leave a dog at a station like that, but remember that many folks are so sad, depressed and desperate right now. — Irvine Welsh (@IrvineWelsh) January 6, 2015

@ScottishSPCA is Kai still available for adoption? located in Canada but love the breed and will pay any necessary costs to have him come. — brenda chan (@_bchan_) January 7, 2015

“Normally, when we get an abandonment, it’s usually a staffie and we don’t tend to get many offers to re-home them, but when it’s an unusual breed or a particularly cute one, then we get a lot of interest.

“I’m sure Kai’s story has tugged at a lot of heartstrings.”

The Scottish SPCA has asked for anyone with any information about the ‘cruel incident’ to contact them.

Abandoning an animal is an offence under the Animal Health and Welfare (Scotland) Act 2006.
