b'NASHVILLE  It had been on the calendar for months, the annual leadership conference of the Alpha Kappa Alpha sorority. But the talk at the gathering of 8,000 women last weekend was about far more than the usual chapter building, catching up and breaking out outfits in the organizations signature pink and green: Kamala Harris, who joined the sorority as a college student, had just resurrected the ghost of segregation and busing against former Vice President Joseph R. Biden Jr. in a Democratic presidential debate.\n\nThe moment brought a sense of pride and some apprehension about what Ms. Harriss campaign would hold.\n\nYounger members said Ms. Harris represented a hope for the future. She just reminds me to be fearless in the pursuit of my goals, said Shannon Burge, 31, a Denver sales manager.\n\nOlder members said Ms. Harriss challenge to Mr. Biden last week  over his opposition to busing during the 1970s  was evidence that years of sacrifice had not been in vain. I went to segregated schools. I experienced integration. It wasnt easy, said Miriam Joyner-Smith, 59, who works in the insurance industry in Tampa. Were just excited and proud because she represents us well.'
