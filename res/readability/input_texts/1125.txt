b'WASHINGTON  The departure of Scott Pruitt, the scandal-plagued former head of the Environmental Protection Agency, means that the agency will be led in the coming months by Mr. Pruitts deputy, Andrew Wheeler, a former coal lobbyist who shares Mr. Pruitts zeal to undo environmental regulations.\n\n\n\nBut unlike Mr. Pruitt  who had come to Washington as an outsider and aspiring politician, only to get caught up in a swirl of controversy over his costly first-class travel and security spending  Mr. Wheeler is viewed as a consummate Washington insider who avoids the limelight and has spent years effectively navigating the rules.\n\nFor that reason, Mr. Wheelers friends and critics alike say, he could ultimately prove to be more adept than his controversial former boss in the job.\n\nMany worry Wheeler will be more effective at implementing Trumps anti-environmental agenda than Pruitt was, said Paul Bledsoe, a former Clinton White House climate adviser, in the wake of the departure.'
