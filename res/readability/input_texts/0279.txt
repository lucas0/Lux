What did you do this weekend? Argentinian President Cristina Fernandez de Kirchner adopted a young boy as her godson so he wouldn't turn into a werewolf and eat babies. Yes, really! (Kind of.)

It's actually part of a long-standing tradition stemming from Argentinian folklore that says the seventh son in families with no girls are doomed to turn into "el lobison," a werewolf who feeds on unbaptized babies and whose bites could turn others into werewolves. Belief in the legend was once reportedly so widespread that families were abandoning their seventh sons, giving them up for adoption, or killing them.

A law was passed in the 1920s to counteract the effect (the law was expanded in 2009 to include girls and non-Catholic children), and now, every year, the president formally adopts a boy or girl as his or her godchild, awarding him or her a medal, "presidential protection," and a scholarship to study until the godchild turns 21.

This year, Fernandez de Kirchner formally adopted Yair Tawil, a member of a Chabad-Lubavitch family, according to the Jewish Telegraphic Agency. In 1993, Yair's parents reportedly wrote to the president asking for the honor and were denied, but this year, Yair wrote to Fernandez de Kirchner himself and got his wish, making him the first Jewish boy in Argentina to be officially adopted by the president.

Fernandez de Kirchner posted a photo of herself with Yair and his family lighting Hanukkah candles together (below) with a menorah, which Fernandez de Kirchner tweeted was a gift from Yair's family.
