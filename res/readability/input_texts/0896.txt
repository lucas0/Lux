Everybody, meet Bart the cat. Bart the cat, everybody. Bart’s owner, Tampa Bay resident Ellis Hutson, buried Bart back on January 15th after a neighbor found him dead in the road in a pool of his own blood after being hit by a car. Five days later, however, Bart turned up at a nearby store looking for food — although it’s unclear if he just wanted some Fancy Feast or HUMAN SOULS.

Fox 13 reports:

Bart is at the Human Society of Tampa Bay right now, and rescuers told FOX 13 that he has severe trauma to the head, a broken jaw, a dead eye, and other injuries. Right now, doctors are scheduling surgery to save its life. FOX 13 visited Bart on Monday. Rescuers say they believe he may have regained consciousness, dug himself out of the ground, and hid for a few days.

I don’t know about you guys, but personally I like my Florida stories when they aren’t literally the plot of a Stephen King novel. Bart is expected to make a full recovery, but as if you needed more reason to stay away from Florida, there is now a zombie cat on the loose. What you choose to do with that information is entirely up to you.
