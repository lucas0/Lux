The MacBook Air has always won high acclaim for its beautiful design but apparently the company is giving it a major overhaul for its 2015 edition. 9to5Mac’s Mark Gurman has another big Apple-related scoop and this time he’s detailing what he calls a “radical” design of Apple’s iconic ultra-thin laptop.

According to Gurman, the 2015 MacBook Air will have a 12-inch display and will eliminate a lot of the design features we’ve grown used to seeing from MacBooks in the past. In particular, Gurman writes that the new MacBook “jettisons standards such as full-sized USB ports, MagSafe connectors, and SD card slots in favor of a markedly thinner and lighter body with a higher-resolution display.”

So how light and thin are we talking about? Gurman’s source say the 12-inch laptop will be “approximately a quarter-of-an-inch narrower than the 11-inch version, yet it is also a quarter-of-an-inch taller in order to accommodate the slightly larger display.”

Even better, Gurman’s sources have provided such detailed descriptions of the new MacBook Air that artists were able to create beautiful renders of the devices, one of which we’ve posted below.

As you can see in the render above, Apple has eliminated a lot of extra space on the side of the device, as its keyboard nearly extends to the edge of the computer’s aluminum frame.
