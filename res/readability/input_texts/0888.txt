A statement from the SPCA said: "Regardless of the act Kai was left with his belongings, this was a cruel incident and we are keen to identify the person responsible."

The suitcase held a number of the dog's belongings, including a pillow, toy, food bowl and food.

Inspector Stewart Taylor said: "The dog is microchipped and we were able to find out his name is Kai.

"We contacted the owner registered to the microchip, who stated they had sold Kai on Gumtree in 2013. Unfortunately they could not tell us the address of the person who bought him."

Abandoning an animal is an offence under the Animal Health and Welfare (Scotland) Act 2006 and anyone found guilty of doing so can expect to be banned from keeping animals for a fixed period or life.

Inspector Taylor added: "This case highlights the potential consequences of selling an animal online as it often leads to the impulse buying of pets that people know very little about."
