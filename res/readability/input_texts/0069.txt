b'In the governors race and 17 House races in Texas, no candidate received 50 percent of the vote in the primaries in March, prompting a runoff.\n\nRead more\n\nAt the top of the ballot, Lupe Valdez, a former Dallas County sheriff, defeated Andrew White, a businessman and son of former Gov. Mark White, in the Democratic primary to challenge Gov. Greg Abbott in November. While Ms. Valdez appeals more to liberal voters, Mr. White relentlessly cast himself as better equipped to take on Mr. Abbott.\n\nThen there are the House races. On the Democratic side, contests to watch include the Seventh and 23rd Districts; on the Republican side, the Eighth and 21st Districts.\n\nThe Seventh and 23rd Districts are home to incumbent Republicans who could be vulnerable in November. In the Seventh District, the race turned vicious when the Democratic Congressional Campaign Committee released a 2014 article in which one of the contenders, Laura Moser, wrote that she would rather have my teeth pulled out without anesthesia than move to Paris, Tex. It was a clear attempt to knock out a candidate who the committee felt would jeopardize Democrats chances, but the interference may actually have lifted Ms. Moser. And in the 23rd District, Gina Ortiz Jones, a former Air Force intelligence officer, is up against Rick Trevio, a Bernie Sanders-style Democrat running to Ms. Joness left.\n\nThe 21st District, which includes part of Austin and a large area north of San Antonio, drew 18 Republican candidates, now winnowed down to Matt McCall, a businessman, and Chip Roy, a former Ted Cruz staffer. And the Eighth District is a tight battle between Cody Harris, a moderate Republican, and Thomas McNutt, a right-wing Republican.'
