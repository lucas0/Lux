Located on State Rt. 5, 14501 John Tyler Highway, Charles City, VA. 30 minutes from Williamsburg and 45 minutes from Richmond. 804-829-5377. 3 miles west of the courthouse in Charles City County - Tyler Country. John Tyler was the first vice president to ascend to the presidency upon the death of 9th President, William Henry Harrison. The plantation, first recorded in a 1616 land grant, was originally known as Smith's Hundred. The house, circa 1720, is a classic example of Virginia Tidewater design: big house, little house, colonnade, and kitchen. It had several owners before Tyler purchased the home and its surrounding 1,600 acres in 1842. He bought the plantation from his cousin, Collier Minge, while he was still in the White House and renamed the plantation "Sherwood Forest" referring to his reputation as a political outlaw. The Tyler family still maintain the plantation today through the Sherwood Forest Plantation Foundation. Their children and grandchildren frequently are seen at the Plantation. Sherwood Forest Plantation remains the longest frame house in America -- expanded to its present length of over 300 feet in 1845 when Tyler added a 68-foot ballroom catering to the popular dance of his time, the Virginia Reel. The grounds are 25 acres of terraced gardens and lawn based on the landscape designs of Andrew Jackson Downing of New York and include original outbuildings or dependencies. It is considered one of the most complete plantation yards left in America, dating from c. 1680. Please enjoy your visit to our WWW site.
