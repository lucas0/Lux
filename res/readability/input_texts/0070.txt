On Tuesday, police in Saint Clairsville, Ohio announced some troubling news to the small town: a dead body had washed ashore on the Ohio River. Authorities told residents not to worry, that the body had probably drifted there from somewhere hundreds of miles away based on the amount of damage — and they were right.

An investigation concluded on Saturday that the corpse was, beyond a shadow of a doubt, the inhumed remains of Jaeger Holpern, aide to Hillary Clinton for more than a decade — including in the 2012 and 2016 elections. He also worked as a bodyguard for Chelsea Clinton from 2017-November 2018.

Holpern recently provided evidence to Judicial Watch regarding the Clinton email scandal, according to a press release from the transparency organization.

The Belmont County coroner concluded that Holpern had been “subjected to prolonged burning across his forearms” — a common torture tactic — and that “he ultimately was killed by a bullet fired at close range into the back of his cranium.”

Investigators think that Holpern was thrown into the Wabash River in Illinois, which empties into the Ohio River near Saint Clairsville. The body was found by a 12-year-old girl and her friends, who admit that they were going down by the river to smoke pot.

“The body seemed more important than concealing what we were doing,” one of the girls told the local newspaper. “It was the saddest and most horrifying thing I have ever seen in my life.”

As of yet it is unclear who murdered Holpern, but the timing suggests that it was someone connected to Hillary Clinton

“An investigation is still ongoing, but resources are strained at the moment,” an FBI spokeswoman told local TV news station WTFR. The spokeswoman noted that “some agents are being pulled off of the Mueller probe to investigate this incident.”

Yet another body is added to Clinton’s pile . How many skeletons will we ultimately find in her closet?
