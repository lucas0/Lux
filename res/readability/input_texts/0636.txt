b'Georgias voters had low expectations, and Tuesdays primary did not meet them. In many parts of greater Atlanta, voters brought their own lawn chairs to the polls, expecting long lines and not wanting to stand in the heat.\n\nFulton County pushed its poll closing time from 7 p.m. to 9 p.m., but some voters in Union City, a suburb south of Atlanta that is 88 percent black, waited in line until 12:37 a.m. to vote.\n\nAs a black person I was actually sad. I was thinking to myself, How long do we have to be going through this? said LaTosha Brown, a co-founder of Black Voters Matter, who documented the Union City voting line on Twitter. This is supposed to be a new system but we continue to see old problems.\n\nMuch of the trouble that plunged Georgias voting system into chaos Tuesday was specific to the state, stemming from the rollout of new voting machines and an electronic voter check-in system, which some elections experts had been sounding alarm bells about for months.\n\nPoll workers proved to be tragically unfamiliar with the system. And a number of the most seasoned poll workers in the Atlanta area, many of whom are older, chose to sit the election out to avoid exposure to the coronavirus.\n\nAt the same time, the state had encouraged more voters to avoid in-person voting altogether and vote using absentee ballots. With Covid-19 concerns in mind, elections officials sent an absentee ballot application to every eligible voter in the state in active status  meaning they had voted in the past several years.\n\nBut a number of voters who filled out those applications never received a ballot. Some of them spoke Tuesday night at a Zoom meeting of the Fulton County Board of Registration and Elections, saying that they ended up having to vote in person after their ballots didnt show up.'
