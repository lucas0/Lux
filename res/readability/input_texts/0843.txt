Now that's a special delivery!

A group of real estate agents meeting in Ann Arbor surprised a man by giving him a $2,084 tip for delivering one pizza on Thursday.

The man, identified only as Rob, was stunned and said on video, "All I did was deliver pizza."

Agents from Keller Williams Realty all pitched in while attending the company's regional conference. Stacey McVey said they wanted to show their appreciation to someone from the service industry.

Besides cash, the man received a Visa gift card, lottery tickets and letters of encouragement.

Brian LeFevre, delivery manager at Pizza House in Ann Arbor, says the lucky delivery man was "ecstatic." He says "that's a pretty good day's work" for just one pizza.
