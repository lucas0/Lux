A TEXAN plumber is getting death threats after his old truck — still bearing his name — was tweeted on the front line by Islamic jihadists in Syria.

Mark Oberholtzer’s former Ford F-250 pick-up truck, complete with anti-aircraft gun, was used in a propaganda stunt by Supporters of the Religion Front (Jabhat Ansar al-Deen) in the Syrian civil war.

Subsequently his company Mark-1 Plumbing — the name emblazoned on the pick-up truck in Syria — has been bombarded with hate calls at the office in Texas City, Texas.

“A few of the people are really ugly,” he told Galveston Daily News.

“People think you are aiding and abetting terrorists.

“We have a secretary here, she’s scared to death. We all have families. We don’t want no problems.

“I just want it to go away, to tell you the truth,” he said.

Oberholtzer has run the company for 32 years and said he took the truck to an AutoNation dealership three years ago. He believed that the company would remove the decal off the vehicle before sale.

“They were supposed to have done it and it looks like they didn’t do it,” Oberholtzer told Galveston Daily News. “How it ended up in Syria, I’ll never know.”

Oberholtzer told CBS News that he had hired a lawyer to make Twitter remove the posting.

A spokesman for AutoNation told KHOU 11 News that the truck went to auction. It has probably had different owners since the auction before ending up in the hands of Islamic terrorists.

Jabhat Ansar al-Din wants to impose the rule of Shari’ah but has maintained it is independent of ISIS/al-Qaeda.
