The mysophobic mystery-man first attacked a woman after she sneezed in Carlisle town centre on Monday.

The not-so-happy slapper allegedly struck again on Tuesday, this time launching an unprovoked attack on a frail 82-year-old woman who also had a bout of the sniffles.

Cumbrian Police believe the man to be in his mid-to-late 50s and are urging anyone with information about either of the two attacks to come forward.

Sgt Gill Cherry said: "We are treating these two reported incidents as linked , and are appealing to the local community to help trace the man responsible.

"It is very unusual behaviour , and will have left his victims feeling confused and upset."

A shocked trainee shop assistant Gemma Prosser, 19, said: "We heard as it happened in the town centre and at first we just thought it was a bit weird.

"When you think about it, it is really awful because anyone can sneeze at any time and it's not your fault."

Cumbria Police are still trying to trace the first female victim.
