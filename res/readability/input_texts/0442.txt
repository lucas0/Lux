A 19-YEAR-OLD woman woke up in the middle of brain surgery and was lucid enough to ask doctors how the surgery was going.

Iga Jasica, of Poland, was having a cancerous growth removed from her brain at the Central Clinical Hospital in the city of Katowice when, mid-surgery, the anaesthetic wore off, mirror.co.uk reported.

Jasica, whose brain was exposed at the time she awoke, asked the docs how the surgery was going — then started chatting about cats.

“Despite coming round, she didn’t feel anything and was never in danger,” neurosurgeon Professor Dawid Larysz said.

It’s possible the surgery may have triggered something that woke her up, experts said — but doctors are also looking into whether the anaesthesia was administered correctly.

Jasica later said: “I can’t remember much, but the doctor said he talked to me about cats, which I love. I missed Christmas because of this operation, but it is the best present I could have had as I am now feeling great.”
