b'Joseph R. Biden Jr. has sought to distance himself from two segregationist senators whose names he invoked on Tuesday as he recalled a time of civility in the Senate.\n\nInstead, Mr. Biden, the former vice president , emphasized his relationship with a prominent liberal, Senator Edward M. Kennedy of Massachusetts, and highlighted his disagreement with the segregationist senators, James O. Eastland of Mississippi and Herman E. Talmadge of Georgia.\n\nHes the guy who got me on the Judiciary Committee, Mr. Biden said of Mr. Kennedy at a Maryland fund-raiser on Wednesday. And we had to put up with the likes of, like , Jim Eastland and Hermy Talmadge and all those segregationists and all of that. And the fact of the matter is that we were able to do it because we were able to win  we were able to beat them on everything they stood for.\n\nWe in fact detested what they stood for in terms of segregation and all the rest, Mr. Biden continued. And because of Teddy letting me become chairman of the Judiciary Committee in 1982, when he moved on to take on Health and Human Services, we were able to do so much. We restored the Voting Rights Act. We did it, and over time we extended it by 25 years, not just five years.'
