b'New York is moving from caboose to locomotive, said Blair Horner, the executive director of the New York Public Interest Research Group, adding, New York has been in the obstacle-creating business, as opposed to the obstacle-smashing business when it comes to voting.\n\nThe bills, which will be introduced as a package, would place New York in the same rank as other liberal bulwarks like California and Washington, at a time when Democrats are seeking to enhance voter involvement.\n\nGov. Andrew M. Cuomo has expressed support for such measures in the past, most recently last month, when he vowed to make an election overhaul a priority in the first 100 days of the new year. A spokesman for Mr. Cuomo said the administration is hopeful that the voting package is the start of a range of reforms lawmakers pass this session.\n\nWe look forward to working with them to go further and enact public campaign financing, make Election Day a state holiday and ban corporate contributions once and for all, the spokesman, Rich Azzopardi, said.\n\nMr. Cuomo has also favored a bill that would close the so-called L.L.C. loophole, which allows corporate interests to funnel almost unlimited amounts of money into campaigns through various anonymous limited liability companies. The loophole has been a bte noire of good government groups for years, but has been utilized by various powerful politicians in the state, including Mr. Cuomo, who has been one of its biggest beneficiaries.\n\nThe Democrat-dominated Assembly has voted to close the loophole for years, but the measure went nowhere in the Republican-led Senate.\n\nOn Monday, however, the new Democratic leadership in the Capitol intends to pass identical bills to cap contributions from L.L.C.s at $5,000, bringing them in line with limits on donations from corporations.'
