At 42-40 last season, the Chicago Bulls finished the NBA season at the 9th spot in the East and didn’t make the playoffs. It snapped the Bulls’ seventh straight playoff appearance. And because of that, the Bulls made a drastic change on their roster.

They let go of Derrick Rose and Pau Gasol. Rose signed with the New York Knicks while Pau Gasol moved to San Antonio Spurs.

Jimmy Butler is slowly getting used to being the leader for the Bulls. In 16 games with the Chicago Bulls, he is averaging a career-best 25.8 points on 49% shooting from the field and 88.7% from the free-throw line. He is also recording 6.6 rebounds (also a career-best), 4.1 assists and 1.6 steals.

But as good as the Bulls were with this 3 great players, the latest NBA trade rumors suggest that adding another superstar will make the Bulls a powerhouse in the East.

According to FADEAWAY WORLD, if Anthony Davis would team up with these three players in Chicago, fans might see the Bulls in the NBA Finals in 2-3 years. And in exchange, the Bulls can send Nikola Mirotic, Rondo, Denzel Valentine and a first round draft pick as further dicussed by FADEAWAY WORLD.
