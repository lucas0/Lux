b'State Highlights\n\nNo longer will New England have a Republican in the House of Representatives.\n\nChristopher Shays of Connecticut, the lone conservative in a region long dyed blue, suffered a startling defeat to a Democratic businessman from Greenwich, Jim Himes.\n\nMr. Shays, who nearly lost his seat in 2006, was seeking an 11th term in the Fourth District. His defeat came in part because of a poor performance in cities like Bridgeport and Stamford.\n\nDuring the campaign, Mr. Shays drew criticism from constituents for his backing both versions of the financial bailout bill. His support for the war in Iraq, as well as a perceived connection between his economic views and those of President Bush, stirred unease among voters.\n\nDemocrats fought vigorously to unseat Mr. Shays, 63, but Republicans had hoped his years of service and his reputation as a fiscal conservative and social progressive would be enough to bring him another victory.\n\nMr. Himes, 42, a former investment banker for Goldman Sachs, will now represent the southwestern Connecticut district, one of the wealthiest in the nation.\n\nThe states Democratic incumbents in the House  John B. Larson, Joe Courtney, Rosa DeLauro and Christopher S. Murphy  all won easy re-elections.\n\nConnecticut voters also approved a measure to allow 17-year-olds to vote in primaries as long as they turn 18 in time for the general election. JAVIER C.
