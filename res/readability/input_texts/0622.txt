A prominent Saudi Arabian cleric has reportedly issued a fatwa against building snowmen, arguing that the practice goes against Islamic teachings.

“It is not permitted to make a statue out of snow, even by way of play and fun,” declared Sheikh Mohammed Saleh al-Munajjid, Reuters reported.

Quoting from Muslim scholars, Sheikh Munajjid argued that to build a snowman was to create an image of man, an action considered sinful under the kingdom’s strict interpretation of Sunni Islam, Reuters reported.

“God has given people space to make whatever they want which does not have a soul, including trees, ships, fruits, buildings and so on,” he reportedly wrote in his ruling.

No date was set for the implementation of the fatwa and there was no government comment, The Telegraph reported. Anyone trained in Islamic law can issue a fatwa, or formal legal opinion, based on their knowledge of the law.
