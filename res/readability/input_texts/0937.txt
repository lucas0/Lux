b'Ms. Thomas, who lives with three rescue dogs and has five chickens, said she usually earned $5,000 to $6,000 a month and sometimes as much as $10,000. She was booked solid during the spring and had to turn some clients away, she said, but over three days last month, everyone canceled. She has no money coming in now.\n\nThis is the first time in 20 years Ive had to worry, she said. I was like, oh, my God, my whole worlds falling apart. The first week, I was a mess. I was so depressed, so sickened. But you cant worry about what you cant control. Im strong, and I always have been.\n\nNormally, most states offer roughly half of a workers previous wage for up to 26 weeks of unemployment, but the benefits can vary widely among states.\n\nAt the end of 2019, the average weekly benefit in Mississippi was $215, and just 9 percent of unemployed workers there were eligible to receive any payments, according to a Brookings Institution analysis. In Massachusetts, the average weekly benefit was $550, and 57 percent of jobless workers qualified.\n\nIn Florida and North Carolina, benefits last for only 12 weeks.\n\nUnder the new federal law, jobless workers will get an additional $600 each week through July. They will also be able to receive benefits for an additional 13 weeks.\n\nMany states have yet to send out the $600 supplement. New York started issuing the additional money this week. The Texas Workforce Commission is working to start the payments by Sunday, a spokesman said. Other states estimate longer delays.\n\nIn Utah, Ms. Thomas said she was not counting on receiving any jobless benefits, but plans to use the $1,200 stimulus check  when she receives it  to help cover some bills, including her business and health insurance.'
