b'Heres a look at how the rankings shifted in each quarter for the 10 candidates who raised the most money this summer. Circles are sized by the amounts raised from individual contributions. Notes: Candidates are ordered by their ranking in each quarter. Some candidates raised more money in the third quarter, but their rankings were lower. Former Vice President Joseph R. Biden Jr. entered the race after the first quarter. Gov. Jay Inslee of Washington was the 10th candidate in the first quarter, but he has since dropped out of the race.\n\nSenator Elizabeth Warren of Massachusetts saw her fund-raising increase once again, just as she has steadily climbed in the polls. Former Vice President Joseph R. Biden Jr. brought in less money. Senator Bernie Sanders of Vermont remains strong.\n\nThe fund-raising numbers filed with the Federal Election Commission on Tuesday revealed the shifting financial fortunes of Democratic presidential candidates.\n\nMr. Sanders and Ms. Warren  two candidates who have sworn off big-money fund-raisers  led the Democratic field in the last three months, raising just shy of $50 million in total, which is more than the bottom 13 candidates put together.\n\n[See who led the money race in the first and second quarter.]\n\nMr. Biden raised about $6 million less than what he collected in the second quarter, a decline of nearly 30 percent and another indicator that his widespread name recognition has not translated into a flood of contributions from online donors. He ended the quarter with just under $9 million in cash on hand, far less than that of Mr. Sanders, Ms. Warren and Mayor Pete Buttigieg of South Bend, Ind.\n\nMr. Sanders had his best quarter this year, reporting the biggest quarterly total in the 2020 Democratic race.\n\nMr. Sanderss haul for the quarter was the latest demonstration of the power of grass-roots donors. As we showed over the summer in our maps of Democratic donors, Mr. Sanders has amassed a huge network of individual donors around the country.\n\nAmount Raised From Individual Contributions (in millions) Note: Third-quarter numbers are from July 1 to Sept. 30. Cycle totals include all activity in the 2020 election cycle. Candidates who reported raising less than $100,000 are excluded.\n\nMr. Sanders, Ms. Warren and Mr. Buttigieg have far more cash in the bank than the rest of their rivals.\n\nMr. Biden ended September with a fraction of the cash that Mr. Sanders, Ms. Warren and Mr. Buttigieg each had on hand. For every dollar that Mr. Sanders had, Mr. Biden had about 27 cents. How much cash a campaign has makes a big difference in how it can hire staff and pay for advertising as the first nominating contests approach.\n\nCash on Hand (in millions) Note: Figures are as of Sept. 30.\n\nPresident Trump has more cash than the three best-funded Democrats combined.\n\nAs the Democratic candidates fight for their partys presidential nomination, Mr. Trump has been able to continue building a huge cash reserve to fund his re-election bid.\n\nCash on Hand for Trump and Top Three Democrats (in millions) Note: Figures are as of Sept. 30.\n\nMore than half of the candidates spent more money than they took in from donors.\n\nFor the Democrats struggling to raise money, keeping the lights on is a real concern. Ten candidates  including Mr. Biden  spent more money in the third quarter than they collected in donations, even though the Iowa caucuses are still months away. The group also included Senator Kamala Harris of California and former Representative Beto ORourke of Texas.\n\nThe billionaire Tom Steyer and former Representative John Delaney of Maryland are not included in the count because they are largely self-financing their campaigns.\n\nBurn Rate Note: The burn rate shown is a candidates spending in the third quarter relative to individual contributions he or she received. Contribution refunds are excluded from the spending figures. The burn rate is greater than 100 percent if a candidate spent more than he or she raised. Candidates who are largely self-funding their campaigns are excluded.\n\nMr. Steyer spent far more than any other candidate.\n\nMr. Steyer, a former hedge fund manager, reported spending more than twice as much as any other candidate, with a majority of his money going toward advertising.\n\nThe leading Democratic contenders have hired big staffs, opened dozens of campaign offices and poured money into Facebook advertising, but their spending in the quarter still paled in comparison to Mr. Steyers. He spent more on advertising alone than any of the other Democrats spent in total.\n\nAmount Spent (in millions) Note: Second-quarter numbers are from July 1 to Sept. 30. Totals include all activity in the 2020 election cycle. Mr. Steyer started spending money investigating the feasibility of a presidential run in 2018, and that spending was reported in the third quarter.\n\nHeres a full look at how the Democratic candidates compare.'
