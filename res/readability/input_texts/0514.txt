Addressing the Dell Issue. 2/26/02

This is the letter I posted in a few Firearms Forums and sent via e mail.

This is a true account of my dealings with Dell over the past few weeks.

I am writing this because I feel every Firearms owner should know

this story.

I placed an order for a Dell notebook computer on February 13 on line

with Dell. I was given a tentative delivery date of February 21st. I

was watching the order through the Dell on line tracking system; I

also opted for the automatic email notification of when the machine

was to be shipped. Well the 21st came and went, I am a Pistolsmith I

know things can happen. I made a phone call on the 25th, did a

voice mail message for my salesman to get back to me and I was

looking for the delivery date. The 25th came and went with no

callback. On the 26th I placed another call this time to cancel the

order. After a few hours I got a call back, with this amazing reason

for the delay. It seems someone in Dell had already canceled my

order, when I asked why I was told Dell was afraid I was going to

use the machine for illegal purposes. When I asked why someone

would think that I was told it was because of the name of my

business Weigand Combat Handguns Inc.. Because I am involved in

firearms I might be doing something illegal. Now keep in mind I was

never called or informed of this decision the order was just canceled.

Many of you know me personally and know I run my business about

as squeaky clean as possible. In addition being the President of the

American Pistolsmiths Guild I am under additional scrutiny as to how I

run my business, if I am not clean how can I be the President of an

organization that promotes just that! I was informed by a Dell

supervisor not long after all of this the reason I was refused was

because of their post September 11th policy of screening buyers.

I would like to respectfully ask the firearms community to do the

following. If you intended to buy a Dell and because of this letter you

do not, email Dell and let them know why. Feel free to distribute this

account to all you know in the Firearms community, I think they need

to know. I for one am sick and tired of people assuming just because

we are involved with firearms that we are doing something illegal. I

also do not believe Dell deserves our business if this is how they

intend to treat us.

God Bless

The above is the only letter I have written. I have written comments on email I have received (that number is now in the hundreds). I would like to add the following.

I have spoken to Dell today 2/26/02

They informed me that the reason my order was cancelled was due to the new post 9/11 screening policy. The word

"Combat" in my company name is what triggered the cancellation of my order. The cancellation was triggered automatically. When I asked why I was not called to clear this up I was told there was a breakdown in communications on Dells part.

Just for the record so everyone knows where I stand.

I have no intention of further dealings with Dell, they don't deserve my business.

I want nothing from Dell but I would gladly accept an apology to the Firearms community in general.

I posted this expressly to warn firearms owners of Dell policies PERIOD.

There are those that think I did this to generate traffic to my web site. All this traffic just made it hard for my customers to shop this evening. If you will notice there are no advertisements on my web so traffic is not a factor. It has also generated hundreds of email that I personally answered. Just so you all know I am not smart enough to do a publicity stunt of this magnitude on purpose, LOL!

I would humbly request the following.

Please, please refrain from making personal attacks on Michael Dell. I have received hundreds of e mails attacking Mr. Dell, please do not do this. I know we are all passionate about our right to keep and bear arms but please be as professional as possible.

I thank all of those that took the time to confirm that this story was true before spreading it, you all are to be commended!



Update 2/27/02

After fielding hundreds of emails and dozens of phone calls today my heart felt thanks to all who responded.

I was contacted by a Dell representative this morning a Mr. John Hood. John made the following remarks.

He extended Dells sincerest apologies for the incident.

He said Dell would review and possibly change the screening policies to prevent this from happening again.

Dell offered to ship the machine I ordered to me at no charge, I respectfully declined the offer.

John told me he would have a statement sent to me sometime Thursday morning the 28th stating Dells position on this issue for me to post here for all to see.

I will post the statement as soon as I receive it.



2/28/02 Update Statement from Dell

To Our Valued Customers and Friends:

U.S. export laws restrict the sale of technology to terrorists and to people

in countries that support terrorism. These laws also prohibit computer sales

to people who will use the technology in developing biological or nuclear

weapons. Dell strictly complies with our country's export laws in order to

ensure the safety of our customers and citizens around the world. When there

is reasonable cause for concern, we carefully review customer orders for

prohibited destinations and activities.

When additional follow-up on an order is required, our sales representatives

ask our customers four basic questions:

1. Who is the end-user?

2. Where will the product be used?

3. What will the product be used for?

4. What type of business or industry is involved?

The answers to these questions, like all customer information we gather, are

confidential and are not shared outside of Dell.

We recently received an order from Mr. Jack Weigand, whose company name,

"Weigand's Combat Handguns Inc." included the word "combat." We cancelled

the order to give us enough time to follow up with the customer and be

assured that the sale would be in compliance with U.S. export law. However,

we failed to contact Mr. Weigand, and as a result, we did not deliver the

order as promised, and the customer did not know why. Once we discovered our

error, we apologized to Mr. Weigand for this misunderstanding, as well as

the inconvenience caused by the delay. This is not the service standard that

we hold ourselves to at Dell.

We at Dell feel a strong obligation to uphold our federal law, but we have

just as strong an obligation to be responsive to the needs of all our

customers. We want to assure you that the company does not discriminate

against any business, regardless of the products or services they sell, nor

do we discriminate against individual consumers. We do, however, sometimes

make mistakes - as we did in this case.

Thank you for your support.

Sincerely,

Dell Computer Corporation

I felt it was my obligation to post the following

The following is a portion of a Dell statement that addresses the above link This was added 3/02/02

We appreciate the opportunity to clarify the facts regarding a customer

issue reported in the media and Dell's position on political or social

issues that many of you care deeply about.

Regarding Handgun Rights/Handgun Control....

Dell is a publicly-traded, customer-focused company with customers,

shareholders and employees on both sides of many public, social and

political issues. Our place is to serve our customers rather than to

endorse or support one position over another in public debates outside the

scope of our industry.

We do not discriminate against any business, regardless of the products or

services they sell, nor do we discriminate against individual customers.

We do, however, respect the right of any organization or individual to

have their own point of view. We follow all laws, rules and regulations.

Regarding allegations that Dell supports Handgun Control organizations

through the Dell Affiliates program...

Dell as a company remains neutral on handgun rights and handgun control.

Dell customers can support causes and organizations, if they choose,

through Dell's affiliates program and charitable websites such as

igive.com and progressivefunds.com. These sites feature links to Dell's

website. Dell's affiliates program provides a way for customers to support

the cause or organization of their choice through their Dell purchases.

Affiliate participants, such as igive.com and progressivefunds.com,

include organizations and causes on different sides of nearly every social

issue.

Some of the organizations participating through Dell affiliates such as

igive.com and progressivefunds.com., promote handgun rights, others

promote handgun control. Handgun Control Inc. (HCI) has been reported as

one organization that participates in this program. Others including The

Gun Owners Foundation and the Michigan Coalition for Responsible Gun

Owners Foundation, Inc. also participate through Dell affiliate igive.com.



The only organizations prohibited from participating in Dell's affiliates

program are those that promote sexually explicit material; promote

violence; promote discrimination based on race, sex, religion,

nationality, disability, sexual orientation or age; or promote illegal

activities.



3/01/02 Update

The free computer offer from Dell is a hot topic in much of the email I have received to date. I have since purchased a notebook computer elsewhere so I hope that issue is settled.



Again I thank everyone for your thoughts and comments. I will say I don't agree with some of the letters but we are Americans, we have the right to free speech.

Please keep in mind when reading postings on my site. I have no public relations department to draft and polish my postings. I think long and hard about what needs to be said and I post it. Please forgive me for being a little crude in my writing, keep in mind I am a Pistolsmith not a writer.

I am doing my best to keep up with the email, over 1000 to date. I read every email I receive and respond to 99% of it.

Title: DELL AND OUR RIGHT TO ARMS





Dell has issued a second statement, many of you have received via email. The letter contains the following statement:

"We have tried to make it right with our customer by giving him a free computer for his trouble and inconvenience ."

I have not accepted a computer from Dell. I have purchased a computer from another manufacturer.



Again I thank the Firearms community as a family for being so willing to come to my aid.

God Bless
