A pregnant woman has lost an eye after cops reportedly fired a BEAN BAG round through a car window during the Ferguson riots.

Violence erupted in the Missouri city of Ferguson earlier this week following a grand jury decision that white policeman Darren Wilson should not face trial for the shooting of unarmed black teenager Michael Brown.

The destruction and looting that followed is believed to have cost the city millions in repair bills - and several lives have been lost.

Dornella Conner was travelling through the mayhem in the St. Louis suburb on Monday night, when a cop is reported to have fired a non-lethal bean bag round at her boyfriend's car, which smashed the window and left her with severe injuries.

“I will have justice for what they did to me,” Ms Conner wrote on Facebook on Thursday following the incident. “But I’m happy I’m alive.”

Ms Conner and her boyfriend were parked a BP petrol station when police moved in to clear the area, the New York Daily News reports.

Officers made 16 arrests after reporting gunfire coming from the petrol station.

Mirror correspondent witnesses the riots:

Police claim a driver tried to run over a cop who then fired at the car in fear for his safety.

Ms Conner's told KMOV that her boyfriend was trying to drive around police so they could escape the violence at the time.

Ms Conner's injured eye could not be saved, and she has blurred vision in the other.

Police have reportedly issued a warrant for her boyfriend's arrest.

She claims the couple were just bystanders who were caught up in the mayhem.
