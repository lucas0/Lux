Woman Slays Gator with Butter Knife The Ohio river is known for it's vast selection of weird fish and creatures in the water. People have seen everything from small fresh water sharks to Alligator Gar. Well now you can add Alligators to that list. On July 23rd 2017 Ben Shoemaker and his family were swimming in the Ohio river when they noticed something in the water. Ben told us "it was a hot humid day so we decided to take a dip". He said "at first I thought it was a log. That sucker must have been at least 9ft long, he was huge". Ellen Shoemaker, (wife of Ben Shoemaker) said. The next day; however, local woman, Lauri Dukes, was picnicking in River park when she spotted the behemoth Gator sunning on the park's shore. The only weapon, Ms. Duke, had was a butter knife, which she was using to spread mayonnaise on a sandwich. Realizing the Gator was a threat to the community, she stealthily creeped up on the Gator and killed it with a swift stab through the eye with her butter knife. Ms. Duke, added all her family would be receiving Gator skin boots for Christmas this year.
