Golfers, take note — Tiger Woods’ Swedish luxury island, complete with six tee-off locations, is now up for grabs.

Located in Lake Mälaren, Sweden, the island was previously home to Woods and his then-wife, Swedish native Elin Nordegren, before their marriage famously collapsed in 2010 due to Woods’ infidelity.

In addition to being a golfer’s paradise, the 62-acre haven features a villa, hunting lodge, private ferry boat, horse stables and landing strip for propeller planes.

Sabine Rollinger of Vladi Private Islands, who are listing the island, told Mercury Press Agency that the escape is “unique due to its central location, as the Swedish capital is only about an hour away by boat or car, and from there you have swift access to the Stockholm archipelago.”

The property is also home to a historic 11th-century Viking stronghold, “a dramatic landscape with approximately 30-meter-high rocks rising out of the lake.”

Lake Mälaren is an enviable swim destination, as the water temperature reaches up to 79 degrees Fahrenheit in the summer months.
