A teenager woke up in the middle of a brain operation and asked doctors how it was going before chatting about cats.Iga Jasica, 19, had been taken to the Central Clinical Hospital in the city of Katowice in southwest Poland for the operation to remove a cancerous growth.But halfway through the critical surgery she woke up after the anaesthetic wore off and started talking to the surgeons about how it was going.Doctors say her brain was exposed at the time. Neurosurgeon Professor Dawid Larysz said: “Despite coming round she didn’t feel anything and was never in danger.”He said the young woman would not have been able to see or feel anything. Experts said the operation may have triggered something that caused her to come round despite the anaesthetic, but doctors are also investigating whether the anaesthetic was properly applied.After the operation Iga said: “I can’t remember much but the doctor said he talked to me about cats, which I love. I missed Christmas because of this operation but it is the best present I could have had as I am now feeling great.”
