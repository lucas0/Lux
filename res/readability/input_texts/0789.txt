The gunman who shot and killed a soldier near the Canadian parliament made a video saying he was driven by "ideological and political motives", police said.

Royal Canadian Mounted Police Commissioner Bob Paulson said they had "persuasive evidence" of the reasons behind Michael Zehaf-Bibeau's attack last week.

The clip cannot be released at this time but officers are conducting a detailed analysis of the footage.

Zehaf-Bibeau was shot dead at the scene after killing Corporal Nathan Cirillo, 24.

The attack in Ottawa came two days after a man described as an "IS-inspired terrorist" ran over two soldiers in a parking lot in Quebec, killing one and injuring the other before being shot to death by police.
