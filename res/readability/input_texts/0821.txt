The Scottish SPCA is appealing to the public for any information related to a dog that was found abandoned at a railway station along with a suitcase full of its belongings.

The dog, a male shar-pei crossbreed was found tied to a railing at Ayr Station, located in southwestern Scotland, last Friday. Next to the dog was a suitcase containing a pillow, toy, food bowl and food, the SPCA said in a statement Tuesday.

Scottish SPCA Insp. Stewart Taylor said the dog was microchipped, so the SPCA found out his name is "Kai" and was able to locate the dog's previous owner.

"We contacted the owner registered to the microchip, who stated they had sold Kai on Gumtree in 2013. Unfortunately they could not tell us the address of the person who bought him," Taylor said in the statement.

Taylor said the case highlights the many risks of selling an animal online.

"Regardless of the fact Kai was left with his belongings, this was a cruel incident and we are keen to identify the person responsible," he said.

The SPCA describes Kai as a "lovely dog with a nice nature" and estimates that he is between two to three years old. "We will look after him until we can find him a permanent and loving home," it said in the statement.

Under the Scottish Animal Health and Welfare Act 2006, abandoning an animal is an offence. Anyone found guilty of abandoning an animal can be banned from keeping any animals for a period of time or for life.

Anyone with any information about the case is being asked to contact the Scottish SPCA helpline at 0300 999 999.
