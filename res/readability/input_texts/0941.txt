The world's werewolf population likely will have one less member to add to its rolls, thanks to the benevolence of Argentine President Christina Fernandez de Kirchner.

Under a law the country has followed since the 1920s to counteract a generations-old legend, Fernandez adopted Yail Tawil, her godson who was destined, as the seventh son of his family, to become a werewolf, according to various published reports and the president's own tweets.

The happy family:

Argentina passed the law because the belief in the curse became so widespread that families were abandoning, putting up for adoption and in some cases killing their seventh sons, according to The Jerusalem Post.

Tawil's parents wrote Fernandez a letter asking her to take on Tawil as her godson, to which she agreed in a ceremony she described to her Twitter followers as "magical."

Many media reports described Tawil as a boy, but The Guardian said he's 21.

Editor's note: This story was updated to include The Guardian report that Tawil is 21 years old.
