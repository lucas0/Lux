b'Follow our live coverage of the 2020 election between Joe Biden and President Trump.\n\nWASHINGTON  Each morning at 8 as the coronavirus crisis was raging in April, Mark Meadows, the White House chief of staff, convened a small group of aides to steer the administration through what had become a public health, economic and political disaster.\n\nSeated around Mr. Meadowss conference table and on a couch in his office down the hall from the Oval Office, they saw their immediate role as practical problem solvers. Produce more ventilators. Find more personal protective equipment. Provide more testing.\n\nBut their ultimate goal was to shift responsibility for leading the fight against the pandemic from the White House to the states. They referred to this as state authority handoff, and it was at the heart of what would become at once a catastrophic policy blunder and an attempt to escape blame for a crisis that had engulfed the country  perhaps one of the greatest failures of presidential leadership in generations.\n\nOver a critical period beginning in mid-April, President Trump and his team convinced themselves that the outbreak was fading, that they had given state governments all the resources they needed to contain its remaining embers and that it was time to ease up on the lockdown.'
