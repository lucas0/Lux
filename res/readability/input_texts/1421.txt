A 17-year-old boy was struck and killed by a passing semitrailer on southbound Interstate 71 in Union Township Sunday morning.

Joshua Alcorn, 17, of Kings Mills, was in the road near the South Lebanon exit just before 2:30 a.m. when a tractor-trailer operated by Abdullahi Ahmed, 39, of Florence, hit the boy, according to police reports.

Alcorn was transported from the scene by the Warren County Coroner's Office.

Ahmed was wearing a seat belt during the accident and was uninjured. Police do not yet know whether or not he was impaired.

Southbound I-71 was closed for just under an hour before reopening Sunday morning.

The incident is being investigated by the Ohio State Highway Patrol.
