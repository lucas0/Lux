b'State Highlights\n\nVermont voters went to bed Tuesday night without knowing whether they had elected a Republican or Democrat for governor, the only opportunity for suspense in this reliably left-leaning state.\n\nBy midday on Wednesday, the votes had finally been counted, and Lt. Gov. Brian Dubie, the Republican candidate, conceded the race to his Democratic opponent, Peter Shumlin, the president of the State Senate.\n\nMr. Shumlin, who was helped by last-minute campaign visits from Vice President Joseph R. Biden Jr., won by a razor-thin margin. It was one of the rare gains for Democrats across the country: the seat had been vacated by a popular Republican governor, Jim Douglas.\n\nBut it was typical for Vermont, where the governorship has alternated between Republicans and Democrats for nearly 50 years.\n\nIn the Senate race, Patrick J. Leahy, an incumbent Democrat, easily defeated Len Britton, a Republican. STEPHANIE STROM'
