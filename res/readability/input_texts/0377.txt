b'Senator Bernie Sanders of Vermont, who has supported a single-payer plan for decades and is the author of the Medicare for All Act, which Ms. Harris has co-sponsored, argues that support will increase as more voters learn about the benefits of his plan. Insurance under Medicare for all, he argues, will cover all doctors and hospitals, and include no co-payments or deductibles. He thinks such a plan has so many advantages that few Americans will remain attached to their current coverage once they understand it.\n\nSome Democratic strategists look at the polls and worry about a backlash to the major disruptions such a plan would create. Candidates like Senator Michael Bennet of Colorado and the former vice president, Joe Biden, say theyd prefer a system in which people could choose to buy public insurance if they want  or keep the plan they have.\n\nMedicare for all was once cast as a litmus test for the Democratic presidential field, but at this point most of the candidates favor this sort of optional approach, with a mix of public and private insurance.\n\nMost candidates in the field endorsed such a plan in a recent New York Times survey, and in the debates less formal vote by show of hands.\n\nAnother solution might be government plans that cover some things, but allow people to buy private insurance for extras. In other countries with a universal public plan and private insurance, private insurance is there to fill holes in the government system. In Canada, private insurers pay for prescription drugs, which Canadian Medicare does not cover. In Britain, private insurance can get you extra services and the ability to jump the line for certain treatments. In the United States today, older people on Medicare buy supplemental insurance to help cover deductibles and co-payments charged by the government system.'
