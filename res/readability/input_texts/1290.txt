POLICE are investigating claims a doctor took a selfie with Joan Rivers while she was unconscious on the operating table, before performing a biopsy she hadn’t consented to.

The shocking claim was made by a staff member at the Yorkville Endoscopy clinic, where Rivers underwent a routine throat procedure on August 28.

After complications, the 81-year-old comedian was rushed to hospital where she died a week later.

Investigators are looking in to claims that a second unnamed doctor entered the operating room after that initial procedure to conduct a biopsy on her vocal chords.

They are also probing claims by the staff member that the clinician who performed the biopsy first snapped a photo of himself with the sedated star.

CNN cited a source close to the investigation as saying that the vocal chord biopsy was not something Rivers had consented to.

That same source also said investigators believe Rivers could have suffered a heart attack after her throat began to swell during the biopsy, depriving her of oxygen.

Yorkville Endoscopy issued a statement denying the biopsy had taken place, but declined to comment on the selfie accusation.
