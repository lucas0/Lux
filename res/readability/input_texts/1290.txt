Freddie Mac has announced that its mortgage relief options will be available to homeowners in Puerto Rico, the U.S. Virgin Islands and the U.S. mainland as Hurricane Irma approaches.

If you are a homeowner whose home or place of employment has been impacted by Hurricane Irma and your mortgage is owned by Freddie Mac, contact your mortgage company right away to discuss your mortgage relief options.

In Major Disaster Areas where federal Individual Assistance programs have been extended, your mortgage company is authorized to:

Suspend mortgage payments for up to 12 months.

Waive assessments of penalties or late fees against borrowers with disasterâ€“damaged homes.

Suspend reporting mortgage loan delinquencies caused by the disaster to the nation's credit bureaus.

Homeowners suffering from hardships unrelated to Hurricane Irma may be eligible for Freddie Mac's standard relief options such as temporarily suspending mortgage payments or a mortgage modification. It's important to contact your mortgage company as soon as possible to discuss your situation and explore your options.
