b'WASHINGTON, July 14  When a comprehensive immigration bill collapsed last month on the Senate floor, it was a victory for a small group that had been lobbying Congress for a decade to reduce the number of immigrants  legal and illegal  in the United States.\n\nThe group, Numbers USA, tracked every twist and turn of the bill. Its members flooded the Senate with more than a million faxes, sent through the organizations Web site. It supplied arguments and information to senators opposing the bill.\n\nIt was a David-and-Goliath struggle, said Roy H. Beck, the president of Numbers USA, who had been preparing for this moment since 1996, when he wrote a book titled The Case Against Immigration.\n\nSupporters of the bill included President Bush, the United States Chamber of Commerce, the high-tech industry, the Roman Catholic Church, many Hispanic organizations, farmers, restaurants, hotels and the construction industry.'
