TAMPA, Fla. -- If ever the "Cats have nine lives" cliche was appropriate, it would be for Bart the miracle cat.Not only was Bart hit by a car, he was buried alive. Five days later, he clawed his way back to life.The Human Society of Tampa Bay released a statement to ABC, explaining what happened to Bart after his owner discovered that he had been hit by a car:"The cat appeared to be lifeless and the owner buried him. Five days later, the cat showed up in a neighbors yard, alive!"How does the Humane Society believe the cat pulled off the feat? It wasn't easy, even for this resilient little guy."He had dug himself out of the grave and slowly made his way back home, albeit in weak, dehydrated and in need of medical attention," the society explained.He had wounds on his face, a broken jaw and a ruined eye. The owner couldn't afford vet treatments, so the cat was taken to the Humane Society, which is now taking care of him.Unfortunately Bart still has a long road ahead of him. He is unable to eat because he is in so much pain. Tuesday he will undergo surgery, when the society will wire his jaw, repair his palette, insert a temporary feeding tube and remove his damaged eye.There is good news, though, for Bart the miracle cat: The society believes he will be at home recovering soon.
