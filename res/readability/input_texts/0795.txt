Kai the dog, who was abandoned at a railway station with his suitcase

The charity managed to trace a previous owner through his microchip, but were told he had been sold two years ago to someone they did not have details for.

Now animal welfare charity the Scottish SPCA are trying to find who left him there.

Kai, a male Shar-Pei crossbreed was found tied to a railing outside Ayr station in Scotland on Friday.

This was still a cruel incident and we are keen to identify the person responsible

Scottish SPCA inspector Stewart Taylor said Kai had been sold on classified website Gumtree.

He said: "Regardless of the fact Kai was left with his belongings, this was still a cruel incident and we are keen to identify the person responsible.

"If anyone can help we would ask them to get in touch as soon as possible.

"Kai is around two to three years old and is a lovely dog with a nice nature. We will look after him until we can find him a permanent and loving home."

The charity also said abandoning an animal was a criminal offence.
