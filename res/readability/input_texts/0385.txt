b'State Highlights\n\nIn 2008, when Barack Obama handily won Wisconsin by 14 points, giddy Democrats declared that the historically progressive state had finally gone solidly blue.\n\nNot so fast. The Republican Party grabbed huge wins across the state on Tuesday, unseating Senator Russ Feingold, beating a Democrat for the open governorship and winning two formerly Democratic Congressional districts that cover nearly the entire northern half of the state. One of those two was the Seventh District, which had been held for 41 years by Representative David R. Obey, a Democrat who is retiring.\n\nScott Walker, a Republican and the Milwaukee County executive, was elected governor, succeeding James E. Doyle, a Democrat who opted against running for re-election.\n\nMr. Feingold, a liberal known for his unorthodox votes (he was the only senator to vote against the Patriot Act), was beaten by Ron Johnson, a businessman from Oshkosh who gained huge support almost immediately after receiving the State Republican Partys endorsement.\n\nThe public was substantially already behind Johnson before they knew anything about him, said Charles H. Franklin, a political science professor at the University of Wisconsin, Madison. Its very interesting that a guy with Feingolds record of 18 years could be beaten by such a neophyte, who himself admitted that he wasnt going to be specific about the details because he hadnt studied them very well. The answer to that is a combination of just how powerful these national forces were.\n\nDeep concerns over the economy appeared to drive the sentiment against Democrats in Wisconsin. Exit polls revealed that 4 in 10 voters said their own familys financial situation had worsened in the last two years.\n\nBut voters also said they had unfavorable views of both the Democratic and Republican Parties, with neither registering a clear advantage. (Wisconsin voters tend to favor moderate politicians, regardless of party, like Tommy Thompson, a progressive Republican who was governor from 1987 to 2001.)\n\nAnd they did not express the animosity toward the new health care law that was seen in other states. Only a minority of voters said they thought Congress should repeal it, and one-third said it should be expanded.\n\nMr. Franklin cautioned that Tuesdays results were no more permanently binding than those in 2008. Theyre the result of short-term forces, he said. I think weve remained pretty much a purple state.\n\nJULIE BOSMAN'
