1. That is probably some random blog someone wrote for amusement and get a bunch of gullible people to argue over.2. It could be photo shopped.3. Just because you have both genitalia doesn't mean you have both reproductive organs.4. Probably 100% of the people claiming to be "hermaphrodites" are probably making it up to back up their argument. 5. I doubt lady gaga's managers actually found a hermaphrodite that looks reasonably like her to learn her moves, and pose as her at live concerts. 6. It's illegal for strippers to show their genitalia due to indecent exposure.7. Baby pictures don't prove anything, there isn't any proof that it is actually her, it could be anyone.8. Getting plastic surgery on extra body parts to be removed is pretty easy, and affordable on her wage.9. Has anyone thought that this is probably just a publicity stunt? 10. Most of these comments are hypocritical and prejudice. You are ranting about people that are "against" lady gaga simply because you are convinced she is a hermaphrodite and that makes her special and need to be defended and protected. You rant on people for insulting her, you may aswell double post that to reply to yourself.11. I don't even understand why so many people feel obliged to defend her, what satisfaction will you gain from it what so ever? does it make you feel better about yourself or something? if you really want to support her go buy one of her albums or something.12. "I don't believe the bible is truth, but 'Judge not lest ye be judged' is a great quote." I just have to add this in.. You're saying you think it's a great quote but you don't believe it at all? Then what makes it great?13. "people should be able to do and live how they want, as long as it doesn't hurt or affect anyone else, without the criticism."firstly, what makes you think she doesn't just LOVE the attention she gets from all this? And secondly, you're saying you want to live in a world without a government? Every man for himself? What a ridiculous comment.14. "its whats on the inside that counts"No, it's not what's on the inside that counts, that's not how people become famous.. In a literal sense, you can sell various organs for some worth; so it is partly true.15. "...who cares what she is..."obviously, all these people commenting care..16. "fuck anyone who thinks they're sick peopleim nnot a hermaphrodite but i know that you people are just complete ignorant pigs." That's probably the most ignorant comment I've seen yet..17. "...fucking grow up you inconsiderate pricks dont take to fucking piss out of hermaphrodite's becasue you are fucking pathetic and they cant help it."and you're 'pathetic' for taking the piss out of 'inconsiderate pricks' ?18. "By the way you sick pig who are you to judge people, you insensitive piece of crap. You obviously have no respect for anyone, go and get a life!"You're worse then him, he's judging a celebrity, which the media does every day and no one seems to care.. but you're judging him from a simple comment? He should get a life? what about you, you have nothing better to do then to insult people on the internet?19. "ONE IS BORN A HERMAPHRODITE- ITS A BIOLOGICAL PHYSICAL FEATURE. THERE IS NOTHING WRONG WITH THAT."umm, yes there is something wrong with that.. only certain species are "natural" and successful hermaphrodites. Humans aren't able to reproduce without 2 sets of DNA.20. "The only way I will believe it is if she gets on tv and says it." You wouldn't believe it if she said it to your face?21. "GaGa never had an interview like this. No one has ever asked her anything about this." obviously because it's not suitable for the public media.
