Labs across the country were allowed to produce their own test kits, starting in January, which epidemiologists have credited with keeping the number of deaths relatively low and preventing Germanys health care system from becoming overwhelmed.\n\nWith a capability to carry out 1.2 million tests per week, Germany will begin implementing mandatory tests for anyone returning from vacation outside of Europe in August. Germany relies on contact tracing and an app to prevent outbreaks from spreading. Regions reporting more than 50 new cases per 100,000 residents in a week must return to lockdown.\n\nThe German economy is predicted to shrink by more than 5 percent this year, and more than 2.9 million Germans remain unemployed, with another 6.7 million furloughed. But Europes largest economy is rebounding more quickly than expected, though the risk of further setbacks remains high.\n\nThe countrys professional soccer league, which resumed matches played to empty stadiums on May 16, is planning to allow fans to return in smaller numbers and without beer in the coming months. Still, large-scale events, including the Berlin Marathon, Oktoberfest and countless local and regional fairs remain banned.\n\nHow Cases Are Growing\n\nHeres how the number of new cases and deaths are changing over time:\n\nNew reported cases by day in Germany 0 2,000 4,000 6,000 cases Feb.

Other organizations have reported higher figures for cases and deaths in Germany, but the German health authorities maintain that this data is unverified.'
