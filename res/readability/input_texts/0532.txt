Hot on the heels of a report that Apple has plans to release the Apple Watch in the U.S. in early April, 9to5Mac reports that the highly anticipated device will also be available in Germany and, perhaps, in other countries as well next month.

Don’t Miss: Apple’s secret plan to maximize Apple Watch battery life

The news is sourced directly from Apple CEO Tim Cook himself who spoke to Apple store employees while on a recent visit to Apple’s flagship store in Berlin, Germany.

Speaking at the Berlin flagship Apple Store last week, Apple CEO Tim Cook told employees that the Apple Watch will not be exclusive to the United States in April, according to employees in attendance. Specifically, Cook said that the Apple Watch will launch in Germany during the month of April.

If previous iPhone and iPad launches abroad are any indication, it certainly stands to reason that the Apple Watch will be available in a number of European countries come April. Additionally, it’s worth pointing out that Apple is reportedly planning to sell select models of the Apple Watch in high-end department stores and watch boutiques in Paris.

Over the past few weeks, with the Apple Watch launch drawing closer, Apple has noticeably stepped up its advertising efforts. The company’s U.S. based advertising campaign kicked off about a week ago with model Candice Swanepoel donning the device on the March cover of SELF Magazine.

With many questions and key details about the Apple Watch remaining, all eyes will be on Apple come March 9 when the company plans to hold a special media event to discuss all things Apple Watch and, perhaps, even new products.
