b'Mr. Torres, who identifies as Afro-Latino, would most likely be one of the first two openly gay Black or Latino members of Congress; the other is Mondaire Jones, a 33-year old lawyer who defeated another crowded field seeking to fill the seat in the Hudson Valley being vacated by Nita Lowey, the first woman to chair the House Appropriations Committee.\n\nBoth Ms. Maloneys seat in the 12th Congressional District, which includes parts of Manhattan, Queens and Brooklyn, and the 15th Congressional District in the Bronx, where Mr. Torres won his primary, are solidly Democratic, making both candidates overwhelming favorites to win in November.\n\nThe incumbent in the 15th, Representative Jos E. Serrano, has served in Congress for three decades, and some Democrats were already threatening to run against him in the primary before he announced his retirement ahead of 2020, citing the effects of Parkinsons disease.\n\nAmong the candidates Mr. Torres finished ahead of were Michael Blake, a state assemblyman and vice chair of the Democratic National Committee; Samelys Lpez, a community organizer who had the backing of some key progressives, including Representative Alexandria Ocasio-Cortez; Ydanis Rodriguez, a city councilman; and Melissa Mark-Viverito, a former City Council speaker.\n\nBut it was the chance to topple the Rev. Rubn Daz Sr., Mr. Torres had said in an interview before the election, that would be especially sweet, representing poetic justice that is long overdue.\n\nLooking back to his first City Council race seven years ago, he said, I ran in a state of fear because of the homophobic political culture that Rubn Daz Sr. has spent his life cultivating in the Bronx.\n\nMr. Daz, a 77-year-old Pentecostal minister who has served for two decades in the State Senate and the City Council, was under pressure last year from Council colleagues demanding that he resign for saying that legislative body was controlled by the homosexual community.'
