Canseco, who has been known for his infamous tweets in recent years, provided an update on his finger via his Twitter account on Oct. 29:

The 50-year-old enjoyed many of the best years of his career with the Oakland Athletics, winning an American League MVP award in 1988 and his first of two World Series titles in 1989.

The slugger hit 462 total home runs but discredited the power element of his game to a degree by publicly admitting to extensive steroid use.
