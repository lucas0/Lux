Police in Carlisle are hunting a middle-aged man who is slapping high street shoppers if they sneeze

Police are hunting a middle-aged man who is slapping high street shoppers if they sneeze.

In what Cumbria Police admit is 'very unusual behaviour', the man, who wears a tweed jacket, first smacked a woman round the head after she sneezed in Carlisle town centre on Monday.

The following day, the same man is thought to have slapped an 82-year-old woman who had just sneezed in Scotch Street, Carlisle. Sgt Gill Cherry of Cumbria Police said the pensioner was left feeling 'confused and upset'.

Police were informed about the first attack by witnesses â€“ but have yet to trace the victim.

Cumbrian Police described their strange suspect as being in his mid-to-late 50s and wearing a plush, tweed jacket.

The force have now asked for anyone with any information about, or who witnessed, the two related incidents to contact them.

Sgt Gill Cherry from said: 'We are treating these two reported incidents as linked, and are appealing to the local community to help trace the man responsible.

'It is very unusual behaviour, and will have left his victims feeling confused and upset.'

Shoppers in Carlisle yesterday said they were concerned by the eccentric's behaviour, although Nicola Dawson, 48, a dental receptionist, said: 'I have come here shopping on my day off and actually have a cold.

'If anyone smacked me for sneezing I would smack them back.

'If anyone saw someone do something like that I would be surprised if they did not do something as you wouldn't stand for it if you witnessed it.'

Trainee shop assistant Gemma Prosser, 19, added: 'We heard as it happened in the town centre and at first we just thought it was a bit weird.

'When you think about it, it is really awful because anyone can sneeze at any time and it's not your fault.'
