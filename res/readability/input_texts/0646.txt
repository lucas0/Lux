Yet its public health system is severely strained, and experts believe it is likely to reach a breaking point as Prime Minister Narendra Modis government continues to ease a nationwide lockdown.\n\nInitially, the country took some of the strictest measures anywhere to slow the spread of the coronavirus, including placing all 1.3 billion citizens under a nationwide lockdown. But the measures were brutally hard on the poorest Indians. Some of the restrictions were lifted in early May to help revive the economy, including allowing construction and plantation work to resume and many shops to reopen.\n\nWhen Mr. Modi announced the lockdown, hundreds of thousands of migrant workers were initially stranded in cities without a way to reach their home villages. Some started long journeys on foot. Most headed back to the countryside because they couldn't afford the rent or food without work in the cities, and that just spread the virus across the larger swaths of the country.\n\nHow Cases Are Growing\n\nHeres how the number of new cases and deaths are changing over time:\n\nNew reported cases by day in India 0 20,000 40,000 60,000 cases Feb. March April May June July Aug. New cases 7-day average Note: The seven-day average is the average of a day and the previous six days of data.\n\nNew reported deaths by day in India 0 500 1,000 1,500 2,000 deaths Feb. March April May June July Aug. New deaths 7-day average Note: Scale for deaths chart is adjusted from cases chart to display trend.\n\nThe New York Times has found that official tallies in the United States and in more than a dozen other countries have undercounted deaths during the coronavirus outbreak because of limited testing availability.\n\nIndias lockdown was largely considered effective, and it was widely obeyed. But with the measures largely lifted, anxiety is rising as the caseload surges, and more people have complained that they have been unable to find hospital beds.\n\nIndias total caseload has become the worlds third-largest. So far, a large chunk of Indias Covid-19 cases have come from five states: Maharashtra and Tamil Nadu, followed by Delhi, Karnataka and Andhra Pradesh.\n\nPublic health experts have warned that the countrys testing figures were still far too restricted. But capacity has been rising: On July 9, more than 267,000 samples were tested in 24 hours, taking the total number of samples tested so far to 10,740,832.\n\nWhere You Can Find More Information\n\nRead more about how Muslims in India have been blamed for spreading the virus, the steep drop in air pollution and life under lockdown in New Delhi, and how half a billion people could slip into destitution during the outbreak.\n\nHere is where you can find more detailed information:"
