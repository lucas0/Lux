It's being reported that one of the Batmobiles that are currently in Detroit for Batman Vs. Superman has been stolen.

Details are slim as Bleeding Cool mentions they heard it, but not from whom, and they state WB hasn't responded to inquires.

It's known that there are at two versions of the Batmobile in Detroit as two were spotted recently under a tarp.

Cosmic Book News will update when more becomes available.

This isn't the first time the film has had issues in Detroit as reportedly Henry Cavill almost got into a fight with a bunch of Detroit locals at a bar that dub themselves the "Deaf Wolfpack."

Update: It's being reported the Detroit police are unaware of the alleged stolen Batmobile and are said to be looking into the matter.

Update #2: Detroit police confirm the Batmobile was not stolen, but Zack Snyder reveals the culprit.
