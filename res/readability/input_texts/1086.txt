b'The workers open each ballots envelope and go through each ballot to determine whether, for example, a ballot has an extraneous marking that could disqualify it. They also hold up each ballot to the candidates or their representatives  known as watchers  who are intently monitoring the process from six feet away.\n\nThe ballots are then run through a machine that tallies the votes for each candidate.\n\nMr. Ryan said his workers were working around the clock and had been doing so throughout the Covid-19 emergency.\n\nCandidates and their campaigns have nonetheless been deeply frustrated by the slow pace, and increasingly concerned about what it portends for the general election in the fall.\n\nThis is just a primary: Imagine November with the presidential race and all the Senate and House races, said Rebecca Katz, a progressive political consultant who serves as an adviser to Mr. Bowmans campaign. Whats going to happen to our country?\n\nJohn Conklin, a spokesman for the New York State Board of Elections, said that the astronomically high number of absentee ballots overwhelmed a system built to handle far, far fewer.\n\nThe system is built to process 3 to 5 percent of the election in absentee ballots, not 40 to 60 percent of the election, Mr. Conklin said, adding that it is not possible to change this process overnight.\n\nMoreover, Mr. Conklin said that the delays could be repeated in November, if local boards are not given additional resources for hiring and overtime pay.'
