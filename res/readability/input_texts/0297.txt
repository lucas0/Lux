BREAKING : Pepsi STOCK Plummets After CEO Tells Trump Supporters to “Take Their Business Elsewhere”

Pepsi should have taken a look at Macy’s and what happened to them after they irrationally attacked Trump and his supporters.However, they’re ignoring Macy’s plight and attacking Trump supporters and telling us to “Take our business elsewhere.”

However, Pepsico is ignoring Macy’s plight and attacking Trump supporters and telling us to “Take our business elsewhere.”

Well, ok then…..

PepsiCo’s CEO said the election of Donald Trump as president was terrifying her employees. “I had to answer a lot of questions from my daughters, from our employees. They were all in mourning,” PepsiCo CEO Indra Nooyi told Andrew Ross Sorkin at The New York Times’ DealBook conference on Thursday. “Our employees were all crying,” she said. “And the question that they’re asking, especially those who are not white, ‘Are we safe?’ Women are asking, ‘Are we safe?’ LGBT people are asking, ‘Are we safe?’ I never thought I would have to answer those questions.” 

These people are low-info idiots.

We are calling on ALL TRUMP supporters to BOYCOTT Pepsi and all of their products.

These are the products we’re asking you to stop buying:

Sure glad it was @pepsi and not Coca-Cola. Coke could gang rape me and I'd pop one afterwards to enjoy that cool, refreshing cola taste. — CNN Is HitlerMaximus (@NolteNC) November 15, 2016 
