A man at New York City's LaGuardia Airport was removed from a plane after the Christmas spirit turned out to be too much for him.

As he was boarding American Airlines Flight 1140, headed to Dallas on Tuesday, an airline employee wished him a "Merry Christmas," according to the New York Post.

He lectured the employee about how it was inappropriate to say that to everyone, because not everyone celebrates the holiday. Unfortunately that was not the end of it. The Post:

Once on the plane, he was warmly greeted by a flight attendant who also wished him a “merry Christmas.” That was the last straw. “Don’t say, ‘Merry Christmas!’ ” the man raged before lecturing the attendants and the pilot about their faux pas.

The crew was unable to calm the man, and he was eventually removed from the flight (to the cheers of the other passengers).

Jonathan Daly, who commented below, says he was on the flight and did not think that the passenger was behaving in an irate manner.

"He was not acting crazy, or in anyway cranky, but simply calmly explaining to cops why he got into an argument with the flight crew," he said.

The flight left LaGuardia about 40 minutes late, according to FlightAware.

For proper greeting etiquette, Mashable turns to Miss Manners, who says annoyance at "Merry Christmas" is understandable but "friendly overtures require pleasant replies."

"While some people are offended by 'Christmas,' because they do not celebrate it, even more are offended by 'merry' because they do not feel it," she says.

But even though it's proper to respond to a well-intentioned greeting in kind, the holiday spirit can be a little overwhelming this time of year.

Just because I'll be stuck in a plane all day doesn't mean I can't be obnoxiously festive. Merry Christmas, yall!pic.twitter.com/YxShwZjF7C — Ashley Argota (@ashleyargota9) December 25, 2014

We hope that Mr. Scrooge is safe and well, wherever he is not observing the holiday.

American Airlines did not immediately respond to a request for comment.

Happy holidays, America.
