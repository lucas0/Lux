b'President Trump raised $165 million in July for his campaign and shared committees with the Republican National Committee, outpacing Joseph R. Biden Jr., who raised $140 million last month as a record-setting pace of money continued to flood into the presidential campaign.\n\nMr. Biden, the presumptive Democratic nominee, had outraised Mr. Trump in the two previous months, the first time that he had outraised the Republican incumbent. Mr. Biden raised $141 million in his shared accounts with the Democratic National Committee in June, compared with $131 million for Mr. Trump with the R.N.C.\n\nThe sums for both parties are far higher than for the campaigns four years ago, when Hillary Clinton raised $89 million with the Democratic Party in July and Mr. Trump collected $80 million.\n\nBoth campaigns announced their dueling July figures on Wednesday evening, with Mr. Bidens campaign going first and Mr. Trumps soon following.'
