The House tax reform bill includes a number of changes to the tax treatment of employee benefit programs, including the repeal of exclusions, deductions and credits for certain employee benefits and changes to rules for qualified retirement plans. These provisions are effective for tax years beginning after 2017.

Repeal of Exclusions, Deductions and Credits for Employee Benefits

Entertainment Expenses and Fringe Benefits – The bill repeals deductions for expenses relating to entertainment, amusement and recreation activities and facilities (including membership dues and on-premises gyms) and certain fringe benefits (e.g., employee discounts, transportation fringe benefits), unless the benefits are treated as taxable compensation to the employee. Employers may continue to deduct 50% of expenses relating to food, beverages and qualifying business meals.

Moving Expenses – Qualified moving expenses are no longer deductible by an employee or, if paid or reimbursed by the employer, are no longer excludible from the employee’s income.

Education Assistance – The bill repeals the exclusion for employer-provided education assistance.

Dependent Care – The bill repeals the exclusion for employer-provided dependent care assistance and the employer credit for qualified child care expenses.

Employee Achievement Awards – Qualified length of service and safety achievement awards are no longer excludible from employees’ income.

Adoption Assistance Programs – The bill repeals the exclusion for expenses paid by an employer under a qualified adoption assistance program.
