Police have said the male suspect in the shooting is dead, but did not reveal if it was Zehaf-Bibeau, Reuters reported. Some sources claimed he was born Michael Joseph Hall but changed his name to Zehaf-Bibeau after converting to Islam.

The alleged shooter had a criminal history for drug trafficking in Montreal and robbery in Vancouver, the U.K.'s Daily Mail said. He was designated as a “high-risk traveler,” and the government had seized his passport, Paul Waldie of the Globe and Mail wrote on Twitter.

Canadian Security Intelligence Service would not comment on the gunman’s alleged identity.

Corp. Nathan Cirillo, 24, was fatally shot by the assailant while he was standing guard at the National War Memorial. The Canadian parliament is currently on lockdown.
