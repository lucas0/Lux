US actor and comedian Adam Sandler has been found dead, aged 49, in an apparent suicide.

Marin County Police in California said he was pronounced dead at his home shortly after officials responded to an emergency call around noon local time.

Sandler was famous for such films as Happy Gilmore, The Wedding Singer, 50 First Dates, Mr Deeds and more than 40 others.

His publicist said he had been “battling severe depression”.

In the past he had talked, and even joked, about his struggles with alcohol and drugs.

Sandler had recently returned to a rehabilitation centre to “fine-tune” his sobriety, the Los Angeles Times reported in July.

The local Sheriff’s office said Sandler was found unconscious and not breathing at his home near Tiburon, north of San Francisco.

“At this time, the Sheriff’s Office Coroner Division suspects the death to be a suicide due to asphyxia, but a comprehensive investigation must be completed before a final determination is made,” police said in a statement.

In a statement, Adam’s wife, Jackie Sandler, said she was “utterly heartbroken” and asked that he be remembered for the joy he brought to the world.

“This morning, I lost my husband and my best friend, while the world lost one of its most beloved artists and beautiful human beings. I am utterly heartbroken,” she said.

“On behalf of Adam’s family, we are asking for privacy during our time of profound grief. As he is remembered, it is our hope the focus will not be on Adam’s death, but on the countless moments of joy and laughter he gave to millions.”

Sandler had two children Sadie Madison Sandler and Sunny Madeline Sandler.
