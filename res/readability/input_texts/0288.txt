b'41% of all U.S. deaths 68,000+ 8% of all U.S. cases 402,000+\n\nAt least 68,000 residents and workers have died from the coronavirus at nursing homes and other long-term care facilities for older adults in the United States, according to a New York Times database. As of August 13, the virus has infected more than 402,000 people at some 17,000 facilities.\n\nNursing home populations are at a high risk of being infected by  and dying from  the coronavirus, according to the Centers for Disease Control and Prevention. Covid-19, the disease caused by the coronavirus, is known to be particularly lethal to adults in their 60s and older who have underlying health conditions. And it can spread more easily through congregate facilities, where many people live in a confined environment and workers move from room to room.\n\nWhile 8 percent of the countrys cases have occurred in long-term care facilities, deaths related to Covid-19 in these facilities account for more than 41 percent of the countrys pandemic fatalities.\n\nIn 20 states, at least half of deaths are linked to nursing homes.

States with insufficient data to calculate a share of Covid-19 deaths are shaded gray.\n\nThe share of deaths linked to long-term care facilities for older adults is even starker at the state level. In 20 states, the number of residents and workers who have died accounts for either half or more than half of all deaths from the virus.\n\nInfected people linked to nursing homes also die at a higher rate than the general population. The median case fatality rate  the number of deaths divided by the number of cases  at facilities with reliable data is 16 percent, significantly higher than the 3 percent case fatality rate nationwide.\n\nFacility fatality rates are much higher than the national average Number of long-term care facilities by case fatality rate 20 facilities 40 facilities 60 facilities 80 facilities 0% 10% 20% 30% 40% 50% 60% The U.S. case fatality rate is 3%. The median case fatality rate in long-term care facilities is 16%. Note: Only facilities with reliable case and death data and at least 50 cases are included.\n\nIn the absence of comprehensive data from some states and the federal government, The Times has been assembling its own database of coronavirus cases and deaths at long-term care facilities for older adults. These include nursing homes, assisted-living facilities, memory care facilities, retirement and senior communities and rehabilitation facilities. This tracker will be updated periodically.\n\nSome states, including Colorado, Illinois, Nevada, New Jersey and South Carolina, regularly release cumulative data on cases and deaths at specific facilities. New York regularly releases facility-level information about deaths, but not about cases. Ohio, Wisconsin and Minnesota, among others, provide some details on the number of cases at specific facilities  but not on deaths. Others report aggregate totals for their states but provide no information on where the infections or deaths have occurred. Some report very little or nothing at all.\n\nThere are at least 17,000 long-term care facilities with one or more coronavirus case States that provide some facility data States that provide no facility data Ala.

They include residents and, in cases in which reporting is available, employees of the facilities. Given the wide variability in the type of information available, the totals shown here almost certainly represent an undercount of the true toll.\n\nThe New York Times is tracking the coronavirus at nursing homes and long-term care centers. Do you or a family member live or work in one of these facilities? If so, we would like to hear from you.\n\nHere is a list of cases and deaths at long-term care facilities that have had at least 50 cases.
