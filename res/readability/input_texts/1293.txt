The style is personal preference, and people who keep their hair long are viewed as hippies, hipsters, or just plain lazy. However, a whole different story emerged during the time of the Vietnam war.A woman, lets call her Sally, was married to a licensed psychologist who happened to work at a VA Medical Hospital. He worked with combat veterans who were suffering from PTSD.Below is Sallys story:I remember clearly an evening when my husband came back to our apartment on Doctors Circle carrying a thick official looking folder in his hands. Inside were hundreds of pages of certain studies commissioned by the government. He was in shock from the contents. What he read in those documents completely changed his life. From that moment on my conservative middle of the road husband grew his hair and beard and never cut them again. What is more, the VA Medical center let him do it, and other very conservative men in the staff followed his example. As I read the documents, I learned why.It seems that during the Vietnam War special forces in the war department had sent undercover experts to comb American Native American Reservations looking for talented scouts, for tough young men trained to move stealthily through rough terrain. They were especially looking for men with outstanding, almost supernatural, tracking abilities. Before being approached, these carefully selected men were extensively documented as experts in tracking and survival.With the usual enticements, the well proven smooth phrases used to enroll new recruits, some of these Native American trackers were then enlisted. Once enlisted, an amazing thing happened. Whatever talents and skills they had possessed on the reservation seemed to disappear mysteriously, as recruit after recruit failed to perform as expected in the field.Serious casualties and failures of performance led the government to contract expensive testing of these recruits, and this is what was found.When questioned about their failure to perform as expected, the older recruits replied consistently that when they received their required military haircuts, they could no longer sense the enemy. They could no longer access a sixth sense, their intuition no longer was reliable, they could not read subtle signs as well or access subtle extrasensory information.So the testing institute recruited more Native American trackers, let them keep their long hair, and tested them in multiple areas. Then they would pair two men together who had received the same scores on all the tests. They would let one man in the pair keep his hair long, and gave the other man a military haircut. Then the two men retook the tests.Time after time the man with long hair kept making high scores. Time after time, the man with the short hair failed the tests in which he had previously scored high scores.Here is a standardized test:The recruit is sleeping out in the woods. An armed enemy approaches the sleeping man. The long haired man is awakened out of his sleep by a strong sense of danger and gets away long before the enemy is close, long before any sounds from the approaching enemy are audible.In another version of this test, the long haired man senses an approach and somehow intuits that the enemy will perform a physical attack. He follows his sixth sense and stays still, pretending to be sleeping, but quickly grabs the attacker and kills him as the attacker reaches down to strangle him.This same man, after having passed these and other tests, then received a military haircut and consistently failed these tests and many other tests that he had previously passed.So, the document recommended that all Native American trackers be exempt from military haircuts. In fact, it required that trackers keep their hair long.How is this possible? It all has to do with how we as humans have evolved. Every part of the body has a purpose, and when we lose touch with ourselves and our bodies, we lose the true power we have.Hair, like skin, is an extension of the nervous system, it may be correctly seen as exteriorized nerves, a type of highly evolved feelers or antennae that transmit vast amounts of important information to the brainstem, the limbic system, and the neocortex.However, many people think hair is dead and does nothing for us as humans. It is just an accessory. I do not know who is right or who is wrong, but I am open to all possibilities.Here is the man you need to hear it from:This article was featured at Rense & WakingTimes by C.
