"Women retain and carry living DNA from every man with whom they have sexual intercourse , according to a new study by the University of Seattle and the Fred Hutchinson Cancer Research Center The study , which discovered the startling information by accident , was originally trying to determine if women who have been pregnant with a son might be more predisposed to certain neurological diseases that occur more frequently in males But as the scientists picked apart the female brain , the study began to veer wildly off course As it turns out , the female brain is even more mysterious than we previously thought The study found that female brains often harbor male microchimerism , or in other words , the presence of male DNA that originated from another individual , and are genetically distinct from the cells that make up the rest of the woman According to the study 63 of the females \( 37 of 59 \) tested harbored male microchimerism in the brain Male microchimerism was present in multiple brain regions So 63 of women carry male DNA cells that live in their brains Obviously the researchers wanted to know where the male DNA came from Anyone care to guess \? From the women s fathers \? No Your father s DNA combines with your mother s to create your unique DNA So where else could it come from \? Through the study the researchers assumed that the most likely answer was that all male DNA found living in the female brain came from a male pregnancy That was the safe , politically correct assumption But these researchers were living in denial Because when they autopsied the brains of women who had never even been pregnant , let alone with a male child , they STILL found male DNA cells prevalent in the female brain At this point the scientists didn t know what the hell was going on Confused , they did their best to hide the evidence until they could understand and explain it They buried it in numerous sub studies and articles , but if you sift through them all you will find the damning statement , the one line that gives the game away and explains exactly where these male DNA cells come from What are they so afraid of \? CONCLUSIONS Male microchimerism was not infrequent in women without sons Besides known pregnancies , other possible sources of male microchimerism include unrecognized spontaneous abortion , vanished male twin , an older brother transferred by the maternal circulation , or SEXUAL INTERCOURSE Male microchimerism was significantly more frequent and levels were higher in women with induced abortion than in women with other pregnancy histories Further studies are needed to determine specific origins of male microchimerism in women So according to the scientists , the possible sources of the male DNA cells living in the women s brains are an abortion the woman didn t know about a male twin that vanished an older brother transferred by the maternal circulation sexual intercourse Considering the fact that 63 of women have male DNA cells residing in the recesses of their brain , which of the above possibilities do you think is the most likely origin of the male DNA \? The first three options apply to a very small percentage of women They couldn t possibly account for the 63 figure The fourth option \? It s rather more common The answer is 4 Sex This has very important ramifications for women Every male you absorb spermatazoa from becomes a living part of you for life The women autopsied in this study were elderly Some had been carrying the living male DNA inside them for well over 50 years Sperm is alive It is living cells When it is injected into you it swims and swims until it crashes headlong into a wall , and then it attaches and burrows into your flesh If it s in your mouth it swims and climbs into your nasal passages , inner ear , and behind your eyes Then it digs in It enters your blood stream and collects in your brain and spine Like something out of a scifi movie , it becomes a part of you and you can t get rid of it We are only now beginning to understand the full power and ramifications of sexual intercourse Sources",false

"In addition to the catastrophic flooding from Hurricane Harvey , Houston residents have one more thing to worry about floating colonies of fire ants Fire ants have waxy bodies that allow them to repel water Should a colony find itself waterlogged , ants will protect their queen by forming a mass around her , as well as eggs , larvae , and pupae \( ants that are in between larvae and adults \) As the ants float , they rotate , so that the underwater ants will get to the top and vice versa This behavior is totally normal , Molly Keck , an entomologist at Texas A M AgriLife Extension Service , tells The Verge We usually call fire ants flood water species , she says They 've been known well before this hurricane to float on top of water like that Keck describes these clumps as chain link ants They hook their feet and hang onto one another to preserve their colony while flooded When the water recedes , or they float to a spot where they hit dry land , then they 'll build their colony again in their spot , Keck says In a flood , this can be particularly scary if they choose to board a temporary sanctuary someone has taken refuge on like a roof The ants , in fact , aren t harmless , she says People who come in contact with the colonies will get at least a few itchy , probably painful pustules But how your skin reacts can differ from swelling to life threatening allergic reactions Once they hit you , you 're a solid surface so they 're gonna crawl on you , Keck says When the first one stings , they emit a pheromone that causes a chain reaction that tells everybody else to sting , so you 're going to experience quite a few stings The best thing to do is to rub them off as quickly as possible They 'll kind of roll up when you brush against them , and so that 's an easy way to try and get them to detach from you , she says Those looking to go on the offensive may want to spray the ants with dish soap to break down their waxy rafts , according to Wired Of course , that means getting close to the adrift colony , which Larry Gilbert , a professor of integrated biology at the University of Texas at Austin , strongly advises against You protect yourself by avoiding them , not by messing with them , he says They do n't come to attack you They 're just passively floating along It 's a matter of being just intelligent and evasive But if you find yourself unable to escape their path , Keck suggests creating waves to wash them away from you They are pretty well globbed up , and so if you 're quick enough , you can kind of move them a few inches away from you so you can avoid them , Keck says At the very least , their distinctive rust coloring makes them easy to spot for what they are and not a piece of debris Keck says there s no danger of them spreading beyond states they already inhabit That might not be comforting for those in Texas and Louisiana , but at least the fire ants are not building wriggling Eiffel towers Yet",true

"I spent 18 months putting together the sanctions against Iran so that we could force them to the negotiating table Hillary Clinton on Friday , November 6th , 2015 in a Democratic primary forumHillary Clinton says she helped usher Iran to the negotiating tableBy Lauren Carroll on Monday , November 23rd , 2015 at 11 26 a m Former Secretary of State Hillary Clinton takes questions after delivering a speech on her approach to defeating the Islamic State terrorist network at the Council on Foreign Relations Nov 19 , 2015 in New York City \( Photo by Spencer Platt Getty Images \) If it weren t for Democratic presidential candidate Hillary Clinton , there likely wouldn t yet be an Iran nuclear deal , according to the former Secretary of State While her Republican rivals who oppose the Iran deal might use that line against her , Clinton has touted progress with Iran as one of the hallmarks of her tenure at the State Department I spent 18 months putting together the sanctions against Iran so that we could force them to the negotiating table , she said at the MSNBC Democratic forum Nov 6 She s said this line a few times throughout her campaign , so we decided to dig into it According to her campaign , Clinton was referring to her first 18 months as secretary from January 2009 to June 2010 During this time , U S and global sanctions on Iran increased , it s fair to say that Clinton and the State Department played a major role in this development The invitationUpping sanctions on Iran was a clear priority for Clinton s State Department She talked at length about the importance of pressuring Iran to discontinue nuclear activity , including through sanctions , at her nomination hearing in January 2009 She and other members of President Barack Obama s administration regularly spoke publicly about the topic throughout her first 18 months in office During this time period , the State Department top aides and Clinton herself led the diplomatic lobbying effort to get other countries to join the U S plan to pressure Iran , overcoming large hurdles such as getting Russia and China to get on board In her memoir Hard Choices , Clinton recalls hashing out final details of a plan over drinks with a Chinese official In June 2010 , the United Nations Security Council approved tough new sanctions on Iran including expanding an arms embargo and restricting certain financial and shipping enterprises At the time , Obama called them the toughest sanctions ever faced by the Iranian government Those sanctions enabled even tougher measures from the United States and the European Union , which were passed immediately Congress passed several more bills containing additional sanctions on Iran during the rest of Clinton s tenure , which ended in early 2013 While the Treasury is the primary agency responsible for enforcing sanctions , Clinton appointed a special adviser in 2010 to oversee U S efforts to ensure full and effective implementation of all U N Security Council resolutions related to Iran , including most recently UNSCR 1929 Experts told us that Clinton is correct to take some of the credit for the rapid increase in international sanctions on Iran , and these sanctions were a big part of the reason why Iran rejoined multilateral talks about its nuclear program The RSVPThe State Department was key to getting other countries to go along with and add to U S efforts to pressure Iran , said Patrick Clawson , senior fellow and research director at the Washington Institute for Near East Policy He added that her claim doesn t give enough credit to other players but is essentially correct Clawson specifically noted that he is not a fan nor a political supporter of Clinton The international sanction ramp up shocked Iran 's leaders , Clawson said Besides the pain the sanctions inflicted , they raised the possibility more worse was coming That was a key factor pushing Iran to resume more serious talks There is room for subjective interpretation on who deserves the credit for effective sanctions because many corners of the U S government are involved in the Iran effort , said Suzanne Maloney , deputy director of the foreign policy program at the Brookings Institution But the State Department had its hands in every aspect of new sanction making and implementation , she said And in the absence of the United Nations resolution Clinton s lobbying success it would have been challenging to get a global coalition to significantly ramp up the sanctions , she said But whether sanctions were a big factor in bringing Iran to the negotiating table is not crystal clear , Maloney said Iranian officials have historically denied the significance of sanctions , but Ayatollah Ali Khamenei has said recently that Iran negotiated the deal specifically to have sanctions lifted Beyond the multilateral effort , Clinton s team also played a role in the sanctions that Congress passed , said Richard Nephew , an expert on sanctions with the Center on Global Energy Policy at Columbia University Lawmakers would not have written that legislation without consulting the State Department and the administration \( as evidenced in this 2010 New York Times article \) Nephew noted , though , that Congress did pass some sanctions that went further than the administration s wishes Without Secretary Clinton 's good diplomacy and the message that she radiated down the system to make this a priority and so forth you can argue that the reductions would not have been as steep or as lasting , Nephew said Congress sanctions that affect Iran s oil exports resulted in a 50 percent reduction in oil exports and were instrumental in getting Iran to the negotiating table , said Nephew , who worked at the State Department under Clinton Our rulingClinton said , I spent 18 months putting together the sanctions against Iran so that we could force them to the negotiating table Clinton s claim is for the most part accurate , though a little exaggerated During her first 18 months as secretary , the State Department was at the helm of a global effort to increase sanctions on Iran , culminating in an important U N resolution Clinton was personally involved in these diplomatic efforts and pushed them publicly And experts said these sanctions , on top of other sanctions passed before and after , were crucial to getting Iran to the negotiating table However , Clinton wasn t singularly responsible for the sanctions , just as the sanctions passed under her watch likely weren t singularly responsible for opening up Iran to talks We rate her statement Mostly True Advertisement",true

An open letter to the local daily paper almost every local daily paper in America I remember reading All the President 's Men and thinking That 's journalism You do what it takes to get the truth and you lay it before the public , because the public has a right to know This housing crisis did n't come out of nowhere It was not a vague emanation of the evil Bush administration It was a direct result of the political decision , back in the late 1990s , to loosen the rules of lending so that home loans would be more accessible to poor people Fannie Mae and Freddie Mac were authorized to approve risky loans What is a risky loan \?

Are n't you supposed to follow the money and see which politicians were benefitting personally from the deregulation of mortgage lending \? I have no doubt that if these facts had pointed to the Republican Party or to John McCain as the guilty parties , you would be treating it as a vast scandal Housing gate , no doubt Or Fannie gate Instead , it was Senator Christopher Dodd and Congressman Barney Frank , both Democrats , who denied that there were any problems , who refused Bush administration requests to set up a regulatory agency to watch over Fannie Mae and Freddie Mac , and who were still pushing for these agencies to go even further in promoting subprime mortgage loans almost up to the minute they failed As Thomas Sowell points out in a TownHall com essay entitled Do Facts Matter \? Alan Greenspan warned them four years ago So did the Chairman of the Council of Economic Advisers to the President So did Bush 's Secretary of the Treasury These are facts This financial crisis was completely preventable The party that blocked any attempt to prevent it was the Democratic Party The party that tried to prevent it was the Republican Party Yet when Nancy Pelosi accused the Bush administration and Republican deregulation of causing the crisis , you in the press did not hold her to account for her lie Instead , you criticized Republicans who took offense at this lie and refused to vote for the bailout ! What \? It 's not the liar , but the victims of the lie who are to blame \? Now let 's follow the money right to the presidential candidate who is the number two recipient of campaign contributions from Fannie Mae And after Franklin Raines , the CEO of Fannie Mae who made 90 million while running it into the ground , was fired for his incompetence , one presidential candidate 's campaign actually consulted him for advice on housing If that presidential candidate had been John McCain , you would have called it a major scandal and we would be getting stories in your paper every day about how incompetent and corrupt he was But instead , that candidate was Barack Obama , and so you have buried this story , and when the McCain campaign dared to call Raines an adviser to the Obama campaign because that campaign had sought his advice you actually let Obama 's people get away with accusing McCain of lying , merely because Raines was n't listed as an official adviser to the Obama campaign You would never tolerate such weasely nit picking from a Republican If you who produce our local daily paper actually had any principles , you would be pounding this story , because the prosperity of all Americans was put at risk by the foolish , short sighted , politically selfish , and possibly corrupt actions of leading Democrats , including Obama If you who produce our local daily paper had any personal honor , you would find it unbearable to let the American people believe that somehow Republicans were to blame for this crisis There are precedents Even though President Bush and his administration never said that Iraq sponsored or was linked to 9 11 , you could not stand the fact that Americans had that misapprehension so you pounded us with the fact that there was no such link \( Along the way , you created the false impression that Bush had lied to them and said that there was a connection \) If you had any principles , then surely right now , when the American people are set to blame President Bush and John McCain for a crisis they tried to prevent , and are actually shifting to approve of Barack Obama because of a crisis he helped cause , you would be laboring at least as hard to correct that false impression Your job , as journalists , is to tell the truth That 's what you claim you do , when you accept people 's money to buy or subscribe to your paper But right now , you are consenting to or actively promoting a big fat lie that the housing crisis should somehow be blamed on Bush , McCain , and the Republicans You have trained the American people to blame everything bad even bad weather on Bush , and they are responding as you have taught them to If you had any personal honor , each reporter and editor would be insisting on telling the truth even if it hurts the election chances of your favorite candidate Because that 's what honorable people do Honest people tell the truth even when they do n't like the probable consequences That 's what honesty means That 's how trust is earned Barack Obama is just another politician , and not a very wise one He has revealed his ignorance and naivete time after time and you have swept it under the rug , treated it as nothing Meanwhile , you have participated in the borking of Sarah Palin , reporting savage attacks on her for the pregnancy of her unmarried daughter while you ignored the story of John Edwards 's own adultery for many months So I ask you now Do you have any standards at all \? Do you even know what honesty means \? Is getting people to vote for Barack Obama so important that you will throw away everything that journalism is supposed to stand for \? You might want to remember the way the National Organization of Women threw away their integrity by supporting Bill Clinton despite his well known pattern of sexual exploitation of powerless women Who listens to NOW anymore \? We know they stand for nothing they have no principles That 's where you are right now It 's not too late You know that if the situation were reversed , and the truth would damage McCain and help Obama , you would be moving heaven and earth to get the true story out there If you want to redeem your honor , you will swallow hard and make a list of all the stories you would print if it were McCain who had been getting money from Fannie Mae , McCain whose campaign had consulted with its discredited former CEO , McCain who had voted against tightening its lending practices Then you will print them , even though every one of those true stories will point the finger of blame at the reckless Democratic Party , which put our nation 's prosperity at risk so they could feel good about helping the poor , and lay a fair share of the blame at Obama 's door You will also tell the truth about John McCain that he tried , as a Senator , to do what it took to prevent this crisis You will tell the truth about President Bush that his administration tried more than once to get Congress to regulate lending in a responsible way This was a Congress caused crisis , beginning during the Clinton administration , with Democrats leading the way into the crisis and blocking every effort to get out of it in a timely fashion If you at our local daily newspaper continue to let Americans believe and vote as if President Bush and the Republicans caused the crisis , then you are joining in that lie If you do not tell the truth about the Democrats including Barack Obama and do so with the same energy you would use if the miscreants were Republicans then you are not journalists by any standard You 're just the public relations machine of the Democratic Party , and it 's time you were all fired and real journalists brought in , so that we can actually have a daily newspaper in our city",true

"Index to Five Millennium Catalog of Lunar Eclipses 1999 to 3000 \( 2000 BCE to 3000 CE \) Introduction Eclipses of the Moon can occur when the Moon is near one of its two orbital nodes 1 during the Full Moon phase It is then possible for the Moon to pass through Earth 's penumbral or umbral shadows thereby producing an eclipse There are three types of lunar eclipses Penumbral Moon traverses Earth 's penumbral shadow \( Moon misses Earth 's umbral shadow \) Partial Moon traverses Earth 's penumbral and umbral shadows \( Moon does not pass completely into Earth 's umbra \) Total Moon traverses Earth 's penumbral and umbral shadows \( Moon passes completely into Earth 's umbra \) Furthermore , total eclipses can be classified as either central 2 or non central The visual appearance of each of these eclipse types differs dramatically from each other The recurrence of lunar eclipses is governed by the Saros cycle For more information , see Periodicity of Lunar Eclipses Statistics for Lunar Eclipses 1999 to 3000 \( 2000 BCE to 3000 CE \) During the five Millennium period 1999 to 3000 \( 2000 BCE to 3000 CE 3 \) , Earth will experience 12064 lunar eclipses The following table shows the number of eclipses of each type over this period Lunar Eclipses 1999 to 3000 Eclipse Type Symbol Number Percent All Eclipses 12064 100 0 Penumbral N 4378 36 3 Partial P 4207 34 9 Total T 3479 28 8 During most penumbral eclipses , only part of the Moon passes through Earth 's penumbral shadow However , it is also possible to have a penumbral eclipse in which the Moon passes completely within Earth 's penumbral shadow without entering the inner umbral shadow Such total penumbral eclipses are quite rare compared to normal \( or partial \) penumbral eclipses The table below shows the distribution of the two penumbral eclipse types during the 5000 year period of this Catalog Penumbral Lunar Eclipses 1999 to 3000 Classification Number Percent All 4378 100 0 Partial Penumbral 4237 96

this five millennium period Each line in the table corresponds to one century and gives the breakdown of each eclipse type \( penumbral , partial , and total \) The date intervals themselves are each a link to a catalog listing complete details for every lunar eclipse in the selected century The data in these 100 year eclipse tables include the date and time of greatest eclipse 4 , T , lunar libration number , Saros series , the eclipse type , quincena solar eclipse parameter , gamma , eclipse magnitudes , eclipse phase durations , and local circumstances For a detailed key and additional information about the catalogs , see Key to Catalog of Lunar Eclipses Calendar The Gregorian calendar is used for all dates from 1582 Oct 15 onwards Before that date , the Julian calendar is used For more information on this topic , see Calendar Dates The Julian calendar does not include the year 0 Thus the year 1 BCE is followed by the year 1 CE \( See BCE CE Dating Conventions \) This is awkward for arithmetic calculations Years in this catalog are numbered astronomically and include the year 0 Historians should note there is a difference of one year between astronomical dates and BCE dates Thus , the astronomical year 0 corresponds to 1 BCE , and astronomical year 1 corresponds to 2 BCE , etc Predictions Lunar eclipse predictions must take into account the enlargement of Earth 's shadows In this Catalog , Earth 's penumbral and umbral shadow sizes have been calculated using Danjon 's enlargement method The coordinates of the Sun used in the predictions are based on the VSOP87 theory Bretagnon and Francou , 1988 The Moon 's coordinates are based on the ELP 2000 82 theory Chapront Touze and Chapront , 1983 For more information , see Solar and Lunar Ephemerides The revised value used for the Moon 's secular acceleration is n dot 25 858 arc sec cy cy , as deduced from the Apollo lunar laser ranging experiment \( Chapront , Chapront Touze , and Francou , 2002 \) The largest uncertainty in the eclipse predictions is caused by fluctuations in Earth 's rotation due primarily to tidal friction of the Moon The resultant drift in apparent clock time is expressed as T and is determined as follows pre 1950 's T calculated from empirical fits to historical records derived by Morrison and Stephenson \( 2004 \) 1955 2006 T obtained from published observations Post 2006 T is extrapolated from current values weighted by the long term trend from tidal effects A series of polynomial expressions have been derived to simplify the evaluation of T for any time from 1999 to 3000 The uncertainty in T over this period can be estimated from scatter in the measurements Footnotes Acknowledgments The information presented on this web page is based on data published in Five

"The bruising battle over Brett Kavanaugh 's Supreme Court nomination may be finished , but the political scars will last a lifetime That is true for no one more than Sen Lindsey Graham Formerly a believer that a judge must be removed if he commits perjury , the Republican from South Carolina turned a blind eye to Kavanaugh 's many demonstrable fibs Formerly known for his bipartisanship , Graham elected to play the attack dog \( Curiously enough , this turn came after the Judiciary Committee 's counsel started asking Kavanaugh searching questions about his history of drinking and partying \) For Graham watchers , the hearings were the latest evidence of the senator 's disturbing transformation from Never Trumper to Trump apologist What happened to Lindsey Graham \? is the question asked by three separate profiles in the past month A New York Times columnist just dubbed him the saddest story in Washington Some commentators have pointed to the death of his good friend Sen John McCain of Arizona this summer as a turning point for Graham In reality , he 's been sliding down this path for years And the best place to witness his transformation indeed , to glimpse the regression of the GOP as a whole is via his Twitter account , LindseyGrahamSC First , let 's remind ourselves of what Graham used to be like in 2009 In Obama 's first term , he was to be found working with John Kerry on a bipartisan bill to put a price on carbon emissions back when Kerry was a senator Yes we can \( pass climate change legislation \) , the pair wrote in the Times \( No , they could n't \) You can see the exact moment Graham realized his fellow Republicans were not as keen on Obama as he was In the middle of a September 2009 speech to Congress , Graham starts to applaud the president 's words on education , then suddenly thinks better of it Graham did n't join Twitter until December 2011 , and did n't start tweeting until March 2012 His first tweet thanked supporters for coming to a fish fry and vowed to make Obama a one term president But nearly all his tweets were innocuous back then bland statements of support for GOP candidates approving reports of his visits to Google and Apple a photo of his fashion choices on the links Graham announced his own bid for the presidency on June 1 , 2015 He touted his experience , and compared himself favorably to Hillary Clinton in that area But he was also careful to strike a note of civility and bipartisanship one that sounds like it 's from a lifetime ago , not a mere three years Donald Trump announced his candidacy two weeks later Graham did n't even think it worth tweeting about Nor did he mention Trump 's comments calling Mexican immigrants criminals and rapists His first ever Trump tweets came a month later , after Trump denied that McCain was a war hero because I like people that do n't get captured That subtweet was immediately followed by a direct attack on Trump 's fitness for office Trump punched back by giving Graham 's cellphone number out during a campaign speech Graham 's response was to bring a droll understatement to a knife fight Still , Graham was n't cowed his attacks on Trump ramped up over the following months Here 's Graham 's first actual joke at Trump 's expense But when Trump called for a total and complete shutdown of Muslims entering the United States , Graham like many of us decided the reality TV star 's campaign was no laughing matter The next day , Graham took direct aim at the MAGA slogan using his strongest swear word The following week , Trump made an ominous statement of support for Russia 's president Back then , Graham considered it an even more serious foreign policy blunder Graham dropped out of the presidential race on December 21 , 2015 , citing poor polling numbers But that did n't stop him from attacking Trump in unequivocal language On February 20 , 2016 , Trump swept the GOP primary in Graham 's home state , South Carolina Shortly after , Graham and Trump got into the first of two Twitter spats On May 3 , 2016 , Trump 's last opponent with a shot at defeating him , Sen Ted Cruz , dropped out of the race Graham was in an apocalyptic mood He posted a dire prediction to his party one that remains his most liked , most talked about tweet , even now Just nine days later , however , Trump won the delegates he needed Graham posted this , and you can almost hear the gnashing of teeth If anyone on Trump 's campaign expected Graham to fall into line , however , they were disappointed A day after the infamous Access Hollywood tape was released , Graham again made his anti Trump feelings clear In the wake of three disastrous debate performances by Trump , Hillary Clinton was riding high in the polls Graham 's tweets indicated he considered Trump 's campaign to be a lost cause Not even the last minute bombshell of then FBI director James Comey reopening an investigation into Clinton 's emails deterred Graham from making it clear on election day that he did not vote for Trump Instead the senator punched his ballot for a Republican running as an independent , Evan McMullin Even after a perfunctory statement congratulating Trump on his surprise victory , Graham remained cautious particularly about Trump 's relationship with Russia In the month after Trump 's inauguration , Graham 's tweets continued to be ambivalent Reacting to a Trump proposal for a border tax on Mexico to build the wall , Graham tried to bring the funny by tweeting that it was mucho sad Graham tweeted support for all Trump 's cabinet picks , but also pushed for investigations into Russia 's impact on the 2016 election and cautioned against the first Muslim travel ban But if there is a pivot point in Graham 's relationship with Trump , it arrived in March 2017 He issued a statement in support of the second travel ban , and had a White House meeting that seemed to thaw relations to the point where he and Trump became phone buddies again Still , Graham was prepared to defend Jeff Sessions against Trump 's insistence that the Attorney General prosecute Hillary Clinton even if the strongest word he could muster to describe this norm breaking outrage was inappropriate When literal Nazis and Klansmen rallied in Charlottesville , Graham was prepared to attack Trump over his many sides statement But he did n't dare tweet his complaints directly , preferring to link to a newspaper interview Two days later Trump struck back at Graham directly , calling him publicity seeking and a disgusting liar Graham then got into his second ever quote tweet spat In a non threaded thread , he warned Trump that he was now being quoted approvingly by racist hate groups , implored him to fix this and said that history is watching us all But by this point , Graham could not attack Trump without sending an approving tweet literally one minute later Trump 's announcement calling for a troop surge in Afghanistan the following week seemed to patch things up as far as the hawkish Graham was concerned And then , a couple months later , the golfing began Later that month , the supposed fiscal conservative Graham voted for Trump 's deficit ballooning trillion dollar tax cut By Trump 's first State of the Union in January 2018 , the senator was tweeting full throated support for the law and order president In April , two years after predicting the GOP would be destroyed by Trump , Graham announced he was all in for Trump 2020 The preemptive endorsement also marked a distinctive trend in Graham 's tweets Since March 2018 , he has started using Trump 's twitter handle A lot In July , Trump 's craven display of obsequiousness towards Vladimir Putin in Helsinki shocked the world Graham had once considered Trump 's support for Putin worse than his proposal for a Muslim travel ban Now he merely described it as a missed opportunity Even that mild display of dissent was erased a couple days later , when Graham credulously insisted Trump was not denying the conclusions of his own intelligence services Soon enough , Graham was couching his Russia criticism within a statement that he was totally agreeing with Trump In April 2018 , Graham had signed on to a bipartisan Senate bill that would have specifically protected Robert Mueller 's investigation into Russian interference in the 2016 election But in August 2018 , the bill having gone nowhere , Graham tweeted that he hoped Mueller would wrap up his investigation sooner rather than later He also gave an interview in which he appeared to back away from supporting Jeff Sessions For the first time , Trump quoted Graham approvingly There was little time for Graham to respond to that tweet John McCain , who had not wavered in his opposition to Trump , passed away later the same day McCain had specifically disinvited Trump from the funeral , but Graham was able to wangle an invite for Ivanka Trump and Jared Kushner Around the same time , he tweeted a photo of his meeting with Ivanka After the McCain funeral , Graham 's long transformation into a Trump surrogate seemed complete Here he is a week later , tweeting his support in the wake of early revelations from Bob Woodward 's book Fear Meanwhile , Republican representatives in the House were in the throes of discrediting Mueller 's investigation by attacking the investigators This presented no problem for Graham What is interesting to follow through all this is how much more frequently Graham tells us to tune in to appearances on Fox News , Fox Business News , and CNN The more controversial he gets , naturally , the more he does on air hits And then we come to the Kavanaugh nomination , and the revelation of Dr Christine Blasey Ford 's accusation In a startling display of hypocrisy , the senator who had gone all in for a man he once despised now accused Democrats of acting in a Machiavellian manner By the end of the nomination process , Graham was n't just supporting Trump in his tweets he was starting to sound like him Note the use of ellipses instead of numbering his tweets , the one word descriptions , and the very Trumpian touch of capitalizing the word victory Perhaps there is more of Graham 's Twitter story to be told maybe he will disentangle himself from Trump after the midterms But at the moment , his trail of shifting positions looks like a cautionary tale for future generations Here , kids , is what happens when you gain a tax cut , and a Supreme Court seat , and a whole lot of airtime , but lose your political soul",true
"In what might just be the most 2017 NFL story ever , Steelers coach Mike Tomlin ripped one of his players , an Afghan war veteran , for coming out of the locker room for the national anthem On Sunday , the Steelers had decided as a team to remain in the locker room and not come to the sidelines for the playing of the national anthem , with one notable exception The team understood that tackle Alejandro Villanueva , a former Army Ranger and Afghan war veteran , would still come out to show respect for the flag The exception was made for Villanueva due to the fact that he risked life and limb defending that flag and what it stands for , a factor obvious enough that really shouldn t have to be explained Except for one factor it s the NFL in 2017 The reasons why Villanueva should be exempted from his team s disgusting display of disrespect were apparently lost on their head coach When answering questions from reporters after the game , Tomlin seemed to rap Villanueva , repeating the claim that the team was looking for 100 participation , Tomlin said , Like I said , I was looking for 100 percent participation , we were gonna be respectful of our football team Apparently , in Tomlin s world , respect for team is over and above respect for someone who risked his life to defend his country According to Fox , Tomlin told the media that , prior to kickoff Sunday , the Steelers held a team meeting and decided , though not unanimously , to not come out of the locker room for the national anthem Tomlin added the intent was to have his team focus on the game and not President Trump s comments blasting players who chose to protest during the playing of The Star Spangled Banner Tomlin said after the game Many of them felt like something needed to be done I asked those guys to discuss it and whatever they discussed that we have 100 percent participation or we do nothing They discussed it for an appropriate length of time and they couldn t come to an understanding , so they chose to remove themselves from it They were not going to be disrespectful in the anthem so they chose not to participate , but at the same time many of them were not going to accept the words of the president Villanueva clearly had a different mentality about what the anthem meant for him Tomlin continued , We re not politicians We re coaches and professional athletes If those of us or individuals choose to participate in politics in some way , I m going to be supportive of that But when we come out of locker rooms , we come out of locker rooms to play football games Villanueva was critical of the Colin Kaepernick , the former 49er who launched the current NFL protest movement In 2016 , Villanueva said , I don t know if the most effective way is to sit down during the national anthem with a country that s providing you freedom , providing you 16 million a year when there are black minorities that are dying in Iraq and Afghanistan for less than 20 , 000 a year I will be the first one to hold hands with Colin Kaepernick and do something about the way minorities are being treated in the United States , the injustice that is happening with police brutality , the justice system , inequalities in pay You can t do it by looking away from the people that are trying to protect our freedom and our country",false

"Cashew nuts are one of the healthiest foods in the world Unfortunately , not many of you know the numerous benefits they offer , and only a very small percentage of the natural medicines comprehensive database is dedicated to them Countries like Nigeria , Tanzania , Mozambique and Brazil are the biggest producers of cashew nuts , mostly due to the fact that they need hot and humid climate in order to grow Health Benefits of Cashew Nuts Cashew nuts are rich in vitamins , soluble dietary fiber , minerals and many phytochemicals that prevent diseases , including cancers Cashews are also rich in calories , about 50 grams of these favorable foods contain 275 calories These beneficial nuts provide numerous essential vitamins , including pantothenic acid or vitamin B5 , pyridoxine or vitamin B6 , thiamin or vitamin B11 and riboflavinThe aforementioned vitamins are crucial for metabolism of fat , protein and carbs at a cellular level On the other hand , niacin improves the protection against pellagra or dermatitis Furthermore , B6 is extremely beneficial for our health for it significantly lowers the chances of developing sideroblastic anemia and homocystinuria Only 3 5 Oz \( 100 gr \) of these nuts provide about 30 of daily recommended levels of B6 \( that s about 0 147 mg \) Moreover , cashews are also rich in essential minerals Some of the most useful minerals found in cashew nuts are potassium , manganese , copper , selenium , magnesium , zinc and iron Only a handful of these nuts on a daily basis can provide the necessary amount of these extremely needed minerals and protect you from deficiency related diseases For instance , copper acts as a co factor for many important enzymes , like superoxide dismutase and cytochrome c oxidase Zinc , on the other hand , plays the same role together with enzymes that are responsible for the regulation of the growth and progress of digestion , gonadal function and DNA synthesis Selenium is a very important micronutrient and it works as a co factor for antioxidant enzymes like Glutathione peroxides , known as one of the strongest antioxidants in human body Monounsaturated fatty acids which are in high quantities in these nuts are extremely good for the heart health , as palmitoleic and oleic acids They belong to the group of essential fatty acids that can increase the level of good HDL cholesterol and decrease the level of harmful LDLcholesterol in our blood In addition , as shown by many scientific studies , the so called Mediterranean diet which is mostly based on monounsaturated fatty acids supports the blood lipid profile , and protect our system from strokes and coronary artery diseases Furthermore , cashews also contain a small quantity of one very important pigment of flavonoid antioxidants , called zeaxanthin , which is selectively absorbed inside the retinal macula in our eyes This pigment provides protective and antioxidant UV ray filtering features , and it also protects from ARMD or age related macular degeneration in old people How Treat Depression Naturally A Basic Guide to Cashew Nutrition Cashew nuts are more than great source of tryptophan , which is a vital amino acid our body needs to take it throughout the food This amino acid helps children develop and grow , regulates mood , balances our behavior , improves sleep and can significantly lower the level of stress , anxiety and depression Just two handfuls of cashews contain somewhere between 1 000 and 2 000 mg of tryptophan This compound has been proven to be as equally successful as prescription antidepressants The best thing about treating depression with cashews is that you will surely avoid side effects that are usually caused by antidepressants Of course , this is yet another thing big pharma carefully hides from us According to FDA Deputy Commissioner for Policy s David Adams , who was part of the Drug Information Association Annual Meeting back in 1993 , we need to pay close attention to the things happening around the legal arena and dietary supplements If producers of natural remedies manage getting the support , there will most likely be a completely new class of products , which will be competing with the already existing drugs This is why we need a special law that will have the function to regulate the supplements In addition , back in 1993 , FDA Dietary Task Force has released a report saying that the selling and existence of dietary supplements will not jeopardize efforts for creating new drugs As you are probably aware by now , big pharma is a huge business However , there is much effective and safer natural depression treatment they want to hide from the common people because thus they will lose lots of money An introduction to Cashew Nut Allergy Beside allergies caused by eating walnuts , almonds and other nuts , cashew nut cause allergy in both adults and children and is one of the commonest food allergies Same as peanuts , cashews can lead to occurrence of some very severe allergic reactions , even if the individual has consumed just a small quantity of cashews The healthy nuts we dedicate this article to are a hidden ingredient in many common foods such as ice cream , cakes and Asian dishes Anyway , if you ever experience symptoms of cashew nut allergy , it is mandatory to look for professional

"GPR55 is a G protein coupled receptor recently shown to be activated by certain cannabinoids and by lysophosphatidylinositol \( LPI \) However , the physiological role of GPR55 remains unknown Given the recent finding that the cannabinoid receptors CB 1 and CB 2 affect bone metabolism , we examined the role of GPR55 in bone biology GPR55 was expressed in human and mouse osteoclasts and osteoblasts expression was higher in human osteoclasts than in macrophage progenitors Although the GPR55 agonists O 1602 and LPI inhibited mouse osteoclast formation in vitro , these ligands stimulated mouse and human osteoclast polarization and resorption in vitro and caused activation of Rho and ERK1 2 These stimulatory effects on osteoclast function were attenuated in osteoclasts generated from GPR55 macrophages and by the GPR55 antagonist cannabidiol \( CBD \) Furthermore , treatment of mice with this non psychoactive constituent of cannabis significantly reduced bone resorption in vivo Consistent with the ability of GPR55 to suppress osteoclast formation but stimulate osteoclast function , histomorphometric and microcomputed tomographic analysis of the long bones from male GPR55 mice revealed increased numbers of morphologically inactive osteoclasts but a significant increase in the volume and thickness of trabecular bone and the presence of unresorbed cartilage These data reveal a role of GPR55 in bone physiology by regulating osteoclast number and function In addition , this study also brings to light an effect of both the endogenous ligand , LPI , on osteoclasts and of the cannabis constituent , CBD , on osteoclasts and bone turnover in vivo The physiological role \( s \) of GPR55 remains unknown Given the apparent role of CB 1 and CB 2 in regulating bone mass , we examined whether GPR55 is expressed by osteoblasts and osteoclasts and whether this receptor regulates bone cell function in vitro and in vivo We present evidence that GPR55 plays a role in bone physiology , with major implications for the development of GPR55 and CBD related therapeutics In some systems such as the vasculature , there is considerable evidence for a role of non CB 1 non CB 2 receptors in mediating some of the effects of certain cannabinoid ligands \( for review , see ref 4 \) Such non CB 1 non CB 2 effects have been observed with a range of cannabinoid ligands including certain endocannabinoids and the phytocannabinoid like compound O 1602 these effects are antagonized by the cannabis constituent cannabidiol \( CBD \) \( 4 \) Recently , the G protein coupled receptor GPR55 has been shown to be activated by O 1602 \( EC 50 13 nM \) and antagonized by CBD \( IC 50 445 nM \) \( 5 8 \) In contrast , these compounds have low affinity \( 5 30 M \) for CB 1 and CB 2 receptors \( 9 , 10 \) GPR55 also is activated by the bioactive lipid , L lysophosphatidylinositol \( LPI \) \( 11 , 12 \) A role for the endocannabinoid system \( 1 \) in the regulation of bone mass has been demonstrated recently , because mice lacking either of the cannabinoid receptors CB 1 or CB 2 have abnormal bone phenotypes Furthermore , cannabinoid receptor agonists and inverse agonists reduce bone loss in mice following ovariectomy and have direct effects on both bone resorbing cells \( osteoclasts \) and bone forming cells \( osteoblasts \) in vitro \( 2 , 3 \) CBD has been estimated to have a half life of 2 5 days in humans \( 15 , 16 \) Treatment of male mice for 8 weeks with 10 mg kg CBD \( 3 times per week \) significantly decreased the level of serum type 1 collagen C terminal telopeptide fragments \( CTX \) , a biochemical marker of bone resorption , by 18 \( P 0 05 \) \( vehicle control 22 47 ng L CBD treated 18 27 ng L \) Microtomographic \( CT \) analysis of the proximal tibiae also revealed a trend toward increased BV TV \( 10 \) and trabecular number \( 10 \) , with a decrease in trabecular separation \( 7 \) , trabecular pattern factor \( 5 \) , and structure modulus index \( 8 \) in the tibia of the CBD treated mice relative to control These findings were consistent with a decrease in bone resorption in CBD treated mice , although these changes were not statistically significant over this treatment schedule Male GPR55 mice also demonstrated a trebling of osteoclast surface and osteoclast number compared with male wild type mice Despite this increase , an impairment in osteoclast function in GPR55 animals was confirmed by measurement of cartilage remnants within the trabecular bone , which revealed a doubling of the cartilage content within the trabecular bone of the secondary spongiosa \( C and Table S1 \) Histologically , osteoclasts in GPR55 bones appeared plump and inactive The presence of unresorbed cartilage also was significantly higher in female GPR55 mice than female wild type mice , suggesting a phenotype similar to but milder than that in the male GPR55 mice In contrast to male GPR55 mice , however , the number of osteoclasts in female GPR55 mice was reduced considerably compared with wild type mice , and no change in trabecular bone volume was observed These differences between male wild type and male GPR55 mice were confirmed by histomorphometric analysis of femoral sections from 12 week old mice \( Table S1 \) In male , but not female , GPR55 mice , trabecular BV TV was increased significantly , and trabecular separation was reduced significantly compared with male wild type mice However , no significant changes were detected in any histomorphometric indices of bone formation , including osteoblast surface , osteoblast number , osteoid surface , osteoid volume , or osteoid thickness In 12 week old male GPR55 mice , bone volume bone volume \( BV \) tissue volume \( TV \) was significantly increased in the tibia and femur compared with wild type littermates , together with a significant increase in trabecular number , trabecular connectivity \( trabecular pattern factor \) , and a transition from rod like to plate like trabecular structure \( structure modulus index \) in the femur \( A and B \) These changes were not seen in female GPR55 mice of the same age No significant changes in cortical bone volume were detected in male or female mice compared with GPR55 mice of the same age Using a pull down assay , treatment of human osteoclasts with O 1602 for 10 min caused an increase in active , GTP bound Rho This effect was prevented by pretreatment of the osteoclasts for 10 min with 1 M of the GPR55 antagonist CBD \( A \) Although LPI showed the same trend toward Rho activation and inhibition of this effect with CBD , this trend did not reach statistical significance ERK phosphorylation in human osteoclasts was increased following treatment with LPI this effect also was prevented by pretreatment with 1 M CBD \( A \) Similarly , O 1602 showed the same trend toward activation of ERK signaling and inhibition of this effect with CBD , but this trend did not reach statistical significance As with human osteoclasts , treatment of mouse osteoclasts with O 1602 or LPI also caused activation of Rho This effect was absent in GPR55 osteoclasts \( B \) Consistent with the effects seen on human osteoclasts , when mouse osteoclasts were treated with O 1602 , we observed a significant increase in the proportion of mouse osteoclasts with F actin rings \( with 1 100 nM O 1602 \) and a significant increase in resorption area \( with 50 nM O 1602 \) \( Fig S5 \) LPI , another GPR55 agonist , also increased the number of polarized , actively resorbing human osteoclasts \( with 100 nM , 242 82 of control P 0 05 \) and increased resorption area \( with 100 nM , 192 61 of control P 0 05 \) \( D and E \) Treatment of human osteoclasts \( cultured on dentine discs for 5 days \) with O 1602 caused an increase in the proportion of polarized , actively resorbing osteoclasts with F actin rings and increased the area of resorption pits on the discs \( A C \) Furthermore the GPR55 antagonist CBD , at a concentration of 500 nM \( similar to the IC 50 value of 445 nM in previous studies \) \( 6 \) , significantly inhibited both the increase in resorption area and the F actin ring number seen after treatment with 50 nM O 1602 alone \( P 0 001 \) \( A C \) This concentration of CBD slightly \( but not significantly \) reduced the basal level of resorption and significantly decreased the number of polarized osteoclasts with F actin rings However , a higher concentration of 1 M CBD alone significantly inhibited both human osteoclast polarization and resorption \( Fig S4 \) Osteoclasts generated from GPR55 bone marrow macrophages \( BMMs \) appeared larger than wild type osteoclasts \( D \) Concentrations of 5 nM to 1 M O 1602 significantly inhibited the formation of multinucleated mouse osteoclasts \( B \) , although the macrophages still seemed to differentiate into tartrate resistant acid phosphatase \( TRAP \) positive mononuclear cells \( D \) This inhibitory effect of O 1602 on multinucleated cell formation was not seen in cultures of GPR55 BMMs \( B and D \) but still occurred in cultures of CB 1 and CB 2 BMMs \( Fig S3 \) Furthermore , the inhibitory effect of O 1602 on multinucleated osteoclast formation did not occur in the presence of 500 nM CBD \( Fig S3 \) Like O 1602 , the GPR55 ligand LPI also inhibited mouse osteoclast formation , an effect that \( as with O 1602 \) was not seen with GPR55 BMMs \( C \) With the use of quantitative PCR , expression of GPR55 mRNA was detected in human osteoclasts generated from macrophage colony stimulating factor \( M CSF \) dependent monocytes The mean GPR55 expression was 8 fold higher in osteoclasts than in monocytes in blood from 7 different healthy blood donors \( Supporting Information \( SI \) Fig S1A \) , and the expression of GPR55 in osteoclasts was similar in males and females the mean ratio of GPR55 GAPDH expression was 0 096 in 3 male donors , 0 068 in 4 female donors Discussion The physiological function of GPR55 is largely unknown Using immunostaining and quantitative PCR , we demonstrate that both human and mouse osteoclasts and osteoblasts express GPR55 and that GPR55 mRNA is present in human monocytic osteoclast precursors but increases during differentiation into mature , multinucleated osteoclasts To investigate the role of GPR55 in osteoclast formation , we used a synthetic GPR55 agonist , O 1602 \( 6 , 13 \) O 1602 significantly inhibited the late stages \( including cell fusion \) of osteoclastogenesis from mouse precursors Although there is evidence that O 1602 can act on additional targets \( 13 \) , in the present study the inhibitory effect of O 1602 on osteoclastogenesis was mediated via GPR55 , because this effect was not observed in BMMs from GPR55 mice but was retained in macrophages from CB 1 and CB 2 mice Consistent with the inhibitory effect of O 1602 on mouse osteoclast formation in vitro , osteoclast number was significantly higher in the long bones from GPR55 mice than in those from wild type mice O 1602 had no effect on the formation of human osteoclasts in vitro It remains unclear why O 1602 inhibited the formation of mouse osteoclasts but not human osteoclasts a possibility is that human osteoclasts already produce higher levels of an endogenous agonist However , consistent with the hypothesis that GPR55 plays some inhibitory role in osteoclastogenesis , the antagonist CBD did increase human osteoclast formation significantly Next , we examined the role of GPR55 in osteoclast function O 1602 had a stimulatory effect on cell polarization and resorption in human osteoclasts that was attenuated in the presence of the GPR55 antagonist CBD Furthermore , treatment with 1 M CBD alone significantly decreased cell polarization and resorption , presumably by antagonizing the effect of GPR55 ligands present in the culture medium or produced endogenously \( such as 2 arachidonoylglycerol , which we recently have shown can be produced by osteoclasts \) \( 17 \) The endogenous GPR55 agonist LPI also stimulated human osteoclast polarization and resorption Both O 1602 and LPI elicited a bell shaped concentration response relationship for these effects on osteoclasts , a typical response of cultured cells to cannabinoids \( 18 \) The stimulatory effect of GPR55 agonists on osteoclasts probably is mediated , at least in part , by activation of the small GTPase Rho \( 6 , 12 , 19 \) , which is known to play important roles in osteoclast polarization and bone resorption \( 20 22 \) We found that treatment of human osteoclasts with O 1602 or LPI caused activation of Rho , an effect that was prevented by pretreatment of osteoclasts with CBD The stimulatory effect of O 1602 and LPI on Rho was mediated via GPR55 , because this effect was absent in mouse osteoclasts derived from GPR55 BMMs compared with osteoclasts from wild type BMMs LPI \( and , to a lesser extent , O 1602 \) also caused activation of ERK in osteoclasts ERK is associated with increased osteoclast activity and survival \( 23 25 \) Although some studies have failed to show that ERK lies downstream of GPR55 \( 19 \) , other studies have demonstrated robust GPR55 mediated ERK activation \( 11 , 26 \) The contradictory nature of these findings may relate to the concept of functional selectivity \( 27 , 28 \) , whereby different signaling pathways \( e g , Rho and ERK \) are activated in an agonist and tissue specific manner \( 8 \) Together , our studies strongly indicate that both Rho and ERK signaling lie downstream of GPR55 in osteoclasts and that GPR55 plays a role in regulating osteoclast function Consistent with the stimulatory effects of GPR55 agonists on both human and mouse osteoclast function in vitro , male GPR55 mice had evidence of decreased bone resorption and an osteopetrotic phenotype Although osteoclast numbers were increased significantly , osteoclast function was impaired , as indicated by increased cartilage remnants within the trabecular bone \( 29 31 \) This impairment in osteoclast function is consistent with our observed effects of O 1602 on osteoclasts in vitro and a role for GPR55 in stimulating osteoclast activity An increase in osteoclast number in the presence of impaired function often is observed in osteopetrotic phenotypes and seems to be a homeostatic response \( 32 \) The reason for the milder bone phenotype in the female GPR55 mice is not yet known , because there were no noticeable differences in GPR55 expression in human osteoclasts derived from males or females It is possible that , in vivo , hormonal differences may play a compensatory role in female GPR55 mice or that males are more susceptible to loss of GPR55 mediated signaling Alternatively , this difference could relate to the higher level of remodeling in wild type female mice compared with males The high bone mass phenotype of the GPR55 mice therefore seems to be predominantly the result of a defect in osteoclast function rather than an increase in osteoblast mediated bone formation , because O 1602 had little effect on the differentiation or mineralization of osteoblasts cultured in vitro , and osteoblast number and osteoblast surface were not altered in the GPR55 mice compared with wild type controls Together , our observations indicate that GPR55 has a necessary role in bone physiology , regulating the formation and particularly the activity of osteoclasts Previous studies have highlighted the involvement of the cannabinoid receptors CB 1 and CB 2 in the local and or central control of bone mass \( 2 , 3 , 33 \) Opinion is divided as to whether endocannabinoids have the ability to act as agonists of GPR55 \( 6 , 11 , 12 , 19 , 26 \) , but our findings introduce the possibility that the effect of certain endocannabinoids on bone cells may be mediated , at least in part , via GPR55 Lysophospholipids play a role in many physiological and pathophysiological processes and now are recognized as extracellular signaling molecules as well as precursors of phospholipid synthesis \( 34 \) We show here that LPI causes activation of ERK and Rho in osteoclasts via GPR55 and hence could play a role in regulating bone resorption in vivo Our observations also suggest that CBD can inhibit bone resorption in vivo via modulation of GPR55 signaling CBD has been shown to be an effective oral anti arthritic therapeutic \( 35 \) The receptor mechanisms underlying these therapeutic effects of CBD are unknown , but our observations clearly indicate that GPR55 has a role in the pharmacology of CBD Recently , GPR55 mice have been shown to be resistant to neuropathic and inflammatory pain \( 36 \) therefore the search for selective GPR55 antagonists for testing in pain models already is underway Our observations suggest that blocking GPR55 also may have direct beneficial effects on bone turnover in arthritic or metabolic bone diseases Finally , although CBD is a major constituent of cannabis , it remains to be determined whether cannabis smoking may increase bone density , because delta 9 tetrahydrocannabinol , another constituent , also is thought to be a GPR55 ligand \( 6 , 19 \) and may oppose the effects of CBD",true
"By Matt MillerTuesday , September 8 , 2009A dangerous sentiment on the left threatens to derail what could be the biggest progressive achievement in half a century It 's the view that any health care reform that does n't include a public option is n't real reform and thus is n't worth doing This mantra has become an article of faith among many Democrats who have n't necessarily thought through the matter but who take their cues from leaders advancing this argument Unless liberals rethink this premise , and fast , Democrats will squander their best chance in a generation to end the scandal of the uninsured , bring health security to every American family and begin the long term process of getting national health costs under control The first fallacy of the public option or nothing mantra is the notion that we 'll never cover everyone without a Medicare style program for Americans under 65 The experiences of Switzerland and the Netherlands prove that this is n't the case Both have pioneered market based universal health care Both cover all their citizens using private insurers , and they do so for much less cost 10 percent of gross domestic product for the Dutch and 12 percent for Switzerland , compared with 17 percent in the United States , where nearly 50 million people are still uninsured Those countries also boast better health outcomes than we do , even when compared to states with similar demographics , such as Connecticut and Massachusetts Sick people in both countries are pursued as customers by private insurers \( rather than shunned , as they are in the United States \) because health plans are paid more for sick enrollees via a government designed system of risk adjustment The Swiss and Dutch achievements are important because conservative critics often act as though fully socialized systems , such as those in Britain and Canada , are the inevitable result of any drive for universal coverage In fact , as these two countries show , it is possible to cover everyone without a big government takeover A related fallacy is that the public option is the most important issue to debate It 's not The central progressive breakthrough in any reform should be to make it possible for every American to access group health coverage outside the employment setting access that does not currently exist but which the proposed insurance exchanges would enable What 's critical , therefore , is the structure of these exchanges and the rules about who would be eligible to use them Such questions have received disturbingly little attention but need to be front and center For example , some legislation proposes barring people who enjoy employer based coverage from seeking insurance from the new exchanges this ban should be scrapped in favor of the proposal offered by Sen Ron Wyden , under which employees could use the cash their companies spend on their benefits to buy coverage they prefer at the exchange I respect those in my party who seek the single payer system into which the public option might eventually evolve But I do n't agree that it 's the best answer for the United States Though single payer has merits , especially in administrative efficiency , it is also likely to freeze in place our fragmented , uncoordinated system of fee for service care It would encourage providers to goose volume \( to boost their incomes \) rather than improve quality and would offer greater rewards for providers of acute care when we need a fresh focus on chronic disease management Single payer also asks government to do things I do n't think it is competent to do , such as setting prices across a large swath of the health sector in ways that seem certain to create damaging rigidities or resource misallocations \( as happens in Medicare \) Finally , if government is the sole payer , provider payments will become even more politicized than they are today On the eve of beneficial innovations in drug therapies , devices and cost effective ways to deliver better care , it is ill advised to make the government 's hand too rigid Private health plans have many flaws , to be sure , but if sensibly regulated they 're likely to respond more nimbly to disperse medical innovations Liberals should make peace with the notion that a regulated market of competing private health plans can be the vehicle for getting everyone covered Yes , it means that unlike some other advanced countries , we 'll have billions of health dollars siphoned off by middlemen and marketers But if liberals think of it as a jobs program , they 'll learn to love it If everyone 's covered and insurer cherry picking is dead , health insurance will come to look more like a regulated utility Those on the left still seeking incentive should consider In 2006 , Sen Ted Kennedy urged Massachusetts Democrats to support Mitt Romney 's plan for universal coverage via a competing system of regulated private insurers , paired with an individual mandate and subsidies for low earners Kennedy knew this would become a model for a bipartisan fix for the country Now , a Kennedy approved model is within reach Liberals , far from resisting it as a setback , should celebrate it as a triumph Matt Miller , a former Clinton White House aide , is a management consultant and the author of The Tyranny of Dead Ideas In recent years he has advised and given paid speeches to doctor groups , hospitals , pharmaceutical firms and insurance companies , as well as to low income advocacy groups promoting universal coverage 2009 The Washington Post Company",true
"By Michael Learmonth learmonth On03 04 15 AT 2 28 PMGeorge R R Martin teased that some of the characters still alive in the books will die in Game of Thrones Season 5 Photo Facebook Game of ThronesHBO is in talks with Apple to make Apple TV a launch partner for its highly anticipated streaming service when it debuts next month HBO and streaming partner Major League Baseball Advanced Media are working to have the standalone service , called HBO Now , ready to launch in April in conjunction with the premiere of the fifth season of Game of Thrones , according to sources familiar with the plan When it launches , consumers will be able to subscribe to HBO Now directly from HBO for the first time , rather than through a cable , satellite or telco TV distributor such as Comcast or Verizon The retail price is expected to be 15 a month when purchased directly from HBO , or about what consumers pay when they order HBO through their cable , satellite or telco provider HBO s corporate parent , Time Warner Inc , will rely on a whole new line of distributors \( e g , Apple TV , Roku , Xbox , PlayStation , Amazon , etc \) to help market HBO Now to an estimated 10 million U S broadband subscribers who do not pay for a cable TV bundle CEO Jeff Bewkes has said the offering could also help reach some of the 70 million cable TV subscribers who do not subscribe to HBO but might if given the opportunity to subscribe online HBO s over the top service has been cast as the biggest challenge yet to the so called cable bundle , in which consumers are required to buy packages of channels , some of which they may never watch One study claimed the service would lead to a 7 percent drop in pay TV subscriptions , as users opt out of cable and opt in to HBO Now Some cable providers , however , such as Cablevision and Cox Communications , have expressed interest in bundling HBO Now with broadband for their own subscribers who don t get cable TV Apple has been most aggressive in courting HBO in a bid to add the service to Apple TV , sources say Apple TV already carries HBO Go for current HBO subscribers , but it may add a second app for HBO Now Apple has spent the past several years negotiating for the rights to offer its own linear TV package in the meantime , HBO Now is seen as an added service to drive adoption of Apple TV While HBO has not confirmed a launch date for HBO Now , internally the target is an April launch , in time for the April 12 debut of Game of Thrones That s an aggressive time frame for Major League Baseball Advanced Media , which is building the back end along with a new front end separate from HBO Go HBO is taking care not to launch HBO Now before it can guarantee that the service will work without some of the technical glitches that plagued HBO Go during last year 's debut of cult fave Game of Thrones The launch of HBO Now will be a milestone for Time Warner s premium TV channel , which has for most of its 42 year history been distributed as an add on to a package of cable channels The Web service will allow HBO to sign on a new group of distribution partners , which it sees as no different than when it added satellite TV and , later , telcos such as Verizon and AT T Each of those distributors pays a wholesale price for HBO and then resells it to consumers for anywhere from 13 to 18 a month Most see HBO as a retention device those who subscribe are less likely to drop service or switch providers HBO and Time Warner declined to comment At 15 a month , HBO Now will be significantly more expensive than Netflix , which ranges from 8 to 12 a month for various levels of service , but cheaper than some were predicting HBO makes the case that it has more original programming than Netflix and a better , more current film library It s a premium product , and it will be priced accordingly , HBO CEO Richard Plepler said during a Time Warner earnings call in February HBO s push to launch HBO Now comes after years of talking about launching an over the top service that bypasses traditional cable TV Understandably , it has been met with some resistance from current distributors , including Time Warner Cable and Comcast , two companies in the midst of a 46 billion merger , according to sources HBO , of course , heard the same misgivings from cable companies when it first added satellite TV providers and then telcos as distributors HBO s strategy is to give early partners a pricing advantage over newer ones it s unclear how this will go over with Apple , which has a track record of squeezing advantageous deals out of media , including the 99 cent single more than a decade ago Bewkes said in December that he saw cord cutting accelerate as pay TV providers dropped subscribers U S pay TV providers lost 125 , 000 subscribers in 2014 , according to Leichtman Research Group At the same time , HBO and Cinemax reported their highest number of new subscribers \( 2 8 million \) in 30 years Among the challenges HBO faces to get HBO Now launched is how to avoid confusion with HBO Go , the service that allows HBO s cable TV subscribers to access it on the Web , smartphones and tablets The two services will have separate log in pages and separate apps , but some cable execs are concerned about customer confusion The explanation might challenge even the best call center employee HBO Go is for TV subscribers to watch their content on devices HBO Now for those who don t subscribe via TV",true

"b'The Apple Watch is a fairly large chunk of gold ! Get ready for the tech press to flip out when Apple announces the retail price for the gold Apple Watch Edition model Apple critics have always roasted the company for selling products that are more expensive than they should be , and they frequently use this as a wedge topic to criticize buyers But the 18 karat gold Apple Watch Edition will set a whole new bar with a sales price of 10 , 000 The funny thing in this case is that Apple is perfectly right to be charging that much ! Do you disagree \? Check out my counterpoint , The Case Against the 10 , 000 Gold Apple Watch EditionGold is ExpensiveLets start with a little backgrounder in gold Everyone has a vague sense that gold is expensive Even rabid Internet trolls have seen the banner ads and heard about that in the news But most people dont understand just how expensive even a little bit of gold is So this is a good place to begin the discussion Update My calculations were wrong ! Also , this was a bit back of the envelope Now that it has some readership I realize I should go back and fix the calculations in the article to be more realistic Here are the basic facts Gold currently sells for between 1 , 200 and 1 , 300 per troy ounce and has been over 1 , 000 per troy ounce for the last five years 18 karat gold contains 75 pure gold , and that term is regulated by law One ounce of 18k gold occupies about 1 8 cubic centimeters of volume since a typical 18 karat gold alloy weighs about 16 5 grams per cc 18 karat gold currently sells for 29 11 per gram , 905 per troy ounce , or 480 per cc 25 cc of 18k gold is about enough to construct a watch buckle and 75 cc gets you a deployant clasp It takes a few more to build a watch case , anywhere from 1 5 to 8 cc depending on the size and thickness of the case So the buckle is worth 120 360 and the watch case 720 to 3800 just as raw gold This is why gold watches generally sell for a lot more than 6 , 000 ! Gold Watches are ExpensiveLets apply this to a watch case Imagine you wanted to create a rectangular case 42 mm high by 36 mm wide by 10 mm deep If it was solid , this would equal 15 12 cc of volume But its a watch case , so you have to leave room for the movement , dial , case back , etc So lets just leave 5 mm of thickness all around , making a hollow rectangle This equals 6 8 cc \( 42 x 36 x 10 32 x 26 x 10 \) Therefore , the raw gold to make just the case of this hypothetical watch would cost 3 , 200 as of this writing A simple 42x36x10 mm rectangle of 5 mm thick 18 karat gold would cost more than 3 , 200Now lets consider the same shape but just 2 mm thick Thats 2 9 cc of gold , worth 1 , 400 Pick your thickness and youre still looking at thousands of dollars worth of gold How does this translate in the real world \? Lets look at the retail price of some watches that are available in both stainless steel and 18 karat gold This Cartier Tank MC is 15 , 000 more in 18k goldThe Cartier Tank MC measures 44 mm by 34 mm by 9 5 mm thick 15 , 000 extra \( list \) for 18k goldCartier Tank MC in stainless steel 7 , 000 list , 5 , 800 streetCartier Tank MC in 18k pink gold 22 , 000 list , 18 , 200 streetThe Jaeger LeCoultre Reverso Squadra Hometime measures 50 5 mm by 34 9 mm by 14 mm thick 14 , 750 extra \( list \) for 18k goldJaeger LeCoultre Reverso Squadra Hometime in stainless steel 8 , 550 list , 6 , 800 streetJaeger LeCoultre Reverso Squadra Hometime in 18k pink gold 23 , 300 list , 18 , 400 streetThis list could go on and on , but the gist is simple 18 karat gold cases cost a lot more than stainless steel In fact , its pretty much impossible to find a gold watch for under 10 , 000 in any size and from any manufacturer Even tiny quartz ladies watches like the tiny Chopard Happy Sport Mini sells for 11 , 000 ! Most of the bargains commenters have pointed to are either 14 karat or less , very slim and small , or long out of production and with outdated pricing Then theres the bracelet Swap a gold bracelet for a leather strap and you are looking at an extra 20 , 000 Adding a gold bracelet to that Jaeger LeCoultre bumps the price to 42 , 900 ! Certainly there is quite a bit of profit in luxury watches , but one simply cannot deny the raw material value in a gold watch case And the gold market is liquid like stocks and other commodities There are plenty of buyers and sellers of gold , and plenty of reserves , so no company , no matter how strong , can expect favorable pricing from their suppliers Another reason companies charge so much for gold watches and jewelry is as a hedge against volatility They cant price near the commodity price because they have to set a price and stick to it all year long So they generally price somewhat higher than they would , even taking into consideration all the rest of the materials , labor , distribution , and profit in a watch The Apple Watch Edition Will Cost 10 , 000Theres a reason I picked those two watches for my comparisons Both are similar in size and shape to the 42 mm Apple Watch The Cartier is a little smaller and the Jaeger LeCoultre is a little larger , but both represent a traditional watchmakers gold cased square ish offering in the space And both cost more than 20 , 000 , with much of that price going to the gold case and matching buckle And Jony Ive recently said that the historic Cartier Tank was one of his inspirations for the Apple Watch design ! Apple would be crazy to sell the Apple Watch Edition for 20 , 000 , though Thats not going to happen So theyre likely to find ways to reduce the cost dramatically First , as we can see , the Apple Watch case is highly rounded in all three dimensions Although questionable from an esthetic standpoint , this reduces the amount of material required by quite a lot Second , Apple Watch has a large sapphire crystal front and back with the display , sensors , and such Third , the interior frame is likely made of steel or aluminum , not gold , to reduce cost and increase commonality with the aluminum and steel versions Could it be gold plated \? No Numerous reports state that it is a solid gold case Although Apple has not apparently used the word , solid in their press releases , they do claim it is crafted from 18 karat gold and nowhere does it say it is plated or gold filled \( the industry term \) There are laws covering descriptions of metal content for jewelry and Apple cannot break these any more than Tiffany could Apple says that the Apple Watch will start at 349 for that aluminum Sport model , and many bloggers have reported the price for the steel Apple Watch to be roughly 1 , 000 It is reasonable to assume that the gold Edition model will sell for substantially more than this , with many suggesting 4 , 000 or 5 , 000 But remember that this price would only cover 4 or 5 ounces of gold ! Even with thin walls and a steel frame , its hard to see how Apple could make a solid 18 karat gold case and buckle for a 42 mm watch with just 3 ounces of gold Gold is soft , but Apple claims that their special gold is twice as hard as standard gold Taking that at face value , perhaps they reduced the thickness of the case commensurately , cutting the amount of gold in half versus a standard rectangular watch This still leaves a few thousand dollars of material value in the case The Apple Watch Edition will come in 38 mm and 42 mm sizes , a difference of about 20 in terms of case volume So the smaller model could sell for 20 less still My prediction is that the 42 mm Apple Watch Edition will retail for 9 , 999 with the 38 mm Apple Watch Edition retailing for 7 , 999 This covers the cost of the gold case , the internals , manufacturing , sales , and profit , and yet does not leave Apple subsidizing the world gold market by selling at a discount or cheating with a too thin or plated case I will be shocked if the price is 4 , 999 , but I suppose its possible with some finagling and if thats the smaller model And it will not be any less than that This is a 10 , 000 productBonus prediction Given the very high price of the Apple Watch Edition , I predict that availability will be quite limited Apple will likely create special store within a store spaces in certain Apple Store locations for the Edition I further expect them to open special standalone Apple Edition Boutiques to sell the Watch Edition , accessories , and perhaps other future high end products Update ! Needless to say , many people disagree with me And now that Gruber Fireballed this post , I imagine Ill hear from lots of them real soon ! The gist of the disagreement lies in the amount of gold needed for the watch case I assumed it would be quite thick \( read sturdy \) and would contain upwards of 130 grams of 18k gold Then theres the strap lugs and buckle which would likely contain another few dozen grams But GAK PDX \( and others , though he was most visually eloquent \) suspects it contains much less gold For fun , I took my Apple Watch models and used SW and some basic assumptions to figure the gold content 29 16g pic twitter com WGEnjtj1Yh Greg Koenig \( gak pdx \) February 19 , 2015I think this number is way too low , but its a good lower bound if the case was very thin and completely hollow And it puts the raw gold at about 849 at 29 11 per gram of 18k gold Although this is admittedly much , much lower than my estimate , it still illustrates my point that the Apple Watch Edition is not going to be cheap And I think hes way off but time will tell who is right and who is wrong Another argument is based on this 2006 analysis of a gold Rolex watch Right off the bat one should point out that gold cost 400 oz when it was written and that watch includes a gold bracelet as well , something Apple is apparently not going to do with the Edition That Rolex case contained 18 5 grams of gold alloy , but its much , much smaller than the Apple watch and its circular to boot ! A 34mm circle is 107mm in circumference , while the 42mm Apple Watch is 156mm in circumference Use the magic of math to scale the Rolex up into a 42mm rectangle and were at 27 75 grams But that case is also much thinner since we excluded the bezel , and the Apple Watch is pretty slab sided So we can probably double this safely and come out with 1 , 615 of gold in my mangled square Rolex case So there are lower estimates than mine for the amount and value of the gold I can accept that But lets take a step back and think about the final price Even if it contained less than 1 , 500 of gold , how much would it sell for \? Certainly not 2 , 000 or 3 , 000 You still have to account for the cost of everything else , plus the intangibles of manufacturing and distribution And profit for Apple \( and a hedge against the volatility of the price of gold \) So were back at the 4 , 000 5 , 000 estimate others have made As Greg Koenig tweeted , and Forbes reported , If anyone thinks Apple is charging less than 5k for the Edition , they are smoking crack Regardless of the total , its important to realize that the price of gold is in the drivers seat when it comes to pricing the Apple Watch Edition Id love to be wrong , and I look forward to updating this piece Thanks for reading !

If the world were round , believe me , I would know ! The comments came in response to a question from AP reporter , Charles Darr , regarding the future role of the National Guard , as private companies proliferate space travel Mr Trump , if elected , are you willing to increase taxes in order to meet the growing budget demands of the National Guard , as existential threats from our enemies grow along with the advancement of space travel technology \? Darr asked The presidential hopeful replied that such a future is nonsense , adding that the round earth people , and you know who they are , these people have an agenda It s all on the Internet , it s there After declaring that the world is flat , Mr Trump , as he has done before , again cited the Internet as his primary source of information There are people out there , many people , and I mean missile experts , sailors , you name it , folks , and this is what they re saying It s all on the Internet , it s there The The flat earth conspiracy theory , like most conspiracy theories , is propagated primarily via the Internet Internet forums and YouTube channels are dedicated to enlightening the vast majority who , as truthers explain , naively buy into the globe earth theory that has been sold to them since birth One piece of evidence that flat earth truthers present as proof that there is a global conspiracy against them , is the emblem used by the One piece of evidence that flat earth truthers present as proof that there is a global conspiracy against them , is the emblem used by the United Nations , implying that the intergovernmental organization is part of the conspiracy In it , the planet is displayed as a flat earth , with the northern pole at the center , and southern hemisphere continents stretched out toward the circumference , just as the planet really is , according to truthers Flat earth model designed by evangelical minister , WIlbur Glenn Voliva , 1931 United Nations Emblem In April , after stating that he is In April , after stating that he is open to allowing Japan and South Korea to develop nuclear weapons to alleviate the financial costs of the United States role as policemen to the world , Trump also suggested minimizing the authority of the United Nations By the way , United Nations , Trump said , same thing , smaller numbers In now deleted tweets , Trump also seemingly offered Biblical evidence of a flat earth Book of Matthew , folks , the devil took him to a very high mountain , very high , and what did he do \?

"Boston Marathon Bomber Tsarnaev Severely Injured In Prison , May Never Walk Or Talk AgainPosted on Like 0FORT DEVENS , Massachusetts Infamous Boston Marathon bombing suspect Dzhokhar Tsarnaev , 22 , was the victim of an unfortunate accident yesterday at Ft Devens Detention Center in Massachusetts , just a few short months after his high profile trial and sentencing , according to warden Paul Jacobson Corrections officers reportedly found the terror suspect face down in a pool of his own blood in his cell a banana peel was found on the floor nearby It initially appeared as though Tsarnaev slipped on a discarded banana peel and hit the floor with such force that his head bounced off the hard tile surface , probably 16 or 17 times There was blood everywhere all over the walls , the floor , even the toilet The injuries have caused massive brain trauma , said prison investigator Joe Goldsmith We determined though , through expert analysis , that it would be impossible for these injuries to have occurred through a fall Our investigation has shown that that it was the Aryan Brotherhood who initiated an attack on Tsarnaev Yes , it was the brotherhood who took care of that bomber , said Miles Smith , head of the Aryan Nation inside Devens The other gangs , they wanted him , too We paid the guards the most money to have a shot They stood aside , and let us do what we do On the way out , they shook our hands , told us Thank you Well , You re welcome You re welcome , Boston You re welcome , America ! Normally , an attack this violent , this cruel , on another inmate would get any offending party more time added to their sentence , said warden Jacobson Because of the nature of Tsarnaev s crimes , though , we have decided to actually reduce the sentences of the Aryan members who were involved They have done our prison and our country a great service , and we appreciate it immensely They are heroes in the eyes of not only this institution , but also in the eyes of the people of the Commonwealth of Massachusetts Tsarnaev had pled not guilty to all thirty charges filed against him , but was found guilty on all counts in April He was sentenced to the death penalty per the crimes committed",false

"GIFT IDEASMark Zuckerberg Disgusted With Social Media Set To Leave Facebook Later This Year \( ET , Tuesday , March 14 , 2017 \) Mark Zuckerberg helped to create a whole new world when he unveiled Facebook in 2004 Barely 20 years old , the fresh faced college student knew he had something special with his technological find But even this genius had no way to predict how Facebook would change the world Now , just 17 years later , this 32 year old billionaire is ready to give it all up \? Why \? According to those closest to the developer , Zuckerberg is disgusted with the way the public has used and abused the platform He wanted to create a way for people to connect not tear them apart , explained one colleague Since its inception , Facebook has enjoyed a wild ride of success With more than 1 2 billion people logging on every single day , one would think that Zuckerberg fulfilled his dream of global connection But , according to friends and coworkers , that wasn t at all what Zuckerberg had in mind when he and a group of friends built the concept \( and the reality \) of the famous site back in their Harvard dormitory What Mark wanted most was to bring the world together It s not good enough if it brings along some people and leaves others behind And when it comes to using the platform he created to bully or disparage others , Zuckerberg is completely disgusted He hates the way some users utilize the platform to bring others down or even to circulate false accounts of events or history While Facebook itself begins a new chapter in harnessing its platform for the betterment of society , focusing on remaking the site in order to offer global connectedness while fighting isolationism and social ills Although a manifesto recently released by Zuckerberg himself outlines a long term plan by his company to revamp the site and focus on social infrastructure for the community for supporting us , for keeping us safe , for informing us , for civic engagement , and for inclusion of all , many behind the scenes say that the Facebook founder has no intention of being a part of the changes and will announce his exit from Facebook in the coming months Since marrying wife Priscilla Chan M D , in 2012 , Zuckerberg has discovered a new passion for eradicating disease and living a healthier lifestyle A pediatrician who specializes in childhood disease , Chan convinced her husband last year to fund the Chan Zuckerberg initiative , whose main focus is health and education The initiative has also cited a long term goal of working towards eradicating all disease by the end of the 21st century Zuckerberg wants to focus on helping peopleThe daughter of Chinese refugees , Chan is a big believer in Traditional Chinese Medicine and holistic health regimes She believes that western medicine is incomplete , only striving to treat illness , rather than get to its root cause and cure it Using a combination of traditional healthcare approaches that date back centuries , in conjunction with modern technology and understanding of disease , Chan and Zuckerberg hope to find cures for thousands of disease now plaguing our society While working so hard to find the key to unlocking the answers to curing disease in our lifetime , Zuckerberg and Chan discovered something they hadn t expected the fountain of youth While investigating several all natural holistic remedies for curing skin cancer , Chan stumbled across a new way to care for the skin While it may not have been the cancer answer she sought , Chan did learn that the ingredients her researchers were using did seem to push back the hands of time , making the skin look younger , smoother and healthier Mark and wife Priscilla are embarking on a joint business ventureEnthralled by the discovery , Chan put a team of researchers on the case , seeing how much they could learn about these all natural ingredients It took them months , but what they ultimately invented was amazing creams and lotions that can strip away decades of skin damage , returning the skin to a more youthful state Those who initially used the cream reported looking 10 15 years younger in less than a month ! Understanding the full implications of their discovery , Chan quickly patented the invention and talked to her husband about funding the new project Not really interested in the attention putting their names on the product would create \( after all , they wanted this product to speak for itself \) , the couple decided to release their new skin car line without their name or their endorsement So what is this amazing skin care line \?

"Say Oregon Reps Peter DeFazio and Earl Blumenauer are socialists who are openly serving in the U S Congress Bloggers on Friday , August 12th , 2011 in web pagesBloggers claim Peter DeFazio and Earl Blumenauer are socialistsBy Charles Pope on Monday , August 29th , 2011 at 5 03 p m Bloggers are spreading a list of so called socialists in Congress Democratic Rep Peter DeFazio has been called a lot of things over his 12 terms in Congress hot head , visionary , renegade , principled , effective and determined Now , if a burst of activity on websites and blogs in recent weeks is to be believed , DeFazio is something else a socialist And he s not alone The posts , all of which piggyback from a single offering that has been replicated on dozens of websites in recent weeks , says there are 70 card carrying Socialists in the House of Representatives , including Rep Earl Blumenauer , another Democrat from Oregon \( The number actually varies Some posts say 70 while others insist it s either 73 or 76 One post used both 76 and 75 in the same entry \) An Aug 12 post on the website for a group called Sovereign Citizens United mentions DeFazio and Blumenauer by name It also says this I m sure if you asked random people on the street if we had open socialists in the US Congress , they would say well only Bernie Sanders \( Senate \) But the right answer is much , much worse This should come as a surprise to absolutely no one , says an Aug 16 post on ConservativeByte com The radical Marxist progressives \( communists \) took control of the Democrat party some time ago They ve only become more emboldened with the election of Barack Obama , who was raised as a communist from birth In case you miss the point , the post comes equipped with a large and very bright hammer and sickle emblem While most of the names politicians are called are opinions , calling a congressman a Socialist sounds both emphatic and exact , which always gets our attention here at PolitiFact Oregon Another thing that gets our attention is when a claim gets spread far and wide This one meets that test , too Here s a blog post on Aug 17 by Texas radio host Dan Cofall , whose show airs out of Fort Worth The magic number 70 is the number of members of the 111th Congress who are members of the Democratic Socialists of America \( DSA \) These are not just politicians who vote left of center these are card carrying members of The Democratic Socialists of America Cofall did not respond to an email asking for comment And we couldn t reach anyone from ConservativeByte Before we get to our ruling , let s begin with some basics Congress resets itself every two years , which means the current edition is the 112th Congress , not the 111th Why does that matter \? Because the new Congress that begins in January every two years always follows an election and some of the people on the list are no longer in office Cofall acknowledges this but then continues to list names from the 111th Congress anyway Those listed as card carrying socialists who are no longer serving include Robert Wexler \( Florida \) , Phil Hare \( Illinois \) , John Hall \( New York \) , Alan Grayson \( Florida \) , and Neil Abercrombie \( Hawaii \) Then there s this Real card carrying Socialists say those members , including DeFazio and Blumenauer , aren t Socialists The list that Cofall and dozens more rely upon is completely fraudulent , said Frank Llewellyn , who served as national director of the Democratic Socialists of America for 10 years until stepping down July 5 There is not one member of Congress who is a formal member of the DSA , Llewellyn said In order to join , a person must fill out a form and pay dues Even Vermont Sen Bernie Sanders , a self described democratic socialist , is not a formal member of the DSA , Llewellyn said The last member of Congress who was an actual card carrying member , he said , was California Democratic Rep Ron Dellums , who served 28 years in the House until leaving in 1998 Llewellyn and DSA s new national director , Maria Svart are chagrined for two reasons First , they have to spend time knocking down reports that never seem to go away Second , Llewellyn said , if we had formal political relationships with 70 odd members , we would be making a lot more money from dues For the record , both DeFazio and Blumenauer say they ve never been associated with the Democratic Socialists of America This is another made up Internet rumor that has no merit , DeFazio said I am a proud Democrat who has taken many independent stands over the years I am anti so called free trade , pro American jobs , pro infrastructure investment , pro fair taxation , anti amnesty , pro balanced budget amendment , pro Wall Street re regulation , and pro audit the Pentagon and Federal Reserve I am an Oregonian and an independent thinker Blumenauer was equally annoyed No matter which side of the political aisle it comes from , this kind of name calling and rhetoric represents exactly what is wrong with our democracy today , he said Rather than bringing people together to solve our nation 's problems , it spreads false and divisive allegations throughout the media and the public It is a major distraction from the real work that needs to get done Bad information gets spread all the time But where did the number , or numbers , come from \? The list purported to have originated with the DSA says this on page two Q How many members of the U S Congress are also members of the DSA \? A SeventyIt then lists them by name What it does not say is that the names are simply lifted en masse from the membership of the Congressional Progressive Caucus , a collection of liberal leaning lawmakers that includes DeFazio and Blumenauer but officially , not a single socialist According to its website , the Progressive Caucus is one of the largest in Congress and works for such causes as economic justice , civil rights and civil liberties as well as global peace and security Llewellyn said that DSA supports some of the policy positions of the caucus Voicing support for positions embraced by a group of lawmakers is a routine part of business on Capitol Hill and is employed by organizations as disparate as the U S Chamber of Commerce , the National Rifle Association and NORML , a group devoted to legalizing the use of marijuana But agreeing with some positions doesn t make a member of Congress a card carrying Socialist Llewellyn says similar accusations of Socialism \( with a capital S \) have surfaced every election year since 1991 when the Progressive Caucus was created There s nothing we can do to stop it , Llewellyn said I can t tell you the number of times we ve tried to stop it Misinformation and smear campaigns also are part of political life But these persistent claims about socialists are riddled with errors and outright lies Any one of the problems would be sufficient to discredit the report , but taken together , the effort is flagrantly false For that reason , we rate this claim Pants on Fire",false
"From a letter written in 1905 by Friedrich Trump , Donald Trump s grandfather , to Luitpold , prince regent of Bavaria Trump had been ordered to leave Bavaria for failing to complete mandatory military service and to register his initial emigration to the United States twenty years earlier Prince Luitpold rejected Trump s request for repatriation the family later settled in New York Translated from the German by Austen Hinkley Most Serene , Most Powerful Prince Regent !

While your drugstore charges you less for a generic drug than a brand name version , that price difference is nothing compared to the markup most druggists place on the generics Your pharmacy most likely paid a wholesale price of only pennies for that generic medicine They then charge you a markup of 3 , 000 , 4 , 000 , even 5 , 000 or more , pocketing most of your savings Action News blew the whistle right here 18 months ago on this practice that has been a secret in the retail pharmacy business far and wide for a long , long time Who s paying sky high prices \? People who can least afford to get ripped off the elderly , the unemployed , and everybody who has to pay for their prescription medicine out of their own pocket HOW DO THE DRUG STORES EXPLAIN IT \? When Channel 7 Chief Investigator Steve Wilson looked at this story 18 months ago , Heritage Sav Mor Drugs in Allen Park was just one of many pharmacies raking in windfall profits every time a cash customer bought generic Prozac , the popular anti depression drug Gregory Papp of Heritage Sav Mor explained the markups this way It s almost a necessity to keep things on an independent basis running You pay 2 16 and you sell it for 92 ! explained Steve Wilson , noting Prozac prices It s not right , admitted Papp And now , as then , the big drug chains like CVS , Walgreens and Rite Aid are still pocketing some of the biggest profit margins in town That s right , at CVS the cost of generic Prozac is marked up at least 56 times what the drug cost wholesale It is a 5 , 594 markup And in our survey of more than a dozen popular generic drugs , CVS leads the pack with average markups of 1 , 436 Walgreen s is not far behind at 1 , 341 and Rite Aid markups on generics average 1 , 183 The stores and their trade group insist their prices just reflect the costs of doing business on what sometimes seems like every corner in town Steve Wilson took the issue to Kurt Proctor , Vice President of the Association of Chain Drug Stores Explain to me why it s necessary to take an 82 \? product and mark it up to 46 69 \? You have to mark it up 5 , 500 to meet your costs to make a profit \?

Now you can t tell me the difference in overhead between this place and that place justifies that kind of difference , noted Steve Wilson No it doesn t It doesn t , Levin answered And I can t explain to you why he wants to charge that price I know what I want to do and what I feel like doing and my commitment to people in this neighborhood is maybe a higher commitment than what he has THE STORY OF THE STATE REP State Rep Stephen Ehardt \( R Lexington \) owns four drugstores up in Michigan s thumb region And as the chairman of the state House Committee on Health Policy , he s working now to formulate a new law to protect Michigan pharmacies from what they see as unfair competition from out of state mail order drug companies Ehardt publicly deplores price gouging I think anytime a pharmacy price gouges an individual , it s wrong At your own pharmacies , are you pricing these generic medicines with high profit margins like the ones I m talking about \? questioned Wilson The Representative s response What we re doing at our pharmacies is charging a very low , very competitive , price to our customers Actually , the prices at Ehardt s pharmacies are not very low And , many would argue , not very fair At all four Ehardt Pharmacies , the markup on a dozen generic drugs averaged more than 1 , 000 The markup was as much as 1 , 357 at one of his locations So what is the lawmaker doing to protect consumers \?

"HOUSTON The city of Dickinson , Texas , is requiring applicants for Hurricane Harvey rebuilding funds to certify in writing that they will not take part in a boycott of Israel The American Civil Liberties Union criticized the city s condition as a violation of free speech rights The First Amendment protects Americans right to boycott , and the government cannot condition hurricane relief or any other public benefit on a commitment to refrain from protected political expression , said ACLU of Texas Legal Director Andre Segura Dickinson s requirement is an egregious violation of the First Amendment , reminiscent of McCarthy era loyalty oaths requiring Americans to disavow membership in the Communist party and other forms of subversive activity The city s website says that it is accepting applications from individuals and businesses for grants from money donated for hurricane relief The application says that by signing it , the Applicant verifies that the Applicant \( 1 \) does not boycott Israel and \( 2 \) will not boycott Israel during the term of this Agreement The city appears to be enforcing a recently passed Texas law that requires all state contractors to certify that they are not participating in boycotts of Israel While the ACLU does not take a position on boycotts of foreign countries , the organization has long supported the right to participate in political boycotts and has voiced opposition to laws and bills and that infringe on the right to boycott The Supreme Court ruled decades ago that political boycotts are protected by the First Amendment , and other decisions have established that the government may not require individuals to sign a certification regarding their political expression in order to obtain employment , contracts , or other benefits On October 11 , the ACLU filed a federal lawsuit challenging a Kansas law on behalf of a high school math teacher who is being required by the state to sign to certify that she won t boycott Israel if she wants to take part in a teacher training program In July , the ACLU sent a letter to members of Congress opposing a bill that would make it a felony to support certain boycotts of companies doing business in Israel and its settlements in the occupied Palestinian territories As a result , Senate sponsors of the bill are considering changes",true
"ICE Agent Commits Suicide in NYC Leaves Note Revealing Gov't Plans to Round up DISARM Americans During Economic Bank Collapse After writing a lengthy suicide note exposing terrifying plans the government has for American citizens , a US Customs Agent walked onto a pier in NYC and blew his brains out Sources inside the New York City Police Department have revealed to SuperStation95 , the contents of a suicide note found on the body and they are utterly frightening The note , which says it was written over the course of a full week in advance , outlines why the officer chose to shoot himself The America I grew up in , and cherished , has been murdered by its own federal government Our Constitution has become meaningless and our laws politicized so badly , they are no longer enforced except for political purposes the note said Our elected officials are , to a person , utterly corrupt and completely devoid of any love or respect for the country which pays them To them , everything is about getting and keeping power , and making illicit money from backroom deals The 42 year old U S Immigration and Customs Enforcement deportation officer shot himself with a 40 caliber service pistol inside Pier 40 in Hudson River Park at around 11 am \( 1 \) A source at the scene described how the officer calmly walked into the park , took out his pistol and shot himself in the head A ICE federal agent fatally shot himself in the head at waterfront Chelsea park \( pictured \) in New York Friday The 42 year old worked as U S Immigration and Customs Enforcement deportation officer and his offices were nearby to the scene of the shooting He was rushed to Lenox Hill Hospital but doctors were unable to save him \( 2 \) ICE released a statement Friday afternoon 'Tragically , a U S Immigration and Customs Enforcement \( ICE \) deportation officer from the New York field office suffered a self inflicted gunshot wound and has passed away ' It added 'The agency is not releasing further details pending notification of the officer 's next of kin According to the suicide note , the Officer said I was hired to enforce the law to capture and deport people who come to this country against our laws But now , if I dare to do that , I face being suspended or fired because our President refuses to faithfully execute the duties of his office Instead , I come to work each day , and collect a paycheck twice a month , for intentionally doing little to nothing I cannot and will not be party to this fraud to this usurpation of the law , or to the despicable politicians betraying our nation the note continued ICE 's Office of Professional Responsibility is reviewing the matter and coordinating with the New York Police Department on the investigation The agent worked at a field office in lower Manhattan , just blocks away from the scene of the shooting MENTIONS FEMA CAMPS FOR AMERICANS \( 3 \) In the suicide note , the officer revealed what he claimed are terrifying plans the feds have been finalizing If the American people knew what this government is planning , they would rise up and overthrow it If I or anyone else in the federal government revealed what is coming , we would be killed anyway , so now I will reveal what I know We in federal law enforcement have been drilling for several years to control riots and uprisings from a coming financial collapse and widespread bank failures The drills involve life sized images of American men , even women and children , whom we are told to shoot for practice and to get used to it We have been told that the economy is terminally ill and will fail in 2016 We are also told the banks are all insolvent and the FDIC does n't have nearly enough funds to bail out depositors We are told these events are unavoidable and it is imperative that the government survive when people rise up over this When the collapse takes place , detention camps created under the FEMA REX 84 program in the 1980 's to house illegal aliens whom we were going to deport , will instead be used to imprison American Citizens whom the government feels constitute a threat American citizens will be rounded up without warrants and imprisoned without trial for God knows how long These camps have been equipped to carry out Hitler scale killings ! An actual purge of Americans citizens by the very government which they , themselves , created and pay for ! I cannot be party to this The Note goes on to say talk about state level national guard being disarmed by the feds \( 4 \) and over 1 Billion rounds of ammunition purchased by the feds \( 5 \) and the Military over deployed and being shrunk \( 6 \) The government knows the military will rise up to stop this , so our military is being deployed overseas , intentionally involved in foreign fights , and deliberately shrunk in size so they cannot be here or help Americans ! This is why certain ammunition and weaponry has been removed from state level National Guard Armories and over a Billion rounds of hollow point ammunition has been bought by the federal government The states themselves have been disarmed of military grade firepower so they cannot defend themselves from the federal activities This is also why local police departments have been militarized and provided with armored vehicles and weapons of war the note says When the inevitable collapse begins to take place , electric power to the entire country will be shut off , as will all forms of communication All banks will be immediately closed no one will be able to get any money because all ATM 's will be offline Credit , Debit and EBT cards will not function Anyone without cash will have no way to get any The Emergency Alert System will be used to takeover all broadcast stations and tell the public this is a result of a cyber attack But while the American people patiently await things to get back to normal , the government will unleash round ups of citizens they deem militants or dangerous With all civilian communications out , and all TV and radio stations taken over by the Emergency Alert System , by the time word spreads of what is taking place , the government will already have the upper hand Federal Prisoners to be GASSED TO DEATH The note goes into a wide array of very specific plans and does so in extremely specific detail about what the feds are allegedly planning For instance , it talks about federal prisons Every federal prison has been outfitted with lethal gas systems When things go bad , all prisoners in all prisons will be placed in their cells on lock down Prison staff will depart the facility , and a certain designated person will trigger a lethal gas system All federal prisoners , regardless of their crime or their sentence , will be gassed to death in their cells Once the gas clears , the dead will be removed and the prisons will then be used to house citizens who fight against the federal onslaught PRIESTS RECRUITED TO QUELL OPPOSITION \( 7 \) The note makes mention about Priests , Rabbis and Clerics from various religious denominations having been recruited and trained to quell resistance So intent is the government to succeed they have recruited priests , rabbis and clerics from various religions to quote appropriate Scriptures about obeying government They are being trained to tell people not to fight back and that their best hope is to pray EXECUTIVE ORDER 13603 \( 8 \) The suicide note goes to great lengths about Executive Order 13603 signed by President Obama on March 16 , 2012 The note details Executive order 13603 about National Defense Resources Preparedness This 10 page document is a blueprint for a federal takeover of the economy Specifically , Obama s plan involves seizing control of All commodities and products that are capable of being ingested by either human beings or animals All forms of energy All forms of civil transportation All usable water from all sources Health resources drugs , biological products , medical devices , materials , facilities , health supplies , services and equipment Forced labor \( or induction as the executive order delicately refers to military conscription \) Moreover , federal officials would issue regulations to prioritize and allocate resources SuperStation95 took a look at this Executive Order from the Government Printing Office \( GPO \) SuperStation95 took a look at this Executive Order from the Government Printing Office \( GPO \) web site and , sure enough , everything contained in the Officer 's suicide note about this Executive Order is true ! To be sure , much of this language has appeared in national security executive orders that previous presidents have issued periodically since the beginning of the Cold War But more than previous national security executive orders , Obama s 13603 seems to describe a potentially totalitarian regime obsessed with control over everything Obama s executive order makes no effort to justify the destruction of liberty , no effort to explain how amassing totalitarian control would enable government to deal effectively with cyber sabotage , suicide bombings , chemical warfare , nuclear missiles or other possible threats There s nothing in executive order 13603 about upholding the Constitution or protecting civil liberties In what circumstances , one might ask , would a president try to carry out this audacious plan \? Executive order 13603 says with ominous ambiguity during the full spectrum of emergencies DATABASE OF PREPPERS The suicide note touches on the subject of Preppers We in federal law enforcement have also been told that the government has a full database of all so called Preppers Those people will be dealt with first by armed federal agents coming to take their guns , then their food stocks , so food can be re distributed as the government sees fit If the dead Officer 's claims about an unavoidable economic and banking collapse are true , would it then follow that the Executive Order put in place by Obama , might be activated \? Would all of us find ourselves in forced labor , while the government takes OUR food and re distrubutes it under the Executive Order 's paragraph about allocating resources \? This is terrifying stuff ! There is much more to the suicide note and SuperStation95 is considering how much more to publish As such , this is a developing story and readers should check back for further updates THESE COULD SIMPLY BE INSANE RAMBLINGS It is not our intent to cause panic or alarm and while we expect readers to be intelligent enough to discern this on their own , we feel compelled to point out that these could simply be paranoid ramblings of an insane person who killed himself On the other hand , these could also be revelations by a person who was so distraught over the ugly truth , that he killed himself We at SuperStation95 just do n't know We urge everyone to stay calm , think rationally , and decide whether or not to take any action to prepare , in case this person 's suicide note is telling the truth SOURCING CORROBORATION \( 1 \) ICE Agent Suicide in NYC \( 1 \) ICE Agent Suicide in NYC NY Daily News \( 2 \) Taken to Lenox Hill Hospital \( 2 \) Taken to Lenox Hill Hospital NY Post \( 3 \) REX 84 FEMA CAMPS \( 3 \) REX 84 FEMA CAMPS Wikipedia \( 4 \) National Guard being stripped of Crew Serviceable Weapons and communications gear \( 4 \) National Guard being stripped of Crew Serviceable Weapons and communications gear Republic Broadcasting , John Stadmiller \( 5 \) Dept of Homeland Security Orders 1 6 BILLION rounds of ammunition \( 5 \) Dept of Homeland Security Orders 1 6 BILLION rounds of ammunition Forbes Magazine \( 6 \) US Army over deployed and intentionally shrunk \( 6 \) US Army over deployed and intentionally shrunk ARMY TIMES",false

"NEW YORK DAILY NEWSMonday , March 28 , 2016 , 4 38 PMOur European allies are under siege from radical Islamic terrorism The Paris attacks last November killed 130 people and seriously injured hundreds more The Brussels attacks last week killed more than 30 people and struck at the heart of NATO Americans were among the victims of both attacks as the terrorists do not differentiate between us and our close allies One of the causes of this horror has been European bureaucrats restraining law enforcement from fully engaging with the Muslim community in no go zones As a result , for years , a radical , theocratic , violent ideology has spread in some mosques and Muslim neighborhoods throughout Europe Terrorists have exploited these isolated enclaves to recruit followers , formulate plots and orchestrate attacks BRATTON RIPS CRUZ AGAIN OVER PROPOSALTO MONITOR MUSLIMSThere is no better example of these no go zones than one neighborhood in the city of this latest horrific attack the municipality of Molenbeek in the city of Brussels In attack after attack , from 9 11 to Madrid to Paris to Brussels , the trail seems to come back repeatedly to Molenbeek At least three of the terrorists of the November 2015 Paris attack grew up and lived there In fact , one of the key terrorists of the Paris attack , Salah Abdeslam , fled back to Molenbeek where he knew he could find sanctuary It is telling that Abdeslam effectively hid in plain sight there for weeks in the same city as the headquarters of NATO and the European Union Even Belgium s own Prime Minister , Charles Michel , has admitted after the Paris attacks that A lmost every time there s a link with Molenbeek It s been a form of laissez faire and laxity Now we re paying the bill Many European leaders are now

of the Brussels attacks , I called for vigorously guarding against the political correctness that has plagued Europe I also called for empowering law enforcement to patrol and secure Muslim neighborhoods before they follow the path of Molenbeek and become havens for radical Islamic terrorists The response was predictable Liberal politicians , including President Obama , Hillary Clinton and Mayor de Blasio , all loudly denounced my approach Indeed , they seemed far more outraged at my calling for us to prevent radical Islamic terrorism then they were at the terrorists who attacked in Brussels In high dudgeon , they insist we must remain willfully blind to the root causes of these attacks The Islamic State is not Islamic , President Obama absurdly tells us New York Daily News front pages on the presidential electionEveryone knows that s nonsense Of course , there are many peaceful Muslims in America , and hundreds of millions across the world , who can be our allies in this global battle But we cannot fight and win without identifying and confronting the enemy Islamism is a political and theocratic philosophy that commands its adherents to wage jihad , to murder or forcibly convert the infidels \( by which they mean everyone else \) Islamism is the enemy , and it must be defeated To do so , we must take a risk based approach that focuses resources on the enclaves and potential hotbeds of radicalization where terrorists are likely to thrive Just as with law enforcement s successful efforts against gangs or drug dealers or the Mafia , we need resources and informants and undercover officers placed where terrorists are likely to be We need lawful surveillance operations And we need far more engagement between law enforcement and members of Muslim communities who are committed to working to rid their neighborhoods of the scourge of terrorism In the wake of 9 11 , there was a broad consensus in favor of a common sense domestic counterterrorism strategy But over the last seven years , the focus on protecting the homeland has been lost The Obama administration has even joined Islamist governments in sponsoring a UN resolution that would shred our First Amendment by threatening to make discussion of radical Islamism potentially illegal And now we are seeing the erosion of our counterterrorism tools here at home , even while we know from successful attacks from Boston to San Bernardino that terrorists are still plotting to strike America A prime case study is here in New York City Under Mayor Michael Bloomberg and Commissioner Ray Kelly , the NYPD started a counterterrorism unit that tracked demographic trends in New York City to provide investigators with important information about where terrorists might congregate and recruit That sophisticated analysis can be a critical part of counterterrorism efforts to prevent an attack before it occurs or disrupt burgeoning terror cells That unit likely saved lives For example , a former director of intelligence analysis for the NYPD , Mitchell Silber , explained that the unit identified the Islamic Books and Tapes bookstore in Brooklyn as a venue for radicalization , and provided a predicate for an investigation that thwarted a 2004 plot against the Herald Square subway station Moreover , the Obama administration s counterterrorism advisor and now CIA director , John Brennan , stated the administration knew about this unit and referred to its work as exceptionally good Indeed , while running for mayor in 2013 , even then candidate Bill de Blasio said he believed the unit was legal and was created in good faith to protect New Yorkers Once elected mayor , however , de Blasio shut down that counterterrorism unit He was taking heat from liberal advocacy groups who caricatured the unit s work as spying on Muslims , which it wasn t New Yorkers , including the Muslim community , are less safe as a result After the Brussels attacks , I called out the de Blasio administration for its shortsighted capitulation to its liberal allies at the expense of the safety and security of the people of New York In response , Commissioner Bill Bratton penned an op ed attacking my policy in this newspaper He did not say that the work of the unit was misguided or a failure Instead , he alleged , remarkably , that the unit was finished with its work and it wasn t serving any useful purpose Bratton has a difficult job , and I am grateful for all he does to keep the people of New York safe I also understand that politically , he has no choice but to implement the de Blasio Obama liberal agenda But his explanation for dismantling the unit makes no sense it ignores the nature of the threat that we face from radical Islam Simply put , demographic trends are not static They are dynamic They change over time The pockets of New York City that are fertile grounds for terrorist recruitment today may not be fertile grounds next year , and places without a significant radical presence right now may become hotbeds of terrorist activity in the future To say that the work of a vital intelligence unit was finished is not plausible It is the excuse of an administration grasping for anything to justify what was obviously a surrender to political correctness Hitting back \( Alex Wong Getty Images \) Former Mayor Rudy Giuliani and former Mayor Michael Bloomberg have both stated they believe the unit was lawful and effective , and should not have been shut down The de Blasio administration is trying to avoid the ideological foundation of the war radical Islamic terrorists are waging against us While Bratton admits that the jihadists are driven by ideology , he astonishingly maintains that our response should have no ideological component whatsoever That s ridiculous If the terrorist threat is driven by radical Islamic ideology , then we must take account of that ideology in countering the threat To stop the terrorists before they strike , we must understand what their motivation and goals are , where they might plot attacks and which targets they are inclined to strike Their ideology tells us how they might peddle their radical Islamism in our cities and towns and helps us encourage our fellow Muslim citizens to choose a different path The hollow argument that ideology has no role in counterterrorism leaves no doubt that politics is afoot here I repeat my call for de Blasio to repudiate the dangerous confines of political correctness and reinstate this important unit as the first step towards a more proactive , hard headed counterterrorism strategy on the home front The bottom line is that to defeat radical Islam , we need to focus our counterterrorism resources where terrorists are likely to be That s not profiling or spying It s common sense An investigation of Wall Street fraud wouldn t focus on community banks in the outer boroughs If we want to defeat radical Islam , we need to focus on areas that are at risk of being infiltrated by jihadists The vast majority of Muslim Americans are law abiding citizens Indeed , patriotic American Muslims have provided critical assistance to our law enforcement , intelligence and military officials to detect and disrupt jihadist plots And we need their help in the war on terrorism These are dangerous times If I am elected President , every American will have a commander in chief fiercely committed to defeating radical Islamic terrorism This is a battle we must win If we don t want to become Europe , we need to put aside the political correctness , focus our efforts on stopping radicalization and do what needs to be done to keep America safe Cruz , U S senator from Texas , is running for the Republican nomination for President Sign

"Falwell apologizes to gays , feminists , lesbians September 14 , 2001 Posted 2 55 AM EDT \( 0655 GMT \) LYNCHBURG , Virginia \( CNN \) The Rev Jerry Falwell said late Thursday he did not mean to blame feminists , gays or lesbians for bringing on the terrorist attacks in New York and Washington this week , in remarks on a television program earlier in the day On the broadcast of the Christian television program The 700 Club , Falwell made the following statement I really believe that the pagans , and the abortionists , and the feminists , and the gays and the lesbians who are actively trying to make that an alternative lifestyle , the ACLU , People For the American Way , all of them who have tried to secularize America I point the finger in their face and say 'you helped this happen ' Falwell , pastor of the 22 , 000 member Thomas Road Baptist Church , viewed the attacks as God 's judgment on America for throwing God out of the public square , out of the schools The abortionists have got to bear some burden for this because God will not be mocked But in a phone call to CNN , Falwell said that only the hijackers and terrorists were responsible for the deadly attacks I do believe , as a theologian , based upon many Scriptures and particularly Proverbs 14 23 , which says 'living by God 's principles promotes a nation to greatness , violating those principles brings a nation to shame , ' he said Falwell said he believes the ACLU and other organizations which have attempted to secularize America , have removed our nation from its relationship with Christ on which it was founded I therefore believe that that created an environment which possibly has caused God to lift the veil of protection which has allowed no one to attack America on our soil since 1812 , he said Pat Robertson , host of the 700 Club program , seemed to agree with Falwell 's earlier statements in a prayer during the program We have sinned against Almighty God , at the highest level of our government , we 've stuck our finger in your eye , said Robertson The Supreme Court has insulted you over and over again , Lord They 've taken your Bible away from the schools They 've forbidden little children to pray They 've taken the knowledge of God as best they can , and organizations have come into court to take the knowledge of God out of the public square of America National Gay and Lesbian Task Force Executive Director Lorri L Jean bristled at the idea that gays and lesbians had anything to do with the attacks on the World Trade Center and the Pentagon that may have left thousands dead , and demanded an apology from Falwell The terrible tragedy that has befallen our nation , and indeed the entire global community , is the sad byproduct of fanaticism It has its roots in the same fanaticism that enables people like Jerry Falwell to preach hate against those who do not think , live , or love in the exact same way he does , she said The tragedies that have occurred this week did not occur because someone made God mad , as Mr Falwell asserts They occurred because of hate , pure and simple It is time to move beyond a place of hate and to a place of healing We hope that Mr Falwell will apologize to the U S and world communities Falwell told CNN I would never blame any human being except the terrorists , and if I left that impression with gays or lesbians or anyone else , I apologize",true

"May 17 , 2012 4 CommentsI am in the process of preparing the data on the first several hundred children I have observed with GcMAF therapy for elevated nagalase activity The preliminary data is extraordinary But not everyone who thinks they understand GcMAF therapy gets it Many are using hugely too much and hurting children in the process Please don t overdose the children if you are using the right GcMAF it takes very little to help Our process involves homeopathic activation using classical techniques And when our techniques are used properly this is what we are hearing from the families so often Dear Dr Bradstreet , What has happened to my child \? Could it be that it was only a few months ago that my little boy preferred sitting alone at the computer or lining up toy cars and planets in his room \? It seems like it s been a lifetime Now , I look at my happy , interactive , responsive , 6 year old child with amazement J began using GcMAF since 27 weeks ago and we noticed changes for the better almost out of the starting gate Only 3 weeks in , my son asked to ride his bike My husband and I looked at each other with dread Unfortunately , in the recent past it took all three of us to make that bike go My husband and I would use our hands to push his feet on the pedals while one of us attempted to steer It was a backbreaking ordeal Our son just couldn t coordinate the mechanics of it But , not this time he jumped on that bike and rode all over the neighborhood We couldn t believe our eyes Could it be the GcMAF \? We just weren t sure The IEP meeting was scheduled We were just 4 weeks into the new school year and 4 weeks into using GcMAF The teacher presented me with written work from the beginning of the year , then placed Jayden s most recent work alongside it Surely , it was from two different children The earlier writing was erratic , with one letter written over top of the other , it was disproportionate , and trailed sloppily down the edge of the page His recent work was neat , orderly , and consistently sized It was even on the line The teacher started gushing about his performance He was starting to read and was learning full curriculum kindergarten academics He was specifically excelling in math Everyone around the conference table verbally gave each other a high five for their achievement Now hold on , I interrupted , the success must primarily be attributed to the biomedical approach and the diet that we ve implemented I gave them a brief explanation and we left the meeting feeling excited for what the future might hold It was not a steady climb up the staircase , however We experienced some regression following dental surgery , but quickly got back on track \( by resuming GcMAF \) Previously , I had a difficult time getting my son to respond when I called out his name He would run out into the street without looking , if I didn t stop him He was able to parrot back canned answers to rehearsed questions Now , here we are , 6 months later , and my son s cognition has exploded He laughs at jokes and is able to tell his own He has started to ask and answer questions cognitively He initiates and organizes the family during playtime activities Recently , while in the pool , he touched his Dad s hair and said , Nice haircut , Dad At breakfast , after drinking his juice he asked , Was that mango juice \? I wanted pear juice The morning after I went to see a show he awoke and said , Good morning Mommy How was the show \? Just 2 months ago , a van from a local karate school brought children to the playground that we were at My son was excited to play and ran over to a boy and gave him a two handed chest shove I apologized and quickly led him away before he got a karate chop Just last week , we went back to that same playground I watched nervously as J ran over to a group of three boys I heard him say , Come on guys , let s play Chase me ! And , you know what they did ! My boy led this group of normal boys all over that playground One of the boys asked him what was his name He told him , My name is J As I glanced around at the other parents scattered about the playground I wondered if I was the only one there who saw a miracle that day My son did experience some symptoms while using GcMAF There was occasional regressive stimming , a rare fever up to 102 , a few shooting head pains with sensitivity to light that lasted for only a few seconds , and he was often tired But , those symptoms were easily lost in the shadows of the exceptional gains that we were experiencing The best part about GcMAF is that Jayden now frequently and spontaneously speaks those words , that for years , I d longed to hear , I love you , Mommy And , if that s not a good enough reason to stick your kid with a needle 27 times , I don t know what is Dr Bradstreet , there are no words adequate enough to express my sincere and heartfelt appreciation for everything that you ve done for J Thank you for including us in your personal journey of discovery and healing God bless you and your family Sincerely , Dr Bradstreet s 1 FanShare this",false

"Michigan residents lost their right to farm this week thanks to a new ruling by the Michigan Commission of Agriculture and Rural Development Gail Philburn of the Michigan Sierra Club told Michigan Live , the news changes effectively remove Right to Farm Act protection for many urban and suburban backyard farmers raising small numbers of animals Backyard and urban farming were previously protected by Michigan s Right to Farm Act The Commission ruled that the Right to Farm Act protections no longer apply to many homeowners who keep small numbers of livestock Kim White , who raises chickens and rabbits , said , They don t want us little guys feeding ourselves They want us to go all to the big farms They want to do away with small farms and I believe that is what s motivating it The ruling will allow local governments to arbitrarily ban goats , chickens and beehives on any property where there are 13 homes within one eighth mile or a residence within 250 feet of the property , according to Michigan Public Radio The Right to Farm Act was created in 1981 to protect farmers from the complaints of people from the city who moved to the country and then attempted to make it more urban with anti farming ordinances The new changes affect residents of rural Michigan too It is not simply an urban or suburban concern Shady Grove Farm in Gwinn , Michigan is the six and a half acre home to 150 egg laying hens that provide eggs to a local co op and a local restaurant The small Michigan farm also homes sheep for wool and a few turkeys and meat chickens to provide fresh healthy , local poultry We produce food with integrity , Randy Buchler told The Blaze about Shady Grove Farm Everything we do here is 100 percent natural we like to say it s beyond organic We take a lot of pride and care in what we re doing here Shady Grove Farm was doing its part to bring healthy , local , organic food to the tables of Gwinn residents , and it mirrors the attitudes of hundreds of other small farming operations in Michigan and thousands of others popping up around the nation The ruling comes within days of a report by The World Health Organization that stated the world is currently in grave danger of entering a post antibiotic era The WHO s director general Dr Margaret Chan argued that the antibiotic use in our industrialized food supply is the worst offender adding to the global crisis The Michigan Agriculture Commission passed up an opportunity to support one of the hottest trends in food in Michigan public demand for access to more local , healthy , sustainable food , Gail Philbin told MLive Meanwhile , neighboring Indiana Governor Mike Pence signed Senate Bill 179 a few weeks before which freed up poultry and egg sales from local and state regulation Yesterday , the USDA Secretary Tom Vilsack announced massive funding to support research about small and medium sized family farms , such as small farms ability to build up local and regional economic systems There s a lot of unnecessary legal action being taken against small farms who are doing good things in their communities , said Randy Buchler , who is also on the board of directors for the Michigan Small Farm Council The Michigan Small Farm Council actively fought to support Michigan farming freedom , but ultimately the Commission voted to approve the new restrictions Farm Bureau has become another special interest beholden to big business and out of touch with small farmers , and constitutional and property rights of the little guy , Pine Hallow Farms wrote to the Michigan Small Farm Council The Michigan Farm Bureau endorsed the new regulatory changes Matthew Kapp , government relations specialist with Michigan Farm Bureau , told MLive that the members weighed in and felt that people raising livestock need to conform to local zoning ordinances The Farm Bureau did not feel Michigan s Right To Farm Act was meant to protect the smaller farms , and ultimately the Michigan Commission of Agriculture and Rural Development agreed",false

Monday September 12 , 2005 By MIKE FOSTER CAMBRIDGE , Mass Scared stiff astronomers have detected a mysterious mass they 've dubbed a chaos cloud that dissolves everything in its path , including comets , asteroids , planets and entire stars and it 's headed directly toward Earth ! Discovered April 6 by NASA 's Chandra X ray Observatory , the swirling , 10 million mile wide cosmic dust cloud has been likened to an acid nebula and is hurtling toward us at close to the speed of light making its estimated time of arrival 9 15 a m EDT on June 1 , 2014 The good news is that this finding confirms several cutting edge ideas in theoretical physics , announced Dr Albert Sherwinski , a Cambridge based astrophysicist with close ties to NASA The bad news is that the total annihilation of our solar system is imminent Experts believe the chaos cloud is composed of particles spawned near the event horizon of a black hole \( a form of what 's called Hawking Radiation \) that have been distorted by mangled information spewed from the hole A super massive black hole lies about 28 , 000 light years from Earth at the center of our galaxy , explained Dr Sherwinski Last year the eminent physicist Stephen Hawking revised his theory of black holes which previously held that nothing could escape the hole 's powerful gravitational field He demonstrated that information about objects that have been sucked in can be emitted in mangled form It now appears that mangled information can distort matter Just imagine our galaxy the Milky Way as a beautiful , handwritten letter Now imagine pouring a glass of water on the paper and watching the words dissolve as the stain spreads That 's what the chaos cloud does to every star or planet it encounters To avoid widespread panic , NASA has declined to make the alarming discovery public But Dr Sherwinski 's contacts at the agency 's Chandra X ray Observatory leaked to him striking images of the newly discovered chaos cloud obliterating a large asteroid It 's like watching a helpless hog being dissolved in a vat of acid , one NASA scientist told Dr Sherwinski Ordinarily , Hawkings Radiation is harmless It 's produced when an electron positron pair are at the event horizon of a black hole , Dr Sherwinski explained The intense curvature of space time of the hole can cause the positron to fall in , while the electron escapes But when infected by mangled information from the black hole , the particles become a chaos cloud , which in turn mangles everything it touches If it continues unchecked , the chaos cloud will eventually reduce our galaxy to the state of absolute chaos that existed before the birth of the universe , the astrophysicist warned Some scientists say mankind 's best hope would be to build a space ark and hightail it to the Andromeda Galaxy , 2 1 million light years away We would n't be able to save the entire human population , but perhaps the best and the brightest , observed British rocket scientist Dr David Hall , when asked about the feasibility of such a project But even if such a craft could be built in time , evacuating Earth might prove fruitless if theories about the origin of the chaos cloud are correct A black hole at the center of Andromeda is about 15 times the size of the one in our own galaxy , Dr Sherwinski noted It might be like jumping out of the frying pan into the fire Speaking under the condition of anonymity , a senior White House official said the president 's top science advisors are taking the findings in stride This is a lot like global warming , where the jury is still out on whether it 's real or not , said the official The existence of this so called chaos cloud is only a theory Americans should n't panic until all the facts are in Email Story Printable Version",false
"Congress America 's Criminal Class Part I Rep Corrine Brown and her long trail of lies , deceit and unpaid bills By the staff of PoliticsLive America , Mark Twain once said , is a nation without a distinct criminal class with the possible exception of Congress If anything , the Congress of today is even worse than it was in Twain 's time more than a century ago The 535 men and women who make up the House and Senate of the United States include , at best , a collection of rogues , con artists , scofflaws and bad check artists At worst , they comprise , as Twain once observed , a distinct criminal class Over the past several months , researchers for PoliticsLive have checked public records , past newspaper articles , civil court cases and criminal records of members of the United States Congress We have talked with former associates and business partners who have been left out in the cold by people they thought were friends What emerges from this examination is a disturbing portrait of a group of elected officials who routinely avoid payment of debts , write bad checks , abuse their spouses , assault people and openly violate the law They include current Rep Corrine Brown \( D Fla \) , whose trail of bad debts , lies to Congress and misstatements to the Internal Revenue Service have spawned a number of investigations Then there is Rep James Moran \( D Va \) whose wife has charged him with abuse , who has assaulted other members of Congress on the floor of the House and is a former stockbroker whose judgment in trades is so bad he is broke from poor investments The list also includes Joe Waldholtz , a con man and husband of former Rep Enid Greene Waldholtz \( R UT \) who kited more than a million dollars in bad checks and ended up in prison Others , like former Ohio Senator John Glenn , have driven creditors into bankruptcy because of unpaid debts left over from aborted Presidential campaigns Even millionaire Senator Ted Kennedy has left a trail of unpaid debts from past campaigns In recent years , members of Congress have gone to jail for child molestation , fraud and other charges Our research found 117 members of the House and Senate who have run at least two businesses each that went bankrupt , often leaving business partners and creditors holding the bag Seventy one of them have credit reports so bad they ca n't get an American Express card \( but as members of Congress , they get a government issued Amex card without a credit check \) Fifty three have personal and financial problems so serious they would be denied security clearances by the Department of Defense or the Department of Energy if they had to apply through normal channels \( but , again , as members of Congress they get such clearances simply because they fooled enough people to get elected \) Twenty nine members of Congress have been accused of spousal abuse in either criminal or civil proceedings Twenty seven have driving while intoxicated arrests on their driving records Twenty one are current defendants in various lawsuits , ranging from bad debts , disputes with business partners or other civil matters Nineteen members of Congress have been accused of writing bad checks , even after the scandal several years ago , which resulted in closure of the informal House bank that routinely allowed members to overdraw their accounts without penalty Fourteen members of Congress have drug related arrests in their background , eight were arrested for shoplifting , seven for fraud , four for theft , three for assault and one for criminal trespass Over the next five days , PoliticsLive will take a closer look at some of the more notorious members of America 's Criminal Class the Congress of the United States We will not run lists of every member who has written a bad check , punched somebody out or been charged with slapping a spouse Rather , we will examine those whose pattern of behavior suggests a blatant disregard for both law and propriety Part I Rep Corrine Brown running on a record of fraud In just seven years in Congress , Rep Corrine Brown has eluded creditors , filed false financial disclosure reports and lied to the Internal Revenue Service She cons people , pure and simple , says Sheryl Wilson , a former travel agency owner in Tallahassee who knew Brown I do n't think she has an honest bone in her body Rep Brown has a poor memory when it comes to remembering her business dealings The financial records that every member of Congress is required to file shows the Jacksonville , Florida Democrat failed to disclose the 40 , 000 sale of her Tallahassee travel agency and improperly reported the sale of her Gainesville agency And she has omitted other required details from her reports Brown has left a trail of unpaid bills from businesses she owned in Gainesville , Jacksonville and Tallahassee during the early 1990s In 1994 , a consortium of airlines sued Brown for 94 , 000 in because her company , Springfield Travel Agency Inc , falsified sales reports and did not pay its bills Delta Air Lines revoked her authority to write tickets because of an unpaid 7 , 237 bill She also owed 5 , 697 to the University of Florida and tried to pay part of the bill with a bad check The IRS also went after Brown for 14 , 228 in unpaid taxes and the Whirlpool Corp had to go to court to try and collect 10 , 227 in unpaid bills for appliances In addition , the House ethics committee is investigating Brown over her dealings with an African millionaire who was imprisoned on bribery charges Two committee investigators went to Miami recently to interview witnesses for that case Brown not only avoids personal responsibility for her financial dealings , but also routinely violates congressional rules and the law Members of Congress are required to file reports to reveal any potential conflicts of interest As a member of the House aviation subcommittee , Brown oversees the very airlines that sued her for unpaid bills But Brown not only fails to truthfully report transactions involving her travel business , she also spends money she never reports and buys expensive homes and other items even though she is deeply in debt Although she recently paid 25 , 000 for a down payment on a 300 , 000 townhouse , those who know her say they have no idea where she got the money Somebody is always bailing her out , says a former staff member You can bet the money came from sources nobody wants to discuss Members who file incomplete or false reports face criminal charges under federal law Republican George Hansen of Idaho went to prison for 11 months in 1984 and paid a 40 , 000 for failing to report more than 300 , 000 in loans and profits Last year , Brown 's daughter received a 50 , 000 car from a close associate of the African millionaire who faces bribery charges Brown 's financial dealings show a long , consistent record of deceit In 1985 , she started a travel agency , Springfield Travel , while serving as a Florida state legislator Papers she filed with the Florida Department of State , listed two prominent state legislators as her vice presidents Reps Doug Tim Jamerson of St Petersburg and James Hargrett of Tampa But Jamerson or Hargrett say did n't know they were affiliated with her company until years later I was somewhat surprised to learn I was even on the board , said Jamerson , now a Tallahassee lobbyist It would have been nice to have been asked Brown opened the agency 's first office in her hometown of Jacksonville and started a second office in Tallahassee where she spend most of her time while serving in the Legislature Brown often used the agency to take advantage of the free trips offered to travel agents She was always getting tickets to Aruba and places like that , former employee Ed Curry told The St Petersburg Times But while Brown was running off to Aruba on free trips , creditors were calling to ask why they were n't getting paid Brown occasionally paid her employees in cash or wrote personal checks to cover payroll , Curry said More than once , the paychecks bounced Brown also failed to pay unemployment taxes to the state The State Department of Labor filed a 353 state tax lien against the company As of last week , the lien had not been paid Even though she could n't pay her bills , Brown sought to expand her company in 1991 Barnett Bank gave her a 10 , 000 loan , but could never get a full accounting of how it was spent At the same time , Brown started a new company , Springfield Enterprises , which she said would resell appliances and seafood Whirlpool Corp filed suit against Springfield Enterprises for an unpaid 10 , 227 bill , saying Brown bought more than a dozen large appliances and did n't pay for them Brown finally paid the bill after the company obtained a judgment But Brown was busy opening other businesses In February 1992 , she opened Gator Travel at the University of Florida in Gainesville Seven months later , she was five months behind in her rent and owed the university 7 , 066 The IRS also filed a lien against Springfield Travel for 14 , 228 in unpaid taxes Brown , who was running for her first term in Congress , was busy looking for someone to buy the travel agency Two buyers Melvin Stith , dean of the Florida State University business school , and Edward Scott II , a Tallahassee dentist , paid her 40 , 000 for the agency , according to a contract filed with the state Brown did not report the sale on her mandatory congressional disclosure , which required her to list sales of all assets worth more than 1 , 000 The cash allowed her to make payments on some of her debts The University of Florida got a personal check for the overdue 8 , 479 bill The IRS withdrew the lien against her in March 1993 But Brown was soon in trouble again In February 1993 , she wrote the University of Florida a check for 1 , 413 partial payment for a 5 , 600 bill The check bounced A month later , Delta Air Lines revoked her authority to write tickets because of an unpaid 7 , 237 bill , a move that effectively put her travel agency out of business \( Delta was the primary airline serving Gainesville \) Enter three Miami businessmen who were willing to take over her failing travel agency Emilio F Torres and his partners at Douglas Executive Travel agreed to pay Brown 's overdue rent to the university and take over the agency , but the transition to Torres' company took more than six months because Brown owed the airlines so much money Finally , the airlines seized Brown 's official ticketing plates and Torres was allowed to take over the lease Brown , however , lied about the transaction on her financial disclosure reports to the House of Representatives Her 1993 report claims Torres bought her agency for an amount between 50 , 000 and 100 , 000 Since then , her reports claim she is owed 50 , 000 to 100 , 000 by Torres and his partners But Torres never bought Gator Travel He just assumed the lease We did n't buy anything from her , he says I do n't owe her anything State records support his claims Torres also did not pay Brown 's overwhelming unpaid debts to the airlines The Airlines Reporting Corp , a consortium of the airlines that handles ticket transactions with travel agencies , filed a lawsuit against Brown in U S District Court in Washington in September , 1994 \( while Brown was running for her second term \) , saying Brown failed to pay about 94 , 000 for plane tickets and lied about her financial transactions Brown eventually paid the 94 , 000 and the suit was dismissed But Brown never reported the debts on her disclosure forms Florida state records show she signed a contract in 1992 taking personal responsibility for the bills Her disclosure forms also fail to show where she got the 94 , 000 to pay off the airlines Her 1994 form said she did n't have enough money to make the payment Her latest report shows no savings accounts , no money market funds and no stocks that she could redeem The only asset she listed is a Jacksonville condo that she rents Yet she still has n't paid back the money she borrowed from Barnett Bank in 1991 and has mortgages on a 110 , 000 waterfront house in Jacksonville and the 300 , 000 Alexandria , Va , townhouse she recently bought with her daughter Nobody seems to know where Brown got the 25 , 000 down payment for the townhouse Brown 's daughter , a political appointee for the Environmental Protection Agency , said in her financial disclosure report that she did n't have any assets over 1 , 000 She 's always pulling a scam on someone , says Oliver Roster of Jacksonville , who has known Brown for years Somebody , somewhere , got the money for her What we do n't know yet is what she had to do or promise to get it Brown also forgot to disclose a 10 , 000 check she received in 1996 from a secret Wisconsin bank account Baptist leader Henry J Lyons allegedly used for money laundering The money came from a secret account in Milwaukee that is a focus of charges against Lyons Federal prosecutors say Lyons , president of the National Baptist Convention USA , hid more than 1 million in the account Brown 's office did not return phone calls seeking comment on this report \( The report was coordinated and written by PoliticsLive editor Jack Sharp with assistance from researcher Marilyn Crosslyn and private investigator James Hargill \) Tomorrow Virginia 's battling Jim Moran , the Congressmen who admits he likes to hit people and the former stockbroker whose trades have left him

"In another example demonstrating that Pat Robertson believes in persecuting non Christians and indoctrinating children , the televangelist openly suggested that parents should beat their kids until they respect Christian beliefs During yet another shameful episode of The 700 Club , which runs on Disney owned channel ABC Family , Robertson received an email from a woman who claimed that her grandson disrespects their Christian faith when they visit their daughter on Christmas and chose not to visit this past year Somebody take that kid to the woodshed and let him understand the blessings of discipline , he advised And while we re on the subject of beating , Robertson continued shamelessly , I was thinking that that might not be such a bad punishment for married women who are thinking about voting for Hillary Clinton in November s election But , then again , it s probably a little harsh to beat on your wife just because she has no idea who it is God wants to be president Okay , here s a compromise non Christian wives should get a beating from their husbands , and Christian wives should have their husbands boycott intercourse until they change their mind How s that \? The 700 Club host went on to argue that it s about time husbands take matters into their own hands , and when I say matters , I m referring to their manhood At the rate we re going , more and more women are taking over the traditional role of men , and that s not a good thing because it leaves men with a lot of free time to act like women They wax their eyebrows , they wax their bodies , they wear skinny jeans , they put makeup on it s as if suddenly we re living in an upside down dimension , he argued So I ve thought long and hard on how to take back what is rightfully ours , and I came to a unique conclusion Namely , women have been using their vaginas as weapons against men for thousands of years It s simple economics , really they realized their girl parts were in high demand with men , so they did the natural thing they started limiting the supply , Robertson elaborated That s how they were able to overpower us over time So , I figured , why not use the same strategy \? They clearly enjoy intercourse just as much as we do , if not more Therefore , it makes perfect sense that husbands should weaponize abstinence and turn it against its creator And marriage is the perfect playground to test that out , just like the upcoming presidential election is the perfect opportunity , as well That s why I urge Christian husbands of all ages and races across America to stop having sex with their wives for the purpose of demonstrating that they don t have control over us , and especially so if they re planning to vote for Hillary Clinton American women need to learn two things one , that they don t control us , but that it s the other way around , and two , that God has made it very clear He wants Donald Trump to be the next President of the United States And both of those things can be achieved through boycotting marital intercourse for a period of time I know they tend to think blueb lls are a fictional problem Well , I guess we ll have to see how they feel about having severe cases of blue gina in the coming weeks , Robertson concluded",false

"Crohn 's disease , one of several inflammatory bowel diseases , achieved complete remission in nearly half the subjects of one study that were exposed to smoking medical marijuana on a regular basis Published in the journal Clinical Gastroenterology and Hepatology , the study examined the effects of consistent marijuana use on Crohn 's patients who suffered from severe cases of the disease The results of the 21 subject study point toward the drug 's anti inflammatory properties as being responsible for quieting symptoms in many patients , and even reaching total remission in others The Disease Causes , Symptoms , And Treatments Often mischaracterized as an autoimmune disease , Crohn 's disease is in fact an immune deficiency state Arising from a host of genetic , environmental , and immunological factors , the disease causes a chronic inflammatory disorder that attacks the person 's gastrointestinal tract anywhere from the mouth to the anus in order to fight the body 's antigens that otherwise do no harm Symptoms of the disease range from mild abdominal pain to more severe cases of bloody diarrhea , nausea , vomiting , weight loss , and fevers There is no cure for Crohn 's however , various methods are aimed at limiting flare ups and keeping the disease in remission Treatments , like disease severity , fall on a spectrum depending on the person Simple dietary changes suffice for some , while invasive surgery to remove the affected area may be needed for others Corticosteroids and other medications are also prescribed for less severe cases The disease affects around 400 , 000 to 600 , 000 people in North America , although many people do not get diagnosed until they 've had the disease for years , simply because no symptoms were present The Study And Its Findings Scientists at Meir Medical Center in Israel wanted to examine the effects of Cannabis sativa on patients with severe Crohn 's disease , relying on the underlying drug 's anti inflammatory effects in treating other ailments , such as arthritis and multiple sclerosis The marijuana plant Cannabis sativa has been reported to produce beneficial effects for patients with inflammatory bowel diseases , but this has not been investigated in controlled trials , the researchers wrote We performed a prospective trial to determine whether cannabis can induce remission in patients with Crohn 's disease Twenty one people with severe , intractable Crohn 's comprised the study Out of those 21 , 11 subjects smoked two joints a day for eight weeks The other 10 made up the placebo group The results were particularly telling , according to the researchers In total , five of the 11 subjects smoking marijuana daily achieved total remission of their Crohn 's They reported greater appetites and sleep patterns \( People with severe cases of Crohn 's sometimes defecate 20 times per day , and may even wake up at night to do so \) Moreover , a clinical response was found in 10 of those 11 Only four of the 10 placebo subjects reported any improvements These findings , argued the researchers , demonstrate how THC rich cannabis produced significant clinical , steroid free benefits to 11 patients with active Crohn 's disease , compared with placebo , without side effects The researchers were hesitant to call the study a total success , however , saying that the primary end point of the study \( induction of remission \) was not achieved , despite the five of 11 people who reported those effects Still , they noted that their findings merit further attention Further studies , with larger patient groups and a nonsmoking mode of intake , are warranted , they wrote , pointing to the potentially diminished effects of smoking marijuana , as opposed to extracting the anti inflammatory drugs directly from the plant Source Naftali T , Lihi BL , Iris D Cannabis Induces a Clinical Response in Patients With Crohn 's Disease A Prospective Placebo Controlled Study Clinical Gastroenterology and Hepatology 2013",false

They re , like , double the threat they re half Muslim , which means that they hate all of America by default , and the other half is Mexican , which means they can be very hard working , but at the same time , they re also very jealous of white people And if , by some miracle , you were to add just an ounce of Germanic heritage to that , you d have Hitler in the mix as well That means they d be the ultimate killing machine They should have been incarcerated from the beginning Instead , we re left with this situation I guarantee you no potential gunman would have ever seen the light of day other than through prison bars if anyone other than Barack Obama had been president All Muslim Mexicans would be scrutinized several times , compared to normal Muslims and Mexicans , the majority of whom would only be subjected to one scrutinization process yearly Instead , they were left to their own twisted behavior under the excuse of civil liberties , and what happened \? We had the Orlando gay club massacre , and now Fort Lauderdale It doesn t take a rocket scientist to figure out there s a pretty obvious pattern here And you better believe there s more of them coming So , when the next one happens , I m not even going to look into who or what the shooter was I m directly going after Obama for carelessness on the job and dereliction of duty Because , he was many things as president , but a patriot was not one of them , Palin concluded Most Popular",false

"by Chase McFadden HOUSTON , TX After double checking their math , scientists have announced that the total lunar eclipse predicted for August 21 , 2017 , will occur August 3 , 2018 Due to a computational mishap , the eclipse we projected for later this month will actually take place late next year , stated NASA astrophysicist Dr Theodore Moneta at a hastily planned press conference from Johnson Space Center in Houston We were a bit off Dr Moneta explained that in calculating the date of the eclipse , scientists utilized a complex formula involving geocentric ephemeris for the Sun and Moon , various parameters , constants , and the Besselian elements , but along the way an error went unnoticed In layman s terms , we forgot to carry the one , explained Moneta , a mistake that has plagued 12 year olds in 7th grade math for centuries This is an embarrassing day for both science and mathematics , he added For officials in those states situated within the eclipse s path of totality preparing for an influx of visitors in the next few weeks , the NASA announcement came as a shock It s disappointing , stated Matt Mead , governor of Wyoming , upon hearing the news Obviously , the NASA nerds really dropped the ball on this one However , Mead felt that Wyoming would be less affected by the altered date than other locales due the Cowboy State s inherent awesomeness A visit to our state is spectacular with or without a once in lifetime astronomical occurrence , said Mead Wyoming doesn t need an eclipse to shine",false
"ShareThis \( Photo Bobby Doherty \) Editor 's Note In the most recent edition of New York , its annual Reasons to Love New York issue , the magazine published this story about a Stuyvesant High School senior named Mohammed Islam , who was rumored to have made 72 million trading stocks Islam said his net worth was in the high eight figures As part of the research process , the magazine sent a fact checker to Stuyvesant , where Islam produced a document that appeared to be a Chase bank statement attesting to an eight figure bank account After the story 's publication , people questioned the 72 million figure in the headline , which was written by editors based on the rumored figure The headline was amended But in an interview with the New York Observer last night , Islam now says his entire story was made up A source close to the Islam family told the Washington Post that the statements were falsified We were duped Our fact checking process was obviously inadequate we take full responsibility and we should have known better New York apologizes to our readers Rumors , on Wall Street , can be powerful A whisper can turn into a current that moves markets , driving a stock price up or sending it tumbling There may be only one other place where gossip holds such sway , and that is high school Late last year , a rumor began circulating at Stuyvesant that a junior named Mohammed Islam had made a fortune in the stock market Not a small fortune , either Seventy two million An unbelievable amount of money for anyone , not least a high school student , but as far as rumors go , this one seemed legit Everyone at Stuy knew that Mohammed , the soft spoken son of Bengali immigrants from Queens and the president of the school s Investment Club , was basically a genius As the news spread , Mo s stock went up The school paper profiled him , Business Insider included him on a list of 20 Under 20 , and Mo became a celebrity , as his friend Damir Tulemaganbetov put it on a recent Friday night at Mari Vanna near Union Square A VIP ! Mo , a cherubic senior with a goatee and slight faux hawk , smiled shyly He s quiet today , said Patrick Trablusi , who was seated with Mo and Damir at a table littered with empty glasses Humble And tired This is our third meeting of the day , Damir said , signaling to the waitress for another round We saw a real estate agent , a lawyer , you Next we re going to see a hedge fund guy , Patrick said The friends locked eyes and started to giggle He basically wants to give us 150 million , Mo explained , a blush like a sunset creeping over his cheeks The waitress arrived with a tray of green drinks Freshly squeezed apple juice , Damir said , passing them around It s very good Do you like caviar \? After Mo became a celebrity , things got a little awkward at school \( Aren t you the kid who made all that money \? a teacher asked him \) So he reconnected with kids from his old school , Allen Stevenson One of them introduced him to Patrick , an aspiring financier , who introduced him to Damir at a poker game attended by kids whose parents are , according to Damir , the one percent of the one percent The son of a Kazakh oligarch , Damir is tall , slim , and cocky , like a cigarette wearing a fedora I call the poker game Destiny , ' he said The waitress arrived with a plate Here , have some caviar Over late nights out and dinners at Morimoto , the three hatched a plan to start a hedge fund There are a lot of steps we have to follow through , said Patrick , calling to mind a more serious Chuck Bass But we re on the right track They plan to launch in June , after Mo turns 18 and can get his broker dealer license Mo s our maestro , Patrick said He s going to be earning the big bucks We re just going to try to fill his needs All three plan to attend college next year , but they re not concerned about classes getting in the way of their goal A billion dollars ! Damir said By next year ! Mo affirmed the number with a nod But it s not just about money , he added We want to create a brotherhood Like , all of us who are connected , who are in something together , who have influence , like the Koch brothers Like in Wolf of Wall Street ! Damir interjected And Mo is Jordan Belfort No , but , not like that , Patrick said , blanching slightly Like Belfort , Mo started with penny stocks A cousin showed him how to trade He loved the feeling of risk the way his hand shook making the trade but he swore it off after losing a chunk of the money he d made tutoring I didn t have the balls for it , he said He was 9 It was a while before he was ready to try again In the meantime , he became a scholar of modern finance , studying up on hedge fund managers He was particularly enamored of Paul Tudor Jones I had been paralyzed by my loss , Mo said But he was able to go back to it , even after losing thousands of dollars over and over Paul Tudor Jones says , You learn more from your losses than from your gains Mo got into trading oil and gold , and his bank account grew Though he is shy about the 72 million number , he confirmed his net worth is in the high eight figures More than enough to rent an apartment in Manhattan though his parents won t let him live in it until he turns 18 and acquire a BMW , which he can t drive because he doesn t yet have a license Thus , it falls to his father to drive him past Tudor Jones s Greenwich house for inspiration It s because he is who he is that made me who I am today , Mo said Which is to say a believer in Wall Street A lot of young people do start ups , but I think it s a bubble Trading and investments will always be there Money will always be rotating Money never sleeps ! Damir added That s from the Wall Street movie It all comes down to this , Mo continued What makes the world go round \? Money If money is not flowing , if businesses don t keep going , there s no innovation , no products , no investments , no growth , no jobs The check arrived for the caviar and apple juice It totaled 400 New York , that s where the money s at , Damir shouted , pulling out a credit card This reminded me of an old joke about robbing banks because that s where the money is Damir grinned My father has a quote , he said It s really dope You can rob a bank with a gun , but you can rob the whole world with a bank Patrick buried his face in his hands At the end of the day , he said , we re young kids",false

"French President Emmanuel Macron is offering refuge to American liberals upset at President Donald Trump s decision to withdraw from the Paris climate agreement In a video posted to Twitter , speaking in English , Macron said I wish to tell the United States France believes in you The world believes in you I know that you are a great nation I know your history , our common history If you re wondering how to get into France , you can either be a Syrian jihadi or an American climate scientist To all scientists , engineers , entrepreneurs , responsible citizens who were disappointed by the decision of the president of the United States , I want to say that they will find in France a second homeland I call them Come and work here , with us , to work together on concrete solutions for our climate , our environment I can assure you , France will not give up the fight Macron also posted a picture to Twitter , with the words Make Our Planet Great Again on a green and blue background Macron is a 39 year old liberal who worked in mergers and acquisitions for the Rothschild investment bank in Paris and as the economy minister to French Socialist Party President Fran ois Hollande before rebranding himself as an outsider last year and launching a campaign for president He defeated populist National Front leader Marine Le Pen in May to become the youngest ever president of France It may be because of his youth that Macron is not aware that the specter of a young Frenchman calling out the president of the United States , speaking English with a French accent , may invite more ridicule from Americans than gratitude If you 're wondering how to get into France , you can either be a Syrian jihadi or an American climate scientist , newspaper columnist and talk radio guest host Mark Steyn said on The Rush Limbaugh Show on Friday afternoon , before noting that France would likely require more paperwork from the American climate scientist than from the jihadi And as for President Trump himself , The Washington Post reported Friday that Trump 's irritation with Macron 's disrespecting him at their first meeting may have , in fact , helped seal his decision on withdrawal from the Paris accord It occurred in Brussels , Belgium , on May 26 , when the new French president approached the line of world leaders , with Trump in the middle , but veered off to his right , ignoring Trump to shake German Chancellor Angela Merkel 's hand first , and then the hand of NATO Secretary General Jens Stoltenburg , only to then finally come to Trump , who clasped Macron hand tightly and pulled the slender Macron toward him forcefully while shaking his hand vigorously , breaking out into a huge smile not at Macron , but toward the cameras that he saw were pointed toward him At an earlier private meeting between Macron and Trump , the two had shaken hands , with both gripping tightly and grimacing for the cameras , in what some media organizations interpreted as an alpha male showdown In what was likely the best , or probably the most memorable , line from the president 's energetic address from the Rose Garden on Thursday , in which he laid out a strong case for exiting the Paris agreement , he said I was elected to represent the citizens of Pittsburgh , not Paris",false
"Pin ItAlthough no alcohol is sold in Disneyland itself \( except in Club 33 \) , locations in Disney California Adventure , the Disney owned hotels , and Downtown Disney serve alcohol Here s our guide to the best beer and mixed drinks available throughout Disneyland Resort While it s not as popular as Drinking Around the World at Epcot in Walt Disney World , leisurely afternoon spent exploring the various Disneyland Resort bars is a lot of fun Plus , all of these bars are within a short walk of one another given Disneyland s condensed footprint , so it s easy to hit them all in one day Some of the mixed drinks here might be off menu at some locations , but they re listed because the bartenders at the given location do a great job with these drinks We try to give a couple suggestions for each location so that you don t have to order a random drink off what I lovingly prefer to as the Generic DisneyParks Drink Menu I loathe this menu of sugar water and vibrantly color concoctions meant to appeal only to vacationers who don t regularly drink It is the epitome of what is wrong with the contemporary Disney theme parks homogenization that has replaced unique experiences in the name of saving a few bucks because bean counters either don t understand the Disney Difference , or think most guests won t notice , anyway More importantly , if you re someone who has the mental and physical fortitude to partake in a bar crawl , you will be largely unimpressed by these drinks Plus , consuming more than a couple will make you sick to your stomach from an overdose of sugar Because of this , we make recommendations that are either unique to each specific stop on our tour , or are drinks most bartenders at the locations in question know how to make Order these , or order something else you enjoy that the bartender knows how to make You order drinks off the Generic DisneyParks Drink Menu at your own peril Obviously you should use your head when consuming alcohol Eat a big early lunch before you start , make sure to stay hydrated , and spread out your drinking This is enough fun that it should be an all day event , so take your time We recommend starting at around noon and concluding late in the evening Every good bar crawl needs a good name , and we re fresh out Epcot has Drinking Around the World , which is a very solid name , but nothing spectacular for Disneyland sticks out like that In lieu of something better , I m going to call this the Disneyland Drinking Debauchery Sounds a little more risque than it actually is , but I like alliterations It s scientifically proven that the best place to start the Disneyland Drinking Debauchery is in Disney California Adventure Laugh if you want , but there is a very good reason for this Disney California Adventure has some attractions that are enhanced with alcohol Seriously , it s like adding 3D to the Lion King It started out great , but 3D really adds an element of wow These alcohol enhanced attractions are California Screamin , Silly Symphony Swings , Goofy s Sky School , and the Golden Zephyr In other words , the stuff on Paradise Pier Science is needed here because you need to consume the perfect amount of alcohol to enhance these experiences Drink too little , and they re the same as they normally are Drink too much , and it s Upchuck City Population everyone in your general vicinity Not a pretty picture However , if you hit that slightly buzzed sweet spot , these attractions are a lot more fun Okay , let s get started with the fun ! Disney California AdventureCarthay Circle Lounge Part of the all new Buena Vista Street , Carthay Circle contains a restaurant and two lounges The first lounge , 1901 , is available only to upgraded Club 33 members The other lounge is where you ll be stopping , and there s no reason to be down about this if you re not a Club 33 member \( as is the case with 99 99999999999999999 of the population \) , because this lounge is spectacular The decor is classy and elegant , and most importantly , the lounge has its own unique menu There are several great options on this menu , with different types of custom ice \( seriously \) to boot ! My personal favorite is the Carthay Manhattan Sarah enjoys the Carthay Club Mojito The Aviator Cocktail is a good , strong drink , too Be careful when you step into Carthay Circle Lounge , as this could be the first and last stop on your Disneyland Debauchery Drinking tour That s not necessarily a bad thing , as the drinks here are seriously good Al Fresco Tasting Terrace This location can be difficult to find It s a secluded area upstairs from Wine Country Trattoria If you can t find the staircase leading here , ask a Cast Member It s easier to find than it used to be , since changing over from the Al Fresco Lounge to the Tasting Terrace Now featuring more tasting plates and a robust drink menu , things have improved , as you can read in our Al Fresco Tasting Terrace Review Moreover , the views from this terrace into Cars Land are phenomenal Here , we recommend one of the cheaper wine flights or the Widmer Hefeweizen This is a wine bar , so I d caution against straying from wines and beers We ve never had a good mixed drink here In fact , the Irish Coffee Sarah once ordered here was about the most disgusting thing I ve ever tasted , and was nothing like a traditional Irish Coffee Fortunately , Al Fresco Tasting Terrace has come a long way since then , and it s now one of our favorite spots in DCA Bayside Brews Bayside Brews is located near the Silly Symphony Swings , Golden Zephyr , and Goofy s Sky School Unsurprisingly , it serves beer Although it s just a little stand \( if we stopped at every little beer kiosk in DCA , you d end up in the hospital fear not , this is one of only two that we hit \) , it is notable because it serves good beer as compared to other beer stands in Disneyland We recommend grabbing a Sierra Nevada Torpedo IPA or whatever the Karl Strauss seasonal beer happens to be The Torpedo IPA is definitely your best bet , and possibly the best beer you can find at Disneyland Resort We highly recommend grabbing your brew from Bayside Brews , and then heading over to the actual bayside , to the secluded seating area under Silly Symphony Swings Enjoy your beer there in peace while looking out over the water , and then head upstairs for the ride of your life on the swings ! Cove Bar The next stop is Cove Bar Ahh , Cove Bar In the original version of this Drinking Guide that we published in 2012 , we regaled readers with tales of Cove Bar and its glorious Lobster Nachos Prior to that post , we never had to wait to be seated at Cove Bar , always walking up and having our choice of seats Shortly after that post , Cove Bar exploded in popularity Now , we aren t taking credit for that nor are we taking blame Irrespective of the reason , Cove Bar exploded in popularity , and a contributing factor was undoubtedly viral images of Lobster Nachos and colorful drinks on Instagram and Pinterest Cove Bar began drawing lines rivaling those of Radiator Springs Races The Lobster Nacho Revolution had begun Fortunately , in early 2016 , Disney opened an expanded seating area for Cove Bar , and now the waits have been reduced to more manageable times on most days \( 10 20 minutes \) The bartenders are usually very entertaining and fun at the Cove Bar , so sitting at the bar can also be a good time This should be your second food stop of the day \( you should ve eaten lunch before commencing the Disneyland Drinking Debauchery \) and there is one thing you should absolutely order here the Lobster Nachos As we wrote in our Cove Bar Review , the Lobster Nachos are a zen like experience that makes you feel like there are little angels massaging your taste buds and tickling your stomach a religious experience These are the most expensive thing on the bar menu , but they are so , so delicious My drink of choice here is the Zombie , which can be made a few different ways The bartenders here usually make it a dark green color , but don t be surprised if it s light It does have some fruit juices in it , but it also is heavy on the rum \( light , dark , and 151 \) The Cove Bar also has around 10 beers on tap , so pick one of those if you re not down with the undead concoction Intermission During the intermission , enjoy the Golden Zephyr , Silly Symphony Swings , and , if your stomach can handle it , California Screamin and Goofy s Sky School Return to the Disneyland Drinking Debauchery after enjoying these attractions Intermission The Karl Strauss Beer Truck This beer truck tucked away in Pacific Wharf at Disney California Adventure is our second of two kiosk style stops As the name suggests , this truck serves Karl Strauss beer As Disneyland Resort , for some reason , is very lacking on good craft beers , we recommend making a stop here This should not be read as an endorsement of Karl Strauss beer , but comparatively speaking , it is fairly good Tower 10 IPA and Red Trolley Ale are both good , or go for the seasonal option This is one step we d recommend skipping if you want to drink less and or don t care for beer Alternatively , you can also stop at the nearby Rita s Baja Blenders , Cocina Cucamonga , or Lucky Fortune Cookie for different options Flo s V8 Cafe The latest addition to our list is quite possibly the best stop of all If you ve paced things really slowly , you might be here around sunset That s the perfect time to drink at Flo s ! Grab a Racer 5 IPA and head back to the outdoor seating area at the back of the restaurant Here , you have a perfect view of the Cadillac Mountain Range and Radiator Springs Racers There s nothing quite like an early evening enjoying a beer and watching the cars fly by one of Imagineering s masterpieces You might just find yourself ending your debauchery here , as you get stuck at this spot for a couple of hours Make no mistake even though you re not missing the mission , this is a noble feat On your way to the next stops at Disney s Grand Californian Hotel Spa , pick up FastPasses for \( hopefully \) the late show of World of Color Grand CalifornianHearthstone Lounge Hearthstone Lounge has a pretty good selection of beers , with a lot of the standard choices available elsewhere from Karl Strauss and Sierra Nevada You can also find some choices from Sam Adams and New Castle , among others , here Here , we definitely recommend sitting at the bar or at least ordering from the bar We ve had inexperienced servers here in the general seating area who simply recommend any of the good drinks on the menu with the menu being the Generic DisneyParks Drink Menu I typically opt for a Sierra Nevada here , whereas Sarah usually experiments with whatever bartender s choice These drinks have always tasted great , but beware , they can pack a punch ! Napa Rose Napa Rose is the best non club restaurant at Disneyland Resort It also has a pretty nice bar Luckily , you don t have to drop 50 on some filet to grab a beer here \( although if you see or smell one , you might find yourself doing just that \) I recommend the Franziskaner Hefe Weisses here It s creamy and moderately thick , with a nutty flavor and slight banana undertone to it Napa Rose is more well known for its world class wine collection , so if you re into wine , you might go that route Rather than taking my advice on that , ask the bartender or a server All of the servers here are sommeliers , meaning they know a heck of a lot more about wine than me ! Here , the plan offers some wild card options See the below Other Stops section if you have time in your crawl and want to make an additional stop Hollywood Land Dance Party Insert Name Club There is a drink station set up each night for Mad T Party It was previously End of Line Club , now it s Drink Me Who knows what it will be next Regardless of the name , the idea remains the same pricey light up drinks for clubin While the drinks are fairly expensive \( over 10 for the light up specialties \) here to capitalize on the party oriented audience , ours have always been surprisingly good This is surprising because , given the location and target , we figured these would be watered down sugar drinks The Glowjito Mojito and Digitini Martini are both good and offer light up fun To be fair , they are somewhat sugar y , but the ones we ve had \( on several different nights \) have always had some kick I don t know if this is just great luck or if it s always this way After grabbing a drink , join the other programs or tweedle dums \( \? \) at elecTRONica or Mad T Party Once the dance party concludes , use your FastPass for the late show of World of Color Trader Sam s Enchanted Tiki Bar After World of Color , the perfect way to cap off the evening is at the best bar in all of Disneyland Resort , Trader Sam s If you want a thorough review of Trader Sam s , read this review where I offer heaping amounts of praise to Trader Sam s The CliffNotes version Trader Sam s is the coolest bar in Disneyland , with an intimate \( 47 person capacity \) location that is packed with an astonishing amount of detail , interactive elements , and some fantastic drinks Some of these drinks include the Adventurers Club Kungaloosh \( a Walt Disney World classic \) , the HippopotoMai Tai , Shrunken Zombie Head , Tiki Tiki Tiki Tiki Tiki Rum , Shipwreck on the Rocks , and the Uh Oa ! The Uh Oa ! can be shared by 2 4 people , has a cool tableside presentation , and is our favorite drink at Trader Sam s Trader Sam s does serve some good beers as well , but this is one location where you should stick to mixed drinks because they re really that good If you stay for only one drink , you can add items in from the Other Stops list below , but we recommend spending a couple hours here soaking up the ambiance and ending your night here It s the perfect conclusion to Disneyland Drinking Debauchery Other Stops There are other places you can stop , but chances are , even with taking it slow and spreading out the festivities over the course of the entire day , eight stops will be the limit \( or even too much \) for most people The stops above are our picks for the best drinking spots in Disneyland However , since we heavily weigh ambiance , there might be some additional or alternative places that might appeal more to you personally , depending upon your preferences Here s our list of the best of the rest",true

"Medicaid funding casts shadow over New Yorkers amid DC political dramaSaturdayJul 15 , 2017 at 7 41 PM Jul 15 , 2017 at 7 41 PMChris McKenna Times Herald Record ChrisMcKenna845One of the biggest things at stake for New Yorkers in the political drama in Washington over the fate of the Affordable Care Act is its impact on funding for Medicaid , a program that now provides health coverage for almost 165 , 000 residents of Orange , Ulster and Sullivan counties more than a quarter of the population Republican proposals to repeal and replace the 2010 law , better known as Obamacare , would affect health care in a multitude of ways It would lift the mandate that Americans have insurance , change the subsidies that help some pay for it , and cause the number of people with coverage to plunge by as much as 23 million over the next decade , according to the Congressional Budget Office But the aspects that have generated the most political friction , and that might affect the most people , in New York are those dealing with Medicaid The government insurance program expanded its reach under the Affordable Care Act and now covers nearly one in three New Yorkers Pending bills in Congress would cut or cap New York 's Medicaid funding in four separate ways Jason Helgerson , the state 's Medicaid director , told the Times Herald Record last week that he estimates those changes , once fully phased in , could cost the state as much as 8 billion or 9 billion a year , for a program that costs 65 5 billion this year The result is a sharp debate over Medicaid 's role and cost and the effect that Trumpcare would have on its beneficiaries and on hospitals in New York Helgerson argues the cuts would reverse coverage gains New York has made and have a devastating effect on upstate hospitals and the local economies they support Medicaid is the biggest payer of health care services in New York , he said , arguing that reducing that funding would force hospitals to lay off employees or even close In rural areas where those operations are the largest employers , the impact could trigger a ripple effect on the economy , Helgerson said Rep John Faso , the Republican freshman whose district includes Ulster and Sullivan counties , has been prominent in the debate because of a bill amendment he sponsored that would force New York to stop requiring its counties outside New York City to shoulder part of the Medicaid expenses He argues that the federal government must slow Medicaid 's spending growth because the current pace is not sustainable , and that New York would adjust to the changes without the dire consequences that Gov Andrew Cuomo and other critics predict But he also suggests the Medicaid program itself has grown beyond its original purpose and now covers more people than it should We now have about one third of New York 's population on Medicaid , Faso said Some people in Albany may look upon that as an accomplishment I look upon that as a failure Local impactFrom Warwick to Woodstock , from Newburgh to Callicoon , households and a variety of institutions rely on Medicaid to pay for costly services It pays for child births and dental care and diabetes drugs in densely populated areas where poverty is concentrated , places like Newburgh and Kiryas Joel , but also in largely rural areas like Sullivan County , where one in three residents is enrolled in Medicaid It pays for services for people with disabilities , such as children with autism at the Center for Spectrum Services in Kingston and Ellenville It is a primary funding source for the elderly and infirm living in 21 nursing homes with 3 , 100 total beds in Orange , Ulster and Sullivan counties It pays for addiction treatment in the midst of a national heroin and prescription pill epidemic Frank Petrucci , a 28 year old Warwick resident who suffers from a rare , debilitating disease , relies on Medicaid to pay the 50 , 000 bill each time he goes to the hospital for an intravenous drug treatment to prevent his condition from getting worse , at intervals of six weeks or two months Without those treatments , the disease is likely to progress and make him more and more incapacitated , taking away his ability to take care of himself , drive and work part time A national rower before his ailment set in , Petrucci coaches several times a week at the East Arm Rowing Club in Greenwood Lake Whether and how a reduction in Medicaid funding would affect his coverage is uncertain Petrucci , who has closely watched the legislative debate as it unfolds in Washington , said he 's covered now because of his low income If the state is forced to curtail eligibility for his income level , could he qualify instead because of his disability \? Would he have to allow his condition to worsen without treatment until he was disabled enough \? Would the wait for disability coverage require him to go even longer without treatment \? If that 's removed , then my world becomes a smaller place , Petrucci said , referring to the loss of mobility he would likely suffer What he knows for sure is that he 's an expensive patient and probably will remain so for many years I'm young , and this disease is most likely a lifelong disease , he said Heated debateThe amendment Faso sponsored with Rep Chris Collins would force the state to absorb the 2 3 billion that 57 counties now spend on Medicaid or else cut that amount from its spending Faso argues that imposing a cost share on New York 's counties when Medicaid began 51 years ago was a bad mistake , one that now helps drive up property taxes and cause residents to leave New York Shifting the counties' expense to Albany is restoring responsibility , he said Faso contends the state could shoulder that responsibility by cutting waste and fraud from Medicaid and other unnecessary state spending He dismissed Cuomo 's contention that the state might recover the lost revenue from its counties in some other manner , saying the Legislature would never approve it It 's time for him to man up and do what 49 other governors have done , Faso said On a broader level , Faso said that increased dependence on Medicaid is not a desirable thing , and that government should be striving to get people into private insurance It was not meant to be an insurance policy for able bodied adults , he said Helgerson counters that at a time when fewer employers give their workers health insurance , Medicaid has helped the state cut its rate of uninsured residents in half , a feat it celebrates without apology Does Congressman Faso want to double the uninsured rate in New York \? he asked Bill Hammond , director of health policy for the Albany based Empire Center for Public Policy , said he sympathizes with Republicans' quest to control Medicaid spending , which he said is growing faster than our ability to pay He also agreed with Faso that New York 's Medicaid program contains a fairly large amount of waste as any public or private insurance program does But he pointed out that cutting Medicaid spending to absorb the county costs would have a double impact , since the state would then lose a dollar for dollar amount in federal funding And he argued that the legislation under debate in Washington would have to offer Medicaid enrollees enough financial support for private insurance to make that a reasonable alternative It 's just unreasonable for them to find a couple thousand dollars a year to buy health insurance , Hammond said Rep Sean Patrick Maloney , the Cold Spring Democrat whose district includes Orange County , argues that Republicans undermined their rationale for cutting Medicaid spending growth as a fiscal necessity by proposing to eliminate two taxes on high income earners in the same legislation Their position would have more integrity , he said , if the savings had been used to balance the budget This whole thing is a scheme to cut taxes for the rich , he said Maloney applauded the drop in New York 's uninsured rate to 4 5 percent from 9 5 percent and said 55 , 000 people in his district alone had gotten coverage through the Medicaid expansion Maybe John Faso thinks too many people have health care , he said I do n't cmckenna th record comChoose the plan that 's right for you Digital access or digital and print delivery",true

"The Golden Arches Theory of Conflict Prevention was proposed by economist Thomas Friedman as a way of explaining how globalization affects foreign policy and conflict Essentially , the Theory points out that no two countries that both have McDonalds franchises have ever gone to war The reasoning behind this correlation , Friedman says , is that once economies become sufficiently integrated , both the cost of going to war and the amount of contact between two countries will increase Both these factors lead to more effective conflict resolution , as states will attempt to pursue the more economically beneficial option Friedman s argument echoes the main suppositions of the democratic peace theory , which states that democracies never go to war Friedman s analysis simply takes this argument further in his economic emphasis , although he places a similar amount of emphasis on the role of domestic society in influencing a government s willingness to go to war Problems with the Golden Arches Theory The Golden Arches Theory has not held true in all cases , and explanations to explain these inconsistencies vary In some cases , the increased contact between two countries due to integration may actually exacerbate points of contention between the two states , leading to more opportunities for conflict Or , the difference may lie in the type of government in power a democratic government may follow the Golden Arches Theory , but the Theory may break down when confronted with cases of nondemocratic or authoritarian regimes The Golden Arches Theory assumes that governments respond to the desires of their constituents for economic stability and that the government knows it will be held accountable in the case that it does not provide for the economic well being of its citizens In the case of an authoritarian or nondemocratic state , leaders may not experience these dilemmas , causing them not to act in accordance with the Golden Arches Theory 1",false

"Young Thomas Edison NPS PhotoThomas Alva Edison was born on February 11 , 1847 in Milan , Ohio the seventh and last child of Samuel and Nancy Edison When Edison was seven his family moved to Port Huron , Michigan Edison lived here until he struck out on his own at the age of sixteen Edison had very little formal education as a child , attending school only for a few months He was taught reading , writing , and arithmetic by his mother , but was always a very curious child and taught himself much by reading on his own This belief in self improvement remained throughout his life Edison began working at an early age , as most boys did at the time At thirteen he took a job as a newsboy , selling newspapers and candy on the local railroad that ran through Port Huron to Detroit He seems to have spent much of his free time reading scientific , and technical books , and also had the opportunity at this time to learn how to operate a telegraph By the time he was sixteen , Edison was proficient enough to work as a telegrapher full time The development of the telegraph was the first step in the communication revolution , and the telegraph industry expanded rapidly in the second half of the 19th century This rapid growth gave Edison and others like him a chance to travel , see the country , and gain experience Edison worked in a number of cities throughout the United States before arriving in Boston in 1868 Here Edison began to change his profession from telegrapher to inventor He received his first patent on an electric vote recorder , a device intended for use by elected bodies such as Congress to speed the voting process This invention was a commercial failure Edison resolved that in the future he would only invent things that he was certain the public would want Edison moved to New York City in 1869 He continued to work on inventions related to the telegraph , and developed his first successful invention , an improved stock ticker called the Universal Stock Printer For this and some related inventions Edison was paid 40 , 000 This gave Edison the money he needed to set up his first small laboratory and manufacturing facility in Newark , New Jersey in 1871 During the next five years , Edison worked in Newark inventing and manufacturing devices that greatly improved the speed and efficiency of the telegraph He also found to time to get married to Mary Stilwell and start a family In 1876 Edison sold all his Newark manufacturing concerns and moved his family and staff of assistants to the small village of Menlo Park , twenty five miles southwest of New York City Edison established a new facility containing all the equipment necessary to work on any invention This research and development laboratory was the first of its kind anywhere the model for later , modern facilities such as Bell Laboratories , this is sometimes considered to be Edison 's greatest invention Here Edison began to change the world Edison 's first phonograph 1877 NPS PhotoThe first great invention developed by Edison in Menlo Park was the tin foil phonograph The first machine that could record and reproduce sound created a sensation and brought Edison international fame Edison toured the country with the tin foil phonograph , and was invited to the White House to demonstrate it to President Rutherford B Hayes in April 1878 Edison next undertook his greatest challenge , the development of a practical incandescent , electric light The idea of electric lighting was not new , and a number of people had worked on , and even developed forms of electric lighting But up to that time , nothing had been developed that was remotely practical for home use Edison 's eventual achievement was inventing not just an incandescent electric light , but also an electric lighting system that contained all the elements necessary to make the incandescent light practical , safe , and economical After one and a half years of work , success was achieved when an incandescent lamp with a filament of carbonized sewing thread burned for thirteen and a half hours The first public demonstration of the Edison 's incandescent lighting system was in December 1879 , when the Menlo Park laboratory complex was electrically lighted Edison spent the next several years creating the electric industry In September 1882 , the first commercial power station , located on Pearl Street in lower Manhattan , went into operation providing light and power to customers in a one square mile area the electric age had begun An early sketch from a laboratory notebook of an electric lightbulb NPS PhotoThe success of his electric light brought Edison to new heights of fame and wealth , as electricity spread around the world Edison 's various electric companies continued to grow until in 1889 they were brought together to form Edison General Electric Despite the use of Edison in the company title however , Edison never controlled this company The tremendous amount of capital needed to develop the incandescent lighting industry had necessitated the involvement of investment bankers such as J P Morgan When Edison General Electric merged with its leading competitor Thompson Houston in 1892 , Edison was dropped from the name , and the company became simply General Electric This period of success was marred by the death of Edison 's wife Mary in 1884 Edison 's involvement in the business end of the electric industry had caused Edison to spend less time in Menlo Park After Mary 's death , Edison was there even less , living instead in New York City with his three children A year later , while vacationing at a friends house in New England , Edison met Mina Miller and fell in love The couple was married in February 1886 and moved to West Orange , New Jersey where Edison had purchased an estate , Glenmont , for his bride Thomas Edison lived here with Mina until his death When Edison moved to West Orange , he was doing experimental work in makeshift facilities in his electric lamp factory in nearby Harrison , New Jersey A few months after his marriage , however , Edison decided to build a new laboratory in West Orange itself , less than a mile from his home Edison possessed both the resources and experience by this time to build , the best equipped and largest laboratory extant and the facilities superior to any other for rapid and cheap development of an invention The new laboratory complex consisting of five buildings opened in November 1887 A three story main laboratory building contained a power plant , machine shops , stock rooms , experimental rooms and a large library Four smaller one story buildings built perpendicular to the main building contained a physics lab , chemistry lab , metallurgy lab , pattern shop , and chemical storage The large size of the laboratory not only allowed Edison to work on any sort of project , but also allowed him to work on as many as ten or twenty projects at once Facilities were added to the laboratory or modified to meet Edison 's changing needs as he continued to work in this complex until his death in 1931 Over the years , factories to manufacture Edison inventions were built around the laboratory The entire laboratory and factory complex eventually covered more than twenty acres and employed 10 , 000 people at its peak during World War One \( 1914 1918 \) After opening the new laboratory , Edison began to work on the phonograph again , having set the project aside to develop the electric light in the late 1870s By the 1890s , Edison began to manufacture phonographs for both home , and business use Like the electric light , Edison developed everything needed to have a phonograph work , including records to play , equipment to record the records , and equipment to manufacture the records and the machines In the process of making the phonograph practical , Edison created the recording industry The development and improvement of the phonograph was an ongoing project , continuing almost until Edison 's death While working on the phonograph , Edison began working on a device that , does for the eye what the phonograph does for the ear , this was to become motion pictures Edison first demonstrated motion pictures in 1891 , and began commercial production of movies two years later in a peculiar looking structure , built on the laboratory grounds , known as the Black Maria Like the electric light and phonograph before it , Edison developed a complete system , developing everything needed to both film and show motion pictures Edison 's initial work in motion pictures was pioneering and original However , many people became interested in this third new industry Edison created , and worked to further improve on Edison 's early motion picture work There were therefore many contributors to the swift development of motion pictures beyond the early work of Edison By the late 1890s , a thriving new industry was firmly established , and by 1918 the industry had become so competitive that Edison got out of the movie business all together The success of the phonograph and motion pictures in the 1890s helped offset the greatest failure of Edison 's career Throughout the decade Edison worked in his laboratory and in the old iron mines of northwestern New Jersey to develop methods of mining iron ore to feed the insatiable demand of the Pennsylvania steel mills To finance this work , Edison sold all his stock in General Electric Despite ten years of work and millions of dollars spent on research and development , Edison was never able to make the process commercially practical , and lost all the money he had invested This would have meant financial ruin had not Edison continued to develop the phonograph and motion pictures at the same time As it was , Edison entered the new century still financially secure and ready to take on another challenge Edison 's new challenge was to develop a better storage battery for use in electric vehicles Edison very much enjoyed automobiles and owned a number of different types during his life , powered by gasoline , electricity , and steam Edison thought that electric propulsion was clearly the best method of powering cars , but realized that conventional lead acid storage batteries were inadequate for the job Edison began to develop an alkaline battery in 1899 It proved to be Edison 's most difficult project , taking ten years to develop a practical alkaline battery By the time Edison introduced his new alkaline battery , the gasoline powered car had so improved that electric vehicles were becoming increasingly less common , being used mainly as delivery vehicles in cities However , the Edison alkaline battery proved useful for lighting railway cars and signals , maritime buoys , and miners lamps Unlike iron ore mining , the heavy investment Edison made over ten years was repaid handsomely , and the storage battery eventually became Edison 's most profitable product Further , Edison 's work paved the way for the modern alkaline battery By 1911 , Thomas Edison had built a vast industrial operation in West Orange Numerous factories had been built through the years around the original laboratory , and the staff of the entire complex had grown into the thousands To better manage operations , Edison brought all the companies he had started to make his inventions together into one corporation , Thomas A Edison Incorporated , with Edison as president and chairman Edison was sixty four by this time and his role with his company and in life began to change Edison left more of the daily operations of both the laboratory and the factories to others The laboratory itself did less original experimental work and instead worked more on refining existing Edison products such as the phonograph Although Edison continued to file for and receive patents for new inventions , the days of developing new products that changed lives and created industries were behind him In the 1915 , Edison was asked to head the Naval Consulting Board With the United States inching closer towards the involvement in World War One , the Naval Consulting Board was an attempt to organize the talents of the leading scientists and inventors in the United States for the benefit of the American armed forces Edison favored preparedness , and accepted the appointment The Board did not make a notable contribution to the final allied victory , but did serve as a precedent for future successful cooperation between scientists , inventors and the United States military During the war , at age seventy , Edison spent several months on Long Island Sound in a borrowed navy vessel experimenting on techniques for detecting submarines Edison 's role in life began to change from inventor and industrialist to cultural icon , a symbol of American ingenuity , and a real life Horatio Alger story In 1928 , in recognition of a lifetime of achievement , the United States Congress voted Edison a special Medal of Honor In 1929 the nation celebrated the golden jubilee of the incandescent light The celebration culminated at a banquet honoring Edison given by Henry Ford at Greenfield Village , Ford 's new American history museum , which included a complete restoration of the Menlo Park Laboratory Attendees included President Herbert Hoover and many of the leading American scientists and inventors The last experimental work of Edison 's life was done at the request of Edison 's good friends Henry Ford , and Harvey Firestone in the late 1920s They asked Edison to find an alternative source of rubber for use in automobile tires The natural rubber used for tires up to that time came from the rubber tree , which does not grow in the United States Crude rubber had to be imported and was becoming increasingly expensive With his customary energy and thoroughness , Edison tested thousands of different plants to find a suitable substitute , eventually finding a type of Goldenrod weed that could produce enough rubber to be feasible Edison was still working on this at the time of his death During the last two years of his life Edison was in increasingly poor health Edison spent more time away from the laboratory , working instead at Glenmont Trips to the family vacation home in Fort Myers , Florida became longer Edison was past eighty and suffering from a number of ailments In August 1931 Edison collapsed at Glenmont Essentially house bound from that point , Edison steadily declined until at 3 21 am on October 18 , 1931 the great man died Last updated February 26 , 2015",false
"Gen Vo Nguyen Giap is perhaps the most important figure in the early history of communist Vietnam with the exception of Ho Chi Minh At the end of World War II , Ho named Giap commander in chief of the Viet Minh forces fighting French colonial rule Giap orchestrated the defeat of the French at the battle of Dien Bien Phu in 1953 and remained minister of defense of the newly independent Democratic Republic of Vietnam He was the chief North Vietnamese military leader in the subsequent war against U S forces This interview , which was conducted in May 1996 , has been translated from Vietnamese On the battle of Dien Bien Phu The Dien Bien Phu campaign is a great and first victory of a feudal colonial nation , whose agricultural economy is backward , against the great imperialist capitalist which has a modern industry and a great army Thus , it means a lot to us , to people all over the world , and to other countries This is also how Ho Chi Minh saw it We see the Dien Bien Phu victory as the victory over the French army and over the intervention of the Americans because in the Dien Bien Phu campaign , 80 percent of the war expenditures were spent by the Americans The Americans had their hands in it So the Dien Bien Phu defeat was a defeat for both the French and the Americans But whether the Americans had drawn the lessons from that , I do n't think so That 's why the Americans continued in South Vietnam When we received news of the Dien Bien Phu victory , everyone practically jumped up in the air , they were so happy about it But Ho Chi Minh said that this is only victory of the first step we have yet to fight the Americans It was very clear then On the United States' involvement in Vietnam In 1945 , some Americans parachuted into our war zone for a meeting with our late President Ho Chi Minh Back then , President Roosevelt 's attitude was that the U S did not want to see events like the war with France coming back to Indochina , but later this attitude was changed After the August Revolution in 1945 , the relationship between Vietnam and the U S could have been good , and we wished that it had been good Then only the intelligent people or those with vision and wisdom , such as Eisenhower , saw the impracticality of the domino theory And any mistakes were due to following the domino theory They thought that if the theory was put into practice here , it would become the pivotal location for preventing the spread of communism to the whole Southeast Asia So Vietnam was made the central location to check the expansion of communism , and this was what President Kennedy believed , and it was mistake The Americans sent advisers to each and every division in the South Vietnamese army before 1965 In 1965 , they started to commit big forces We discussed among ourselves in the Politburo whether at that point it was a limited war We decided that it was already a limited war We discussed it in the Politburo that with America bringing in gigantic forces was to carry out a new campaign , with the American forces committed , it was not good for America but it would be very hard for us to fight The struggle would be very fierce but we already concluded that we would win the war On fighting technologically superior U S forces When American combat forces were committed , it was a myth that we could not fight and win because they were so powerful We survived because of our courage and determination , together with wisdom , tactics and intelligence During the attacks of B 52s , we shot down a few B 52s and captured documents One of them was a order by the U S air command about the targets to be bombed in and around Hanoi and the positions of our forces Some of the figures were correct , but some were wrong because of our deception measures And our conclusion was that with such anti air power measures , the B 52 is not an effective way to fight We had to resort to different measures , some of which are quite simple , like hiding in man holes and evacuating to the countryside And we fought back with all our forces and with every kind of weapon We fought with anti aircraft artilleries and with small guns , even though it was sometimes solely with the strength of our local force An 18 year old girl once said that she followed routes every day and studied the patterns of American flights and when they would attack I told her that she is a philosopher to understand that , because only philosophers talk about principles Later she used small gun to shoot down an aircraft from a mountainside That is an example of the military force of the common people We had ingenuity and the determination to fight to the end I appreciated the fact that they had sophisticated weapon systems but I must say that it was the people who made the difference , not the weapons There was also a human factor involved As to whether they were tempted to use nuclear weapons during the war there was a time during the Dien Bien Phu campaign in which the Americans were going to use nuclear weapons , and this is back in 1954 during the Eisenhower era We were also aware of possible use of nuclear weapons and we were prepared for it But whether the Americans could really use nuclear weapons was a question of international politics , and it also depended on the American allies But looking at the intertwined forces , as the situation was , the result of a nuclear blast would not be good , and the Americans had to think hard If nuclear weapons were used on locations where the Vietnamese troops were concentrated , it would also affect American troops On the Ho Chi Minh Trail The Ho Chi Minh Trail was a very extensive system it started with a trail but later became a road Many roads , actually the Western road system and the Eastern road systems , criss crossing here and there And also there were the extensive systems of gas pipelines and communications lines , and routes on rivers and across the sea We did everything possible to keep the whole system going I visited many important points which were subjected to many B 52 bombings 23 out of 24 hours a day we had many teams working toward maintaining the operation , including a team made up of women who had to use iron rings to defuse the unexploded bombs We made big sacrifices I visited a dozen girls who maintained the route in Dong Lap of Nghe An Province they showed me how they invented camouflage to cover the lamps so that those in vehicles can see , but the planes could not see They urged us to move fast and they all died during the bombing There was danger of the trail being cut off , but it never really was cut off With a long procession of vehicles , and with the bombing from the B 52s , it was very difficult , but we had to use both courage and wisdom There are some routes that the Americans did not know about , but if they had used a telescope they would have seen the routes quite clearly But we did not use those routes We used some secret smaller trails as a detour and we went during the day On the Tet Offensive The Tet Offensive is a long story It was our policy , drawn up by Ho Chi Minh , to make the Americans quit Not to exterminate all Americans in Vietnam , but to defeat them It could be said Tet was a surprise attack which brought us a big victory For a big battle we always figured out the objectives , the targets , so it was the main objective to destroy the forces and to obstruct the Americans from making war But what was more important was to de escalate the war because at that time the American were escalating the war and to start negotiations So that was the key goal of that campaign But of course , if we had gained more than that it would be better And after Tet the Americans had to back down and come to the negotiating table , because the war was not only moving into the cities , to dozens of cities and towns in South Vietnam , but also to the living rooms of Americans back home for some time And that 's why we could claim the achievement of the objective On the U S leadership during the war In general , I must say they were the most intelligent people , with certain talents such as military , political and diplomacy skills They were intelligent people That was the first point that I want to say The second point I want to say is that they knew little about Vietnam and her people They did n't understand our will to maintain independence and equality between nations even though these are stated in President Jefferson 's manifestation And so they made mistakes They did not know the limits of power No matter how powerful you are there are certain limits , and they did not understand it well The people in the White House believed that Americans would definitely win and there is not chance of defeat There is a saying which goes , If you know the enemy and you know yourself , you would win every single battle However , the Americans fought the Vietnamese , but they did not know much about Vietnam or anything at all about the Vietnamese people Vietnam is an old nation founded in a long history before the birth of Christ The Americans knew nothing about our nation and her people American generals knew little about our war theories , tactics and patterns of operation During the war everyone in the country would fight and they would do so following the Vietnamese war theory We have a theory that is different from that of the Russians and that of the Americans The Americans did not understand that They did not know or understand our nation they did not know our war strategies They could not win How could they win \? As our president said , there was nothing more precious than independence and freedom We had the spirit that we would govern our own nation we would rather sacrifice than be slaves Now that the normalization between our two countries have been established , we hope for better relations , but it should be based on equality Otherwise , if America is at advantage simply because she is richer , it will be unacceptable for us Now we hope that American leaders can understand Vietnam and her people better",false
"While the volcano cooling venture may create a lucrative power generating opportunity , it could also potentially cause a catastrophic eruption NASA scientists have reportedly designed a way to avert a disaster which may threaten mankind s continued existence the threat of Yellowstone supervolcano eruption Brian Wilcox of the NASA s Jet Propulsion Lab explained to BBC that the US space agency plans to drill up to 10km down into the supervolcano , and pump down water at high pressure , thus slowly extracting heat from it You would have to give the geothermal companies incentives to drill somewhat deeper and use hotter water than they usually would , but you would pay back your initial investment , and get electricity which can power the surrounding area for a period of potentially tens of thousands of years And the long term benefit is that you prevent a future supervolcano eruption which would devastate humanity , he explained Wilcox also remarked that the drilling project must be handled with utmost care as a slightest mistake might actually trigger the eruption the scientists are trying to prevent As BBC points out , a powerful supervolcano eruption might trigger a prolonged volcanic winter , with the resulting crop failure putting mankind on the brink of starvation as food reserves worldwide would last 74 days , according to the 2012 UN estimates He noted that while the cost of this venture is estimated at 3 46 billion , it may also present an interesting investment opportunity as the volcano , which currently leaks around 6GW in heat , can be essentially converted into a huge geothermal plant which would generate electric power at extremely competitive prices of around 0 10 kWh",false
"Three people remain in custody after being arrested on Saturday morning following a traffic stop in Canton In what was described by Lt Paul Sullivan as the most bizarre traffic stop that he has seen in his 23 years on the force , Canton police responded to a report of a disabled vehicle traveling on Route 95 They came across the vehicle shortly after 2 a m traveling in the high speed lane on the southbound side We spotted the green Hyundai Elantra traveling at approximately five miles per hour in the passing lane with a huge shower of sparks coming from the rear of the vehicle As we got closer we noticed that the rear end of the vehicle was dragging on the ground due to the fact that there were no rear tires or axle on the vehicle , said Lt Sullivan of the Canton Police After the vehicle pulled over , we approached it and found that the driver was not only drinking a can of beer , but that he was not wearing any pants and that he had urinated on himself After not one , but two , brief foot chases , Francis Fasher , 45 , of Foxboro , was placed under arrest There were also two female passengers in the back seat , stated Lt Sullivan One of the females was asleep , partially clad The other was extremely hysterical At that time , we believed that she might have been under the influence of PCP , due to the fact that she claimed there were mice biting at her and climbing on her Because of the size of the two women , police were unable to pull the women out of the rear doors of the vehicle After members of the Canton Rescue Squad cut the roof off the vehicle , and with the help of a crane supplied by Shaugnessy Crane , the women were lifted out of the car Police estimate the weight of each woman was between 300 and 450 pounds Shortly after being extracted from the vehicle , the two women began arguing with each other and blows were thrown At that point , police arrested 17 year old Tina Pebbles Zonfrelli of Foxboro and 56 year old Donna Dyers of Lynn We followed the drag marks and found that the axle and tires had separated from the vehicle some four miles back The axle , wheels and tires were found in the parking lot of the Ancient Mariner Lounge located in Foxboro , stated Canton police officer James C West At this time we believe that the three individuals had patronized the Mariner Lounge for the better part of the day , and that at closing time , they decided to continue the party at Mr Fasher s apartment Upon entering the vehicle , the combined weight of the occupants caused the axle and wheels to separate from the vehicle It is unbelievable that an individual could drive over four miles and not realize that there were no rear tires on the car , says West During the search of the vehicle , police came up with an unexpected find The interior of the vehicle was very messy There were beer cans , food wrappers , rib bones , and other rubbish in the car Under the driver s seat we found a nest of mice I guess she did see a mouse , West chuckled Police charged Fasher with driving while intoxicated , indecent exposure , urinating in public , disturbing the peace , failure to stay in marked lanes , destruction of public property , assaulting a police officer , driving an unregistered motor vehicle , driving an uninsured motor vehicle , non payment of child support , public intoxication , evading police , passengers not wearing seat belts , transporting lab animals without proper permits and contributing to the delinquency of a minor We ve been after this guy for quite some time , said West Mr Fasher is well known to us He is a renowned transvestite , and he s been arrested a number of times for prostitution In June of 1998 , he was arrested six times in one week In fact , three of those arrests occurred on one day Fasher faces a number of complaints from business owners in Canton and charges have been filed against him by a number of citizens in the community Four people have filed civil damage lawsuits against him after their private property was damaged by Fasher One person has alleged that he had sex with her prize winning French poodle in her backyard Jimmy Chan , owner of Golden China restaurant claims that he assaulted an employee and caused damages to his establishment He drink all morning , said Chan He get crazy I tell him no more beer for you and he throw Pu Pu platter at waitress He a very bad man He broke very expensive mirror !

Internet to Manipulate , Deceive , and Destroy Reputations July 13 , 2016 Assassination Of Top US Democratic Party Official Leads To FBI Capture Of Clinton Hit Team By Sorcha Faal , and as reported to her Western Subscribers A somber Foreign Intelligence Service \( SVR \) report circulating in the Kremlin today says that a top American Democratic Party staffer preparing to testify against Hillary Clinton was assassinated this past Sunday during a secret meeting in Washington D C he believed he was having with Federal Bureau of Investigation \( FBI \) agents , but who turned out , instead , to be a hit team and who , in turn , were captured yesterday after a running gun battle with US federal police forces just blocks from the White House Note Some words and or phrases appearing in quotes are English language approximations of Russian words phrases having no exact counterpart According to this report , SVR electronic specialists performing counter intelligence missions operations noted on 7 July an enormous gigantic increase of computer and telephonic traffic between the Democratic National Committee \( DNC \) headquarters in Washington D C and the Clinton Foundation \( CF \) offices in New York City Upon a deeper broader investigation into this odd strange increase in communications between these believed to be separate organizations , this report continues , SVR analysts determined that the original initiating person responsible was a 27 year old DNC official named Seth Rich who was that political organizations Deputy Director Data for Voter Protection Expansion who had helped develop a computer program for the Democratic National Committee allowing people to type in their address and get a map to their polling place DNC official Seth Rich , assassinated 10 July 2016 What had drawn the concern of DNC official Seth Rich causing him to contact the Clinton Foundation , this report explains , was his discovery of a pay to play scheme that involved people seeking jobs with a new Hillary Clinton presidential administration to funnel money to the Clinton s through their foundation with various US federal government positions being designated by the dollar amount it would cost to buy them As the cash for favors lifestyle of both former President Bill Clinton and Hillary Clinton have long been known about , this report continues , SVR analysts , while preparing to document the results of their 7 July probe into the Clinton Foundation concerns of DNC official Seth Rich , became alarmed when they discovered that his micro computer system \( cell phone \? \) had become infected virused by killers assassins working for the Clinton s and who the SVR had previously documented as being involved in the assassination of the husband of the State of Georgia prosecutor investigating Bill Clinton for child sex crimes and the murder of American pop singer Christina Grimmie and massacre of nearly 50 gay pride celebrants Fearing that the life of DNC official Seth Rich was in danger due to his being tracked targeted by this known Clinton hit team , this report says , SVR Director Mikhail Fradkov authorized an emergency contact between his agency and the US State Department but , and shockingly , when Russian diplomats presented the SVR findings to US authorities , on 7 July , they were immediately expelled from the United States Causing even greater perplexity to the SVR about these events , this report continues , was that in expelling these Russian diplomats from the United States , the US State Department thanked Russia for the information stating that it would be taken care of , and then formally requested that the matter remain secret However , less than 24 hour later , this report notes , the Washington Post wrote a made up story about what had actually happened causing Deputy Foreign Minister Sergey Ryabkov to publically state I can confirm that the US government did demand the departure of two employees of the Russian Embassy in Washington DC without presenting any complaints to the employees themselves Furthermore , the State Department strongly asked us not to make this fact public As you can see , it is customary for American diplomats to keep their word Three days later , this report grimly states , SVR fears that the life of DNC official Seth Rich was in danger proved true when , on 10 July , he was gunned down in Washington D C at approximately 4 19 am According to the official US police report of DNC official Seth Rich s murder , this report explains , it says Detectives from the Metropolitan Police Department s Homicide Branch are investigating a fatal shooting that occurred in the 2100 block of Flagler Place , Northwest on Sunday , July 10 , 2016 At approximately 4 19 am , members of the Fifth District were patrolling the area when they heard gunshots Upon arrival on the scene , members located an adult male victim conscious and breathing , and suffering from gunshot wounds The victim was transported to an area hospital , where he succumbed to his injuries and was pronounced dead This SVR report , though , says that DNC official Seth Rich was lured enticed to his murder by this Clinton hit team who portrayed themselves as FBI agents wanting to secretly interview him and that the expelled Russian diplomats had given the US State Department electronic access to so that they could be found Curiously , this report continues , US authorities , and while being able to track this Clinton hit team since 7 July , only confronted these assassins yesterday and who before being captured , engaged in a gun battle with US federal police forces firing their fully automatic weapons before being trapped and surrendering just blocks from the US Capitol and White House Clinton hit team captured by US federal police forces on 12 July 2016 SVR intelligence analysts contributing to this report speculate that this latest assassination ordered by the Clinton s has enraged FBI Director James Comey who barely a week ago allowed Hillary Clinton to walk free from her many crimes committed against her own government and people and that he had no choice to do because of his own involvement with the Clinton Foundation while he was the director of the notorious HSBC money laundering bank that funneled hundreds of millions of dollars to the Clinton s FBI Director , and former HSBC Director , James Comey To what FBI Director Comey will now allow to happen to this Clinton hit team who assassinated DNC official Seth Rich this report doesn t speculate upon but it does conclude with a presentation of the many stunning facts regarding the Clinton Foundation that shows it to be nothing more than a Clinton slush fund that violated an agreement Hillary Clinton signed with Obama regime in her failing to report millions of dollars given to it by foreign governments , has over 300 , 000 contributors , and that the prestigious Charity Navigator organization

Little else about the 20 minute show was remarkable which was the most remarkable thing about it Without much gusto , he covered the French election \( Marnie Le Pen \) and conservative commentator Ann Coulter s feud with the University of California at Berkeley \( a place I would never in a million years go to \) Interesting , he said of the Berkeley issue Very , very interesting To show just how interesting it was , he followed with a long um Frankly , I could have used a little , um , spin In what I take as an ominous sign , the word of the day flashed in a banner atop the O Reilly website The word on Monday was sciolistic , which means concerned with or comprehending only what is apparent or obvious not deep or penetrating emotionally or intellectually Was some dastardly young web editor trolling O Reilly \? Or was O Reilly nobly unspinning himself \? The latter is unlikely Like the man in the Oval Office , O Reilly never backs down when presented with evidence of his own misconduct or deception To the contrary , both men puff up their chests and grow indignant , mistakenly thinking that they stand on high ground , when they are in fact treading along the crumbling edge of a cliff I m very confident the truth will come out , O Reilly said at the opening of his podcast It already has , Bill",false

"Grandma Beats Up Airport Security Guards by Bob Wallace Charges were dropped yesterday against Ruth Grammy Gordon , an 83 year old wheelchair bound grandmother , who was originally charged with assault and battery , and assault with a deadly weapon , because an altercation she had last week with six airport security guards , that left all six hospitalized Justice has been served , said the 95 pound mother of three and grandmother of six , as she sat in her wheelchair , aided in her breathing by an oxygen bottle Now I m going to sue every fool in the federal government for ignorance , stupidity , and just plain general incompetence I m an American , and I won t be treated like this The problem began last month as Gordon was attempting to board an airplane at the R J Squirrel Airport in Frostbite Falls , Minnesota These guys are supposed to be some kind of professionals , she said , but they re dumber than rocks Here they were letting guys who looked just like terrorists walk through without searching them , and then they pull me aside and tell me they re going to search me \? I don t think so According to one witness , Bud Cort of Cuyahoga Falls , Ohio , one guard , who weighed about 300 pounds , looked like he was drunk , and had his shirt out , told this woman she couldn t board the plane unless they searched her He was really rude That s when the trouble started Videotapes showed that Gordon ran the guard down with her motorized wheelchair , then sat on top of the screaming man while spinning her chair in circles Doofus was so fat he couldn t get up , said Gordon with a giggle One guard who attempted to pull Gordon s wheelchair off of the screaming man from behind was hit over the head with an oxygen bottle and knocked unconscious A third guard , who approached Gordon from the front , was also left dazed on the floor Witnesses said she was cackling , Put your hands on an old lady , will you \? as she bashed both guards The tape also showed a fourth guard attempting to grab Gordon s wheelchair Gordon removed a knitting needle from her purse and stabbed him in his left buttock What a wimp , she told reporters He started screaming and grabbing his butt and running like a puppy that someone kicked It was amazing , said another witness , Scott Ryan , also of Cuyahoga Falls , a professor of music at Ohio Express University and author of Yusef Islam Cat Stevens Declawed The whole crowd just stood there cheering and clapping I mean , she was whupping butt A fifth guard that attempted to grab Gordon had the seat of his pants set on fire with a cigarette lighter than had escaped detection He just went whoosh across the concourse , screaming and slapping at all these flames flying out of his rear , said Ryan A sixth guard did finally manage to get Gordon in a body hug I think that was the wrong thing to do , said another witness , who declined to be identified She just grabbed him by his greasy hair with one hand and cracked him across the jaw with her skinny fist And down and out he went After all this , Gordon s chair was still sitting on top of the first guard The tapes clearly showed her leaning over and yelling , Apologize to me , you fat sumbitch , or when I m done with you you ll just be a greasy spot on the floor ! As the crowd roared , the guard cried , I m sorry , I m sorry ! Uncle ! I won t do it again ! Finally , Gordon surrendered without further incident , and was taken to jail and released on her own recognizance We didn t have any choice , said an unidentified officer of the court Over 200 people showed up to support her I think if we had demanded bail , there would have been a riot Over 20 lawyers offered to defend her for free However , realizing the precariousness of the case , Gordon was not charged with anything I doubt there s a jury in the whole country that would have found her guilty of anything , said one of the lawyers I m flying again tomorrow , Gordon told reporters And I suggest no one at the airport so much as look at me wrong All six guards , employees of the Bullwinkle Security Company , were taken to Badanov Hospital , treated for minor injuries , and released All of them are okay , said their doctor , who identified herself only as Natasha Just very minor injuries The owner of the security firm , a Mr Big , said he considered his employees to be fearless leaders May 27 , 2002 Bob Wallace send him mail , a former newspaper reporter and editor , and an incurable lover of puns , lives in St Louis Copyright 2002 LewRockwell com Bob Wallace Archives LewRockwell com needs your help Please donate",false

Last time I checked , Las Vegas is still in the United States And in the United States , we have something called The First Amendment This constitutional right gives everyone here the right to say whatever they want to say All Americans hold this right as sacred Many of our young people put on a uniform and risk their lives to defend it My film is all about asking the questions that should have been asked before those brave soldiers were sent into harms way For you to throw Linda Ronstadt off the premises because she dared to say a few words in support of me and my film , is simply stupid and Un American Frankly , I have never heard of such a thing happening I read that you would n't even let her go back up to her room at your hotel ! Are you crazy \? For crying out loud , it was a song DEDICATION ! To Desperado ! Every American loves that song ! Sure , some people did n't like the dedication , and that 's their right But neither they nor you have the right to remove her from your building when all she did was exercise her AMERICAN right to speak her mind Of all the things that go on in Las Vegas , this is what creates the need for serious action \? What about the other half of the crowd at the Aladdin who , according to the Las Vegas Sun , cheered her when she made her remarks \? Did you throw them out , too \? I think you owe Ms Ronstadt an apology And I have an idea how you can make it up to her and to the millions of Americans you have offended Invite her back and I 'll join her in singing America the Beautiful on your stage Then I will show Fahrenheit 9 11 free of charge to all your guests and anyone else in Las Vegas who wants to see it Mr Timmins , as the song Desperado says Come to your senses ! How can you refuse this offer \? I await your reply Yours , Michael Moore Director , Fahrenheit 9 11 Response July 21 , 2004 Attention Michael Moore , In response to your letter dated July 20 , 2004 You are correct that I had security remove Linda Ronstadt from Aladdin Casino and Hotel where the fun never ends and everybody wins How very interesting to learn you are such a fan of Ms Ronstadt You questioned where I live and surprisingly knew Las Vegas is in the United States You should visit it sometime There are thousands of wonderful 'All You Can Eat' buffets There are also a lot of casinos who 's owners do n't around I am aware of the First Amendment and you have the right to talk about your hatred of America but once you are on my property and you are upsetting my guests , you will quickly learn about my rights I ca n't remember if it was Jesus or George W Bush that said , Freedom is a two way street Ms Ronstadt learned this long before I had her thrown out of my casino You question my actions \? If you come onto my property and upset my guests , you will receive the same , if not worse , treatment than Ms Ronstadt received I am sure your mere presence would upset my guests You claim you film , is all about asking the questions that should have been asked before those brave soldiers were sent into harms way I think you film does nothing but aid the enemy and hurt our troops You have betrayed our troops , our leader and America I have no respect for you or your vision of what America should be I paid Ms Ronstadt to entertain my guests , not divide them The half that did not leave probably thought the verse you mentioned , Why do n't you come to your senses was addressed to you Maybe she should have dedicated her song , 'You 're No Good' to you I would have asked her back , had she done that Regarding your request for me to apologize to her , have you and her on my stage singing anything about this Country and then playing your piece of film is ludicrous ! One of my workers is currently throwing away every complaint letter from brainless followers of you , claiming they will never visit my Casino I could not be more pleased to know my casino and hotel will always be void of the kind of people who support you Meanwhile , my hotel has been quickly booked solid for the rest of the year with true Americans who love this Country and support our efforts overseas They will see a framed copy of your letter and my response in the lobby to ensure they begin their experience with a laugh Sincerely , Bill Timmins President Aladdin Casino and Hotel Las Vegas , NV TOPICS News Current Events Political Humor Cartoons KEYWORDS aladdin aladdincasino boycottaladdin boycotthollywood defundtheleft lasvegas lindaronstadt lumpyriefenstahl michaelmoore michaelmoore411 mikhailmoore notgenuine politicalhumor proterrorist satire Linda Rongstance got what she deserved !

"New York , NY People voting for Bernie Sanders in today s New York primary are seeing their ballots changed to show a vote for Hillary Clinton Calls began flooding in early this morning to New York based ABC affiliate WGRZ with reports of voting machines across the state switching votes entered for Democrat Bernie Sanders to his establishment counterpart Hillary Clinton The station has spoken with multiple witnesses and is in the process of verifying statements from voters Upstate \( districts 20 , 21 , 22 and 24 \) as well as two of the five boroughs \( Bronx and Manhattan \) According to one witness identified as Jason Jones from Manhattan , It was the strangest thing The machine literally would not allow me to vote Bernie I have been a Bernie supporter since he launched his campaign and have absolutely no reason to vote for Shillary I have heard the same from several others coming out of the voting booth Seems like the establishment will stop at nothing to keep this out of the hands of Bernie Brian Johnston , a volunteer and self professed Hillary supporter who is overseeing the voting at the 9th district , had this to say , These allegations have no basis in reality If Sanders supporters cannot figure out how to use a voting machine maybe they shouldn t be voting All eyes have been focused on New York as many pundits view the state as critical to the momentum of the Sanders campaign Members of the establishment , including the head of the Democratic National Committee , Debbie Wasserman Schultz , have been accused of conspiring with the Clinton camp to stop Mr Sanders from earning the delegates needed to secure the parties nomination According to polling , Ms Clinton is ahead in the state and is riding a wave of support based on her history with the State As of presstime , no response has yet been released by either the Sanders or the Clinton campaigns This is a breaking story Please check back for updates",false
"These , then , were the underlying misconceptions of late 20th century futurists Their flawed analysis led , in turn , to the five great economic trends that observers in 1996 should have expected but did n't Soaring Resource Prices The first half of the 1990 's was an era of extraordinarily low prices for raw materials In retrospect , it is hard to see why anyone thought that situation would last When two billion Asians began to aspire to Western levels of consumption , it was inevitable that they would set off a scramble for limited supplies of minerals , fossil fuels and even food In fact , there were danger signs as early as 1996 A surge in gasoline prices during the spring of that year was prompted by an unusually cold winter and miscalculations about Middle East oil supplies Although prices soon subsided , the episode should have reminded people that industrial nations were once again vulnerable to disruptions of oil supplies But the warning was ignored Quite soon , however , it became clear that nat ural resources , far from becoming irrelevant , had become more crucial In the 19th century , great fortunes were made in heavy industry in the late 20th , they were made in technology today 's super rich are , more frequently , those who own prime land or mineral rights The Environment as Property In the 20th century , people used some quaint expressions ''free as air , '' ' 'spending money like water'' as if the supplies of air and water were unlimited But in a world where billions of people can afford cars , vacations and food in plastic packages , the limited carrying capacity of the environment had become perhaps the single most important constraint on the standard of living By 1996 , it was obvious that one way to cope with environmental limits was to use market mechanisms In the early 1990 's , the Government began to allow electric utilities to buy and sell rights to emit certain kinds of pollution the principle was extended in 1995 when the Government began auctioning rights to the electromagnetic spectrum Today , of course , practically every environmentally harmful activity carries a hefty price tag It is hard to believe that as late as 1995 , an ordinary family could fill up a Winnebago with 1 a gallon gasoline , then pay only 5 for admission to Yosemite Today , that trip would cost about 15 times as much , even after adjusting for inflation Once governments got serious about making people pay for pollution and congestion , income from environmental licenses soared License fees now account for more than 30 percent of the gross domestic product , and have become the main source of Government revenue after repeated reductions , the Federal income tax was finally abolished in 2043 Advertisement Continue reading the main story The Rebirth of the Big City During the second half of the 20th century , the densely populated , high rise city seemed to be in unstoppable decline Modern telecommunications eliminated much of the need for physical proximity in routine office work , leading more and more companies to shift back office operations to suburban office parks It seemed as if cities would vanish and be replaced with a low rise sprawl punctuated by an occasional cluster of 10 story office towers Newsletter Sign Up Continue reading the main story Please verify you 're not a robot by clicking the box Invalid email address Please re enter You must select a newsletter to subscribe to Sign Up You will receive emails containing news content , updates and promotions from The New York Times You may opt out at any time You agree to receive occasional updates and special offers for The New York Times 's products and services Thank you for subscribing An error has occurred Please try again later View all New York Times newsletters But this proved transitory For one thing , high gasoline prices and large fees for environmental licenses made a one person , one car commuting pattern impractical Today , the roads belong mostly to hordes of share a ride minivans efficiently routed by computers Moreover , the jobs that had temporarily flourished in the suburbs mainly office work were eliminated in vast numbers beginning in the mid 90 's Some white collar jobs migrated to low wage countries others were taken over by computers The jobs that could not be shipped abroad or be handled by machines were those that required a human touch face to face interaction between people working directly with physical materials In short , they were jobs done best in dense urban areas , places served by what is still the most effective mass transit system yet devised the elevator Here again , there were straws in the wind At the beginning of the 1990 's , there was speculation about which region would become the center of the ballooning multimedia industry Would it be Silicon Valley \? Los Angeles \? By 1996 , the answer was clear The winner was Manhattan , whose urban density favored personal interaction , which turned out to be essential Today , of course , Manhattan boasts almost as many 200 story buildings as St Petersburg or Bangalore The Devaluation of Higher Education In the 1990 's , everyone believed that education was the key to economic success A college degree , even a postgraduate degree , was essential for anyone who wanted a good job as one of those ' 'symbolic analysts '' But computers are proficient at analyzing symbols it is the messiness of the real world that they have trouble with Furthermore , symbols can be transmitted easily to Asmara or La Paz and analyzed there for a fraction of the cost in Boston Therefore , many of the jobs that once required a college degree have been eliminated The others can be done by any intelligent person , whether or not she has studied world literature This trend should have been obvious in 1996 Even then , America 's richest man was Bill Gates , a college dropout who did not need a lot of formal education to build the world 's most powerful information technology company Or consider the panic over ' 'downsizing'' that gripped America in 1996 As economists quickly pointed out , the rate at which Americans were losing jobs in the 90 's was not especially high by historical standards Downsizing suddenly became news because , for the first time , white collar , college educated workers were being fired in large numbers , even while skilled machinists and other blue collar workers were in demand This should have signaled that the days of ever rising wage premiums for people with higher education were over Somehow , nobody noticed Eventually , the eroding payoff of higher education created a crisis in education itself Why should a student put herself through four years of college and several years of postgraduate work to acquire academic credentials with little monetary value \? These days , jobs that require only 6 or 12 months of vocational training paranursing , carpentry , household maintenance and so on pay nearly as much as if not more than a job that requires a master 's degree , and pay more than one requiring a Ph D So enrollment in colleges and universities has dropped almost two thirds since its peak at the turn of the century The prestigious universities coped by reverting to an older role Today a place like Harvard is , as it was in the 19th century , more of a social institution than a scholarly one a place for children of the wealthy to refine their social graces and befriend others of their class Advertisement Continue reading the main story The Celebrity Economy This century 's last great trend was noted by acute observers in 1996 , yet most people failed to appreciate it While business gurus were proclaiming the new dominance of creativity and innovation over mere production , the growing ease with which information was transmitted and reproduced made it harder for creators to profit from their creations Nowadays , if you develop a marvelous piece of software , everyone will have downloaded a free copy from the Net the next day If you record a magnificent concert , bootleg CD 's will be sold in Shanghai next week If you produce a wonderful film , high quality videos will be available in Mexico City next month How , then , could creativity be made to pay \? The answer was already becoming apparent a century ago creations must make money indirectly by promoting sales of something else Just as auto makers used to sponsor grand prix racers to spice up the image of their cars , computer manufacturers now sponsor hotshot software designers to build brand recognition for their hardware The same is true for individuals The royalties that the Four Sopranos earn from their recordings are surprisingly small the recordings mainly serve as advertisements for their concerts The fans attend these concerts not to appreciate the music \( they can do that far better at home \) , but for the experience of seeing their idols in person In short , instead of becoming a knowledge economy we became a celebrity economy Luckily , the same technology that has made it possible to capitalize directly on knowledge has also created many more opportunities for celebrity The 500 channel world is a place of many subcultures , each with its own heroes Still , the celebrity economy has been hard on people especially for those with a scholarly bent A century ago , it was actually possible to make a living as a more or less pure scholar Now if you want to devote yourself to scholarship , there are only three choices Like Charles Darwin , you can be born rich Like Alfred Wallace , the less fortunate co discoverer of evolution , you can make your living doing something else and pursue research as a hobby Or , like many 19th century scientists , you can try to cash in on a scholarly reputation by going on the lecture circuit But celebrity , though more common , still does not come easily That is why writing this article is such an opportunity I actually do n't mind my day job in the veterinary clinic , but I have always wanted to be a full time economist an article like this may be just what I need to make my dream come true",true

"According to nonpartisan experts , the new health care reform lawwill extend coverage to 32 million Americans and cut the deficit by 143 billion over 10 years But as with any major new law , thereare many reasonable questions people have about how it affects themand their families And , unfortunately , there are also many questions and concernsabout the new law based on misinformation For example , I have beenasked a number of times why senators and their staff will not becovered by the law The answer is , they will be That is just oneof the many questions about the new law that I hear at my listeningsessions and from constituents So to help answer these questions and correct some of themisinformation I hear about the bill , here are some frequentlyasked questions along with answers I currently purchase my own insurance Will this bill force meinto a public plan \? No The health care law does not create a public plan If you likethe plan you purchase , the health care reform bill does not forceyou to change it Now that the health care bill has become law , what about myhealth care coverage will change \? The most immediate change as a result of the new health carereforms is that people will be able to enjoy new consumerprotections like not being dropped from coverage if you get sick , no lifetime limits on benefits and yearly caps on what insurancecompanies can charge you for out of pocket expenses If you arelike the majority of Americans who get their health care coveragethrough work , you will not see any big changes If you havespecific questions , you may want to discuss them with yourinsurance company or your employer What will this do to the cost of my private insuranceplan \? For Wisconsinites who purchase health care on the individual market \( i e , people who do not get insurance through their employer \) , experts believe this reform will lower premiums by 14 percent to 20percent compared to what the same plan would cost without healthcare insurance reform by 2016 If I ca n't afford to purchase insurance will I be fined \? No The new law includes subsidies to help individuals to purchasehealth insurance through exchanges In the rare occasion it isstill unaffordable , even with the subsidies , you will not be fined The law extends coverage to 32 million Americans who do n't haveinsurance Can I keep both my private insurance and my Medicare \? Under the new law , anyone can keep Medicare and a privatesupplemental plan Some people are saying that this new law would add trillions ofdollars to our debt and raise taxes on families and smallbusinesses by more than 500 billion Is that true \? The nonpartisan Congressional Budget Office has stated the new lawwill reduce our national deficits by 143 billion over the first 10years and as much as 1 2 trillion over the next 10 years Thoseare the facts Middle class families will benefit from the largestmiddle class tax cut ever by receiving subsidies to purchase healthinsurance and new consumer protections against health insuranceabuses More than 77 , 000 small businesses in Wisconsin alone willbenefit from tax credits to purchase health insurance for their ownfamilies and employees Do these new exchanges give Americans the same health carechoices as members of Congress \? Yes A number of Wisconsinites have expressed concern about theidea that members of Congress may be exempted from health carereform I am pleased that that is not the case Currently , membersof Congress , like other federal employees including everyone frompostal workers to custodial staff have access to affordableinsurance purchased through a federal exchange The healthinsurance exchanges set up by this new law will operate in asimilar manner to make sure that all Americans in the exchangeshave access to good , affordable , health care choices Under the newlaw , Sen Russ Feingold and his staff will be required to purchasetheir health insurance in the new state exchanges once thoseexchanges are operating \( Sec 1312 of PPACA , pages 157 and158 \) How does the new law make health care affordable \? Because of this new law , 541 , 000 Wisconsinites who are uninsuredand 320 , 000 Wisconsinites who purchase health insurance through theindividual market will have access to better and more affordableinsurance Furthermore , this bill provides tax credits for up to358 , 000 Wisconsinites to help make health insurance moreaffordable , bringing 5 8 billion in premium and cost sharing taxcredits into Wisconsin during the first five years of the healthinsurance exchange Will this new law cost jobs \? Actually , it could create thousands of new jobs By slowing thegrowth rate of health care costs , it will be more profitable forbusinesses to expand employment The state exchanges set up by thisnew law also help ensure that entrepreneurs are not prevented fromlaunching a new business because they ca n't afford the cost ofcare One analysis predicts that this slowing of the growth ratewill lead to anywhere between 5 , 600 and 9 , 000 new jobs each year inWisconsin I 've been told this new law is terrible for small businesses Isthat true \? Where small businesses make up 76 percent of Wisconsin businesses , less than 38 percent of them are able to offer health insuranceright now Because of this new law , more than 77 , 000 smallbusinesses in Wisconsin could receive a tax credit making healthcare coverage for employees more affordable I keep hearing that this new law will be paid for through endingwaste , fraud and abuse in our health care system What does thatmean \? According to the non partisan experts at the Congressional Budget Office , because ofthis new law , over the next 10 years , our national deficit willdecrease by 143 billion and up to 1 2 trillion in the following10 years Those savings come from a number of cost containmentprovisions A major one is reimbursing physicians based on thequality of care they provide rather than the quantity of care Thisis called value based health care purchasing , and it will helpreward some of the high quality care provided by hospitals andmedical groups around Wisconsin such as the Marshfield Clinic , Gundersen Lutheran and Franciscan Skemp Hospitals will be held accountable to reduce preventable hospitalreadmissions and preventable health care acquired infections Increasingly , their payments will be linked to improving theirquality and the outcomes of their care Physicians will also bepaid based on quality of care and not on the volume of servicesthey provide This will curb the ordering of unnecessary tests andprocedures that can be very expensive A new Independent PaymentAdvisory Board will identify ways to lower costs , improve outcomes , promote quality and expand access to evidence basedcare We will also save billions over the next decade through cutting thecost of drugs purchased through Medicaid One example is aprovision of Feingold 's Control Spending Now Act , included in thenew health care bill The government is able to purchase drugsincluded under the fee for service component of Medicaid at adiscounted price The new health care law extends the ability topurchase discounted drugs to managed care organizations to providetreatment to Medicaid beneficiaries CBO estimates this change willsave 11 billion over 10 years I'm a Medicare beneficiary with high prescription drug costs howdoes this new law help me \?

"The Supreme Court ruled this week to uphold a North Dakota voter identification law which requires that voters present an ID which includes a residential address in order to vote , potentially restricting the rights of Native Americans in the state who do not have residential addresses The law , signed by Republican Gov Doug Burgum in 2017 , had been blocked by a U S District Court which found it to be discriminatory towards the state 's Native American population The Eighth Circuit overturned that ruling , and the Supreme Court upheld the circuit court 's decision , with only Justices Ruth Bader Ginsburg and Elena Kagan dissenting The two noted in their dissent that this ruling was confusing because voters who used their identification to vote in the primaries could now find that same identification insufficient , because the injunction against requiring residential address identification was in force during the primary election and because the secretary of state 's website announced for months the ID requirements as they existed under that injunction Native Americans living on reservations often do not have residential addresses , but have IDs which feature P O boxes Native Americans are North Dakota 's largest minority population , comprising over 5 percent of the state 's population This Supreme Court ruling could significantly affect the re election chances of Democratic Sen Heidi Heitkamp , who is trailing Republican opponent Kevin Cramer in polling Heitkamp won her seat by just under 3 , 000 votes in 2012 , with the help of Native American voters If a few thousand Native American voters lack the necessary identification and are unable to vote , that could damage Heitkamp in a close race However , it is possible to obtain a residential address before Election Day , according to a Facebook post by the organization Native Vote ND , which encourages voter participation by Native Americans in the state Individuals can reach out to their county 's 911 coordinator to begin the process of having a residential address assigned They can then describe where their homes are located , enabling coordinators to assign addresses The office assigning the addresses will provide letters upon request to confirm each individual 's new address The voter can use this letter to obtain a new ID , or as proof of a residential address for voting purposes If you encounter anyone who says to you that they do not have a residential street address to provide to either the DOT Posted by Native Vote ND on Monday , October 1 , 2018 Native Americans did not obtain the right to vote in the United States until 1965 , when the Voting Rights Act was passed , prohibiting voter restriction based on race",true

"Matt Taibbi , the star magazine writer hired earlier this year to start a satirical website for billionaire Pierre Omidyar s First Look Media , is on a leave of absence from the company after disagreements with higher ups inside Omidyar s organization , a source close to First Look confirmed today \( UPDATE Taibbi has left the company Taibbi s abrupt disappearance from the company s Fifth Avenue headquarters has cast doubt on the fate of his highly anticipated digital publication , reportedly to be called Racket , which First Look executives had previously said would launch sometime this autumn When he was hired , amid much fanfare , Taibbi s website was meant to be the second in an envisioned fleet of titles to be published by First Look , an ambitious digital journalism company funded by Omidyar , the founder of eBay and one of the richest tech moguls in America Like its counterpart the Intercept , launched earlier this year by Glenn Greenwald and others to pursue investigations of NSA surveillance and the intelligence world , it was a venture centered around a brand name polemicist without much management experience Prior to joining First Look , Taibbi made his name by gleefully skewering fat targets for Rolling Stone most famously , he described Goldman Sachs as a great vampire squid wrapped around the face of humanity and he said at the time of his departure that he was lured away by the chance to lampoon the financial industry in the simultaneously funny and satirical voice associated with the legendary magazine Spy Over the succeeding months , the mission of the publication broadened to encompass political satire as well , and it brought on a number of high profile names from the New York digital scene , including deputy editor Alex Pareene , formerly of Salon Laura Dawn , a digital video producer who formerly worked with Moveon org and Edith Zimmerman , editor of the Hairpin Journalists should be dark , funny , mean people , Taibbi told New York in an interview in March Omidyar originally conceived of First Look as a network of interlinking sites run by independent journalists , many of whom took a similarly adversarial approach to journalism Over the last year , however , the center of gravity of the organization has shifted , as Omidyar and his Silicon Valley braintrust have exerted control over budgets and vacillated over the journalistic mission Over the summer , Omidyar appointed a longtime confidante , John Temple a former newspaper editor who previously led an Omidyar financed civic journalism venture in Hawaii to be the president for audience and products , putting him in a position above Eric Bates , the former Rolling Stone editor who was brought on as a First Look editorial director , who is close to Taibbi The confrontational approach that made Taibbi s name at Rolling Stone and before that , as a co founder of the gonzo Moscow expatriate magazine The eXile appears to have contributed to internal trouble at First Look Sources confirmed that Taibbi has been absent from the office for several weeks , only returning on one brief occasion to address the staff Although those hired have been reassured that the project would continue on during the unspecified term of Taibbi s absence , the launch date for Racket which Taibbi indicated in September would be coming in a month now appears to have been pushed off We have a target date but I wouldn t make a launch date public , said Temple , who is based in San Francisco , when reached by phone this morning I don t comment about internal matters and I don t comment on personnel matters Taibbi s absence is only the latest in a series of shifts inside First Look , which Omidyar founded last year , originally in response to the disclosures of NSA surveillance leaked by Edward Snowden to Greenwald and his Intercept colleague Laura Poitras Omidyar initially committed 250 million to the project and began laying plans for a large general interest website and a number of more narrowly focused digital magazines In July , the billionaire announced he was scaling back the plan for the time being , choosing instead to focus on Racket and the Intercept as prototypes for a new technological model of journalism The Intercept has lately been publishing vigorously , breaking several major stories federal investigators are reportedly pursuing the alleged leaker responsible for a story on the site about the government s voluminous terrorist watch list But Racket has been much slower to materialize , leading to rumors of staff anxiety In August , Temple told me Taibbi s site was experimenting with a variety of journalistic approaches not just satire and humor but also investigative journalism For instance , Ellen Miller , head of the campaign finance watchdog the Sunlight Foundation a nonprofit also heavily financed by Omidyar met with the staff over the summer to discuss how it might dig into issues of money in politics We re supporting Matt in creating something unique and it s Matt s , Temple told me Taibbi s clashes with those at the top are likely to drive further speculation about the fate of the long incubating project and about the journalist s own continued involvement Nonetheless , the site is apparently still hiring UPDATE Omidyar announced on Tuesday night that Taibbi has left the company I regret to announce that after several weeks of discussions , Matt Taibbi has left First Look We wish him well Our differences were never about editorial independence We have never wavered from our pledge that journalistic content is for the journalists to decide , period We re disappointed by how things have turned out I was excited by Matt s editorial vision and hoped to help him bring it to fruition Now we turn our focus to exploring next steps for the talented team that has worked to create Matt s publication I remain an enthusiastic supporter of the kind of independent journalism found at The Intercept and the site we were preparing to launch As a startup , we ll take what we ve learned in the last several months and apply it to our efforts in the future Above all , we remain committed to our team and to the First Look mission",true
"Seven employees of a nursing home for elderly people were arrested by the FBI this morning in Charlottesville , Virginia , for forcing the elders under their care to fight each other According to investigators , the 124 residents of the Retirement Village were forced to fight each other in order to obtain basic things such as food and medical treatments The fights were filmed and relayed online on a specialized website , where they often attracted several thousand viewers and astounding amounts of money in bets FBI spokesman , Bill Donovan , says the most popular fights were the ones in which contenders were armed with canes or walkers The older and more handicapped the fighters were , the larger was the crowd the fight attracted Some were so weak they used mobility scooters to try and roll on each other Officer Donovan says the staff used several different methods to force the residents to fight , either by through rewards or punishment The nursing home s staff forced the elders to beat each other up very badly , offering ridiculous rewards such as Jell O or extra mashed potatoes Some residents who refused to fight had their dentures or glasses confiscated until they complied According to the FBI , the organizers of this illegal combat ring may have pocketed over 125 million over the 3 years it was in operation , mostly from online bets The FBI confirmed it has seized a lot of computer hardware in the Retirement Village as well as several other pieces of evidence like video cameras blood covered walkers The two owners of the retirement home and five other employees were arrested for the role they played in the organization The five employees each face numerous criminal charges and could face sentences going from 45 to 85 years in jail if found guilty on all charges The owners of the retirement home , Terence and Michelle Aniston , respectively face 37 and 31 accusations and could face over 300 years in prison Their trial is expected to begin at the end of June and should draw a lot of media attention",false
"Memphis , TN A group of volunteers cleaning up the shores of the Mississippi River near the biggest city in Tennessee have stumbled upon the remains of an ancient boat encrusted in mud A team of archeologists from the University of Memphis that was rapidly called to the site , confirmed that the ship is most certainly a Viking Knarr , suggesting the Norse would have pushed their exploration of America a lot further than historians previously thought The heavily damaged ship was found near the confluence of the Wolf and Mississippi rivers and lies on a private property It has a length of about 16 meters , a beam of 4 5 meters , and a hull that is estimated capable of carrying up to 24 to 28 tons , a typical size for this type of ship Knarrs were naval vessels that were built by the Norsemen from Scandinavia and Iceland for Atlantic voyages but also used for trade , commerce , exploration , and warfare during an era known as the Viking Age , that goes approximately from 793 to 1066 AD They were clinker built , which means the overlapping of planks riveted together It was capable of sailing 75 miles \( 121 km \) in one day and held a crew of about 20 to 30 men This new discovery could be one of the oldest evidence of pre Columbian trans oceanic contact , and it certainly brings to mind the famous colony of Vinland mentioned in the Icelandic Sagas This mythical colony would have been established by Leif Ericson around the same period as the settlement at l Anse aux Meadows , in the Canadian province of Newfoundland and Labrador , the most famous site of a Norse or Viking settlement in North America outside Greenland Butternuts found in the Newfoundland site had already suggested that the Norse had explored the continent because they do not grow naturally north of the Canadian province of New Brunswick , hundreds of kilometers away from any known Viking settlement The carbon dating of the new ship estimates that it dates from between 990 and 1050 AD , approximately the period associated with Vinland and the various Canadian sites \( L Anse aux Meadows , Tanfield Valley , Avayalik Islands \) This could mean that the that the Viking had actually developed a far wider trade network in the Americas that what was traditionally believed Unfortunately , very few other artifacts have yet been found on the site , suggesting the crew must have most likely abandoned the ship and continued on foot More searches are to be expected in the area over the next few years , as scientists will now certainly try to look for any artifacts or historical traces that could lead them to understand what happened to the crew of the ship Many myths from local native tribes will also be analyzed by historians from the team to see if they could hold useful information , as both Chickasaw and Choctaw mythologies include many stories of fights against red haired devils",false
"The Republican war on women continues unabated The same week that conservatives argued in the Supreme Court that employers should be able to stop their employees from getting contraception outside of the company health plan , Indiana joined the ranks of states like Texas and Florida in passing a draconian law that purports to protect women , while in fact , endangering their health by making safe abortion much harder to get And Gov Mike Pence recently signed it The bill is stuffed with as many asinine restrictions on abortion with an eye towards making abortion as miserable and humiliating an experience as possible , and ideally something women can t get legally at all Asked to comment on his approval of a piece of legislation that basically promotes hatred towards women once stripped of all the legal terms , Pence argued in an interview with The Huffington Post that abortion as such was a mistake since the day it was first invented So , let s get that straight right away I oppose abortion for any reason whatsoever because I believe that killing someone , or something , if you will , that hasn t developed a consciousness just yet is the ultimate act of crime And if we re murderers of innocent beings who can t defend themselves , how are we to expect people with a fully developed consciousness to stop murdering each other \? the Indiana governor said And as if that wasn t enough , Pence continued , we ve got this situation now throughout different states where some lawmakers allow abortion under some circumstances like rape or when the fetus is diagnosed with an illness , and others just flat out prohibit it And that s bad for a number of reasons First and foremost we can t have this kind of freedom of choice This is bad , let s be clear And that s part of the reason why I signed this bill , because I believe abortion , or I m going to flat out call it murder , this murdering of children has to stop and it has to be prohibited in every state So Indiana is just a step in the right direction Pence also tried to offer his opinion on what would have happened had he allowed rape victims to still have abortion First and foremost , because this is such a sensitive topic , let me just say that I sympathize with rape victims not just in America , but around the world I can only imagine what it must be like to experience such trauma , he said However , that does not justify murder , not even that justifies murdering a baby , not in my book Because what would happen \? We d then have an epidemic of women claiming to have been raped just so they could have an abortion And that has to be stopped at all cost Donald Trump s new running mate also said , Basically , if I d have said no on the bill , that would be just like giving out get pregnant without fear cards , because at the end of the day , women could have unprotected sex without worrying about what they d do in the event of pregnancy And you know , it s not supposed to be like that That would be equal to me picking up a butcher s knife and slicing people open in the middle of the street That would be murder And I m not a murderer And it gets worse when you get an abortion , you get several days off of work and whatnot to recover And there are a lot of crazy people out there What if women would go out and get raped on purpose just so they could get off work \? I mean , Indiana s economy is struggling as it is , and having thousands of women absent from their jobs would be horrific for the state , I m telling you I made the right call and that will be confirmed in the long run , Pence concluded",false

"What s genius for Obama is scandal when it comes to TrumpBy Ben Shapiro , opinion contributor 03 20 18 09 15 AM EDTThe views expressed by contributors are their own and not the view of The Hill On Sunday , The Guardian reported on the supposedly nefarious workings of President TrumpDonald John Trump Four takeaways from Heitkamp and Cramer 's tense final Senate debate Obama takes jab at Trump Nobody in my administration got indicted Lawyer for mail bomb suspect s family 'He found a father in Trump' MORE s data gathering team at Cambridge Analytica The report suggested that Cambridge Analytica had essentially issued questionnaires through a third party those questionnaires , which were personality quizzes , requested that you use your Facebook login Cambridge Analytica then compiled data regarding those who completed the quiz and cross referenced that data with political preferences in order to target potential voters This isn t particularly shocking In 2012 , The Guardian reported that President Obama s reelection team was building a vast digital data operation that for the first time combines a unified database on millions of Americans with the power of Facebook to target individual voters to a degree never achieved before ADVERTISEMENTWhat , exactly , would Obama be doing \? According to The Guardian , Obama s new database would be gathered by asking individual volunteers to log into Obama s reelection site using their Facebook credentials Consciously or otherwise , The Guardian states , the individual volunteer will be injecting all the information they store publicly on their Facebook page home location , date of birth , interests and , crucially , network of friends directly into the central Obama database Facebook had no problem with such activity then They do now There s a reason for that The former Obama director of integration and media analytics stated that , during the 2012 campaign , Facebook allowed the Obama team to suck out the whole social graph Facebook was surprised we were able to suck out the whole social graph , but they didn t stop us once they realized that was what we were doing She added , They came to the office in the days following election recruiting were very candid that they allowed us to do things they wouldn t have allowed someone else to do because they were on our side Not so with Trump As soon as Facebook realized that Cambridge Analytica had pursued a similar strategy , they suspended the firm Again , this isn t surprising Since Trump s election , Democrats in search of a rationale for their favored candidate s defeat have blamed a bevy of social media outlets Senate Democrats trotted out pathetic Russian created memes on Facebook , viewed by a handful of human beings , as an excuse for Hillary s loss Democrats claimed without evidence that fake news had swamped Facebook and thus led to Trump s victory Democrats have also insisted that Facebook be regulated Sen Dianne FeinsteinDianne Emiel Feinstein The unintended perils of investigating Kavanaugh Overnight Energy Groups want Senate to probe Interior watchdog controversy Puerto Rico eyes plan for 100 percent clean energy Dems say Congress already rejected part of EPA car emissions plan Dems Congress rejected part of Trump s car emissions rollback MORE \( D Calif \) raged , You ve created these platforms , and now they re being misused , and you have to be the ones to do something about it Or we will Facebook s former privacy manager called for the government to step into an oversight role regarding Facebook In February , Wired magazine ran a cover story specifically dealing with Facebook s role in the election of 2016 , and their subsequent attempts to fix the problem After the election , Mark ZuckerbergBarack Hussein Obama Obama takes jab at Trump Nobody in my administration got indicted Trump creates national monument in Kentucky Election Countdown Latest glimpse at fundraising highlights Dem edge Cook moves Menendez race to toss up Heated Missouri Senate debate O'Rourke scrambling to win Latino voters Bloomberg spending big for Dem candidates DNC talks 2020 debates MORE , apparently in an attempt to convince Obama that he was serious about stopping the misuse of the platform And in February , Zuckerberg said he wanted to re jigger the algorithms on his platform to benefit content that Facebook deems trustworthy , informative , and local Wired celebrated You can t make the world more open and connected if you re breaking it apart The result of Facebook s algorithmic changes conservatives have been slammed And that s the point A study from The Western Journal found that conservative sites have lost an average of 14 percent of their Facebook traffic leftist sites saw a minor increase Even major publications saw that effect The New York Daily News saw a bump of 24 18 percent , while the New York Post dropped 11 44 percent And that s the goal in covering Cambridge Analytica , and Russian interference on Twitter , and all the rest even without any serious information suggesting that such interference shifted votes , the left can rest assured that its Silicon Valley allies will act to de platform Republicans and conservatives There s a reason Twitter has suspended alt right racists but continued to recommend that others follow Louis Farrakhan there s a reason YouTube is being sued by Prager University there s a reason Google used automatic fact checking on right wing sites but did no such thing for left wing sites We re in the midst of a radical reshifting in social media Ironically , the people who have stumped against regulation conservatives are those being targeted by social media companies If companies like Facebook , YouTube , Google and Twitter don t start acting like platforms again rather than like motivated left wing outlets , Republicans likely won t let principle outweigh practicality for long Ben Shapiro \( BenShapiro \) , a lawyer and conservative commentator , is founder and editor in chief of The Daily Wire The author of seven books , he hosts a daily political podcast , The Ben Shapiro Show",false

"Main content starts below Photo Luke Sharrett Bloomberg via Getty ImagesEmployers are often unwilling to hire someone convicted of a crime That 's a problem and it needs to change Published onSign in to follow this author56th Governor of New York StateBy Governor Andrew M Cuomo and Jostein Solheim , CEO of Ben Jerry sEmployers can often be hesitant to hire someone with a criminal conviction Unsubstantiated rumors of increased violence in the workplace , theft , or incompetence often stand in the way of giving someone with a record a chance Yet employers that do hire formerly incarcerated individuals end up reaping the benefits loyal employees with higher retention rates , tax benefits , and increased economic mobility for their staff 70 million Americans have a criminal record that s 1 in 3 adults There are currently 2 3 million people behind bars in this country , 95 percent of whom will reenter our communities 640 , 000 people are released from prison each year , creating a huge untapped workforce available to fill jobs Yet , in New York State , 53 percent of people on parole have yet to find a job Employers are often uncomfortable hiring people who have been convicted of a crime one study found that , in New York City , a criminal record reduced the likelihood of a callback or job offer by nearly 50 percent This is a problem Joblessness is the number one predictor of recidivism the less likely it is for a formerly incarcerated person to find a job , the more likely it is that they end up back in prison , with all the costs associated with incarceration , including a price tag of 60 , 000 per inmate per year in New York These barriers to reentry have a negative trickle effect not only on the lives of these individuals , preventing them from providing for themselves and their families , but on society as a whole Studies have shown that excluding formerly incarcerated individuals from the workforce results in a GDP loss of 78 87 billion thanks to lost tax revenue , and that if states can reduce recidivism rates by just 10 percent , they could save an average of 635 million annually That s why my administration has launched the Work for Success Pledge an online pledge in which companies , like Ben and Jerry s or VICE Media , whose VICE Apprenticeship Program hires and trains formerly incarcerated people for production , editorial and creative jobs at the company , commit to consider hiring qualified candidates with criminal convictions New York is the first state in the nation to develop such a pledge So far , 80 companies have signed on and shown their commitment to hiring those with a criminal conviction but we need more to pledge their support ! It just makes good business sense Companies like Ben Jerry s recognize that hiring formerly incarcerated individuals and working with suppliers that do the same is important for our business , our culture , and our bottom line Studies have shown that those with a criminal conviction can often make the best employees they are retained at higher rates than those with no criminal record , saving companies costs associated with hiring and training , which can be as much as 4 , 000 per employee Additionally , companies that hire people with criminal convictions are eligible for the Work Opportunity Tax Credit \( WOTC \) , which provides a maximum tax credit of 2 , 400 per employee Formerly incarcerated individuals are often the most motivated at work A study of army enlistees found that enlistees with felony records were 33 percent more likely to be promoted to sergeant than those with no conviction history , a testament to their dedication and motivation Ben Jerry s is incredibly proud of our long relationship with the Greyston Bakery in Yonkers It was Ben who heard about the bakery and came up with one of our most successful flavors , Chocolate Fudge Brownie , specifically to allow our company to work with and expand the impact of the baker which , through its open hiring process , has helped thousands of returning citizens and their families rebuild their lives and their dignity It is in part because of our long relationship with the Greyston Bakery that we ve made changes to our hiring and recruiting process so that people are judged by their skill and qualifications , not the mistakes of the past There is no doubt , with 1 in 3 Americans having been convicted of a crime , if we were to use criminal conviction as screen for recruiting , we would be leaving very qualified candidates out of our process That s just a bad business decision Across New York , the Cuomo administration has long been dedicated to providing employment for those with criminal convictions In 2012 , we launched the Work for Success Program , which matches qualified and appropriately trained job applicants with criminal convictions to open job listings In the last five years , we have placed more than 18 , 000 people in jobs , and each new company that signs on to our Work for Success Pledge also commits to listing job openings with the program In 2015 , the Council on Community Reentry and Reintegration took further steps to ensure equity in hiring by setting uniform guidelines that evaluate qualified applicants for state occupational licenses and adopting fair chance hiring for New York State agencies , meaning agencies will not ask about a job applicant s criminal convictions until and unless the agency has interviewed the candidate and is interested in hiring him or her As a result of Reentry Council efforts in 2016 , New York is also the first in the nation to prohibit insurance companies from denying insurance coverage to businesses that hire people with criminal convictions These are small steps that can make a huge difference Together , by signing the Work for Success Pledge , businesses have a real opportunity to not only provide a helping hand to those who have been cut off from opportunities , but to also improve our bottom line New York State is dedicated to creating a true state of opportunity for everyone FollowFollowingUnfollowAndrew Cuomo",true
"White HouseWelcome to Trump s whatever shutdownTrump has spent a year upending the rules of being president , and so far he 's approaching the congressional spending crisis as another episode that will work itself out By ELIANA JOHNSON01 20 2018 05 48 PM ESTPresident Donald Trump is sticking with the message that Democrats will take most of the heat for the government shutdown Saul Loeb AFP Getty ImagesPrintLittle of the congressional drama that precipitated the weekend s government shutdown made its way to the White House on Saturday Previous presidents have projected an air of crisis during shutdowns , but President Donald Trump stayed out of the public eye , sticking to his preferred mode of communication Twitter while expressing annoyance to aides that the disruption is keeping him away from an evening bash at Mar a Lago celebrating the one year anniversary of his inauguration Story Continued BelowWhite House aides , too , say they are relatively relaxed Mick Mulvaney , the director of the Office of Management and Budget , told Fox News host Sean Hannity on Friday that he discovered Friday that it fell to him to shut down the government which is kind of cool Welcome to the whatever shutdown The attitude permeating the Trump administration reflects , to some degree , the confidence that comes from finding that the world keeps spinning every time they do something they ve been warned would have dire consequences , like withdrawing from the Paris climate accord or announcing plans to move the U S embassy in Israel to Jerusalem According to a half dozen White House officials and outside advisers , Trump is viewing the shutdown through a similar lens , a view encouraged by White House aides , including senior adviser Stephen Miller and congressional liaison Marc Short , who urged him on Friday not to give in to Democratic demands , particularly on immigration Several presidential advisers expressed confidence that Democrats , who offered no philosophical objections to the 30 day continuing resolution approved by House Republicans , wanted to make a statement but don t want to hurt federal workers , tens of thousands of whom will be staying home from work without pay if government funding isn t restored by Monday morning Two presidential aides said they expect the current crisis to be resolved by the end of the weekend But Democrats themselves are sending a different message , at least publicly giving no indication they are ready to buckle to pressure It s important , Sen Tim Kaine of Virginia said of the shutdown s impact on federal workers But I was just at the women s march this morning , and there are a lot of federal workers there and they were basically You need to stand up to this guy One House Democrat said he was relieved his party had finally grown a spine The most reliable politics newsletter Sign up for POLITICO Playbook and get the latest news , every morning in your inbox EmailSign UpBy signing up you agree to receive email newsletters or alerts from POLITICO You can unsubscribe at any time The White House has responded by shrugging it off , hewing to a consistent message This shutdown won t hurt as much as the one President Barack Obama oversaw five years ago Mulvaney drew the comparison repeatedly on Saturday , telling reporters that national parks and monuments would remain open , though they were closed in 2013 that the Centers for Disease Control and Prevention would continue to protect Americans from this year s flu outbreak and that , in another departure from five years ago , the activities of the Environmental Protection Agency would continue uninterrupted He also argued that Democrats today are being more unreasonable than were Republicans in 2013 We were asked to vote for something in 2013 that we did not approve of , said Mulvaney , who , as a South Carolina congressman , supported the 2013 shutdown because the government funding bill required lawmakers to approve funding for Obamacare , a federal program to which they vehemently objected Other West Wing aides were playing it cool as well Whose Fault Is the Shutdown \? By POLITICO STAFF This seems so banal compared to 2013 , when the two sides were actually fired up and there was a cause , said a senior presidential aide The 2013 shutdown , precipitated by Republican attempts to prevent funds from flowing to the Affordable Care Act , lasted 17 days Everybody figures this is going to resolve itself by the end of the weekend , the aide said It will be nothing compared to Obama s shutdown , said another senior White House official , though the 2013 shutdown was roundly blamed on Republicans Trump himself , who has yet to appear in public since the shutdown early Saturday morning , is sticking with the message that Democrats will take most of the heat , though he privately joked to staff that he knows he ll get blamed because he always does Though he hasn t appeared before the cameras , he was active on Twitter throughout the day on Saturday , writing This is the One Year Anniversary of my Presidency and the Democrats wanted to give me a nice present DemocratShutdown In photos released late Saturday by the White House , Trump and top staff appeared relaxed and smiling Joyce N Boghosian Official White House photoWhite House aides said that they think Trump s Twitter microphone is enough , and they don t believe the president needs to make official remarks to bring the shutdown to a close Indeed , Trump s own erratic behavior in negotiations last week including his remarks to lawmakers that many immigrants come from shithole countries helped precipitate the breakdown in spending talks on the Hill by hardening the positions among party rank and file on both sides and giving Democrats a ready made excuse to walk away from the negotiating table on immigration Since then , he s been a bit player in the shutdown drama the absence of his direction and leadership driving events more than their presence By BRENT D GRIFFITHSThe irony is that while many had high hopes that Trump s election augured a new era of bipartisanship in the country , the government shutdown is the clearest evidence yet that that hasn t materialized Instead , a year into his first term , the president who won the election railing against the political system finds himself trapped inside it , waiting for the political leaders he holds in contempt to set him free Annie Karni and Seung Min Kim contributed to this report",true

"Lunar Eclipse Overview Introduction A lunar eclipse occurs when the Earth comes between the Sun and the Moon and the Earth 's shadow passes over the Moon This phenomenon can be seen by any observer on Earth for whom the Moon is above the horizon Lunar eclipses occur at the time of a Full Moon , but not every Full Moon , because the Moon has to be near one of the nodes of intersection between its orbit and the ecliptic plane The Earth umbra is larger than the whole Moon So , one will observe either a total eclipse by the umbra \( which can be well observed \) , a partial eclipse by the umbra and penumbra , or a total or partial eclipse by the penumbra only , depending on where the centre of the earth 's shadow is with respect to the disk of the Moon The duration of a lunar eclipse is much longer than a solar eclipse , and can take as much as six hours In practice , the lunar eclipse conditions are modified due to the refraction of the Sun 's rays by the Earth 's atmosphere This refraction \( of 35 minutes of arc \) allows some light to penetrate the cone of the geometric umbra So even during total lunar eclipse , the lunar disk is not completely dark This grazing light is more absorbed by the Earth 's atmosphere in the blue and yellow portions of the spectrum , giving a particular reddish light during total lunar eclipse Last Update 21 September 2006",true
"b'Its nearly impossible today to go anywhere without seeing someone talking into a tiny earpiece , but the headsets with blinking blue lights were not so common just a decade ago Use of Bluetooth equipped devices has stretched across the globe , yet the technologys origins and name can be traced to an engineer obsessed with making computers function using as little energy as possible Power is one of the key attributes Battery life is life Its the life of the product To ignore that is totally unacceptable You have to design things to work efficiently , but more importantly , do nothing efficiently , said Jim Kardach , retired chief power architect at Intel Originally intended as a wireless replacement for cables to connect phones , headsets , computers , keyboards and mice , Bluetooth technology has proliferated over the past decade , allowing devices in close proximity to connect while using very little battery power The headsets are ubiquitous , but according to the Bluetooth Special Interest Group \( SIG \) they are only one of many product types that make up the 9 billion Bluetooth devices in the world today That number keeps growing Over the next 2 years , annual Bluetooth device shipments are expected to double from 2 to 4 billion , according to ABI Research Intel mobile computing engineer Jim Kardach was instrumental in bringing together Ericsson , IBM , Intel , Nokia and Toshiba to form the Bluetooth SIG in 1998 That group created the universal standard that is used by more than 17 , 000 member companies Kardach recalls playing the role of instigator and mediator among the founding companies , but says the group quickly agreed on a common goal to create a small , low power consuming , low cost , short range radio with built in security and the ability to connect ad hoc with other devices Inspired by a book about Vikings that he was reading at the time , he came up with the Bluetooth name Just days before he retired in December , Kardach reflected on his 27 year career at Intel , including the genesis of Bluetooth , the many low power design breakthroughs that led to 100 patents and his work on the first notebook system on chip \( SoC \) sold in the 1980s by Intel called the 386SL 486SL How did you get involved with the creation of Bluetooth \? I got the assignment in 1997 when my boss at the time came up to me and said , Youre finishing up the ACPI stuff , can you figure out how to integrate wireless into the notebook \? We got together Ericsson , Nokia , Toshiba and IBM That probably represented 60 percent of both the cellphone and notebook markets at the time The key was to define the goals of what we wanted to do We formed a SIG , all agreeing that we wanted to build this universal , very low cost , private , wireless cable We did it under an open IP \( intellectual property \) policy , allowing us to take the best pieces from everywhere and put them together We had goals on what we wanted this thing to cost and strategies for it being built on a bulk CMOS process , which hadnt been done before It had security , privacy and had to work across the world , so we picked the ISM band , which required fixing some of the regulatory issues around it We had a term sheet that everyone agreed to and we put it together Intel became the leader simply because we had IBM and Toshiba who didnt trust each other , and Ericsson and Nokia who didnt trust each other , so we were kind of the Switzerland How does a chief power architect look at things \? The idea for the Bluetooth name came from Jim Kardach of Intel , who was reading a historical novel about Vikings and King Harald Bluetooth at the time Power is one of the key attributes Battery life is life Its the life of the product To ignore that is totally unacceptable You have to design things to work efficiently , but more importantly , do nothing efficiently Those are the two rules of power management We rely on architectural designs to lower power use We design chips to turn things off and back on only when theyre needed We architect things to minimize latency and anticipate when something is needed so it gets turned on just in time We used to rely on randomness , like when you drive to work and hope to miss all of the red lights , but more recently weve purposely tried to line up activities in order to create big idle gaps between these activities If the idle gaps are long enough , we can shut off all of the power For example , we now have special offloading accelerators that run to do specialized media loads and then be able to put the rest of the platform to a low power state , which means 98 percent of it is powered off Hardware not designed for power management can be like crying babies that wake up the whole house They ping memory every couple of milliseconds or microseconds , keeping the CPU out of its low power state This can keep memory and the busses between them alive A Bluetooth radio should require about a milliwatt of power , but when you put it on a USB plug , because of the way the bus was architected , it generates an extra 6 watts of power by pinging memory every millisecond These are things we want to catch up front when architecting for good power management The fourth generation Intel Core processors that use an SoC design are coming out soon Whats the advantage of SoCs over traditional CPU designs \? SoC allows you to do things that arent possible if you have a handful of chips from different venders We have the advantage of doing our own chipsets and CPUs , which allows us to design power management between them and the rest of the platform In the 1980s I worked on the 3SL and 4SL SoCs We were doing it in an era where we were cramming hundreds of thousands of transistors on a die and now we can fit billions We can now take advantage of Moores Law and increased capacity that were getting from bigger wafers and smaller transistors This lets us integrate more capabilities into a small chip Having an SoC allows us to bring power management across the platform With the 3SL , we added new operating modes to the CPU that pulled some power management underneath the operating system This work is still used today To design an SoC , sometimes you have to trade off time to market but you can really take advantage of them to manage power consumption This content was originally published on the Intel Free Press website '",true

"The world is reaping the terrifying consequences of hate filled rhetoric that threatens to normalize massive discrimination against marginalized groups , Amnesty International warned today as it launched its annual assessment of human rights Last year our world was immersed in crises , with prominent leaders offering us a nightmarish vision of a society blinded by hatred and fear This emboldened those who promote bigotry , but it inspired far more people to campaign for a more hopeful future Salil Shetty , Secretary General of Amnesty International Nevertheless , the organization found that a growing movement of both first time and seasoned activists campaigning for social justice provides real hope of reversing the slide towards oppression The report , The State of the World s Human Rights , covers 159 countries and delivers the most comprehensive analysis of the state of human rights in the world today The transparently hateful move by the US government in January to ban entry to people from several Muslim majority countries set the scene for a year in which leaders took the politics of hate to its most dangerous conclusion , said Salil Shetty , Secretary General of Amnesty International We saw the ultimate consequence of a society encouraged to hate , scapegoat and fear minorities laid bare in the horrific military campaign of ethnic cleansing against the Rohingya people in Myanmar , said Salil Shetty World leaders abandon human rights , igniting protest movements globally The specters of hatred and fear now loom large in world affairs , and we have few governments standing up for human rights in these disturbing times Instead , leaders such as al Sisi , Duterte , Maduro , Putin , Trump and Xi are callously undermining the rights of millions , said Salil Shetty The feeble response to crimes against humanity and war crimes from Myanmar to Iraq , South Sudan , Syria and Yemen underscored the lack of leadership on human rights Governments are shamelessly turning the clock back on decades of hard won protections Signs of regression cited in the report include clampdowns on rights to protest in France , and attempts to roll back women s rights from the USA to Russia and Poland With the report launching in Washington D C , Amnesty International warned that President Trump s backward steps on human rights are setting a dangerous precedent for other governments to follow Defenders of human rights around the world can look to the people of the United States to stand with them , even where the US government has failed As President Trump takes actions that violate human rights at home and abroad , activists from across the country remind us that the fight for universal human rights has always been waged and won by people in their communities , said Margaret Huang , executive director of Amnesty International USA Regressive policies have inspired many people to join long standing struggles , and the report details many important victories that human rights activists helped to secure These include lifting the total abortion ban in Chile , achieving a step towards marriage equality in Taiwan and securing a landmark victory against forced evictions in Abuja , Nigeria A vast Women s March centered on the USA and with offshoots around the world showcased the growing influence of new social movements , as did the MeToo phenomenon and Latin America s Ni Una Menos which denounced violence against women and girls The indomitable spirit of the women leading powerful human rights movements reminds us that the desire for equality , dignity and justice will never be extinguished There is a palpable sense that protest movements are on the rise globally If governments stand against such movements , they will erode their legitimacy , said Salil Shetty Free speech takes on colossal importance in the renewed battle for human rights Governments think they can declare open season on human rights activists They may shut down our newspapers , undermine judges and jail activists , but we refuse to be silenced Salil Shetty The willingness of prominent leaders to tout fake news in order to manipulate public opinion , coupled with attacks on institutions that act as checks on power , show that free speech will be a key battle ground for human rights this year , said Amnesty International In 2018 , we cannot take for granted that we will be free to gather together in protest or to criticize our governments In fact , speaking out is becoming more dangerous , said Salil Shetty Hundreds of activists were killed last year as authorities sought to silence campaigners and muzzle the media , the report said The biggest jailors of journalists were Turkey , Egypt and China where Nobel laureate Liu Xiaobo died after being imprisoned for criticizing the government With governments shamelessly pursuing human rights activists , Amnesty International faced threats to its work in Hungary as well as the unprecedented arrests of its staff in Turkey Governments think they can declare open season on human rights activists They may shut down our newspapers , undermine judges and jail activists , but we refuse to be silenced If the legendary Chinese activist Liu Xiaobo taught us anything , it is that we must speak truth to power precisely when it seems impossible to do so , said Salil Shetty Hate on the march as people targeted for their identity The report emphasized the need for people to continue to speak out against the kind of hate filled rhetoric seen in xenophobic slogans at a nationalist march in Warsaw , Poland , a white supremacist rally in Charlottesville , USA , and sweeping crackdowns on LGBTI communities from Chechnya to Egypt This was underscored by the vilification of refugees and migrants from the very highest levels of government While the Trump administration made headlines for its anti refugee rhetoric , the report says they were not alone in pursuing xenophobic policies Donald Trump s policies may have marked a new era of human rights regression but they are not unique If you look across from Australia to Hungary , leaders have long treated refugees and migrants as problems to be deflected , not as human beings with rights who deserve our compassion , said Salil Shetty Governments must address the burning injustices fueling protest movements The report also notes that millions of people worldwide are facing increasingly precarious access to basic goods and services such as housing , food and health care Amnesty International warned that unless governments tackle the underlying causes of poverty and inequality then there is huge potential for even greater unrest Across the world people are being forced to live an intolerable existence because they are being denied access to adequate food , clean water , health care and basic shelter If you take away these human rights , you breed despair with no limit or end From Venezuela to Iran , we are witnessing the formidable spread of social discontent , warned Salil Shetty Instead of trying to silence people when they speak out , governments should address their concerns , said Amnesty International , and start by loosening restrictions on the media , civil society and other key checks on power We are witnessing history in the making as people rise up and demand justice in greater numbers If leaders fail to discern what is driving their people to protest , then this ultimately will be their own undoing People have made it abundantly clear that they want human rights the onus now is on governments to show that they are listening , said Salil Shetty",true
"REUTERS Brendan McDermid Kentucky county clerk Kim Davis speaks during an interview on Fox News Channel 's 'The Kelly File' in New York September 23 , 2015 Pope Francis did not ask to meet a Kentucky county clerk who had been jailed for refusing to issue marriage licenses to gay couples and did not offer her unconditional support , the Vatican said on Friday Looking to limit controversy after last week 's meeting in Washington between the pope and Kim Davis , Vatican spokesman Federico Lombardi said she was one of several dozen people who had been invited by the Vatican ambassador to see Francis The Pope did not enter into the details of the situation of Mrs Davis and his meeting with her should not be considered a form of support of her position in all of its particular and complex aspects , Lombardi said in a statement The meeting with Davis , which was originally kept secret , disappointed many liberal Catholics but delighted conservatives , who saw it as a sign that the pope was clearly condemning a ruling by the U S Supreme Court to legalize same sex marriage A senior Vatican official , who declined to be named , said there was a sense of regret within the Holy See over the encounter , which sparked widespread debate in the United States , overshadowing almost all other aspects of the pope 's visit He added that Davis had been in a line of people the pope had met at the Vatican embassy in Washington before he left for New York The only real audience granted by the Pope at the Nunciature \( Vatican embassy \) was with one of his former students and his family , the statement said Davis was jailed for five days in September for refusing to comply with a judge 's order to issue marriage licenses in line with the Supreme Court ruling Davis has said her beliefs as an Apostolic Christian prevent her from issuing marriage licenses to same sex couples Her church belongs to a Protestant movement known as Apostolic Pentecostalism \( Reporting by Philip Pullella , Editing by Crispian Balmer \)",true

"Mark your calendars a series of three supermoons will appear on the celestial stage on December 3 , 2017 , January 1 , 2018 , and January 31 , 2018 What is a Supermoon \? A supermoon is a Moon that is full when it is also at or near its closest point in its orbit around Earth Since the Moon s orbit is elliptical , one side \( apogee \) is about 30 , 000 miles \( 50 , 000 km \) farther from Earth than the other \( perigee \) Nearby perigee full Moons appear about 14 bigger and 30 brighter than full Moons that occur near apogee in the Moon 's orbit The supermoons are a great opportunity for people to start looking at the Moon , not just that once but every chance they have ! says Noah Petro , a research scientist from NASA s Goddard Space Flight Center It s hard for our eyes to distinguish these small changes in size when the Moon is high amidst the vastness of the night sky But any time you catch a full Moon as it rises or sets , while it s suspended low on the horizon beaming through the silhouettes of trees or buildings , its apparent size might make you do a double take You almost feel as though you could reach out , grab the glowing orb , and drop it into your coffee cup Even more so if it s a supermoon If you can only catch one episode of the supermoon trilogy , catch the third one It will be extra special First of all , the January 31st supermoon will feature a total lunar eclipse , with totality viewable from western North America across the pacific to Eastern Asia The Moon s orbit around our planet is tilted so it usually falls above or below the shadow of the Earth About twice each year , a full Moon lines up perfectly with the Earth and Sun such that Earth s shadow totally blocks the Sun s light , which would normally reflect off the Moon The lunar eclipse on January 31 will be visible during moonset Folks in the Eastern United States , where the eclipse will be partial , will have to get up in the morning to see it , notes Petro But it s another great chance to watch the Moon The Moon will lose its brightness and take on an eerie , fainter than normal glow from the scant sunlight that makes its way through Earth s atmosphere Often cast in a reddish hue because of the way the atmosphere bends the light , totally eclipsed Moons are sometimes called blood Moons We re seeing all of the Earth s sunrises and sunsets at that moment reflected from the surface of the Moon , says Sarah Noble , a Program Scientist at NASA headquarters The January 31st supermoon will also be the second full Moon of the month Some people call the second full Moon in a month a Blue Moon , that makes it a super blue Moon Blue Moons happen every two and a half years , on average With the total eclipse , it ll be a royal spectacle indeed a super blue blood Moon Sometimes the celestial rhythms sync up just right to wow us Heed your calendar reminders On the three dates marked , step out into the moonset or moonrise and look up for a trilogy of sky watching treats !

"TV 's Gupta Is Obama 's Pick for Surgeon GeneralVideoBy Ceci Connolly and Howard KurtzWashington Post Staff WritersWednesday , January 7 , 2009America 's most famous television surgeon , Sanjay Gupta , is poised to take his black bag and microphone to the White House as President elect Barack Obama 's choice for U S surgeon general A neurosurgeon who is also a correspondent for CNN and CBS , Gupta was chosen as much for his broadcasting skills as for his medical r sum , suggesting that the incoming administration values visible advisers who can drive a public message He has also been offered a top post in the new White House Office of Health Reform , twin duties that could make him the most influential surgeon general in history A practicing physician and one of People magazine 's Sexiest Men Alive , Gupta met for more than two hours with Obama in Chicago on Nov 25 , according to two sources with knowledge of the talks Gupta , 39 , later spoke with several Obama advisers , including Thomas A Daschle , who will run the new White House policy office and the Department of Health and Human Services The globetrotting doctor has told Obama aides he wants the job , which involves overseeing the 6 , 000 member Commissioned Corps of the U S Public Health Service When reached yesterday , Gupta did not deny that he plans to accept the offer but declined to comment Transition officials refused to speak on the record about his selection , but several Obama allies praised Gupta as the sort of highly visible , articulate physician who might restore the luster that the position of the nation 's doctor had in the person of Reagan appointee C Everett Koop and some of his predecessors A representative of the Commissioned Corps , however , said Gupta will face a credibility gap because he has never served in the uniformed Public Health Service I am unaware of any public health experience or qualifications he has to be the leader of the nation 's public health service , said Gerard M Farrell , executive director of the service 's Commissioned Officers Association This would be akin to appointing the Army chief of staff from the city council of Hoboken , N J The selection of Gupta represents a return to a communicator model , said Susan Blumenthal , who retired as an assistant surgeon general two years ago after 20 years in the Public Health Service If he is confirmed by the Senate , Gupta would provide the administration with a skilled television personality to help market what is planned to be a massive reorganization of the U S health system The Obama team already has initiated a public relations campaign aimed at mobilizing grass roots support for eventual health reform legislation Last week , Daschle appeared at town hall style meetings in Indiana and Washington to solicit public input The sessions , captured on video and posted on the transition Web site , were among more than 8 , 500 local gatherings held over the holidays Gupta is a great voice to get the public engaged in the discussion over health care reform , said Kenneth Thorpe , a former Clinton administration official who has become friendly with Gupta as a colleague at Emory University in Atlanta Gupta , the son of Indian parents , has long been drawn to policymaking He was a White House fellow in the late 1990s , writing speeches and crafting policy for then first lady Hillary Rodham Clinton He is currently associate chief of neurosurgery at Grady Memorial Hospital , Atlanta 's busy downtown hospital CONTINUED 1",true

"Like other organizations , ACPeds involves itself in judicial matters , and files amicus briefs with various courts in support of or in opposition to various cases What its website will not tell you is that this fringe organization , under the veneer of its professional sounding name and claims , works to defame and discredit LGBT people , often by distorting legitimate research It consists of around 200 members and started because a small group of anti LGBT physicians and other healthcare professionals broke away from the 60 , 000 member American Academy of Pediatrics \( AAP \) , composed of leaders in the professional field , to form its own group after the AAP issued a new policy statement in 2002 in support of adoption and foster parenting by same sex couples Anti marriage equality protester at the Supreme Court ACPeds has a history of propagating damaging falsehoods about LGBT people , including linking homosexuality to pedophilia , and claiming that LGBT people are more promiscuous than heterosexuals , and that LGBT people are a danger to children In 2010 , for example , ACPeds mailed a letter to over 14 , 000 school district superintendents pushing so called ex gay therapy and making other false claims about LGBT people in its Facts About Youth campaign , which brought a scathing response from a researcher whose work the group had distorted That wasn t the first time ACPeds had been called out for distorting legitimate research , but clearly , if the brief they filed is any indication , the lesson didn t take ACPeds filed the brief with the Alabama Supreme Court on Nov 6 in response to that court s pending decision regarding the U S Supreme Court \( SCOTUS \) ruling in Obergefell v Hodges last June , which legalized same sex marriage in the United States In defiance of Alabama federal district court judge Callie Granade , the Alabama Policy Institute and Alabama Citizens Action Program petitioned the Alabama Supreme Court to uphold Alabama s state law , which declares that marriage is between one man and one woman While the Alabama Supreme Court requested that the parties in the case have their briefs filed by July 6 , 2015 , amicus briefs seem to still be tricking in and the court has yet to rule The ACPeds brief urges the court to defy the U S Supreme Court and confirm that marriage is only between one man and one woman The brief states that ACPeds is concerned by the delay of the Alabama Supreme Court and the immediate threat of Obergefell to the stability of families , the safety of children and our constitutional republic Unsurprisingly in the brief , ACPeds cites professors Loren D Marks and Mark Regnerus , both of whom have attempted to claim through discredited research that children do worse in same sex parent households than in heterosexual parent households Regnerus s infamous study , which received almost a million dollars from right wing anti LGBT think tanks , was released in 2012 and was immediately trumpeted by anti LGBT groups around the country and has been used repeatedly in various amicus briefs in opposition to same sex marriage Loren Marks \( top \) is a professor of family life at BYU and Mark Regnerus is a professor of sociology at the University of Texas , Austin Regnerus has become a darling on the anti LGBT circuit , though in legitimate social science circles , his credibility continues to wane Last year , Regnerus testified in a federal court case in Michigan regarding the legality of same sex marriage Federal judge Paul Friedman dismissed Regnerus s testimony as unbelievable and not worthy of serious consideration and wrote that his study was hastily concocted at the behest of a third party funder In addition , Regnerus s own academic department has distanced itself from him In spite of that , ACPeds relies heavily on Regnerus as well as on other researchers affiliated with the National Association for the Research and Therapy of Homosexuality \( NARTH now the NARTH Institute \) , which supports the discredited ex gay therapy movement So called ex gay or reparative therapy seeks to change gay people to heterosexual The ACPeds brief also cites outdated sources from the 1970s , 1980s , and 1990s to bolster claims that same sex relationships don t last very long , and that same sex relationships are more violent than heterosexual This Court , the brief implores , should take care that innocent and helpless Alabama children are not sacrificed on the altar of adult passions , judicial will , or politically correct opinion In a supreme case of irony , the brief further claims that legitimate research by professional organizations like the American Psychological Association are the result of a biased political agenda The brief goes on to cite , for example , a 2002 report by physician Ellin Perrin in support of ACPeds views that legitimate research is biased That 2002 report actually found the opposite of what ACPeds claims The report states that , the weight of evidence gathered during several decades using diverse samples and methodologies is persuasive in demonstrating that there is no systematic difference between gay and nongay parents in emotional health , parenting skills , and attitudes toward parenting The report further notes that no data have pointed to any risk to children as a result of growing up in a family of one or more gay parents Perrin s report , co authored by the Committee on Psychosocial Aspects of Child and Family Health is part of what caused ACPeds to break away from the AAP in the first place , because it helped form the basis for AAP s support of adoption and foster parenting by same sex parents , which ACPeds vehemently opposes Nevertheless , the group has no problem taking one line in that report out of context and using it to bolster their own flagging position But in the strange world of the anti LGBT right , damaging falsehoods about LGBT people are considered true while legitimate science is seen as false This is why fringe think tanks like ACPeds have formed in hard right circles a means to hold on to and perpetuate views that are being proven wrong with every passing day",false
"Download the Baby Mummy graphic For more than two decades , the baby mummy remained in a storage facility at the Saint Louis Science Center One day last spring , Washington University scientist Charles F Hildebolt got an intriguing phone call A mummy had turned up in the storage facility of the Saint Louis Science Center \( SLSC \) , but no one knew much about it Could he and his colleagues do some detective work to learn more \? When you hear the word 'mummy , ' you think big box or large tomb , says Hildebolt , DDS , PhD , a dentist and anthropologist in the Department of Radiology It was a surprise when we got over there and found that this was a small child , partly unwrapped and in a little pine box We said , 'Wow ! This is really interesting ' But we did n't know exactly what we 'd be able to find out Charles F Hildebolt , DDS , PhD , enlisted the help of Li Cao , MD , center , and Anne M Bowcock , PhD , to retrieve and analyze the baby mummy 's DNA Hildebolt and other volunteer investigators from the School of Medicine , helped by experts from around the world , began a yearlong quest to uncover the mummy 's past Assisted by the latest technology sophisticated CT scanning , DNA analysis and radiocarbon dating they pieced together a likely story of love and loss , of ancient Egypt and European conquerors , of theft and recovery , that has attracted international attention At the same time , they made a bit of scientific history Although the record of child mummies in existence is still incomplete , they are exceedingly rare , says Hildebolt The extensive research they have done to understand this one may well rank , he says , as the most extensive work ever done on a child mummy What information they had when they began came from SLSC records Around the turn of the last century , a dentist from Hermann MO was traveling in the Middle East when he acquired the mummy as a keepsake Back home , a niece eventually inherited it , and she brought it out for display on Halloween Her family donated it to the SLSC in 1985 For two decades , the small mummy remained in the SLSC storage facility until new vice president Al Wiman noticed it in 2006 The first thing I asked was 'What do you know about it \? ' Well , they knew it was a boy , he says today 'Do you know anything else \? ' No , they did n't Once Washington University agreed to help , Mallinckrodt Institute of Radiology was the first stop Hildebolt , a veteran of other forensic detection efforts , recruited Kirk Smith , a senior research engineer with CT expertise Smith did the full body scanning , and Hildebolt and pediatric radiologist Steven Don , MD , studied the results in hopes of determining the child 's age and cause of death It was just what a doctor would do with a living patient except that we could scan at a very high resolution , with an X ray dose you would not use on a live person , says Smith We also have state of the art CT scanners , among the best in the world They captured some 1 , 000 CT slices , which Smith integrated for an overall look and segmented for close ups From the teeth and cranial sutures , Hildebolt and Don established the child 's age 7 to 8 months They hypothesized that , in the tradition of Egyptian mummification , his organs had been removed through a hole in his left side and his brain through his left nostril Within the mummy , they could see amulets at a tantalizing distance , but could n't make out any inscriptions that might pinpoint the child 's identity Canopic jars \( reproductions pictured here \) were used to hold the dried internal organs of Egyptian mummies So far , everything indicated an Egyptian place of origin , but how to prove it \? Other cultures also mummified the dead With the help of paleoneuroanatomist Dean Falk , PhD , from Florida State University , who confirmed the brain removal , they contacted Salima Ikram , PhD , an Egyptologist at the American University in Cairo Snipping a postage stamp sized piece of the wrapping material , they sent it to Ikram , who passed it on to Emilia Cort s , a textile conservator at the Metropolitan Museum of Art She determined it was Egyptian wrapping material from the Roman period in Egypt , around 2 , 000 years ago Ikram unraveled other pieces of the mystery True to Roman period mummification custom , this mummy had a wooden rod placed at its back for support The dark brown color of the body and the linen wrapping turned gentle shades of beige in the CT scans was the product of resins and oils used in the 70 day mummification process As to the mummy 's origin , Ikram says , it definitely came from a grave that was plundered by robbers , but several sites are possible , so I shall not speculate Sadly , its very existence may point to sorrow that resonates through the centuries The parents of this child were wealthy , since they could afford to mummify their child , and they were likely heartbroken at their loss This was certainly a loved child , says Hildebolt , for the family to go to the cost , trouble and time to have him mummified But the investigation also left some questions unanswered Since the bones showed no injury , the team still does not know the cause of death At first the skull seemed a bit enlarged , possibly due to hydrocephaly , but Don 's measurements proved it was within the normal range And who were the parents \? Would further testing corroborate the mummy 's time period \? With funding from the SLSC , university researchers sent another swatch of wrapping to a laboratory for radiocarbon dating with 95 percent certainty , the results showed a close match This baby lived sometime between 40 BC and 130 AD , at the end of the Macedonian Egyptian period of control and the beginning of Roman rule under Caesar Augustus So this child could easily have been alive at the same time as Cleopatra , Marc Antony , Julius Caesar and Octavian , says Hildebolt To trace the baby 's roots , they contacted Washington University geneticist Anne M Bowcock , PhD , who enlisted researcher Li Cao , MD , to help retrieve and analyze DNA This process was fraught with problems For one thing , they needed to find uncontaminated DNA , deep inside the body For another , the mummy was rock hard , yet they did n't want to damage it Using instruments designed for spinal punctures , they bored into its bone through existing holes in the skin , extracting samples from several sites Targeting the mitochondrial DNA , they amplified and sequenced their samples , checking the results with Douglas C Wallace , PhD , of the University of California Irvine , a mitochondrial expert Next came a major surprise This kind of DNA , provided by the maternal side , showed that this child 's mother came of European lineage perhaps a Roman or Greek living in Egypt So far , the researchers have not been able to amplify the child 's nuclear DNA , which would show the father 's lineage More questions linger , but the Child Mummy , as the SLSC calls it , has generated an excited response from visitors , who have flocked to the new permanent exhibit The respectful treatment given this long ago child also pleases Ikram I am delighted with the results , she says , and feel that the ancient Egyptians would have been , too",false
"For eight years , Michelle Obama genuinely thought she was a queen and expected to be treated like one Now that she s a regular citizen , she s having a hard time of letting go of her former status as the \( failed \) first lady and keeps trying to push her way into every major social scene where she doesn t belong and is apparently not invited When she heard the news that Prince Harry was marrying a black American girl , she assumed it was her place to be on that guest list , which has to be approved by the Queen of England herself Michelle made a desperation move to sneak a spot on that exclusive guest list and as soon as the real queen found out what the wannabe royalty did , she delivered a brutal beatdown that was definitely deserved As soon as the big news about the royal engagement of Prince Harry and an American actress Meghan Markle was announced , the Obamas saw an opportunity to edge their way into the elites , like a couple of desperate kids trying to hang with the popular crowd at school Barack immediately got on social media to beat President Trump to the congratulatory punch He has a lot more time on his hands than the Commander in Chief who is busy cleaning up his mess Barack practically stalked the prince on Twitter and made a post within seconds of the news coming out , which perhaps had an undertone of letting the royals know that he and Michelle were available that day to attend The Obamas know what they are doing when it comes to getting attention on themselves and this post was no exception It garnered a whopping 1 million likes on it which both he and Michelle were likely elated about since the royal family was likely sure to see it The exposure of this post sparked rumors that the Obamas would likely be added to the guest list in the current president and first lady s place , the Independent reported While Barack was making desperate tweets to secretly get on the guestlist , Michelle was doing something worse to shove the Trumps aside and ensure her spot , even though the honor is typically reserved for the current president and first lady Michelle has been making the speaking engagement rounds lately to rack in hundreds of thousands of dollars to trash Trump Her recent trip to Canada was no exception as she combined it with a hidden mission of getting to the royal wedding The former first lady had been invited as the keynote speaker in addressing the Economic Club of Toronto , when she deviated from her planned remarks to double down on her and Barack s desperate attempt to kiss up to the Queen of England According to Page Six , Michelle took the opportunity to make fun of President Trump then immediately gushed over the queen Both conversation deviations had no place in an event like this , but for calculated Michelle , it has a passive aggressive purpose of saying that Trump wasn t fit for her guest list , but since she loves the queen so much , she should get a spot After being introduced by Canada s first lady , Sophie Trudeau , Obama told the crowd that it is never a good idea to put your first thought in the morning on social media , and never a good idea to tweet from bed , which appears to be one of the president s favorite pastimes , presuming that he is actually in bed when he tweets at 3 a m , Page Six reported Going on about effective communication , and the importance of doing drafts , Obama went on , Then you need to edit and spell check it The 45 minute conversation , hosted by the Economic Club of Toronto , flowed into a bunch of amusing side stories , including her memories of being awestruck when meeting Queen Elizabeth of England What do you do with the queen \? I touched her She touched me first , she said , adding that her dream dinner guest would be Jesus , whom she d serve pizza It s well known that the respect , proper etiquette , and holding a high level of decorum is important to the royal family and by painting a picture that Trump can t control himself , Michelle thought she was making him look like a bad person to have at the wedding However , the bigger motive in her comments was to cover up her actual faux pas with the Queen when , not surprisingly , brash Michelle showed a complete lack of respect and protocol when she got a little too touchy with her bullying her way into a hug and pushing her toward a chair , The Guardian previously reported The Queen felt so grossly disrespected by Michelle that she royally snubbed the former first lady after the touchy feely offense When she flew into London with her mother and daughters in tow , expecting an audience with Queen Elizabeth only , she received a big slap in the face instead , the Globe reported Instead of spending the day with Michelle and her family who flew in to meet with her , the Queen ditched her and went off the horse race instead Michelle may think she s royalty and even try to act like it , but she s got nothing on the actual Queen of England who s the real deal and put her in her place when she changed plans The Queen does what she wants which hopefully means that she kicks her off the coveted guest list too",false

"Republican lawmakers pushing to close dozens of tax loopholes have left open one that s been good to President Donald Trump the golf break With Senate Republicans expected to unveil the outline for a sweeping tax rewrite on Thursday , a lucrative break for golf course owners including the president remains firmly in place in the House version of the measure The Obama administration estimated in 2014 that closing the controversial loophole would save more than 600 million over a decade While Republicans are eliminating many write offs , the House version of the bill allows golf course owners to claim deductions for promising never to build on their links The Trump Organization , which owns a dozen courses in the U S , has taken advantage of the break in the past , using a law that s supposed to help preserve open space The golf deduction is just one example of how Trump businesses would benefit under the House Republican plan Interest expenses for loans on commercial real estate , for instance , would also remain deductible in many cases , even as that benefit is reduced for most other industries The commercial real estate industry is looking at this and saying , I love it , said Daniel Shaviro , a tax law professor at New York University Despite his efforts to prevent us from knowing about his tax returns , it s clear this is a huge plus for Trump Big Loser Trump said the proposed House tax reform would hurt him on balance When administration officials met with Democratic senators on Tuesday , Trump , who was in Seoul , phoned in an appeal for them to pass the bill He said that his own accountant told him he would be a big loser if the deal is approved as written , according to the Washington Post , which cited people in the room who heard the president on the phone Trump National Golf Club in Bedminster , New Jersey Photographer Julio Cortez AP Photo During that same trip , in a speech to South Korea s National Assembly , Trump plugged his private golf club in New Jersey as he praised the achievements of the Asian nation s professional golfers Trump has taken advantage of the tax benefit for golf courses and other open spaces for at least four of his properties , including the Trump National Golf Club in Bedminster , New Jersey , and the course at the private Mar a Lago Club in Palm Beach , Florida , according to the Wall Street Journal The golf course deduction in particular has drawn scrutiny before in Washington from both sides of the aisle Former President Barack Obama included restrictions on the deduction in his budget for at least three years In April , Republican Senator Jeff Flake listed the golf course deduction in a report he wrote entitled , Tax Rackets Outlandish Loopholes to Lower Tax Liabilities Representatives for Trump and the House Ways and Means Committee , which is working on the House s version of tax cut legislation , didn t respond to requests for comment Easement Donation Here s how it works a golf course owner agrees to restrict development on his or her property in perpetuity , which is known as creating a conservation easement , and to donate that easement to either a land trust or a local government He or she can continue to own the golf course The property owner then gets two appraisals one for the value of the property if it were sold on the market to the highest bidder without any restrictions on development , such as a homebuilder that would subdivide it , and the other for the property with the easement intact The difference between those two values can be deducted from the golf course owner s income for tax purposes The laws allowing for conservation easements were meant to protect forests , farmland and other open space for the benefit of the public Golf courses are just one of many types of land that use the easements For what I see and hear about golf easements , 98 percent of the time it s not what the tax code was intended to provide a benefit for , said Steve Small , a tax lawyer who worked in the chief counsel s office at the Internal Revenue Service from 1978 to 1982 and wrote regulations on conservation easements Sale Temptation In some cases , the tax benefit can make sense There are communities where golf courses are some of the only open space available Without the easements , an owner might be tempted to sell out to the highest bidder , which might develop housing on the space , said Sylvia Bates , director of standards and educational services at the Land Trust Alliance , a conservation group But in practice , the deductions that land owners take for golf courses are enormous compared with the conservation value , said Ruth Madrigal , a tax lawyer who worked on conservation easements for the U S Treasury department during the Obama administration A developer can build homes and a nearby golf course , get a conservation easement on the links and claim a deduction that can pay for the entire development , she said The Obama administration wanted to cut the deduction because it viewed the policy s costs in total as far exceeding the conservation benefits , Madrigal said Getting rid of tax deductions for golf course owners may make sense , but that doesn t mean it will happen , said Dean Zerbe , a tax lawyer for Alliant Group who worked on the Senate Finance Committee from 2001 through 2008 The House Committee needs to make up for trillions of dollars lost from its planned tax cuts over the next decade , and the gains from changing golf course rules may not be big enough to be worth the time , he said But

No , that was a higher power in action That higher power is God , and that was His way of getting a message down to me Well , I m here to tell Him that His message was received loud and clear Americans need me back in the Senate and I need to be back there so that I could stop the Democrats kidnapping of weapons from the citizens of this country Stricter gun laws are not what we need right now , quite the opposite If we want our people to be able to defend themselves , they need to be able to do that anytime , anywhere and with equal power , he argued And gay people are the perfect bait , the senator also said On the outside , they look all weak , feminine and vulnerable That makes them an obvious , easy target , which is what we ve seen in Orlando But if they re packing like Yosemite Sam , the terrorists are going to be in for a surprise when they try something like this the next time And trust me , they re not finished He added , Hell , after what just happened , I honestly think this was the last straw See , if our President was a brilliant strategist , which he s not , but if he was , right now he d be converting the entire U S Army into a mean , green , gay fighting machine If I were the commander in chief , I d recruit every LGBT person in the country right now , arm them to the teeth and ship them off to Syria and Iran to fight ISIS Because , there s no greater motivation than revenge , and I d say the gay community in America is pretty motivated right now Plus , they re always crying about equality So , here s an opportunity to be equal with the straight fighting men and women in our military Not to mention , gays always want to be traveling abroad , and they re nuts about men in uniforms So , that would definitely be a win win situation , Rubio said That s why I need to be in the Senate and that s why God s message is so important Because gay commandos aren t going to be a thing unless someone other than the Democrats has a say in it , he added , causing Hewitt to laughingly approve",false

"\( NaturalNews \) If you 're a conspiracy theorist , then you 're crazy , right \? That 's been the common belief for years , but recent studies prove that just the opposite is true Researchers psychologists and social scientists , mostly in the U S and United Kingdom say data indicate that , contrary to those mainstream media stereotypes , conspiracy theorists appear to be more sane than people who accept official versions of controversial and contested events The most recent study was published in July 2013 by psychologists Michael J Wood and Karen M Douglas of the University of Kent in the UK Entitled 'What about Building 7 \? ' A Social Psychological Study of Online Discussion of 9 11 Conspiracy Theories , the study compared conspiracist , or pro conspiracy theory , and conventionalist , or anti conspiracy , comments on news websites The researchers noted that they were surprised to find that it is now more conventional to leave so called conspiracist comments than conventional ones Of the 2174 comments collected , 1459 were coded as conspiracist and 715 as conventionalist , the researchers wrote So , among people who comment on news articles , those who discount official government accounts of events like the 9 11 attacks and the assassination of John F Kennedy outnumber believers by more than two to one That means the pro conspiracy commenters are those who are now expressing what is considered conventional wisdom , while the anti conspiracy commenters represent a small , beleaguered minority that is often scoffed at and shunned Perhaps becoming frustrated that their alleged mainstream viewpoints are no longer considered as such by the majority , those who are anti conspiracy commenters often showed anger and disgust in their posts The research showed that people who favoured the official account of 9 11 were generally more hostile when trying to persuade their rivals , said the study Also , it seems that those who do not believe in the conspiracies were not just hostile but fanatically attached to their own conspiracy theories as well The researchers said that , according to the anti conspiracy holders , their own theory of 9 11 one which says 19 Muslims , none of whom could fly commercial airliners with any proficiency , pulled off an amazing surprise attack under the direction of a man on dialysis \( Osama bin Laden \) who was living in a cave somewhere in Afghanistan is unwaveringly true Meanwhile , conspiracists , on the hand , did not have to pretend to have a theory that completely explained the events of 9 11 For people who think 9 11 was a government conspiracy , the focus is not on promoting a specific rival theory , but in trying to debunk the official account , the researchers said As reported byThe study also found that conspiracy believers discuss historical context , like viewing the JFK assassination as a precedent for 9 11 , more than the antis It also found that conspiracy believers do not like to be labeled as such These and other findings are contained in a new book , , by political scientist Lance deHaven Smith , which was published last year by the University of Texas Press He explained why people do n't like to be labeled as conspiracy theorists The CIA 's campaign to popularize the term 'conspiracy theory' and make conspiracy belief a target of ridicule and hostility must be credited , unfortunately , with being one of the most successful propaganda initiatives of all time , he said He further noted that , essentially , those who use the term as an insult are doing so as the result of a well documented , undisputed and historically accurate conspiracy by the CIA to cover up the JFK assassination Or not You be the judge",false
"A study published by NPR reveals that over 25 million Hillary Clinton votes were completely fraudulent , meaning that the Democratic candidate actually lost the popular vote by a huge margin A study by the Pew Center claiming that over 800 , 000 non citizens voted for Hillary Clinton failed to take into account dead and fraudulent voters which totalled over 25 million registered voters According to reports , illegal aliens combined with dead voters and multiple state voters explains why Hillary appeared to have won the popular vote over Trump during this years presidential race A report by the Pew Center on the States finds that more than 1 8 million dead people are currently registered to vote , and 24 million registrations are either invalid or inaccurate , NPR reported in 2012 , which is ironic given how NPR is heavily controlled by Democrats And many of the dead , registered voters somehow keep voting Democrat from beyond the grave , most recently in Philadelphia , Penn and Colorado It s also worth noting that the U S population has increased since 2012 , meaning that there s likely more dead and invalid voters than before The Pew study found that almost 3 million people are registered to vote in more than one state , NPR added That s because when a new resident registers to vote in a state , officials usually never bother to tell his former state about the change in voter residency Under the catch and release immigration program by the Obama administration , illegal aliens were routinely given bus tickets to travel to other states by immigration officials , so it was theoretically possible for non citizens to register to vote in a border country illegally , then register to vote in another state after their taxpayer funded bus dropped them off Clinton won most of the 163 most populous counties in the US that account for half of the total votes in the election , including dense urban areas in New York and California , yet she only won the popular vote by 2 8 million votes , which reveals the lack of enthusiasm voters had for her in comparison to Trump and that Democrats would have depended more on illegal votes A portion of the 24 million invalid voter registrations combined with a portion of the 1 8 million dead voters and the over 800 , 000 known illegal voters could explain the difference of 2 8 million votes , and it s worth noting that the 800 , 000 figure could be a low , conservative estimate That said , a popular vote victory is meaningless if the president was elected by popular vote , then both Trump and Clinton would have campaigned in entirely different states because only densely population regions of the U S would decide who would become president Without the electoral college , the United States of America would be reduced to the United States of New York and California , with 48 other vassal states Yet notice how Clinton campaigned in other , less populated states They knew the popular vote was meaningless ahead of the election However , the popular vote is useful as a barometer for voter fraud since the most populous countries are also the most susceptible to election tampering by illegal , invalid and dead voters",false

"An Instagram account apparently belonging to Florida shooting suspect Nikolas Cruz was dominated by disturbing images of a young man with a fascination for deadly weapons One image of a bullet pocked target is labelled Group therapy sometimes it works Others show a masked figure brandished a handgun and hunting knives Before a mass shooting erupted at Cruz s former high school on Wednesday , most classmates thought of the 19 year old as no more than creepy and weird Before 6AM on Thursday , he was formally booked into Broward County jail charged with 17 counts of premeditated murder Law enforcement officials believe he attacked Marjory Stoneman Douglas High School in Parkland , Florida , on Wednesday The teens who knew Cruz at the school were stunned They described Cruz as an awkward outcast someone who had trouble fitting in at Douglas High But they never saw a mass murderer in the making I knew him to be passive aggressive but not violent He was rude to people He had an act up like he was tough He never got into , like , physical fights with anyone , but he did get into verbal arguments , 17 year old Ocean Parodie told The Daily Beast I just thought he dropped out of school , I didn t think he would do anything He always kept a low profile He was definitely not accepted at our school socially People saw him as someone who was different than the normal people at our school , Parodie added Douglas High has a place students call the Emo Gazebo , he said That s where all the kids that are considered weird or not accepted sat Kids at the Emo Gazebo didn t even accept him there He was just an outcast He didn t have any friends Cruz always had his hair short and had a penchant for wearing patriotic shirts that seemed really extreme , like hating on Islam , Parodie said The suspected gunman would also deride Muslims as terrorists and bombers I ve seen him wear a Trump hat , the student said Most kids ignored him at school They pushed him off to the side as if he was garbage He screamed in class one time He was upset and just started yelling at the teacher The teacher was trying to help him and he just took it the wrong way , Parodie continued One student told the Miami Herald that he was expelled and told never to return to the school wearing a bag , after bullets were found in his backpack , but that has not been confirmed by officials Friends and family said both of Cruz s parents , who adopted him at birth , had died his mother late last year and he moved in with a friend s family after being expelled from school Jim Lewis , an attorney representing the suspect , told the Sun Sentinel that he already owned the AR 15 , which he bought legally , when he moved in to the house around Thanksgiving It was his gun , he said The family made him keep it in a locked gun cabinet in the house but he had a key Lewis said the family had encouraged Cruz to continue his education and that he had a job at a dollar store The family is devastated , they didn t see this coming They took him in and it s a classic case of no good deed goes unpunished , he said He was a little quirky and he was depressed about his mom s death , but who wouldn t be \? Ocean Parodie s 15 year old sister , Milan , had a similar impression of Cruz as her brother I could tell he tried to be social at times but there was something off about him , she said I never really saw him with many people Girls thought he was creepy and weird He was pretty pale with red hair I didn t talk to him that much , but from what I could tell he wasn t a nice kid He wore a lot of black and was always alone Still , Milan Parodie described Cruz as always enthusiastic He never seemed depressed or sad He was always a little crazy is the best way to put it He was peppy but not in a good way , in a crazy way He tried to look creepy or weird , I think He tried to talk to one of my girlfriends and he said she was cute , but she was weirded out and he was bothering her Most kids ignored him at school They pushed him off to the side as if he was garbage Ocean Parodie Honestly , a lot of people were saying that it was gonna be him , one student told WJXT of Cruz Actually , a lot of kids joked saying that he was gonna be the one to shoot up the school , but it turns out , you know , everyone predicted it , that s crazy The student added He was in the third floor He knows the school layout , he knows where everyone would be he s been in the fire drills He s prepared for this stuff Another student told WFOR TV that Cruz always had guns on him He was off , Giovanni Watford , 17 , told BuzzFeed News He was super stressed out all the time and talked about guns a lot and tried to hide his face Watford told the site he had been in the same Junior ROTC program as Cruz and that Cruz would complain about bullying at Douglas High Broward County Sheriff Steve Israel told reporters the suspect was a former student of the school who was expelled for disciplinary reasons Math teacher Jim Gard told the Miami Herald that Cruz was identified as a threat to the school in previous years We were told last year that he wasn t allowed on campus with a backpack on him , Gard said There were problems with him last year threatening students , and I guess he was asked to leave campus Helen Pasciolla , a former neighbor of Cruz , told The New York Times that he had told her his family had been forced to sell their house in the upscale neighborhood because of money problems She also told the paper both Cruz and his brother were adopted and their adoptive father had died Their mother , Lynda Cruz , would call the police to try to help deal with the boys behavioral problems , Pasciolla told the Times I think she wanted to scare them a little bit , she said Nikolas has behavioral problems , I think , but I never thought he would be violent Broward County Public Schools superintendent Robert Runcie told reporters outside the school he was unaware of previous concerns about the student We received no warnings , he said Potentially there could have been signs out there But we didn t have any warning or phone calls or threats that were made Ocean Parodie , for his part , felt bad for Cruz and visited him after he was thrown out of Douglas High After he got expelled he worked at a Dollar Store next to the movie theater , Parodie said I went there and asked him what happened once He said he was expelled and was happy that he was thrown out I felt bad for him I think just to treat someone differently for how they look is wrong , so I tried to treat him like I treat everyone else Parodie was in anatomy class on Monday afternoon when he saw his fellow students running away Then he heard the fire alarm go off minutes before school was supposed to end One stairway was crowded , so I went down a different stairway , and I heard shots That s when I knew something was up and it wasn t a drill I made it outside I was one of the first people to make it outside Teachers were asking what was going on , the administrators didn t know what was going on Once they had an idea of what s going on they sent us to the middle school next to our school We walked near a canal to stay away from the school in case it showed up A few hours later , Parodie realized the outcast he had pitied was the person who had just executed his schoolmates I found out it was him when the news said who it was I was like , Oh man , I can t believe it s him",false

"SaveIn the weeks since the tragic passing of visionary musician Prince , many speculate his death may have been linked to drug abuse We now know his death resulted from an overdose of the opiate medication Fentanyl Prince s hits were all over the radio when I was in my 20s and 30s He was a truly gifted artist , and he will be missed by many fans Out of his death , his fans and everyone noting his passing should take away two very important lessons First , we as a society must work harder to reduce the stigma that surrounds substance addiction As people speculated about the cause of Prince s death , what judgments were they forming , perhaps even just subconsciously \? Did they think he must be weak or of low moral character \? Too often , society attaches labels such as those to people who are suffering from addiction The truth is that addiction is a disease We would not view people with leukemia or diabetes as deserving to suffer or die because they have the misfortune of being struck with a disease What do we think , though , when we hear a news story about a person who died from a drug overdose \? About 10 percent of Americans suffer from substance addiction Addiction knows no socio economic , gender , geographic or racial boundaries For many people struggling with addiction and their families , it is kept secret because they fear the judgments they will face from others As a result , they don t seek help when they should Prince seemed to have some quirks that go with being a celebrity , but I have never seen anything that suggests he was weak or a person of bad character It is time to start looking at others who struggle with addiction compassionately and supportively The odds are high that someone you care about suffers from this disease , and perhaps that person hasn t sought help and is afraid of what you will think It is time to change that Second , I hope the passing of this music legend teaches us that no one is immune to the dangers that come with the abuse of prescription painkillers They are highly addictive and can be deadly when abused As a multi millionaire , Prince had resources far beyond anything available to most of us He could have afforded the best treatment available Still , it took his life This is probably not the first time opiates caused Prince serious health dangers He had cancelled a concert due to a health concern prior to his fatal overdose I don t know whether that was opiate related , but Fentanyl is an extraordinarily strong opiate It is many times more powerful than heroin that can be purchased on the street Data shows most people do not start off abusing the strongest painkiller More likely , Prince progressed to abusing such a strong drug after his body built up a higher tolerance for less potent prescription medications Here is a frightening fact 80 percent of those who abuse heroin started by abusing prescription pain pills such as Oxycontin , Percoset or Vicodin Once their tolerance builds , they seek ever higher doses or more powerful opiates They become helplessly trapped Opiates took Prince s life despite his virtually unlimited resources and network of supporters If it can happen to him , it can happen to any of us Once addicted , the power of these drugs can be stronger than even the fear of death And far too often , addiction comes quickly As a society , we need to make treatment more readily available to those who are addicted We absolutely need to lock up those who prey on our society by trafficking deadly drugs , especially to young people , but we will not incarcerate our way out of this public health crisis Ultimately , our best chance to stem the nationwide opiate and heroin crisis is prevention We must alter our view of opiates More people now die in Wisconsin from drug overdoses than car crashes Prescription opiates , not heroin , are the top killer in our state In fact , more die from prescription painkillers than from heroin and cocaine combined Opiates are appropriately prescribed in some circumstances , but they must only be used in exactly the way they are prescribed by a doctor About 70 percent of the time , when a person begins abusing opiates , they do not get them from a doctor They acquire them improperly from a family member or a friend So we all have a role in solving this epidemic by securely storing painkillers in our homes and by properly disposing them I was sad to learn about Prince s death I am even more saddened , though , about the 850 or so of my fellow citizens in our state who die from drug overdoses every year Let s not let any of them die in vain Let s do something to put an end to this tragic public health crisis Please go to doseofrealitywi gov to learn more about how we can make our state safer and healthier",true
"Introduction and Summary Four Wilmington Police Department officers shot Jeremy McDole on September 23 , 2015 The Delaware Department of Justice \( DOJ \) undertook an investigation to determine whether any of the four officers should be charged with a criminal offense As detailed in this report , DOJ also examined whether , notwithstanding any potential violations of criminal law , there were deficiencies in the Wilmington Police Department s policies and or training that should be corrected in light of Mr McDole s shooting , to ensure that similar incidents do not occur in the future Our investigation revealed serious deficiencies in the way in which the Wilmington Police Department prepares its police officers to deal with situations like the one that Mr McDole presented , specifically with regard to use of force policies and training and policies for dealing with individuals with mental illness , disabilities , or cognitive impairments Most significantly , we find that the continuum of force provisions of the Wilmington Police Department s use of force policy are effectively meaningless for police officers as currently written With respect to three of the four officers Senior Corporal \( S Cpl \) Daniel Silva , Corporal \( Cpl \) Thomas Lynch , and Corporal \( Cpl \) James MacColl DOJ did not find probable cause to charge them with a criminal offense Through our investigation , we determined that these three officers believed at the moment they discharged their firearms that doing so was necessary to protect themselves , or others , against death or serious physical injury Because of that belief , they were entitled under Delaware law to use deadly force to subdue Mr McDole Under Delaware s deferential legal standard for the use of deadly force by a law enforcement officer , their subjective belief that using deadly force was necessary to protect themselves or others immunizes them from criminal responsibility With respect to the fourth police officer who discharged his firearm , Senior Corporal \( S Cpl \) Joseph Dellose , the Attorney General did believe that the state should attempt to gather sufficient evidence to pursue a felony assault charge , based upon S Cpl Dellose s conduct in immediately confronting Mr McDole rather than communicating with officers who S Cpl Dellose knew were already on the scene , and discharging his shotgun in the manner that he did However , after hiring a former federal prosecutor from Pennsylvania to prepare a case for possible criminal prosecution and after consulting with two nationally recognized police use of force experts who had recently recommended criminal charges against the Cleveland police officer who shot Tamir Rice , and after receiving opinions from both of those experts that S Cpl Dellose s actions did not constitute criminal conduct under the Delaware Code , DOJ concluded that it could not proceed with a criminal prosecution against S Cpl Dellose given that the defense would present unchallenged expert testimony that S Cpl Dellose s conduct was reasonable Although DOJ is not able to pursue criminal charges against S Cpl Dellose , it is DOJ s position that S Cpl Dellose s conduct in this case was extraordinarily poor police work that endangered both the public and his fellow officers DOJ does not believe that S Cpl Dellose should be employed by the Wilmington Police Department in any role where he would be carrying a firearm in public Scope of Investigation The scope of the investigation into Mr McDole s death was much broader than the scope of prior investigations that have been undertaken by DOJ regarding police involved shootings There were a number of reasons for this First , this case was the first police involved shooting since Attorney General Denn assumed responsibility in January 2015 where there was a bona fide question as to whether the individual who was shot was armed with a weapon at or around the time of the shooting This created a need for a broader factual investigation Second , concerns were raised by Mr McDole s family as to \( among other things \) \( 1 \) the integrity of the scene of the shooting \( and , in particular , whether evidence may have been placed at the scene by Wilmington Police Department officers \) , \( 2 \) the possibility of prior contact between Mr McDole and one or more of the officers involved , and \( 3 \) the possibility of additional video of the incident All of these issues had to be thoroughly investigated by DOJ investigators , in addition to their investigation of the shooting incident itself Third , a decision was made early in the investigation that , notwithstanding any issues of criminal liability , the shooting raised serious questions about the Wilmington Police Department s preparation of its officers , which DOJ should attempt to address through the use of outside experts for the future benefit of both the Wilmington Police Department and other Delaware police departments All of these factors resulted in an investigation that was more extensive than other investigations of police involved shootings Finally , the preliminary conclusion that DOJ should attempt to gather sufficient evidence to pursue a felony assault charge against S Cpl Dellose required that DOJ \( a \) recruit , hire , and deputize a former federal prosecutor who was not a member of the Delaware bar to prepare the case for possible presentation to a Delaware grand jury , and \( b \) consult with two national experts with respect to police conduct who had supported criminal charges against a Cleveland police officer with respect to the shooting of Tamir Rice , in order to determine whether the facts collected by DOJ were sufficient to initiate a criminal prosecution against S Cpl Dellose DOJ first consulted with Jeffrey Noble , former Deputy Chief of the Irvine Police Department in California , who has been involved in over one thousand police use of force investigations and , in November 2015 , authored an expert opinion on behalf of Tamir Rice s family that criticized the expert opinions of the Cleveland District Attorney and argued that the Cleveland police officer who shot Tamir Rice should be held responsible for his death After reviewing all of the materials in the McDole case , Mr Noble told DOJ that , in his expert opinion , S Cpl Dellose s conduct did not violate Delaware s criminal statute After receiving Mr Noble s opinion , DOJ solicited a second opinion from Roger Clark , the former head of the Los Angeles Sheriff s Department s North Regional Surveillance and Apprehension Team Mr Clark has been retained as a consulting expert 1 , 400 times , the majority of times for cases

"\( Photo Hero Images Getty Images \) On June 27 , 2017 , my son Alec was found dead , alone in his Minneapolis apartment It shouldn t have happened Alec had Type 1 diabetes , a serious condition that is manageable with access to insulin and proper supplies But Alec turned 26 years old on May 20 of last year , which meant that his coverage under my health insurance policy ended a few days later Alec had a full time , steady job But , like a lot of US workers , he did not have good health insurance offered through his employer For Alec and others with diabetes , this presents a deadly situation Many people with type 2 diabetes need regular access to insulin to live all persons with Type 1 do Insulin is a 95 year old drug whose discoverers sold their patents for 1 each , but its price has increased over 1 , 000 percent since the late 1990s A vial of the same insulin that was once sold for around 25 can now cost patients like Alec nearly 300 , and many people need multiple vials per month to survive The pharmaceutical companies that sell insulin won t disclose any details , but it is likely that this same vial is manufactured for just a few dollars Which means that those companies are making huge profits and paying huge CEO salaries The three insulin manufacturers have raised their prices in lockstep for many years now , prompting a class action lawsuit and criminal investigations into collusion Additionally , the insurance industry is also complicit in the drug pricing scheme For Alec , this meant that his insulin and supplies cost almost 1 , 300 a month He and I together researched for months in advance about his health insurance options They weren t good The best plan we found would cost him 450 a month for the premium with a whopping 7 , 600 deductible That deductible meant he would be paying out of pocket for his medicine for many months anyway , so he decided to go without the plan until he could find a different job with benefits With the cost so high , Alec tried to ration his insulin I have since learned that this is not uncommon Globally , half of the people who need insulin can t reliably get access to it With 6 million people in the US insulin dependent , and nearly 40 percent of Americans uninsured or facing high deductibles that leave their medicine costs uncovered , the crisis is occurring right here , too Endocrinologists here in the US report that as many as one in five of their patients are not able to afford their insulin For many persons with diabetes , that means they land in the emergency room with diabetic ketoacidosis For others , like Alec , they never get there Just 27 days after his coverage under my insurance ended , I received the call no parent ever wants to get As you would imagine , my family and I are still grieving But I ve decided that sharing our story may help prevent someone else from going through what Alec did There are a lot of proposals to increase access to affordable health coverage and to lower the price of medicines , including forcing drug companies to be transparent about their research costs and profits , and allowing Medicare to negotiate down the price it pays for prescription drugs To me , they all boil down to one theme Access to insulin , and other life essential medicines , is a human right The inventor of insulin , Frederick Banting , believed that When he was asked why he gave away his patent for 1 , he replied , Because insulin does not belong to me It belongs to the world That spirit is being violated today , where there are thousands of GoFundMe pages devoted to people like Alec , desperately trying to cobble together the money they need for their monthly insulin There are a lot of good people working to change this , including US lawmakers But it seems clear to me that significant movement toward universal access to essential medicines will only come when the affected patients and their loved ones help lead the way So I was happy to see that people with diabetes in Nevada were able to help push through a law that requires transparency in insulin pricing there And that is why I support the patient group T1International s demand that insulin manufacturers disclose the profits they are making off of each vial and reverse their unjustified price increases That is why I shared Alec s story at a recent demonstration led by Type 1 diabetes patients outside the headquarters of insulin manufacturer Eli Lilly and Company , demanding increased transparency and lower prices As I told the patients and activists gathered there , my Alec was the best son anyone could ask for He was loved by so many and I am so proud to have been his mom for the short 26 years I had with him But he should still be here I should not have buried my son at 26 because he couldn t afford the one thing in life that was created to keep him alive",true

"Election officials in Franklin County , Ohio are reportedly stumped over what one maintenance worker found in a dilapidated downtown Columbus warehouse earlier this week According to sources , Randall Prince , a Columbus area electrical worker , was doing a routine check of his companies wiring and electrical systems when he s tumbled across approximately one dozen black , sealed ballot boxes filled with thousands of Franklin County votes for Hillary Clinton and other Democrat candidates No one really goes in this building It s mainly used for short term storage by a commercial plumber , Prince said So when Prince , who is a Trump supporter , saw several black boxes in an otherwise empty room , he went to investigate What he found could allegedly be evidence of a massive operation designed to deliver Clinton the crucial swing state Prince , shown here , poses with his find , as election officials investigate Early voting does not begin in Ohio until October 12 , so no votes have officially been cast in the Buckeye state However , inside these boxes were , what one source described as , potentially tens of thousands of votes for Hillary Clinton Christian Times Newspaper has not yet been able to obtain a photocopy of one of the ballots found inside the box , but an affiliate in Ohio passed along a replica of what was found Timeshas not yet been able to obtain a photocopy of one of the ballots found inside the box , but an affiliate in Ohio passed along a replica of what was found It is important to note that the above replica coincides with a ballot that a Franklin County voter would cast at the polling place on Election Day , meaning the Clinton campaign s likely goal was to slip the fake ballot boxes in with the real ballot boxes when they went to official election judges on November 8th Ohio , a perennial swing state in the presidential election , has been a challenge for Clinton and her Democrat counterparts in 2016 Many national Democrat groups have pulled funding from the state entirely , in order to redirect it to places in which they are doing better Clinton herself has spent less time in Ohio , and spent less money , in recent weeks as it has appeared that Trump will carry the crucial state With this find , however , it now appears that Clinton and the Democrat Party planned on stealing the state on Election Day , making any campaigning there now a waste of time This story is still developing , and CTN will bring you more when we have it",false

"ShareTweetPin 1Share7K SharesThere is some interesting information out there about hair and the role it plays in intuition and the nervous system Keeping ones hair long is viewed as a choice The style is personal preference , and people who keep their hair long are viewed as hippies , hipsters , or just plain lazy However , a whole different story emerged during the time of the Vietnam war A woman , lets call her Sally , was married to a licensed psychologist who happened to work at a VA Medical Hospital He worked with combat veterans who were suffering from PTSD Below is Sallys story I remember clearly an evening when my husband came back to our apartment on Doctors Circle carrying a thick official looking folder in his hands Inside were hundreds of pages of certain studies commissioned by the government He was in shock from the contents What he read in those documents completely changed his life From that moment on my conservative middle of the road husband grew his hair and beard and never cut them again What is more , the VA Medical center let him do it , and other very conservative men in the staff followed his example As I read the documents , I learned why It seems that during the Vietnam War special forces in the war department had sent undercover experts to comb American Native American Reservations looking for talented scouts , for tough young men trained to move stealthily through rough terrain They were especially looking for men with outstanding , almost supernatural , tracking abilities Before being approached , these carefully selected men were extensively documented as experts in tracking and survival With the usual enticements , the well proven smooth phrases used to enroll new recruits , some of these Native American trackers were then enlisted Once enlisted , an amazing thing happened Whatever talents and skills they had possessed on the reservation seemed to disappear mysteriously , as recruit after recruit failed to perform as expected in the field Serious casualties and failures of performance led the government to contract expensive testing of these recruits , and this is what was found When questioned about their failure to perform as expected , the older recruits replied consistently that when they received their required military haircuts , they could no longer sense the enemy They could no longer access a sixth sense , their intuition no longer was reliable , they could not read subtle signs as well or access subtle extrasensory information So the testing institute recruited more Native American trackers , let them keep their long hair , and tested them in multiple areas Then they would pair two men together who had received the same scores on all the tests They would let one man in the pair keep his hair long , and gave the other man a military haircut Then the two men retook the tests Time after time the man with long hair kept making high scores Time after time , the man with the short hair failed the tests in which he had previously scored high scores Here is a standardized test The recruit is sleeping out in the woods An armed enemy approaches the sleeping man The long haired man is awakened out of his sleep by a strong sense of danger and gets away long before the enemy is close , long before any sounds from the approaching enemy are audible In another version of this test , the long haired man senses an approach and somehow intuits that the enemy will perform a physical attack He follows his sixth sense and stays still , pretending to be sleeping , but quickly grabs the attacker and kills him as the attacker reaches down to strangle him This same man , after having passed these and other tests , then received a military haircut and consistently failed these tests and many other tests that he had previously passed So , the document recommended that all Native American trackers be exempt from military haircuts In fact , it required that trackers keep their hair long How is this possible \? It all has to do with how we as humans have evolved Every part of the body has a purpose , and when we lose touch with ourselves and our bodies , we lose the true power we have Hair , like skin , is an extension of the nervous system , it may be correctly seen as exteriorized nerves , a type of highly evolved feelers or antennae that transmit vast amounts of important information to the brainstem , the limbic system , and the neocortex However , many people think hair is dead and does nothing for us as humans It is just an accessory I do not know who is right or who is wrong , but I am open to all possibilities Here is the man you need to hear it from This article was featured at Rense WakingTimes by C Young ShareTweetPin 1Share7K Shares",false
"Teenage Sex and Buru sera Shops Yoshiro Mizuguchi , Editor in Chief of Monthly Women 's Magazine Fujin Koron There is a certain sort of used clothing shop that has been booming in recent years The shop is one room in an apartment There are two display cases , one on each side of the room , facing each other There are mountains of underwear in every color You begin to notice the 'abnormality' of the place This is not a department where beautiful lingerie is sold These items are all stained and soiled In other words , they are used Uniforms from famous middle and high school girls' schools are also on display They are also dingy This is place that sells items that should have been thrown away or sent to the cleaners Shorts \( bloomers \) which are used in physical education classes \( known as Buruma in Japan \) , school uniforms , and sailor or middy clothes \( known as sera \) are in these stores As a result these stores have come to be known as buru sera shops The sellers are just common middle school and high school girls They stop by on their way home , looking for a little pocket money Some take out sundry items from their bags , while others take off their underwear on the spot The clerks then check the amount of soiling and price them accordingly Among other considerations are smell , and these items are ranked such as 'three day items , ' 'one week items , ' etc An appropriate amount of residue of menstrual blood or excrement brings particularly high prices In the case of underwear 2000 yen \( 20 \) is the general price If there is a photo of the girl attached the price can more than double The 'sailor' clothes are more expensive if they are from a school that is well known or from an 'uptown' girls school There are some maniacs who will pay any price for a uniform from the Princess' home school The girls who come to sell are happy go lucky We just want money This is an easy way to get it and it 's better than working part time There is a never ending flow of white collar workers in their twenties and thirties and college students coming in to buy these unusual items The girls who come in to sell are not from poor families on the contrary , they are from established households It must be said that the monetary values of these neo yamatonadeshiko \( daughters of Japan \) are severely warped They have never had to endure anything and the carefree atmosphere has removed the boundaries of common sense Get money Have fun What 's wrong with that \? is how it goes This is the kind of value that is common to present day Japan The girls sell their bodies to get brand name items and have fun Matter has overtaken Soul To state it plainly , this is bartering between bodies \( matter \) and brand name items \( matter \) There are such markets all over the place They can sell their bodies as well as their underwear It goes without saying that the parents and adults who cannot say , Cut out this foolishness ! are equally guilty No one wants to think that selling underwear leads directly to prostitution But the middle school girls in prostitution say , I'm not doing anything wrong I'm keeping it a secret from my parents , but I'm not harming anyone According to analysis by psychiatrists , the men who steal or buy or wear women 's underwear view the underwear as a substitute for female genitals This points to a lack of erotic communication between the sexes There is also a great problem in the sudden increase in adults who buy this underwear and the sexual services of young girls Sexual perversion is related to the form of society What must be pointed out is that there is something fundamentally wrong with this nation when 'buru sera' shops flourish and 'neo yamatondeshiko' are allowed to sell themselves without comment from their parents or older It is a bartering session , one without a soul \( 10 24 94 \) Yoshiro Mizuguchi , Editor in Chief of Monthly Women 's Magazine Fujin Koron",true

"Toxicity Chocolate Written by Dr Peggy Root Reviewed by Dr Mike Murphy The toxic compounds in chocolate are theobromine and caffeine , which are classified as methylxanthine alkaloids Theobromine is the primary chemical involved in chocolate toxicity in small animals Dogs and cats are exposed to chocolate especially during the holiday season Because of their small body size relative to human beings , ingestion of a fairly small amount of chocolate may cause toxicity As little as 4 ounces of baking chocolate or 1 pound of milk chocolate could be fatal if ingested by a dog weighing 10 pounds or less Dogs will readily eat a toxic dose of chocolate Ingestion of the rich smelling cocoa bean landscaping mulch also can be a cause of methylxanthine toxicity The relative amount of theobromine contained in various chocolate compounds is described in the table below CHOCOLATE PRODUCT THEOBROMINE CONTENT \( mg oz \) Cocoa bean landscaping mulch 300 1200 Cacao beans 400 1500 Cocoa powder 400 550 Unsweetened baking chocolate 450 Semi sweet baking chocolate \( chips \) 135 260 Milk chocolate 60 Hot chocolate beverage 12 White chocolate 1 Theobromine is absorbed from ingested chocolate products slowly , reaching peak levels in the blood about 10 hours after ingestion Initial clinical signs are seen 2 to 4 hours after ingestion , and include restlessness , panting , vomiting , urinary incontinence , diarrhea and increased heart rate Over time , the body temperature rises , arrhythmias of the heart occur , and the muscles become rigid Finally , seizures and coma occur , followed by death Treatment involves decreasing further absorption of theobromine from ingested chocolate Induction of vomiting only is beneficial if the animal is seen within 2 hours of having ingested the chocolate and if seizures have not begun Chocolate products may coagulate into a ball in the stomach , preventing their expulsion or movement through the intestinal tract Supportive care that will be provided by the veterinarian includes administration of intravenous fluids , medications as needed for heart abnormalities and seizures , and maintenance of normal body temperature Because chocolate products generally are high in fat , secondary pancreatic disease may occur Prognosis for dogs with chocolate toxicity is good if the animal is treated by the veterinarian within 2 to 4 hours of their having eaten a toxic dose of chocolate Prognosis is guarded if heart abnormalities or central nervous system signs , such as tremors , muscle rigidity , or seizures , develop Potential chocolate poisoning is an emergency Please call your veterinarian Do not leave e mail messages on this site about possible poisonings , as messages are not answered swiftly enough to ensure your pet 's safe recovery Emergency personnel at the University of Minnesota Veterinary Teaching Hospital can be reached at 612 625 1919 during the day before 4 30 pm , and at 612 625 9711 in the evening and on weekends References Carson TL Methylxanthines In Small animal toxicology , Peterson ME and Talcott PA \( eds \) , WB Saunders Co , Philadelphia PA , 2001 563 570 Gwaltney Brant S Toxicology of common household hazards Proceedings , Midwest Veterinary Conference , Columbus OH , 2001 127 134 Osweiler GD Chocolate toxicity In The five minute veterinary consult , Canine and feline , Tilley LP and Smith FWK \( eds \) , Williams and Wilkins , Philadelphia PA , 1997 440 441 Dogs Cats Pocket Pets Other Pets Junior Scientists Kid 's Corner FAQ 's Fun and Games Pet of the Month Personality Profile Pet Loss Site Map Contact Us About This Site",true

"Donald Is on Our Side , Says Company With Ties to Putin WASHINGTON One of the world s biggest producers of asbestos , a Russian company with ties to Vladimir Putin , is praising President Trump for allowing asbestos to remain legal in the U S The company s applause for Trump comes as Russia is poised to become the leading importer to the U S of asbestos , which causes diseases that kill an estimated 15 , 000 Americans a year A recent study led by Jukka Takala , president of the International Commission on Occupational Health , found the death toll from asbestos exposure may be much higher , at nearly 40 , 000 Americans a year and more than 255 , 000 a year worldwide On June 25 , the asbestos producer Uralasbest posted photos on its Facebook page of pallets of its signature product , chrysotile asbestos , wrapped in plastic adorned with Trump s image Trump s picture is at the center of a large red seal declaring APPROVED BY DONALD TRUMP , 45th PRESIDENT OF THE UNITED STATES Photo Uralasbest OJSC , via Facebook In an English translation of the post , Uralasbest said Donald is on our side ! He supported the head of the United States Environmental Protection Agency , Scott Pruitt , who stated that his agency would no longer deal with negative effects potentially derived from products containing asbestos Donald Trump supported a specialist and called asbestos 100 safe after application Pruitt resigned as EPA administrator last week , after an 18 month tenure marred by ethical scandals , profligate spending of taxpayer dollars and aggressive attempts to roll back public health protections One of his last decisions was to exclude so called legacy uses of asbestos from the scope of an ongoing safety assessment He also declined to ban new uses of asbestos The Obama administration had designated asbestos a priority for a new safety assessment under the nation s new toxic chemicals law Trump has long rejected the scientific consensus that asbestos is so dangerous that there is no safe level of exposure In his 1997 book , The Art of the Comeback , the future president claimed asbestos is 100 percent safe , once applied In 2012 , he tweeted that if asbestos had not been removed from the World Trade Center , the twin towers would never have burned down in the 9 11 terrorist attacks Not to be outdone in showering adoration on Trump , Kostanai Minerals , the largest chrysotile asbestos producer in neighboring Kazakhstan , shared the post on its own Facebook page Uralasbest claims its asbestos mine in the Ural Mountains city of Asbest is the largest in the world According to an investigation by the Center for Public Integrity , in 2010 , Putin met with the head of the Uralasbest workers union , who said he promised to support Russian producers of chrysotile , especially in situations where we find ourselves under political pressure at the international level The Center also reported that Kostanai Minerals has received financial backing from state controlled banks in both Russia and Kazakhstan According to the U S Geological Survey , in 2016 , roughly 95 percent of the asbestos imported into the U S came from Brazil , with the rest coming from Russia The Commerce Department and the U S International Trade Commission estimate that 705 metric tons of asbestos came into the U S in 2016 , compared to 343 metric tons the year before But in November , Brazil joined more than 60 other nations and banned asbestos Brazil s ban leaves Russia , Kazakhstan and China as the world s dominant asbestos producers With Brazil no longer providing the vast majority of asbestos to the U S , Russia and Kazakhstan could fill the void Vladimir Putin and Russia s asbestos industry stand to prosper mightily as a result of the Trump Administration s failure to ban asbestos in the U S , said EWG President Ken Cook Helping Putin and Russian oligarchs amass fortunes by selling a product that kills thousands each year should never be the role of a U S president or the EPA , but this is the Trump administration Russia s interests are Trump s interests , and any clear eyed American knows it By allowing asbestos to remain legal , the Trump administration would be responsible for a flood of asbestos imports from Russia and other countries into the U S , as well as the wave of illnesses and deaths that will continue for years to come , said Linda Reinstein , co founder and president of the Asbestos Disease Awareness Organization Americans know Putin does not have their interests at heart , but it s becoming increasingly apparent that neither does Trump Trump and Putin are scheduled to hold a one on one summit in Helsinki , Finland , on July 16 The agenda for the meeting has not been made public , but it is safe to assume talks over trade between the two countries could be part of the discussion Photo credit Shutterstock com",true

We 're here to help educate you Jenny Kane RGJ That statement is too much It s too much as far as I m concerned , said Dr Noah Kaufman , an emergency medicine specialist based in Northern Colorado Because that is saying confidently that this is the first case We ve got one ! And I still disagree with that It s widely accepted as fact that marijuana overdoses are not fatal The U S Drug Enforcement Administration fact sheet on pot says simply that no death from overdose of marijuana has been reported and the National Institutes of Health says there is insufficient evidence to link THC overdose to fatalities The claim that an overdose death happened in Colorado has the potential to change the way people think about the steady march toward marijuana legalization in the U S The controversyBoth published accounts of this case clearly state that the autopsy shows that the 11 month old boy died of myocarditis \( inflammation of the heart muscle \) which caused the heart to fail The Nappe Hoyte published case study takes the diagnosis a step further , theorizing that the myocarditis was caused by cannabis overdose , which then caused the baby boy s heart to fail That diagnosis of this heart condition is at the core of the medical debate over this case study Myocarditis is rare in children , and can often be fatal when diagnosed In children , fatal myocarditis is usually caused by a virus called Coxsackievirus The authors of the case report say that virus was ruled out in this case CLOSEA recent poll says Americans believe marijuana is less harmful than opioids in pain relief , but are less comfortable with its use by children and pregnant women for medical conditions WochitMyocarditis has a long list of other known causes , mostly from infections by bacteria , viruses , fungi , and parasites We extensively ruled out almost every other cause that we can think of , Dr Hoyte said Myself , our team , plus the primary team taking care of the patient , plus the coroner who did the post mortem on the child And we found no other reason why this young kid ended up having inflammation on his heart Drs Hoyte and Nappe both worked on the case as physicians on staff at the poison control center More New 'Potcast' to dive into how marijuana legalization is changing AmericaWe do not know if this case has led to a criminal investigation Hoyte and Nappe declined to share the identity of the deceased child or even the name of the hospital in Colorado where the death took place , for fear of revealing his identity They report finding a high concentration of THC \( the psychoactive drug found in marijuana \) in the child s urine and blood Short of that , they have no evidence that explains the child s death We just wanted to make sure that we re not going to call this a marijuana related fatality if there was something else that we could point at And we looked and looked and couldn t find it , Hoyte said Their case report points to other research that shows myocarditis as a symptom associated with THC consumption , but those cases involved the presence of other drugs and do not propose a mechanism by which marijuana might bring on myocarditis None of those cases involved fatalities This hints at a scientific limitation of this study The doctors don t have a proof positive way to demonstrate that marijuana caused the death in this 2015 case What they can do is demonstrate a presence of marijuana in the boy s system , and that they ruled out a lot of other possible explanations for his death The child didn t leave the house between being normal and being sick The child had THC in the blood and in the urine and there were marijuana products in the house , Hoyte said I feel very comfortable with the workup that we did and how much we ruled out in this particular case This conclusion leaves other doctors curious , but skeptical that this truly is the world s first documented death by marijuana overdose This child s death in 2015 was previously noted in a 2016 paper published in the Journal of the American Medical Association Pediatrics In that paper , written by Dr George Wang of Children s Hospital Colorado , said that marijuana could not be determined as the cause of myocarditis in this case However , Dr Wang says that his study focused on a wider review of years of data and not the relationship between this type of heart problem and evidence of marijuana found in that boy s system Multiple ER doctors and medical researchers were interviewed for this story Many praised the Rocky Mountain Poison and Drug Center as a top tier institution for researching the issue , but none accepted this case as bulletproof evidence of a marijuana overdose death , though some were more open to the idea than others One spoke on the record I m going to have to call BS on this one , Kaufman said I m not saying that it s not But I think it s a pretty big leap to say that it is Other possible causesWhile the study notes that the child tested positive for marijuana and that his case involved an unstable motel living situation and parental admission of drug possession , including cannabis , the doctors admit in their published report , the myocarditis could have been caused by something doctors can t test for A lot of the times the cause of myocarditis is infectious Or unknown , Hoyte said Dr Kaufman agrees about the number of unknown causes of myocarditis Hoyte may be pretty confident , Kaufman said , But I m not I think that it s more likely that there s not a relationship There s so many things that cause the problem that this poor baby had , that we re not even close to saying it was definitively a marijuana overdose , Kaufman added Allergies can cause this What if the kiddo was allergic to the carnauba wax , or whatever is in the gummy that s not the marijuana \? Kaufman also points out that there are thousands of known cases of accidental ingestion of marijuana by kids of all ages and while symptoms can be bad , none of those cases have proven fatal To him , that suggests there may be some other reason that a small segment of the population is more sensitive to overdose on THC than most people The case report on this death itself is missing some key information Hoyte and Nappe wrote that the boy ate an unknown dose of THC , and said they aren t sure exactly what product was involved or precisely when he ate it Based on the blood levels of THC metabolite they found , the doctors estimate that consumption took place 2 6 days before death Some context and adviceDoctors on both sides of the debate agree on what parents should learn from this case It s the same advice they ve given since marijuana first became legal in Colorado keep it away from kids Even if I m not convinced that it could kill your kid , you need to be really careful because it could make them really sick , Dr Kaufman said It needs to be locked up away in a medicine chest because it can cause seizures It can cause real big problems in kids that can lead to other problems Concerned parents can also learn the warning signs for marijuana ingestion , which include lack of balance , unusual and sudden sleepiness , and breathing difficulty , according to Children s Hospital Colorado Hoyte and Nappe report that this baby displayed those symptoms for a day or so before he had a seizure and went to the ER Colorado has taken recent steps aimed at preventing accidental ingestion by children In the years since legalization , the state has imposed new restrictions on the potency and design of edible marijuana products New rules that took effect last month ban edibles that resemble existing non marijuana candies and also bans shaping edibles in the form of people , animals , or fruit Dr Hoyte was careful to point out that even though he does believe THC led to this death , there are plenty of more harmful substances parents also need to worry about We re far more concerned about opioids in that case of a kid getting really sick than we are of marijuana , Hoyte said Even if Hoyte and Nappe s determination is confirmed , it s worth noting that we would have more confirmed deaths from swallowed laundry and dish detergent pods than from marijuana , according to poison control researchers at Nationwide Children 's Hospital in Columbus , Ohio The doctors who spoke agree further study may be warranted , including animal testing , to shed more light on possible links between myocarditis and marijuana More post mortem studies of the heart tissue from cannabis users who pass away could also be useful , Hoyte suggested However , he says that if he s right , this phenomenon may be extremely rare Cases of kids ingesting cannabis have increased since Colorado legalized the drug , but Hoyte admits pot may not be causing enough serious health complications to study these issues extensively We re not getting calls from kids getting sick from marijuana or even adults getting sick from marijuana getting sick to the point of having bad outcomes , Hoyte said We re not getting these every single day They re very few and far between Was this a rare case of marijuana death , or something else \?

Robles said But they pointed at Jane \( Ahern \) , who works for the House , and they said , No , you can stay Ahern , a policy advisor for House Democrats , is white I was born in California , said Flores I m obviously of Mexican descent , so I think in that group I m the darkest one Selianna and Dora , they re light skinned Latinos So , I think probably that s why they pointed at me out of a group of six They assume things about you There s not much we can do , said Robles , an Arizona native raised in the town of San Luis We work for the state , we re public servants , and we re just here to do our job Lawmakers said they were also questioned based on their appearance Rep Eric Descheenie , D Chinle , said he was confronted by Trump supporters while helping defend a young student that he said was being harassed They asked Descheenie , a Navajo lawmaker , if he was in the United States illegally Rep Eric Descheenie \( D Chinle \) I m indigenous to these lands , Descheenie said My ancestors fought and died on these lands I just told them , Don t ask me that question Rep C sar Ch vez , D Phoenix , said he was approached by a female Trump supporter asking who he was and who he represents For the fun of it , Ch vez said , he replied , I m an undocumented legislator Ch vez was brought from Mexico to the United States as a child He said he wanted the protesters to understand that in this country , through a process , you , too , can be a part of a nation that provides opportunity to everybody I wanted them to understand that an individual who came to this country undocumented at the age of three is now a member of the Arizona State Legislature Ch vez said the woman reacted by calling him illegal She said something like , You re illegal Once illegal , always illegal , he said I took no offense , no attention It was just simply one of those things where you re going to have a stance and I m going to have a stance and we re never going to agree on things Jennifer Caminiti Harrison and Lesa Antone said they were at the Capitol to protest activists with Living United for Change in Arizona \( LUCHA \) The women told the Arizona Capitol Times in a phone interview tonight they re against illegal immigration and don t believe the LUCHA activists , who they alleged are undocumented , have the right to lobby state legislators In denying the allegations , Caminiti Harrison and Antone countered that their group was harassed by the LUCHA activists In a live stream of the protest uploaded to Facebook by Antone , a LUCHA member could be heard telling a black Trump supporter , You re gonna be the first to get lynched First , we were a group of several white , black and Latina Americans To make assumptions that we were only calling out Hispanic representatives or non white legislatures \( sic \) is a disgusting , blatant lie , Caminiti Harrison also wrote in an email We also had legal immigrants visiting the Capitol who stood in solidarity with us along with Republican lawmakers who thanked us for being there and stopped for a photo In a video uploaded to YouTube , Republican Reps Jay Lawrenece , of Scottsdale , and Bob Thorpe , of Flagstaff , are seen speaking and taking photos with protesters We asked every rep , white or otherwise , if they supported illegal immigration and why they put the needs of illegal immigrants over the needs of American citizens , Caminiti Harrison wrote Never at any time did we ask the representatives if they were illegals Never A 14 minute video of yesterday s protest uploaded on YouTube shows several interactions initiated by the anti illegal immigration protesters Near the beginning of the video , one protester could be heard assuming that members of a group are staying illegally in the U S No , they re not legal They re illegal , a woman can be heard saying Yeah , we know they re illegal Get legal or get out of America They re illegal , see that \? another woman shouted at the group In another part of the video , a woman can be heard confronting a group of men Why do you want to stay in our country if you hate it so much \? she said One member of the group , a man , came back to tell the protester that she and others need to get educated They exchanged a few more words , and he said , This land wasn t your guys She yelled at him as he walked away , You are an illegal alien When the man denied the accusation , the woman responded Those guys are illegal They do not have any rights here It is not their time This is our time Our nation Our laws Our streets The video also shows what appeared to be a LUCHA activist shielding a young man who was being questioned by the protester about his stance on immigration So , you also believe in No border , No wall , No USA at all \? Do you also believe in that \? Because if you do , why are you here \?

"A nursing home can abuse an elderly resident to the point of death and not be subject to a fine , thanks to the Trump administration Reacting to the demands of lobbyists , the Trump administration has struck down several regulations that have governed the nursing home industry The New York Times reports that this now means several common citations that used to result in fines will either see reduced penalties or no penalties at all Advertisement Error loading player No playable sources found These citations have included failing to protect residents from avoidable accidents , neglect , mistreatment and bedsores Americans can now know that their grandparents , parents , or great grandparents can be neglected and abused without the government exercising oversight Toby Edelman , a senior attorney at the Center for Medicare Advocacy , told the Times , They ve pretty much emasculated enforcement , which was already weak The fines , designed to prod nursing homes into treating elderly Americans with more care , respect , and dignity , were put in place by President Barack Obama and sought to make the institutions answerable to standards put together by Medicare Between 2013 and this year , 6 , 500 nursing homes 4 out of every 10 have been cited for serious violations Under the Obama policies , two thirds of those homes were fined In his eagerness to undo as many regulations as possible , regardless of consequence , Donald Trump has thrown those policies out the window after the lobbyists for companies that operate the homes got the ear of his administration A memo from the Trump administration referred to these fines as penalizing a one time mistake Even if that one time mistake killed someone s grandmother The Times notes one nursing home where the failure to monitor and treat a patient s wound led to a pain medication pump slipping through a ruptured suture , protruding from her abdomen Under the Obama rules , the nursing home at fault Lincoln Manor in Illinois was fined 282 , 954 Under Trump , the home where a person died because of neglect would be fined less than 21 , 000 This sets up a perverse incentive system that tells nursing homes they can abuse and neglect human beings up to and including death and still be exempt from many , if not all , fines Callous treatment of the most vulnerable in society is abhorrent and cruel But it s just another day with Trump",true

"Posted at 9 00 AM ET , 12 21 2010Virginia Rep Gerry Connolly on government workers under political fireBy Ed O'KeefeMore and more , when politicians talk about government employees whether they are federal , state or local it is with the kind of umbrage ordinarily aimed at Wall Street financiers and convenience store bandits Rep Gerald E Connolly \( D Va \) The Federal Eye and colleague Karen Tumulty write in Tuesday 's Washington Post about the growing backlash against public sector employees an issue of special interest in the Washington area , which is home to about 600 , 000 federal workers Rep Gerald E Connolly \( D Va \) represents about 56 , 000 of them who live in Northern Virginia The Federal Eye spoke with him last week about the growing public sector backlash A transcript edited for space appears below Question What do you make of this increased rhetoric against public sector workers , specifically , federal employees \? I think it 's very easy for politicians to demonize federal employees Politically , it costs very little to do that But I think in terms of what it does in the cost to public service is considerable Ultimately , the loser is the public itself , because the more you make public service unattractive , the more you reinforce stereotypes These are n't just nameless , faceless people who work in the bowels of a bureaucracy , they are real people who provide real services for real people It just demeans public service in a way that ultimately costs the public Does this feel like something new or more intense than he has seen before \? Is it new \? I think we 've been doing this since the age of Ronald Reagan , maybe even Jimmy Carter I'm a child of the 1960s , I remember John Kennedy and he ennobled public service Starting around Jimmy Carter and certainly perfected by Ronald Reagan , we had a very different message about public service I think we 've been fighting that battle back and forth ever since What about President Obama Is he closer to Reagan or Kennedy when it comes to public service and federal workers \? I think he 's in between Personally , he certainly believes in the nobility of service and would believe it 's a calling that 's worthy But on the other hand , as a politician , I think he too quickly singled out federal employment as , 'That 's the one I'm going to pluck out and put on the scoreboard That 's where we 're going to save money ' My reaction was , I believe federal employees and certainly the unions who represent them are willing to make a sacrifice and put some commitments on the table as part of this national cause of reducing red ink But help me understand why of all the items on the menu being served up by the Deficit Reduction Committee , the White House in advance picks this one and says this is what we 're going to do And this one just happens to be aimed and about federal employment Then what should he have picked otherwise \? I think the president unwittingly contributed to this unfriendly , if not hostile climate with respect to federal employment , and I think that 's too bad That 's not the same as saying that they should n't be willing to make a sacrifice , but signaling it out in advance of the commission 's report I think calls out the value we put on that service To me , that 's an unfortunate message that just piles on So where is this anti public sector debate headed \? I think the Congress we elected in November is a lot less hospitable to the interests of federal employees I think you 're going to see a lot more legislative action and suggestion aimed at reducing the size and compensation of that federal workforce and retirees Going right at the benefits , going right at the size of the workforce , and frankly , being a lot less attuned to the quality of that workforce Facts be damned There 's a lot of rhetoric on the other side about the growth of the federal workforce , but it 's about the size it was under the first President Bush There has n't really been a lot of net growth in the federal workforce when you compare it to say , 1990 It 's not like it 's gotten out of hand , it 's true I'm afraid that in the focus of reinforcing a stereotype is what will be lost in discussions are the ones we ought to be having , which are the quality of the workforce Where are we going to get the sophisticated skillsets we need for the future if we 're demeaning that service in the first place \? I think it 's self defeating It 's a compelling issue , because an awful lot of people are qualified to retire What if anything are you going to do combat this \? If the other side of the aisle is willing to engage in meaningful reforms , where we can have win win , and we 're able to get more out of the federal workforce , I'm all for that The president just signed my bill on telework last week There are a lot of other initiatives that can upgrade how we do things in the federal workplace and how we recruit and retain skilled workers What is really driving this debate \? What 's the political cost back in Utah or Idaho or Wyoming \? What 's the cost of picking on the federal bureaucrat \? It kind of feeds the narrative of this big , out or control federal bureaucracy that is so far removed from where you live and work that it 's an unnecessary impediment to the rest of us getting on with our lives It 's a powerful narrative in the sense I suppose of the American story , this fierce independence of Americans who , by nature are a little mistrustful of government That 's healthy But to despise the public servant and demonize that public servant , with impunity , does a real disservice to public service and is dangerous in terms of the quality of the government we 're going to need as we move forward The next Congress almost guarantees that they 'll be a lot more attackers than defenders People like me are going to have a much harder job to make the case , because I think there are fewer willing ears Read the full story and leave your thoughts in the comments section below2010",true

It s madness , why would you do a thing like that \? Numerous onlookers were horrified as the woman approached a gator that was resting on the edge of the trail in a patch of sun I pleaded with her to get back onto the trail , said one male witness , but she said she was just going to take a selfie and told me not to worry about it The woman proceeded to take out her phone and prepare for the selfie , but moments later the alligator lashed out , covering the distance between itself and the tourist in seconds Related Articles23 Women Inappropriately Dressed For Walmart \?

"Updated September 2017 The American College of Pediatricians urges healthcare professionals , educators and legislators to reject all policies that condition children to accept as normal a life of chemical and surgical impersonation of the opposite sex Facts not ideology determine reality 1 Human sexuality is an objective biological binary trait XY and XX are genetic markers of male and female , respectively not genetic markers of a disorder The norm for human design is to be conceived either male or female Human sexuality is binary by design with the obvious purpose being the reproduction and flourishing of our species This principle is self evident The exceedingly rare disorders of sex development \( DSDs \) , including but not limited to testicular feminization and congenital adrenal hyperplasia , are all medically identifiable deviations from the sexual binary norm , and are rightly recognized as disorders of human design Individuals with DSDs \( also referred to as intersex \) do not constitute a third sex 1 2 No one is born with a gender Everyone is born with a biological sex Gender \( an awareness and sense of oneself as male or female \) is a sociological and psychological concept not an objective biological one No one is born with an awareness of themselves as male or female this awareness develops over time and , like all developmental processes , may be derailed by a child s subjective perceptions , relationships , and adverse experiences from infancy forward People who identify as feeling like the opposite sex or somewhere in between do not comprise a third sex They remain biological men or biological women 2 , 3 , 4 3 A person s belief that he or she is something they are not is , at best , a sign of confused thinking When an otherwise healthy biological boy believes he is a girl , or an otherwise healthy biological girl believes she is a boy , an objective psychological problem exists that lies in the mind not the body , and it should be treated as such These children suffer from gender dysphoria Gender dysphoria \( GD \) , formerly listed as Gender Identity Disorder \( GID \) , is a recognized mental disorder in the most recent edition of the Diagnostic and Statistical Manual of the American Psychiatric Association \( DSM 5 \) 5 The psychodynamic and social learning theories of GD GID have never been disproved 2 , 4 , 5 4 Puberty is not a disease and puberty blocking hormones can be dangerous Reversible or not , puberty blocking hormones induce a state of disease the absence of puberty and inhibit growth and fertility in a previously biologically healthy child 6 5 According to the DSM 5 , as many as 98 of gender confused boys and 88 of gender confused girls eventually accept their biological sex after naturally passing through puberty 5 6 Pre pubertal children diagnosed with gender dysphoria may be given puberty blockers as young as eleven , and will require cross sex hormones in later adolescence to continue impersonating the opposite sex These children will never be able to conceive any genetically related children even via artificial reproductive technology In addition , cross sex hormones \( testosterone and estrogen \) are associated with dangerous health risks including but not limited to cardiac disease , high blood pressure , blood clots , stroke , diabetes , and cancer 7 , 8 , 9 , 10 , 11 7 Rates of suicide are nearly twenty times greater among adults who use cross sex hormones and undergo sex reassignment surgery , even in Sweden which is among the most LGBTQ affirming countries 12 What compassionate and reasonable person would condemn young children to this fate knowing that after puberty as many as 88 of girls and 98 of boys will eventually accept reality and achieve a state of mental and physical health \? 8 Conditioning children into believing a lifetime of chemical and surgical impersonation of the opposite sex is normal and healthful is child abuse Endorsing gender discordance as normal via public education and legal policies will confuse children and parents , leading more children to present to gender clinics where they will be given puberty blocking drugs This , in turn , virtually ensures they will choose a lifetime of carcinogenic and otherwise toxic cross sex hormones , and likely consider unnecessary surgical mutilation of their healthy body parts as young adults Michelle A Cretella , M D President of the American College of Pediatricians Quentin Van Meter , M D Vice President of the American College of Pediatricians Pediatric Endocrinologist Paul McHugh , M D University Distinguished Service Professor of Psychiatry at Johns Hopkins Medical School and the former psychiatrist in chief at Johns Hopkins Hospital Originally published March 2016 Updated September 2017 CLARIFICATIONS in response to FAQs regarding points 3 5 Regarding Point 3 Where does the APA or DSM 5 indicate that Gender Dysphoria is a mental disorder \? The APA \( American Psychiatric Association \) is the author of the Diagnostic and Statistical Manual of Mental Disorders , 5th edition \( DSM 5 \) The APA states that those distressed and impaired by their GD meet the definition of a disorder The College is unaware of any medical literature that documents a gender dysphoric child seeking puberty blocking hormones who is not significantly distressed by the thought of passing through the normal and healthful process of puberty From the DSM 5 fact sheet The critical element of gender dysphoria is the presence of clinically significant distress associated with the condition This condition causes clinically significant distress or impairment in social , occupational , or other important areas of functioning Regarding Point 5 Where does the DSM 5 list rates of resolution for Gender Dysphoria \? On page 455 of the DSM 5 under Gender Dysphoria without a disorder of sex development it states Rates of persistence of gender dysphoria from childhood into adolescence or adulthood vary In natal males , persistence has ranged from 2 2 to 30 In natal females , persistence has ranged from 12 to 50 Simple math allows one to calculate that for natal boys resolution occurs in as many as 100 2 2 97 8 \( approx 98 of gender confused boys \) Similarly , for natal girls resolution occurs in as many as 100 12 88 gender confused girls The bottom line is this Our opponents advocate a new scientifically baseless standard of care for children with a psychological condition \( GD \) that would otherwise resolve after puberty for the vast majority of patients concerned Specifically , they advise affirmation of children s thoughts which are contrary to physical reality the chemical castration of these children prior to puberty with GnRH agonists \( puberty blockers which cause infertility , stunted growth , low bone density , and an unknown impact upon their brain development \) , and , finally , the permanent sterilization of these children prior to age 18 via cross sex hormones There is an obvious self fulfilling nature to encouraging young GD children to impersonate the opposite sex and then institute pubertal suppression If a boy who questions whether or not he is a boy \( who is meant to grow into a man \) is treated as a girl , then has his natural pubertal progression to manhood suppressed , have we not set in motion an inevitable outcome \? All of his same sex peers develop into young men , his opposite sex friends develop into young women , but he remains a pre pubertal boy He will be left psychosocially isolated and alone He will be left with the psychological impression that something is wrong He will be less able to identify with his same sex peers and being male , and thus be more likely to self identify as non male or female Moreover , neuroscience reveals that the pre frontal cortex of the brain which is responsible for judgment and risk assessment is not mature until the mid twenties Never has it been more scientifically clear that children and adolescents are incapable of making informed decisions regarding permanent , irreversible and life altering medical interventions For this reason , the College maintains it is abusive to promote this ideology , first and foremost for the well being of the gender dysphoric children themselves , and secondly , for all of their non gender discordant peers , many of whom will subsequently question their own gender identity , and face violations of their right to bodily privacy and safety For more information , please visit this page on the College website concerning sexuality and gender issues A PDF version of this page can be downloaded here Gender Ideology Harms Children References 1 Consortium on the Management of Disorders of Sex Development , Clinical Guidelines for the Management of Disorders of Sex Development in Childhood Intersex Society of North America , March 25 , 2006 Accessed 3 20 16 from http www dsdguidelines org files clinical pdf 2 Zucker , Kenneth J and Bradley Susan J Gender Identity and Psychosexual Disorders FOCUS The Journal of Lifelong Learning in Psychiatry Vol III , No 4 , Fall 2005 \( 598 617 \) 3 Whitehead , Neil W Is Transsexuality biologically determined \?

"YOU ARE HERE LAT Home CollectionsNetflix buys exclusive rights to Disney moviesThe acquisition of Disney movies puts Netflix 's video on demand service in direct competition with pay TV giants such as HBO and Showtime December 04 , 2012 By Ben Fritz and Joe Flint , Los Angeles TimesNetflix 's deal with Walt Disney Studios gives it nonexclusive streaming \( Walt Disney Studios \) Netflix Inc has acquired exclusive U S rights to movies from Walt Disney Studios in a deal that catapults the Internet video on demand service into direct competition with pay TV giants such as HBO and Showtime The three year agreement takes effect in 2016 and is a blow to the pay channel Starz , which currently has the rights to broadcast Disney movies , including its Pixar animated films and Marvel superhero pictures , about eight months after they are released in theaters Starz 's sole remaining movie provider is now Sony Pictures That partnership ends in 2016 Disney has also agreed to give Netflix nonexclusive streaming rights to more of its older titles including Dumbo , Pocahontas and Alice in Wonderland starting immediately Netflix 's chief content officer , Ted Sarandos , called the deal a bold leap forward for Internet television We are incredibly pleased and proud this iconic family brand is teaming with Netflix to make it happen , he said Netflix stock soared on the news , rising 10 65 , or 14 , to 85 65 Shares in Starz 's parent company , Liberty Media Corp , fell 5 49 , or 5 , to 105 56 Currently , Netflix has nonexclusive rights to movies from Paramount Pictures , Lionsgate and Metro Goldwyn Mayer via a deal with pay channel Epix , as well as an array of library titles from other studios Its only exclusive movie rights come from independent studios such as Relativity Media and DreamWorks Animation It also has a wide variety of television reruns Sarandos and Netflix Chief Executive Reed Hastings have long said the company wanted to get exclusive pay TV rights to films from one of Hollywood 's six major studios to boost its online entertainment service PHOTOS Disney without PixarHowever , Hastings has also at times downplayed the importance of new movies Netflix previously had streaming rights to Disney and Sony movies via a deal with Starz In January , investors expressed their concerns that the pending disappearance of those movies would hurt the service Hastings said in a letter to investors that Disney films accounted for only 2 of domestic streaming and the loss would not be felt Since then , though , the Disney movie slate has become more attractive At that time , Netflix did not have access to movies from Disney 's Marvel superhero unit or the Star Wars titles from its pending acquisition of Lucasfilm Ltd The end of the Starz agreement accelerated a trend that has seen Netflix evolve into a television company , with reruns of shows such as Mad Men accounting for about two thirds of the content streamed by users With several original programs launching next year , including the Kevin Spacey political drama House of Cards , and a direct connection to a growing number of Internet enabled televisions , Netflix is on the verge of standing on par with many TV networks Netflix charges 8 a month for its streaming service , while premium cable networks such as HBO cost 13 to 18 a month , and that 's on top of a monthly bill for other channels that typically exceeds 50 It remains to be seen whether the addition of Disney products and more original programming could lead Netflix to increase its price PHOTOS Hollywood back lot momentsThe Netflix spending spree could continue , with Sarandos telling Bloomberg News on Monday that his company would bid for rights to Sony movies when its Starz deal expires Netflix might have a tougher time wresting away the rights to Warner Bros , 20th Century Fox or Universal Pictures releases from their current deals with HBO , which like Warner is part of Time Warner Inc Paramount , Lionsgate and MGM are almost certain to stick with Epix , of which the trio are co owners Disney 's family friendly films are particularly valuable to Netflix , however , because young viewers are active users of the service Last year it launched a separate Just for Kids section of its website and apps Although terms were not disclosed , a person close to the matter said Netflix could ultimately pay more than 300 million annually for Disney movies This year , HBO cut a deal with 20th Century Fox for its movies , at an estimated price of more than 200 million annually In so called output deals , pay TV providers typically pay 10 to 12 of the U S box office of each film , up to 200 million For Starz , losing the Disney movies means the channel will have to create more original content to fill the void , just as rival cable network Showtime did when it lost most of its movie content over the last several years Showtime , a unit of CBS Corp , has managed to make this work by launching several successful shows , including Homeland , Dexter and Nurse Jackie Starz 's track record with original programming has been more mixed Its show Spartacus has performed well , but its ambitious political drama Boss , starring Kelsey Grammer , was recently canceled Our decision not to extend the agreement for Disney output allows us the opportunity to implement our plan to dramatically ramp up our investment in exclusive , premium quality original series which will best meet the needs of our distributors and subscribers , Starz said in a statement Janney Capital Markets analyst Tony Wible called the deal a positive for Netflix , writing in a research note , This exclusivity should help them defend against competitors and may reinvigorate subscriber growth at a substantial cost Stern Agee analyst Arvind Bhatia had a more mixed reaction From a content perspective , this appears to be a major coup for Netflix , he said However , without knowledge of the financial terms , we think it would be premature to assume this is a net positive",false
"Banks , who was falsely convicted of rape but later exonerated , says woman who come forward should be able to expect to be believed Brian Banks is a man on a mission After being wrongfully convicted of rape at 16 years old and spending 62 months in prison for a crime he didn t commit , he s sharing his story in the hopes of helping others In his upcoming Oxygen series , Final Appeal , Banks will attempt to educate the masses about the pitfalls that plague the current legal system These problems often disproportionately affect black men While some may expect Banks to have a visceral reaction to very public allegations of sexual assault permeating headlines , we learned the former NFL player is just as serious about empowering sexual assault victims as he is about protecting the wrongfully accused By the end of that day , I was being accused of kidnapping and rape In 2002 , when I was 16 years old , I was on my way to USC on a full scholarship , he tells theGrio com in an exclusive interview I had one more year left to play high school football I went to a known make out spot at my high school with a girl who I ve known since middle school , and we made out We didn t have sex But by the end of that day , I was being accused of kidnapping and rape I got arrested that very same day , July 8 , 2002 , and I did not come home until five years and two months later at the age of 22 , he said Then I did an additional five years of strict custody parole I had to wear a GPS tracking device on my ankle for five total years and register as a sex offender and all kinds of inhumane circumstances I had to deal with for an additional five years , post prison All for it to come to an end when the person who made these accusation up came forward and admitted she lied about everything Answers never came Banks accuser , Wanetta Gibson , never explained her true motives for making the false accusation She recanted nine years later , says Banks , still visibly rattled by a story he s told dozens of times She was , in her words , online on Facebook looking up friends from high school and saw how attractive I was and how much I had grown up , and she wanted to hook up , he explained We still really do not understand She has pointed the finger at so many other people instead of at herself She will tell you the initial lie grew and grew once others got involved She blames a lot of other people when the blame falls on a number of people and a number of reasons why my wrongful conviction took place After Banks conviction , Gibson won a 1 5 million judgment against the Long Beach Unified School District after suing them for being unsafe Consent is important , and so is justice I have been watching the news the last few months and all the headlines that have been coming out The subject of force and the subject of consent and the subject of lying about it are two shi y sides of the same stick Supporting someone who has experienced being victimized like that and someone who has been wrongfully accused of doing that are both valid things to do , he says Banks says he s glad the metoo movement has brought the subject of sexual assault to the forefront I think where we are now and what this dialogue does is it opens up a discussion that needs to happen in our society , and that is about sexual assault , that is about consent , and that is about the process in which we go investigate these kinds of cases I think it s a discussion that needs to happen , he explains I think that people who have been sexually assaulted and want to speak up and seek justice for their experience should have the opportunity to do so As someone who has been wrongfully convicted of rape , these are subjects I think we have to take our time with and be patient and investigate and make sure the right person is being held accountable These people need to be prosecuted Following her recantation , Gibson was ordered to pay a 2 6 million judgment , including a 750 , 000 settlement to the LBUSD , plus attorney fees , interest and more than 1 million in punitive damages The statute of limitations was expired for perjury I would have absolutely pressed charges against her if I could Part of my life was taken away because of her But more importantly , you have to go after people like this because a person such as herself makes it harder for a woman who is raped to come forward confidently and share their story and hope something is done about what happened to them They should be able to expect to be believed , he says For all the men and women who have been assaulted and for all the men and women who have been wrongfully convicted for these kinds of crimes , these people who make false claims need to be prosecuted Stay tuned for our exclusive interview with Brian Banks and the inside scoop on his upcoming series , Final Appeal , coming to Oxygen in January",true

"Staff Report August 11 , 2016By KIM MCCRAYOur Health Matters And when you vote for Amendment 2 , not only are you voting for a medication that is proven to help people with cancer , HIV AIDS , glaucoma , PTSD , MS and more , but you re also voting for positive change in the community Now , the opponents of Amendment 2 have taken on a tone similar to Donald Trump instilling fear through saturating the media with misinformation For example , the opponents to this amendment have touted that states like Colorado \( who successfully passed a similar bill \) have experienced a higher use of marijuana among 10th graders But if you look at studies from noteworthy organizations such as the International Journal of Drug Policy , Colorado Department of Public Safety and Lancet Psychiatry to see the difference between adolescent use before and after passing a medical marijuana law , the level of misuse for that demographic went down Therefore I would strongly encourage you not to get caught up by those types of scare tactics while considering the many benefits that passing this bill will bring to people you deeply care about What is also important to know is that although some debilitated patients may require higher levels of THC than others based on their specific medical condition , medical grade marijuana alone , will not get that patient high , no matter what level of THC , CBD or any other compound is found in the plant And unlike the rumors floating around , medical grade marijuana does not have to be smoked to be effective It also comes in various other forms such as an ointment , oil , pill and skin patch I m reminded of Bridgette Wilkie from Orlando Bridgette is a mother , wife and entrepreneur She suffers from sickle cell anemia and lives with chronic pain that most people cannot imagine Bridgette is taking elephant doses of Oxycontin and Oxycodone and still , there are days when she cannot get out of bed to see her daughter off to school because the pain is just too unbearable The narcotics that are prescribed for Bridgette have terrible side effects on her organs that make her overall condition worse It would be great if she could have access to other effective and safer alternative treatments like medical grade marijuana , without making her high Doctors should not be restricted from utilizing other safer and well proven treatment methods when patients like Bridgette have such painful reactions to the narcotics typically prescribed for people in her condition As you may know , current state regulations in Florida do not necessarily prevent doctors from prescribing \( or over prescribing \) other drugs such as Morphine , Xanax , Oxycontin and other potentially deadly medications that are much more likely to be habit forming By supporting Amendment 2 , you will help to ensure the right level of oversight in how medical grade marijuana will be prescribed and distributed In fact , one of the key provisions of this amendment is that only licensed physicians can recommend medical grade marijuana and will be held accountable if they are found to be negligent Think about the people in your life , your church or community who will begin to finally find comfort and relief when Amendment 2 passes Furthermore , history shows that when a state enacts a medical marijuana law , first time \( and ongoing \) use among teens in that state goes down So when we go to the ballot box , we need to vote YES to prevent Florida politics from over reaching at the expense of people like Bridgette \( or our veterans , cancer patients , those suffering from AIDS and others \) who could benefit greatly from a safer , more effective and more controlled medical alternative Kim McCray is the Outreach Director for United For Care She can be reached atmccray unitedforcare org",false

' lures politicians into supporting guns for toddlers The audience was shocked , as video posted online showed The crowd , brought together by Moms Demand Action , a nationwide movement against gun violence , burst into boos and heckles But there is more to Wilson 's story a lot more The tale begins in Hugo , Oklahoma , in 1963 , when Wilson was 18 years old It includes charges of familial murder , a home destroyed by fire , years of amnesia and the start of a winding path that led a young man to a legal career and , now , ambitions to serve in the Arizona Legislature The candidate told only part of this story to the Tucson audience \( She \) was hell bent on killing me in my sleep one night At three o'clock in the morning , I woke up to find a rifle in my face a semiautomatic rifle at that and the bullets started to fly , and I started diving for cover , Wilson said A clip of Wilson 's remarks was posted on Twitter by a reporter with the Tucson based Arizona Daily Star He said he dodged six bullets before reaching for the gun under his bed , which he then used to shoot his mother He said if not for that gun , he 'd be dead Both his 49 year old mother and 17 year old sister died that night , as Wilson recalled in a 2010 memoir about the event The book , Bobby 's Trials , was published by Apache Publishing Company , a small Arizona based publisher operated by Wilson 's wife The publisher has printed four other books by Wilson In his memoir , Wilson wrote that his mother suffered debilitating depression and fits of intense rage He has also called her deranged and a fugitive hiding in the backwoods of S E Oklahoma More More than 500 guns found , seized from convicted felon in California Court records and newspaper articles from the time suggest there may be more to the story than Wilson 's account Those records show he was charged with the murder of his mother and sister , and soon after his arrest he confessed to those charges He later recanted his confession and claimed he had amnesia about the events of the night in question The charges against him ultimately were dismissed by an Oklahoma judge What happened the night of the killing \? In an interview with The Arizona Republic , Wilson recalled more of his memories of the events that night at his childhood home Wilson said his mother , Lavonne Wilson , entered his room and repeatedly shot at him but missed While aiming for Wilson , he said his mother must have seen a shadow move , so she swung the gun The rifle butt hit his younger sister , Judy Wilson , in the back of the head and caved it in , he said Wilson said Judy had entered his room upon hearing the commotion More Official Parkland shooting suspect 's mother let him buy gun An autopsy found she was killed upon impact to the head , according to Wilson Wilson 's mother continued to shoot at him , Wilson said A few bullets ricocheted off two gallon size containers of gasoline in the room and smashed them open The Wilsons stored gas in glass jars in Bobby 's bedroom because it was the coolest area of the house , which had no air conditioning , he said Gas spilled all over the floor , Wilson said Wilson said he then grabbed a single shot rifle from under his bed and fired at his mother He said an autopsy later concluded the shot hit her point blank in the eye Wilson then ran to the living room to call for help As he turned on the light switch to reach for the phone , a spark ignited fumes from the spilled gasoline in the other room , he said The house exploded , Wilson recalled According to Wilson , he was blasted through the living room window and into a barbed wire fence He said he received a concussion upon impact and was found unconscious and taken to the hospital More Most shooters got their guns legally , did n't have diagnosed mental illness , new FBI report says Wilson said his mother and sister were found dead in the house 's rubble A medical examiner declared his mother dead from a combination of the bullet wound and burns , Wilson said Wilson said he was arrested by the county sheriff while in the hospital and was thrown in jail With his two family members dead and he as the sole survivor and unable at the time to recall what happened Wilson said the sheriff blamed him and imprisoned him right away He said he spent seven or eight months in jail until his employer bailed him out Wilson said he faced two trials , both of which he said were inconclusive He said that at a third trial in 1973 , all charges against him were dropped He said the district attorney announced the state never had a solid case against him and was wrong all along According to Wilson , the district attorney and sheriff apologized for Wilson 's ordeals and the judge dismissed all charges against him Newspaper , court accounts of killings are much different Details reported at the time in a local newspaper , in addition to court records from Wilson 's case , both differ significantly in numerous regards from Wilson 's account to The Republic The Choctaw County Weekly , a publication that compiled articles from multiple area papers , published several stories about the events in the days following the deaths and fire The Choctow County District Court Clerk 's Office also provided records about Wilson 's case Court records list Wilson 's last name as Wiste Wilson said that was because his mother who was a widow had the family living under an assumed last name He said he later changed his last name to Wilson According to the June 20 , 1963 , edition of the Choctaw County Weekly , after the fire at the house was extinguished , a water truck sprayed the site of the burned house to allow funeral workers to remove the remains According to the newspaper , the charred bodies of Lavonne and Judy Wilson were found lying together in bed in a 'perfectly relaxed' position , indicating they died in their sleep from suffocation More Feds Russian operative tried to infiltrate National Rifle Association , other groups The paper reported that neighbors heard the explosion and rushed to the house to find young Wilson lying in the grass , gasping for breath The paper said he was suffering from smoke inhalation and had minor cuts and burns Initially , authorities anticipated no foul play was involved , but they proceeded with an investigation One week later , the paper reported that Wilson had confessed to murdering his mother and sister The paper said Wilson led officers to where he buried the rifle used to kill them After prompting by his boss at the meat market , Bobby reflected a moment , and then slowly added that last jigsaw piece with this account a story already put together by officers , needing only his stamp of authenticity , the Weekly wrote Wilson admitted to shooting his mother , according to the paper Then , when his sister ran at him , he crushed her skull with his rifle butt He placed the bodies on the bed , poured gas around the house and lit a match , the paper reported It was Sheriff Thornton 's tenacious insistence that the bodies be sent to the state crime bureau for examination that spoiled what otherwise could easily have been the perfect crime , the Weekly reported Reports showed death came prior to the fire and from causes that later proved completely accurate Wilson was tried on homicide charges Court records show that three years after he was charged with the murders , Wilson filed with the court for mental incapacity to make a rational defense He claimed he suffered from amnesia during the time of the allegations , and with no clear memory of the night 's events , was unable to plan his defense with attorneys or tell his side of the story The court ordered a jury to decide whether evidence supported Wilson 's claims of memory loss Four days later , the jury returned its verdict Wilson indeed suffered from amnesia , they said The judge ruled Wilson was thus not capable of proceeding to trial and making a rational defense The case was suspended until Wilson could regain enough memory to defend himself , the judge said More Unlocked and loaded Families confront dementia and guns Seven years later , in late 1973 , Wilson moved to dismiss entirely the charges against him According to court filings , his attorney argued that because the district attorney , state and district court had taken no action in seven years , he had been deprived of his right to speedy trial He added that his witnesses were no longer available because they had died He motioned for all charges to be dismissed The court dismissed his case Wilson then moved to Texas for college and law school After graduating , he practiced law in Texas for 20 years Last year , Wilson told the Green Valley News , a southern Arizona publication , that he regained all of his memory of the events in a momentous day as a lawyer He was investigating the case of one of his first clients , who also had been falsely accused of murder , Wilson told the Green Valley News He said he was looking for clues in the woman 's vehicle , when he smelled the combination of gasoline and blood The horrible , nauseating smells off the car plummeted me back like a lightning bolt to that fateful night in my childhood , and all the memories flooded in , Wilson told the paper It was an incredibly disturbing experience , but it also brought relief Now I had the truth Wilson told the Green Valley News that after his amnesia subsided , he could fully recount the events of that night in 1963 He proceeded to pen a book and tell his version of the story More Judge temporarily blocks assault weapons ban in Chicago suburb of Deerfield Wilson moved to Arizona in 1995 to teach law as a college professor According to his candidate website , he also owned a private investigation agency in Arizona for 10 years The Maricopa County Community College District hired Wilson in 1995 as an adjunct faculty member in the criminal justice department , where he remains active He teaches paralegals at Rio Salado College He said he is a three time recipient of a teaching award for adjunct faculty at the college More on gun laws , and an Oklahoma City bombing conspiracy In the interview with The Republic , Wilson stood by his remarks about gun control legislation and doubled down on his belief that good armed people are the only way to stop gun violence When I was in high school , all of the high school boys had rifles and shotguns in their cars every day when they came to school , and nobody shot anybody at school , and nobody even thought about it , Wilson said In today 's world , we 've got people walking into the public schools and public events and killing innocent people , and yes , the only way you can stop that is somebody better have a firearm to put a stop to it Wilson reiterated his belief that legislation will make no difference MORE Good guy with gun in Giffords shooting touts training if teachers are armed I do n't think you can control people 's behavior by passing laws , he said They keep looking for a magic bullet law that they can pass where it s gonna put an end to the killings and the gun violence , and they 're not gonna find the magic bullet There is no magic bullet In another take on American government , Wilson penned a 2016 book explaining his theory that the 1995 Oklahoma City bombing was part of a government sting operation and that a massive cover up had occurred and possibly an innocent man executed Man who helped save Gabby Giffords responds State Rep Daniel Hernandez , D Tucson , was seated next to Wilson at the forum what Hernandez called a bizarre meeting as both are running to represent Legislative District 2 at the Capitol Hernandez was an intern for former Congresswoman Gabrielle Giffords in 2011 when she was shot in the head and almost died at a mass shooting outside a Tucson area supermarket He is credited with saving her life He applied pressure to her forehead wound and made sure she did n't choke on blood Giffords was in the audience at the forum Hernandez said he was so confused upon hearing Wilson 's comments , and said he checked with Wilson after the event to make sure he heard correctly I thought I had misheard him , Hernandez said We were just like 'Wait , what did he just say \? ! ' More Two years after the Orlando shooting , young activists hold a die in on the Capitol lawn Even though I was sitting right next to him , it just took me aback that at this forum put on by Moms Demand Action , when we were talking about common sense gun violence prevention , he was talking about how he had to kill his mother in what I take is self defense , Hernandez said After his experience at the Jan 8 , 2011 , shooting , Hernandez became an outspoken advocate for gun violence prevention at the state and federal levels The idea that we ca n't actually do anything as a policymaker is just something that baffles me to this day , Hernandez said Candidate Giffords 'created a target' Wilson said he was aware of Hernandez 's story and knew that he supposedly helped Giffords in the moments immediately after the shooting Wilson said he expected to be booed and heckled at the event given its focus on gun control measures I knew it was gonna be a hostile audience when I went , Wilson said I just thought , 'I'm gonna go in and tell them how I think , and they can throw rocks or bananas or whatever , I do n't care ' Wilson said Giffords should have had security with her at the 2011 supermarket meet and greet She basically created a target , he said Anytime you have a group of celebrities or a group of people like at the forum last night , you better have security there It 's the same with a public school Wilson mentioned that an armed officer was present in the back of the church at Monday 's forum , which he said made the boos after his comments seem pretty hypocritical and ironic to him But Hernandez said that even if armed people are present in a violent incident , they still may not act , be it for lack of training or for not wanting to add to the confusion in a mass shooting event He added that the officer present on Monday was a trained professional \( Wilson 's \) notion of all you need is a good guy with a gun is I think just bonkers , Hernandez said It was utter shock at hearing a candidate talk about killing his own mother , and then also just being really surprised that he would come to this forum where gun violence prevention was really the main topic District 2 is a Democratic stronghold encompassing parts of Pima County and Santa Cruz County , south of Tucson All three Democratic incumbents are running for re election this fall Follow Alison Steinbach on Twitter alisteinbach",true

"For a man in San Diego , getting bitten by a rattlesnake was just the beginning of his problems The life threatening encounter was followed by a shocking medical bill 153 , 000 for his treatment Todd Fassler was bitten earlier this month , reportedly while trying to pose for a selfie with the snake Like most snake bite victims , Fassler needed many doses of the antivenom CroFab , the only current drug available to counteract the potentially deadly snake venom Bites from less poisonous snakes can require as little as three doses , but the most toxic poisonous snake bites can take dozens of doses A California boy bitten by an highly toxic snake in 2012 required 42 vials of antivenom , and some patients need even more The only effective treatment is antivenom , Dr Keith Boesen , director of the Arizona Poison Drug Information Center , told CBS News There 's blood tests we can do to determine the effect of the venom Hospital bills can always be worked out or negotiated , but you ca n't really negotiate , other than prosthetics , the loss of part of your hand or your arm Boesen said he knew of one snake bite victim in Arizona who required 74 vials of antivenom The wholesale rate that hospitals pay to the manufacturer is 2 , 500 per vial and the markup to patients and insurance is much higher Fassler 's bill included a line item of 83 , 341 25 for pharmacy to cover the antivenom , as reporter Dan Haggerty of KGTV in San Diego posted on Twitter According to the original report , Fassler used up the antivenom supply from two hospitals Part of the reason the bill is large for most snake bite victims is because there is only one manufacturer and limited supply of the antivenom In addition , a snake bite requires emergency room treatment , a few days in the hospital intensive care unit and sometimes therapy to recover function of the damaged body part Between 7 , 000 and 8 , 000 people are bitten by venomous snakes in the U S every year , according to the CDC and , of those , about 5 will die The vast majority of people seek and have access to medical attention where they quickly receive antivenom , also known as antivenin New antivenoms are in development including one recently approved by the FDA called Anavip , which Boesen 's group helped test Boesen calls Arizona the evenomation capital of the country because they treat so many poisonous reptile and insect bites The problem may become even more common as snakes become bolder searching for water in drought stricken states in the West He said the longer snake bite victims wait before receiving the antivenom , the more damage they will sustain For a person who is bitten , a snake bite start simply as puncture wounds , then the swelling and tissue die off visibly creeps up the extremity At the same time , the venom prevents the blood from clotting , causing bleeding problems and pronounced bruises All those responses can cause serious and permanent damage to the bitten area You 'll see it progress an inch an hour It 's almost at a visible pace where you 're watching your arm swell We 'll give antivenom to make that swelling stop , so it will stop progressing , said Boesen There is no drug that can reverse the damage , we can only prevent it from getting worse Death is very rare since antivenom has been available in the U S since the 1950s , he noted But faster treatment will mean less damage and less time for the substantial recovery process , which can take weeks to months So if someone , for example , does n't have any insurance and is afraid of a hospital , I would be much more afraid of losing my hand or my arm than an expensive hospital bill , he said",true

"The State Department asked all secretaries of state to send their emails over Hillary Clinton 's the only one who s done it Charles Schumer on Sunday , March 8th , 2015 in comments on CBS' Face the Nation Fact checking Chuck Schumer 's defense of Hillary Clinton 's private emailBy Steve Contorno on Sunday , March 8th , 2015 at 6 13 p m Hillary Clinton continues to face criticism for using a private email during her time as Secretary of State Former Secretary of State Hillary Clinton didn t appear on the Sunday political talk shows to explain her use of a private email account to conduct State Department business But Democrats were out in force to defend her as proxies For example , Sen Chuck Schumer , D N Y , appeared March 8 on CBS Face the Nation to throw cold water on accusations of wrongdoing on the part of Clinton The State Department asked all secretaries of state to send their emails over , and she s the only one who s done it , Schumer said We decided to dig into Schumer s claim Spokesman Matt House said Schumer was referring to an October 2014 letter from the State Department to former secretaries of states The letter has not been publicly published but its contents were outlined by State Department spokeswoman Marie Harf to the media last week Harf said the letter was part of a routine effort to update record preservation and asked former secretaries to turn over emails containing state work conducted on personal accounts A couple months after the request , Clinton turned over 55 , 000 pages of emails and documents from a personal email account created on a self operated server , according to the New York Times and the State Department Clinton has since requested \( via Twitter \) for those emails to be released It s not as though the letter went out to living secretaries of state dating back to Henry Kissinger While it may be hard to remember a time before email , only four former secretaries have held the job during the prominence of electronic communications Clinton , Condoleezza Rice , Colin Powell and Madeleine Albright As it is , the State Department query was limited to just those four individuals Two of those individuals haven t provided personal emails for good reason They didn t use email much during their time at the State Department According to MSNBC , an aide for Albright said she did not use email while she was in office from 1997 to 2001 Similarly , Rice , head of the State Department from 2005 to 2009 , was not a habitual emailer either , according to multiple reports As Harf noted in a State Department briefing , Secretary Rice has repeatedly said that she did not regularly use email , and a spokesperson for Rice told ABC , She did not use personal email for official communication as secretary Essentially , two of the four former officials contacted didn t turn any emails over because they didn t have any to turn over That s pretty important context And what about Powell , who served as Secretary of State during President George W Bush s first term \? Powell appeared on ABC s This Week to answers those questions Apparently , Powell can t turn over any documents Why \? Because he doesn t have them anymore I retained none of those e mails and we are working with the State Department to see if there 's anything else they want to discuss with me about those emails , he said I did not keep a cache of them I did not print them off , he added I do not have thousands of pages somewhere in my personal files Harf acknowledged in a March 4 briefing that Powell 's account has been closed for a number of years , and said , He s looking to see if there s anything responsive he still has You can draw your own conclusions about Powell not saving official emails from a 10 year old account , and the relevance of that revelation to the Clinton controversy Powell said most of his important correspondence would have been archived already , since they were sent to staff who had State Department accounts But it does shed light on why Powell didn t provide emails to the State Department , and it also demonstrates that he has taken steps to comply with the request , even if only recently So to recap The State Department reached out to four former secretaries asking about personal email accounts Two have said they rarely used email , the third used personal email but had no records to turn over and the fourth was Clinton That makes Schumer s defense fairly hollow when you think about it Clinton may have been the only person to provide emails , but realistically , that s from a potential pool of two people We took all this back to Schumer s spokesman House He stood by the comment There is another person \( Powell \) who specifically said he had emailed in a way that would be relevant to their request , but did not keep records so would n't be able to comply , House said So she 's the only one to do what State is asking Our rulingSchumer said , The State Department asked all secretaries of state to send their emails over , and \( Clinton is \) the only one who s done it That statement is much more grandiose than the reality of the situation The State Department asked four former secretaries of state for any official business conducted on personal emails Two of those individuals , Albright and Rice , rarely used email at all while in office , let alone on a personal account The other , Powell , has said his personal emails no longer exist , but said he is working with the State Department to recover them , if possible The statement contains some element of truth but ignores critical facts that would give a different impression We rate it Mostly False Correction Clinton turned over 55 , 000 pages and documents from her private email account A previous version of this fact check described the number incorrectly Advertisement",false

"Spread the love State Senator Scott Wiener \( D San Francisco \) and Assemblywoman Susan Eggman \( D Stockton \) introduced recent legislation to end blatant discrimination against LGBT young people regarding California s sex offender registry However , under their bill , SB 145 , the offenders would not have to automatically register as sex offenders if the offenders are within 10 years of age of the minor Wiener claims the current law disproportionately targets LGBT young people for mandatory sex offender registration , since LGBT people usually cannot engage in vaginal intercourse Existing law , the Sex Offender Registration Act , amended by Proposition 35 by voters in 2012 \( Ban on Human Trafficking and Sex Slavery \) , requires a person convicted of a certain sex crime to register with law enforcement as a sex offender while residing in California or while attending school or working in California Wiener says , Currently , for consensual yet illegal sexual relations between a teenager age 15 and over and a partner within 10 years of age , sexual intercourse \( i e , vaginal intercourse \) does not require the offender to go onto the sex offender registry rather , the judge decides based on the facts of the case whether sex offender registration is warranted or unwarranted By contrast , for other forms of intercourse specifically , oral and anal intercourse sex offender registration is mandated under all situations , with no judicial discretion This bill would authorize a person convicted of certain offenses involving minors to seek discretionary relief from the duty to register if the person is not more than 10 years older than the minor , SB 145 states Proposition 35 was created and passed to protect children from sexual exploitation and sex trafficking Victims of sex trafficking are often vulnerable children , afraid for their lives and abused sexually , physically , and mentally , the Proposition said What Does SB 145 Also Do \? Legislators Wiener and Eggman say they are trying to shield LGBT young people from having to automatically register as sex offenders for specified sex crimes But their bill does much more SB 145 would allow a sex offender who lures a minor with the intent to commit a felony \( i e a sex act \) the ability to escape registering as a sex offender as long as the offender is within 10 years of age of the minor No specification is made as to whether the sexual offender is straight or LGBT SB 145 would add a section to the state s penal code \( Section 290 55 \) stipulating that as long as the offender is not more than 10 years older than the minor , they are not automatically mandated to register as a sex offender There is no age limit or range specified , except for existing law which already excludes lewd acts with children under 14 SB 145 appears to allow adults to victimize minors by luring them with the intent to have sex , and then shields the predator from being automatically registered as a sex offender , as in the case of a 25 year old luring a 15 year old for sex , or a 22 year old luring a 12 year old SB 145 , as currently written , appears to allow certain sexual predators to live among the population without anyone being aware Why is this bill needed \?

"Marijuana Effects of Weed on Brain and BodyBy Lauren Cox , Live Science Contributor June 6 , 2017 09 45pm ETMORESmoking marijuana produces euphoria and a range of psychological and physical effects that can be unpredictable at times Credit Igor Kolos ShutterstockMarijuana is a combination of shredded leaves , stems and flower buds of the Cannabis sativa plant Marijuana can be smoked , eaten , vaporized , brewed and even taken topically , but most people smoke it The intoxicating chemical in marijuana is tetrahydracannabinol , or THC According to research from the Potency Monitoring Project , the average THC content of marijuana has soared from less than 1 percent in 1972 , to 3 to 4 percent in the 1990s , to nearly 13 percent in 2010 Today , some retail marijuana has 30 percent THC or more The increased potency makes it difficult to determine the short and long term effects of marijuanaHow Cannabis is consumedIn a 2010 National Survey on Drug Use and Health \( NSDUH \) , 17 4 million people in the United States said they had used marijuana in the past month Since then , many states have made it legal to use marijuana recreationally or medically As of early 2017 , 26 states and the District of Columbia have made the use of pot legal in one form or another A 2016 Gallup poll found that one in eight people smoke marijuana and 43 percent of U S adults admit to trying it Marijuana is usually smoked , according to the National Institute on Drug Abuse \( NIDA \) The Cannabis \( called pot , weed , grass , etc \) is typically spread on rolling papers and formed into a cigarette , often referred to as a joint , or a cigar like blunt Smoking releases the THC , which is absorbed into the blood stream through the lungs Glass pipes , bubblers and bongs are other ways to smoke marijuana Marijuana can also be ingested in food , often a choice of those who are using medical marijuana Aside from the popular pot brownie , edible marijuana can be added to a number of foods , including candy , ice cream and butter Some states that have legalized marijuana have issued rules for packaging and labeling marijuana edibles Cannabis can be taken in liquid form , by brewing it as a tea It can also be added to other beverages , including soda , milk and alcohol Hashish is a resin made of the concentrated plant material Other forms include capsules , oral sprays and topical oils A relatively new method of inhaling marijuana is vaporization , a smokeless delivery system using devices such as e cigarettes By heating the Cannabis at lower temperatures , the plant 's oils or extracts are released Several studies suggest that vaping is better for health than smoking pot Vaporized marijuana contains little other than cannabinoids , according to a 2004 study in the Journal of Cannabis Therapeutics Users inhaled fewer toxic compounds and carbon monoxide when vaping compared with smoking marijuana , according to a 2007 study in the journal Clinical Pharmacology Therapeutics According to the Colorado Department of Public Health and Environment , there has n't been enough research to conclude how much healthier vaping is than smoking unfiltered marijuana How marijuana affects the mindMarijuana reaches the same pleasure centers in the brain that are targeted by heroin , cocaine and alcohol Depending on the quantity , quality and method of consumption , marijuana can produce a feeling of euphoria or high by stimulating brain cells to release the chemical dopamine When smoked or otherwise inhaled , the feeling of euphoria is almost immediate When ingested in food , it takes much longer , even hours , for the drug to signal the brain to release the dopamine , according to the National Institutes of Health Other changes in mood can occur , with relaxation frequently being reported Some users experience heightened sensory perception , with colors appearing more vivid and noises being louder For some , marijuana can cause an altered perception of time and increased appetite , known as the munchies The impact can vary by person , how often they have used the drug , the strength of the drug and how often it has been since they have gotten high , among other factors In some cases , reported side effects of THC include elation , anxiety , tachycardia , short term memory recall issues , sedation , relaxation , pain relief and many more , said A J Fabrizio , a marijuana chemistry expert at Terra Tech Corp , a California agricultural company focused on local farming and medical cannabis Other effects , according to the NIH , include Feelings of panic and fear \( paranoia \) HallucinationsDecreased ability to perform tasks that require coordinationDecreased interest in completing tasksWhen coming down from the high , users may feel depressed or extremely tired While marijuana use produces a mellow experience \( users are sometimes referred to as stoners \) for some , it can heighten agitation , anxiety , insomnia and irritability , according to the NIH Marijuana and teensWhen marijuana use begins in the teen years , it can have a significant impact on brain development , including decreased brain activity , fewer neural fibers in certain areas and a smaller than average hippocampus , which controls learning and memory functions According to a 2014 Northwestern Medicine study of teen marijuana users , memory related structures in the brain appeared to shrink , a possible signs of a decrease in neurons These abnormalities remained two years after the teen stopped using marijuana , indicating that the drug has long term effects and look similar to brains of schizophrenics Those who started using marijuana after 21 generally do not experience the same type of brain abnormalities as those who started using the drug earlier Long term users report that they sometimes have trouble thinking clearly , organizing their thoughts , multitasking and remembering things Sustained marijuana use can also slow reaction times in some individuals Another study by the University of Montreal published in the journal Development and Psychopathology in 2016 found similar results after researching almost 300 students Those that started smoking around age 14 did worse on some cognitive tests than non smokers The study found that pot smokers also have a higher school dropout rate Those that waited to start around age 17 did not seem to have the same impairments How marijuana affects the bodyMarijuana smoke can cause many of the same respiratory problems experienced by tobacco smokers , such as increased daily cough and phlegm production , more frequent acute chest illnesses such as bronchitis , and a greater instance of lung infections , according to NIDA While it had been thought that there was a connection between marijuana smoking and increased risk of lung cancer , even those who are heavy marijuana users do not appear to be at greater risk for lung cancer , according to a 2013 study by Dr Donald Tashkin , UCLA professor of pulmonary and critical care medicine A 2017 study by the Einstein Medical Center in Philadelphia found that those who used marijuana were 26 percent more likely to have a stroke than those who did not use marijuana Those studied were also 10 percent more likely to have developed heart failure Marijuana can also raise heart rate by 20 percent to 100 percent shortly after smoking and the effect can last up to three hours , according to NIDA Marijuana also can reduce sperm production in men and disrupts a woman 's menstrual cycle , according to NIDA While it is widely thought that marijuana is not addictive , about 30 percent users may have some degree of marijuana use disorder , according to NIDA Long term marijuana users who try to quit experience cravings , irritability , sleeplessness , decreased appetite and anxiety some of the same physical symptoms of those trying to quit other types of drugs or alcohol A 2016 study found a link between certain genetic markers and symptoms of marijuana addiction , suggesting that some people may have a genetic predisposition to marijuana addiction That same study showed some overlap between the genetic risk factors for marijuana dependence and the genetic risk factors for depression , suggesting a possible reason why these two conditions often occur together , the researchers said You might

"Antifa claims responsibility for Las Vegas attack 10 2 2017 0 Comments Well Melbourne Antifa has since taken this post down off Facebook , but the good thing is the photo is available So basically what we have here is likely confirmation Antifa is behind the slaughter in Las Vegas where 50 are so far reported dead With Nov 4th coming up in America that Antifa claims to take out the Trump administration , is Las Vegas today a dry run for Antifa And did Antifa just become a bigger threat than ISIS \? Antifa and Leftist will probably cry fake news over this , but it looks like Antifa has claimed responsibility So now we have an official new form of terrorism that we can all simply call Alt Left terrorism If this claim of responsibility by Antifa for the Vegas attack is legit Then it 's time for Trump to launch raids on Antifa across America Remember also that Antifa 's Las Vegas leader school teacher was arrested last week in Berkeley Yvette Falarca America it 's time to take serious attention to Antifa , because they may of just launched their first deadly attack on American soil Stupid thing is Leftists are blaming Trump , his supporters , and guns for this Vegas attack , but why would Trump supporters ever use guns on a country concert \?

Fish is a low fat , high protein food that has a range of health benefits However , given what we know of fish and its sources today , we may have to re examine this statement Fish can either be one of the best foods for you or detrimental to your health depending on where it s sourced There is a world of difference between a fish that is caught in the wild vs farm bred or farm raised fish The most common farm raised fish are salmon , tilapia , catfish , swai , sea bass , and cod \( the last two surprise a lot of people \) Tilapia , in particular , became extremely popular in aquaculture and aquaponics across Asia , Mexico , Central America and the U S because it grows very quickly , is tolerant of stocking density and is adaptable So what s wrong with that \? Well , it all depends on how the fresh or frozen tilapia filets were raised and where What are the exact dangers of eating farm raised fish \? 6 Reasons Tilapia Farming Is Dangerous to Your Health 1 Recent studies have found that farm raised tilapia may cause more inflammation Farm raised tilapia has always been a popular source for fish , not only because it s widely available in the U S , but it s also very inexpensive \( 1 \) However , before you stock up on tilapia , you may want to know about its correlation to inflammation Recent studies have shown that eating tilapia may worsen inflammation , which can lead to heart disease , arthritis , asthma and a world of other serious health problems People who resort to eating more fish as a way to get their dose of omega 3 fatty acids and lessen their risk of heart attacks may want to hold off on the tilapia In fact , a scientist from Wake Forest University has found that the inflammatory potential of tilapia is far greater than that of a hamburger or pork bacon , and therefore make it a fish you shouldn t eat \( 2 \) 2 Farmed salmon may have at least 10 times the amount of cancer causing organic pollutants compared to the wild variety This can most likely be attributed to the feeds that are used on farm raised fish If you knew what went into the feeds of farm raised fish , you would be horrified Apparently , chicken feces is one of the main ingredients that go into farm fish feed Not only that , the transfer of pig and duck waste to fish farms is also a very common practice , such as with Chinese tilapia 3 Farm bred fish have been found to have high concentrations of antibiotics and pesticides Where do farm bred fish get their antibiotics \? The crowded conditions of fish farms cause the fish to be more susceptible to disease To keep them alive , farm owners give antibiotics to the fish to stave off disease similar to what occurs in confined feedlot operations for cattle \( 3 \) Farm bred fish , such as Chinese tilapia , are also treated with pesticides to combat sea lice The pesticides used to treat these fish are so deadly that they will kill wild salmon that are accidentally exposed to them These pesticides are also eventually released in the ocean , where they get into the bodies and systems of other marine life 4 Farm bred fish also have lower levels of healthy nutrients Many of us consume fish , hoping to reap the omega 3 fatty acid benefits that come with it However , did you know that the omega 3 acids that are found in farm raised fish are less usable in our bodies compared to wild bred fish \? Farm raised fish also has a lower protein content Not only that , because farm raised fish are kept in cages , they have the tendency to be fattier , and can have a higher concentration of omega 6 acids The problem with getting too many omega 3 and omega 6 acids is that they , again , may cause inflammation to the body 5 Dibutylin levels , a chemical used in PVC plastics , is said to be six times higher in farm raised mussels compared to wild ones Dibutylin is toxic and can impair immune system function while also contributing to inflammation Dibutylin may be the reason as to why there is a rise in asthma , obesity , allergies and other metabolic disorders in recent years \( 4 , 5 \) 6 Dioxin levels are 11 times higher in farm bred salmon compared to wild salmon According to the Environmental Working Group , the first ever tests of farmed salmon from U S grocery stores show that farmed salmon are likely the most dioxin like PCB contaminated protein source in the U S food supply \( 6 \) Dioxin is actually a very toxic chemical that can contribute to cancer and other complications The problem with dioxin is that once it enters our system , it can take a very long time until it leaves Grimly , the half life of dioxin is about 7 to 11 years ! 7 Excessive mercury levels among even lake grown fish and especially dangerous for pregnant women In a study by Dr J K McCrary published in the Environmental Pollution journal , total mercury concentrations in the water and fish of Lake Managua and Lake Apoyo were measured A considerable one fourth of the commercially fished tilapia in Lake Managua exceeded maximum recommended mercury levels for consumption among pregnant women and other at risk groups \( 7 \) As a result , the study recommended much closer mercury monitoring among freshwater fish that is meant for international commerce These are only some of the dangers that have been linked back to eating farm raised fish What does this tell us \? No 1 , we need to find out where our fish is coming from Not all fish are created equal , and sad to say , farm raised fish , instead of helping us , may even harm us History of Tilapia , Tilapia Facts Types of Tilapia The common name for nearly a 100 species of cichlid fish , it comes from three distinct genera Oreochromis , Sarotherodon and Tilapia Mainly a freshwater fish , tilapia live in shallow streams , ponds , rivers and lakes and adapt well to being farmed Historically , tilapia became popular in so called artisanal fishing in Africa and soon became popular in aquaculture and aquaponics outside of Africa Because North African tilapia grow quickly , are tolerant of stocking density and are adaptable In modern aquaculture , the wild type Nile tilapia \( the healthiest variety \) are not too often seen , because the dark color of their flesh is considered undesirable by many customers Tilapia are farmed extensively in many parts of Asia and the U S They are increasingly found in outdoor fish farms in tropical countries like as China , Papua New Guinea , the Philippines and Indonesia In temperate zone climates , such as in U S , tilapia farming operations need energy in order to warm the water to tropical temperatures \( 8 \) The largest tilapia producers in the world are China , then Egypt \( ! \) Currently , it s the fourth most consumed fish in the U S Going way back , the aquaculture using Nile tilapia began in Ancient Egypt In fact , tilapia is considered one of the three main types of fish caught from the Sea of Galilee during Biblical times Today , the three most commonly fished and eaten species of tilapia are Nile , Blue and Mozambique Oreochromis niloticus , or Nile Tilapia , are the oldest variety of tilapia Nile Tilapia is one of the most adaptable fish , as it can be raised in various ways , such as ponds and in pristine lakes and can be one of the most sustainable farmed fish The best fresh tilapia eaten in the U S is all natural \( not using chemicals or antibiotics \) and lake grown Most lake grown tilapia actually comes from Honduras or Mexico \( 9 \) Therefore , if you ever do eat tilapia , make sure you ask were it was raised Seafood Watch recommends to buy tilapia \( izumidai in sushi \) farmed worldwide in recirculating aquaculture systems , Ecuador in ponds and Peru in raceways \( 10 \) Blue Tilapia is found in Florida s lakes , rivers and streams and it can live both in saltwater and freshwater Because it doesn t grow as quickly as Nile Tilapia , it s not as commonly farmed Meanwhile , Mozambique Tilapia was introduced into the U S for sport fishing and as a means of aquatic plant control Farmed Shrimp the Dirtiest of All Seafood There are a lot of shrimp nutrition facts , but shrimp actually holds the designation of being the dirtiest of all seafood , says Marianne Cufone , director of Food and Water Watch She says it s hard to avoid , as 90 percent of shrimp sold in the U S is imported \( 11 \) Imported farmed shrimp comes with a whole bevy of contaminants antibiotics , residues from chemicals used to clean pens , filth like mouse hair , rat hair , and pieces of insects , Cufone says And I didn t even mention things like E coli that have been detected in imported shrimp Part of this has to do with the fact that less than 2 percent of ALL imported seafood \( shrimp , crab , catfish or others \) gets inspected before its sold , which is why it s that much more important to buy domestic seafood What to Eat Instead of Tilapia Recipes Fish can be an incredible health building food if you go with wild caught fish liked sockeye salmon , which has proven health benefits It s loaded with healthy fats and can help your brain , joints , muscles and skin ! But rather than buying cheap , frozen tilapia filets , a better option that is both inexpensive and easy to make is a homemade salmon patties recipe that is high in omega 3 fats and protein Plus , salmon contains astaxanthin , which has been proven to be more powerful than almost any other antioxidant at absorbing free radicals If you are not consuming salmon or another wild caught fish during the week , then I highly recommend you consume a benefit rich fish oil supplement with astaxanthin When I eat out , I also ask my server if the fish is farm raised or wild caught Most servers know this answer or can quickly go ask the head chef As a quick rule of thumb for salmon , if it s Pacific or Alaskan , it s most likely wild caught if it s Atlantic salmon , it s almost always farm raised Read Next 17 Fish You Should Never Eat From the sound of it , you might think leaky gut only affects the digestive system , but in reality it can affect more Because Leaky Gut is so common , and such an enigma , I m offering a free webinar on all things leaky gut Click here to learn more about the webinar",false

the Fan Forum The day after the Sept 11 terrorist attacks , Steve Buscemi , who worked as a firefighter from 1980 1984 , showed up at his old fire station , Engine Company No 55 in the Little Italy section of New York For the next week he worked 12 hour shifts , digging through the rubble trying to find the bodies of missing firefighters , all the while refusing to do interviews or have his picture taken It was a privilege to be able to do it , the 45 year old actor said It was great to connect with the firehouse I used to work with and with some of the guys I worked alongside And it was enormously helpful for me because while I was working , I did n't really think about it as much , feel it as much It was n't until I stopped that I really felt the full impact of what had happened It would have been much harder for me to get through it if I had n't been able to do that Steve Buscemi might have been a senior firefighter by now if only he had stuck with it He 's still in touch with friends at the New York Fire Department , and went back there for a medal ceremony only recently in honour of a lieutenant who took part in a rescue last year But Steve Buscemi played his part with the bravest , as America 's firemen are known , from 1980 1984 and moved on Yet , he continues to support his firefighter brothers whenever they are in need Doomed Fire Heroes' Rig Unburied at Ground Zero By ANGELINA CAPPIELLO and WILLIAM NEUMAN Courtesy of The New York Post Recovery crews combing through debris from the north tower at Ground Zero found a firetruck yesterday buried some 40 below street level I just think it 's ironic that it 's appearing now six months after Sept 11 , said Robin Freund , whose husband , Peter , a lieutenant , was one of five men killed from Engine Co 55 in Little Italy She said members of her husband 's company had been out to Fresh Kills landfill in Staten Island to look for the company 's missing truck little suspecting it was still buried deep within the wreckage at Ground Zero The members of Engine 55 parked the truck next to the north tower before rushing in to help rescue the people inside and when the building collapsed it apparently sucked the empty truck down with it They were one of the first two companies there That 's probably why the truck was buried so deep , said Freund , who is raising the couple 's four children She said her husband 's colleagues called her after going to Ground Zero to look at the buried truck and told her it was unrecognizable But they did manage to remove a door and take it back to the firehouse , where they included it in a memorial to Lt Freund , 46 , and the others who perished with him , firefighters Faustino Apostol , 56 , Stephen Russell , 38 , Robert Lane , 30 , and Christopher Mozzillo , 28 The bodies of all but Mozzillo have been recovered from the rubble We 're very happy we found the rig , we just hope we can find our last man , said firefighter Rich Cipoletti , at the firehouse We hope we can bring him back home Firefighter Paul Acciarito said of the find , I'm ecstatic It 's almost like she was waiting for us to find her He said having a piece of the truck in the firehouse brings back the horrible memories of that day but I'm glad its back A part of our heart came back Songs of Freedom Tears of Remembrance The following is an excerpt from a five part journal detailing one man 's crusade to bring healing to a New York firehouse after Sept 11 , and in doing so , heal himself Barrington stockbroker Joe Cantafio is on a year long concert tour to raise money for the widows and bereaved families of Engine Company 55 , who lost five men at the World Trade Center on Sept 11 In July 2002 , Cantafio went to New York City to spend a week with Engine 55 and raise money with several club appearances Daily Herald staff writer Jim Fuller and photographer Mark Welsh went along They stayed in the firehouse in Little Italy , sleeping and eating alongside the men of Engine 55 Fuller kept a journal of that extraordinary week In part one , they arrive in New York , meet the firefighters and see ground zero for the first time At night , it 's show time Joe plays his first show at an Irish tavern called Molly Wee , where many of the Chicago rescue crews would go for a break after digging It 's not a neighborhood bar Salt and pepper shakers sit on the tables and the waiters wear shirts and ties Waiting inside is a face from Engine 55 's past Steve Buscemi was with Engine 55 before Hollywood came calling His face is recognizable to millions , but tonight he 's just a firefighter again At one point he blends in so well that a woman asks him to watch the men 's room door for her while she goes in to use the facilities instead of the crowded ladies room He 's not dressed for the red carpet tonight with black pants and a short sleeve , deep orange , button up shirt But tonight , class has no position Some Budweiser reps show up in their suits and ties , but they mix right in with the jean shorts and sandals and start buying beer for everyone Buscemi put on his gear and dug at ground zero with the rest of them Tonight , he sings almost every song from We Wo n't Get Fooled Again to Born to Run There are smiles again As they sing , footage of Sept 11 plays on MSNBC during a story about the attacks The firefighters do n't see it the television is over their heads It is an odd mix of tragedy and recovery Joe does a four hour set , without a break , finally wrapping up close to 1 a m Buscemi walks over to Joe and hugs him at the end I did n't get it

before the World Trade Center attack the following month that left 343 members of the fire service dead Leary , who lost his cousin , firefighter Jerry Lucey , in a warehouse fire in Worcester , Mass , in 1999 , said the public did not understand how underpaid firefighters were These guys shouldn t have to worry about second and third jobs and their kids tuition , and they should be able to see their kids , Leary said The rally was a prelude to Saturday s memorial service for fallen firefighters at Madison Square Garden , expected to draw emergency workers from around the nation While the East Meadow was a sea of umbrellas and rain slickers , the rally clearly fell short of the turnout expected by the Uniformed Firefighters Association This is just a little water , said the Stephen Cassidy , president of the union We ve been through much more Let s get a raise Many of the protesters carried placards , including one that read I m a New York City firefighter I can t afford an umbrella Another sign read , A million thanks won t pay a mortgage Speakers included politicians , widows and celebrities Actor Steve Buscemi , who once worked at Engine 55 in Manhattan , got a particularly warm welcome We could never thank you enough , Buscemi yelled to the crowd from a podium inside the park at 98th and Fifth Avenue We can never pay you enough Firefighters , who after five years on the job make about 59 , 000 annually including overtime and some benefits , said they just wanted to be compensated fairly I m out here because we need a raise , said Frank Doherty of Ladder Company 162 in Queens The city always has excuses why not to give us one We re out here to tell them the excuses are over Marian Fontana , the widow of firefighter David Fontana and president of the Sept 11 Widow and Victims Family Association , told the crowd how she and her husband struggled to survive on a firefighter s salary She drew rousing applause when she called New York City s firefighters the underpaid soldiers on the front line in the war against terrorism The city s deepening fiscal crisis which has even included talk of possibly closing select fire companies may make any resolution tough to come by Cassidy said he would reopen talks with the city , but a spokesman for Mayor Michael Bloomberg held out little hope that anything would change We will continue to negotiate in good faith , but the city s fiscal crisis really limits what we can afford , mayoral spokesman Jerry Russo said Friday Copyright 2003 , Newsday , Inc Excerpt from Salon com Interview You were once a fireman in Manhattan Were you also acting during that time \? I was a fireman for four years , from 1980 to '84 My first year on the job , I did n't do any acting , even though I had gone to school for acting and had done some stand up comedy before I took the job But after I had been on the job for about a year , I started going back to acting classes It was around that time that I met Mark Boone and we started doing our own work And then I started working with the theater group Willem Dafoe was with I was constantly doing theater , and the first couple of films I did , I was still with the fire department Engine 55 , in Little Italy I was in the engine company , which means we were responsible for getting in there with the hose and putting out the fire Were there any situations that were particularly hairy \? Well , they 're all frightening Any time you go into a burning building , there 's the potential for disaster I never had any real close calls , though there 's no such thing as a routine fire Why did you become a firefighter \? My dad had encouraged me to take the civil service test when I was 18 So I did , and I kind of forgot about it until my name came up on the list four years later By then I was living in Manhattan , working as a furniture mover during the day , doing stand up comedy at night and looking for a change I liked the job the guys I worked with and the nature of the work I think I would have been happy doing it if I had n't had a greater passion for acting If anyone has any further information about FDNY Engine 55 that they would like to see added to this page , please contact the webmaster at shari indieking com Thank you",true

Rauner would love to spend these gray winter days focused on his November re election bid against a Democrat opponent , but he can t First , he s got to win the Republican primary on March 20 , in which he will face off against former ally state Rep Jeanne Ives of Wheaton On Monday , Rauner and Ives made a joint appearance before the Tribune Editorial Board at which they sparred over who has the better strategy for addressing Illinois political dysfunction and creating jobs This is their only scheduled debate you can view it at chicagotribune com gopgov Whenever an incumbent gets a serious primary challenge , that says something that there s uncertainty among party faithful , or dissatisfaction Such is the case for Rauner , the former private equity executive who defeated Gov Pat Quinn in 2014 as the unconquerable outsider Turns out Rauner hasn t been able to bend House Speaker Michael Madigan and the Democratic run General Assembly to his will The governor s turnaround agenda stalled Residents are fleeing high tax Illinois Employers are bailing , too , or choosing instead to invest in other states We ve begun to think about this election in dire terms The Land of Lincoln has a festering pension crisis and a reputation as a loser Job growth is weak A lot of voters think Illinois must change or die Ives , a social conservative , edged into the race after Rauner signed legislation expanding taxpayer subsidized abortion for women covered by Medicaid or state employee health insurance But now that she s in , she s running hard as a critic of the governor s economic policy chops and his relentless public feuding with Madigan One of Illinois problems is that Madigan actively blocks the governor s job growth efforts Before the primary , we will endorse a Republican and a Democratic candidate for governor Today we reach only the conclusion that Ives , now in her third term in the Illinois House , makes a persuasive case as an alternative to Rauner Especially on the question of who might work with , or work around , Madigan and colleagues , Ives presented herself as a Republican legislator who knows how to work with Democrats in Springfield We said at the top of this editorial that the governor is eager to run against a Democrat , not another Republican He made clear Monday he thinks his greatest adversary is Madigan , whom the governor attacked for being a property tax attorney in a state where many property owners challenge their assessments We need to focus on Speaker Madigan and his corruption , Rauner told us He then connected dots from Madigan to J B Pritzker , one of the Democrats running for governor Pritzker is Madigan s handpicked candidate for governor He s in effect Madigan s bagman for funding that whole corrupt culture One comment about such incendiary talk We don t see how it convinces employers such as Amazon CEO Jeff Bezos , who values a stable culture of governance , to invest money and hire in Illinois Rauner wishes Madigan would just disappear Rauner s second wish is that the U S Supreme Court rules in Illinois favor in two cases that could weaken the role of unions and thus make the state appear more friendly and flexible to employers Indeed that s possible , but it s bad policy to bet the farm on the deliberation of judges Yet Rauner , as if he were quoting James Earl Jones in Field of Dreams , sounds convinced of his own good luck You watch us boom after the court victories , Rauner promised Even if Madigan is still in power , which I hope he s not after November , we will get changes through the courts that will allow us to compete And the companies will come from Indiana They ll come from Wisconsin and Texas and Tennessee We will be a rapid growth state \( Remember that fantasy sequence from Field of Dreams \? People will come , Ray They 'll come to Iowa for reasons they ca n't even fathom \) As a challenger rising from Springfield s backbenches , Ives has a debating advantage because she can make fresh promises uncompromised by past performance or daunting realities But she made a good point about having a track record of working across the aisle She made another good point about targeting smaller victories to prove to employers and investors that Illinois can be more business friendly Her example Address pension reform by shifting new state employees to 401 \( k \) style retirement plans It would have sent a strong signal to the bond market , to the business community , and to residents that we re finally serious about doing something about not digging the hole deeper , she said Monday s conversation was one moment in the campaign The candidates have more time to differentiate themselves Another debate or two would help Bruce Rauner , with a strong polling and millions in his coffers , showed no interest But he should capitalize on the chance to sell Republicans on himself Because in Jeanne Ives they ve got a legitimate alternative Join the discussion on Twitter Trib Ed Board and on Facebook",false
"An Ivanka Trump blouse \( left \) and a blouse relabeled as Adrienne Vittadini Studio \( right \) NEW YORK , United States At American discount retailer Stein Mart , Ivanka Trump apparel is being sold under the guise of a different label BoF has learned that the Jacksonville , Florida based chain which has 290 stores in 31 states , everywhere from Little Rock , Arkansas to Madison , Wisconsin is selling Ivanka Trump garments relabeled as Adrienne Vittadini Studio G III , the company that owns the right to manufacture and distribute Ivanka Trump apparel through a license agreement and also owns brands including DKNY outright acknowledges that it sold the relabelled merchandise to Stein Mart without the knowledge of the Ivanka Trump brand It is not known whether this inventory was also sold to other retailers G III accepts responsibility for resolving this issue , which occurred without the knowledge or consent of the Ivanka Trump organisation , a representative for G III said in a statement to BoF G III has already begun to take corrective actions , including facilitating the immediate removal of any mistakenly labelled merchandise from its customer The Ivanka Trump brand continues to grow and remains very strong BoF has obtained photos of identical garments being sold at Stein Mart , with the only difference being the name on the label Some say Ivanka Trump while others say Adrienne Vittadini Why did this happen \? Since the election of her father Donald J Trump to the office of US president , Ivanka Trump branded merchandise has been dropped from several prominent American retailers , most notably Nordstrom which cited weak sales as well as Neiman Marcus and Shoebuy com According to a source within Stein Mart , the retailer has received negative feedback from customers regarding Ivanka Trump product , with one customer spitting on a blouse in front of a cashier before storming out of a store But the motivating factors may not be that simple Swiping labels or simply ripping the label out completely before a garment is sold to a discount retailer has long been commonplace One reason is brand protection if a brand is hot , it s not desirable to be associated with a discounter However , this practice occurs less often now that many major full price retailers such as Nordstrom , Neiman Marcus and Saks Fifth Avenue operate their own off price outlets , marketing the same brands they sell at full line stores US textile product labelling laws allow substitution of labels , so long as the entity making the substitution is identified on the new label and keeps records for three years , explained Susan Scafidi , professor of fashion law at Fordham Law School and founder of the Fashion Law Institute This is mostly for supply chain tracking reasons All of the other required information on the label fibre content , country of origin , etcetera must be maintained advertising It could be argued that G III was simply looking to protect the Ivanka Trump brand from being associated with a discount retailer In its 2016 fiscal year which ended at the end of January 2017 G III reported that net sales of Ivanka Trump merchandise increased by 17 9 million from 2015 , although the company does not break out exactly how much revenue the merchandise generated altogether Sales performance of G III 's Ivanka Trump merchandise for the first quarter of 2017 and since President Trump s inauguration has yet to be reported , although much of the success of the brand is thought to be due to sales in China , where she is often referred to as a goddess on social media G III does not break out Ivanka Trump sales by region In a call on Friday with BoF , Stein Mart chief executive D Hunt Hawkins said that , despite certain customer complaints regarding the Ivanka Trump label being sold in stores , the retailer s decision to carry the relabelled product was not motivated by politics We ve had both labels for a while We may see more Adrienne Vittadini in the short term , he said I ve had an equal number of customers say that they don t want and do want the Ivanka Trump merchandise in the store If we get it , we get The retailer doesn t have the luxury of being choosy Unlike many of its off price competitors which have benefited from the rise of discount culture , expanding at a rapid rate Stein Mart , which generated 1 4 billion in its 2016 fiscal year , has struggled While year over year net sales were about flat in 2016 , sales at stores open at least one year were down almost 4 percent While G III and Stein Mart have both acknowledged their participation in the swap , it is unclear what role Adrienne Vittadini has played Authentic Brands Group licenses Adrienne Vittadini , not G III However , G III declined to explain how the Adrienne Vittadini labels ended up on the Ivanka Trump garments A representative from Authentic Brands Group declined to comment for this story It certainly matters if Adrienne Vittadini did not know about the swap If the original label is replaced with that of a third party unaware of the substitution , the responsible party would be liable to the third party , Scafidi says All of this derives historically from the law of fraud advertising And even if label swapping is technically legal , questions remain on whether or not the practice is ethical or in line with customer expectation Of course , the fact that a clothing retailer can legally relabel with certain restrictions does n't mean that it should , especially if label conscious consumers are likely to be outraged by the switch , Scafidi says Fashion may be trending toward modesty , but when it comes to labels , customers are demanding more transparency than ever Related Articles Ivanka Trump Brand Plans to Expand Footprint Despite Criticism Fashion Reacts Publicly and Privately to Trump 's Muslimban Why Fashion Will Learn to Love Melania Trump",false

immigrants' applications to become citizens is starting an office tasked with stripping naturalized Americans of their citizenship if they cheated to get it Cissna said in an interview Friday , June 8 , 2018 , that his agency is hiring several dozen lawyers and officers to review the cases of immigrants who were ordered deported and are suspected of using fake identities to later get green cards and naturalize \( AP Photo Reed Saxon , File \) LOS ANGELES \( AP \) The U S government agency that oversees immigration applications is launching an office that will focus on identifying Americans who are suspected of cheating to get their citizenship and seek to strip them of it U S Citizenship and Immigration Services Director L Francis Cissna told The Associated Press in an interview that his agency is hiring several dozen lawyers and immigration officers to review cases of immigrants who were ordered deported and are suspected of using fake identities to later get green cards and citizenship through naturalization Cissna said the cases would be referred to the Department of Justice , whose attorneys could then seek to remove the immigrants citizenship in civil court proceedings In some cases , government attorneys could bring criminal charges related to fraud Until now , the agency has pursued cases as they arose but not through a coordinated effort , Cissna said He said he hopes the agency s new office in Los Angeles will be running by next year but added that investigating and referring cases for prosecution will likely take longer We finally have a process in place to get to the bottom of all these bad cases and start denaturalizing people who should not have been naturalized in the first place , Cissna said What we re looking at , when you boil it all down , is potentially a few thousand cases He declined to say how much the effort would cost but said it would be covered by the agency s existing budget , which is funded by immigration application fees The push comes as the Trump administration has been cracking down on illegal immigration and taking steps to reduce legal immigration to the U S Immigrants who become U S citizens can vote , serve on juries and obtain security clearance Denaturalization the process of removing that citizenship is very rare The U S government began looking at potentially fraudulent naturalization cases a decade ago when a border officer detected about 200 people had used different identities to get green cards and citizenship after they were previously issued deportation orders In September 2016 , an internal watchdog reported that 315 , 000 old fingerprint records for immigrants who had been deported or had criminal convictions had not been uploaded to a Department of Homeland Security database that is used to check immigrants identities The same report found more than 800 immigrants had been ordered deported under one identity but became U S citizens under another Since then , the government has been uploading these older fingerprint records dating back to the 1990s and investigators have been evaluating cases for denaturalization Earlier this year , a judge revoked the citizenship of an Indian born New Jersey man named Baljinder Singh after federal authorities accused him of using an alias to avoid deportation Authorities said Singh used a different name when he arrived in the United States in 1991 He was ordered deported the next year and a month later applied for asylum using the name Baljinder Singh before marrying an American , getting a green card and naturalizing Authorities said Singh did not mention his earlier deportation order when he applied for citizenship For many years , most U S efforts to strip immigrants of their citizenship focused largely on suspected war criminals who lied on their immigration paperwork , most notably former Nazis Toward the end of the Obama administration , officials began reviewing cases stemming from the fingerprints probe but prioritized those of naturalized citizens who had obtained security clearances , for example , to work at the Transportation Security Administration , said Muzaffar Chishti , director of the Migration Policy Institute s office at New York University law school The Trump administration has made these investigations a bigger priority , he said He said he expects cases will focus on deliberate fraud but some naturalized Americans may feel uneasy with the change It is clearly true that we have entered a new chapter when a much larger number of people could feel vulnerable that their naturalization could be reopened , Chishti said Since 1990 , the Department of Justice has filed 305 civil denaturalization cases , according to statistics obtained by an immigration attorney in Kansas who has defended immigrants in these cases The attorney , Matthew Hoppock , agrees that deportees who lied to get citizenship should face consequences but worries other immigrants who might have made mistakes on their paperwork could get targeted and might not have the money to fight back in court Cissna said there are valid reasons why immigrants might be listed under multiple names , noting many Latin American immigrants have more than one surname He said the U S government is not interested in that kind of minor discrepancy but wants to target people who deliberately changed their identities to dupe officials into granting immigration benefits The people who are going to be targeted by this they know full well who they are because they were ordered removed under a different identity and they intentionally lied about it when they applied for citizenship later on , Cissna said It may be some time before we get to their case , but we ll get to them",true

"Share 0 SHARES The latest PR coup for Pope Francis has seen him hire famous and revered children s author JK Rowling to rewrite the Bible It is hoped the author , most famous for her Harry Potter series , can make it more accessible and believable for a new generation of Catholics and Christians While the specifics of the rewrite are not yet known , it is believed Rowling is tasked with producing a compelling tale that young Catholics and Christians can engage with Figures such as Dementors and other popular creations may take the place of less realistic Biblical creatures such as unicorns and the leviathon We are very happy Miss Rowling has agreed to the rewrite , we keenly await the first draft , a Vatican insider told WWN Rowling s selection has raised some eyebrows , but the decision by Pope Francis to select the wildly popular author is mainly due to commercial concerns The sales of the Jesus Christ action figure have dropped by over 200 in the last 10 years , we are in need of new , compelling and toy friendly characters like the dinosaur in Toy Story , a source close to the Pope told WWN Our revenue streams are shrinking so the more Hollywood esque the better , the source concluded Rowling has thus far remained tight lipped on her vision for the Bible and its merry band of characters , but a number of Hollywood producers are in discussions to turn it into a movie In the last century , many Christian leaders have offered revisions on the interpretations of many of the Bible s passages , but Rowling is expected to take a more drastic approach Judas is probably going to wear a leather jacket and JK is toying with the idea of a nervous twitch or even an eye patch Also , why have one book when can have more \?

"Product Description Jane Leavy , the acclaimed author of the New York Times bestseller Sandy Koufax A Lefty 's Legacy , returns with a biography of an American original number 7 , Mickey Mantle Drawing on more than 500 interviews with friends and family , teammates , and opponents , she delivers the definitive account of Mantle 's life , mining the mythology of The Mick for the true story of a luminous and illustrious talent with an achingly damaged soul Meticulously reported and elegantly written , The Last Boy is a baseball tapestry that weaves together episodes from the author 's weekend with The Mick in Atlantic City , where she interviewed her hero in 1983 , after he was banned from baseball , with reminiscences from friends and family of the boy from Commerce , Oklahoma , who would lead the Yankees to seven world championships , be voted the American League 's Most Valuable Player three times , win the Triple Crown in 1956 , and duel teammate Roger Maris for Babe Ruth 's home run crown in the summer of 1961 the same boy who would never grow up As she did so memorably in her biography of Sandy Koufax , Jane Leavy transcends the hyperbole of hero worship to reveal the man behind the coast to coast smile , who grappled with a wrenching childhood , crippling injuries , and a genetic predisposition to alcoholism In The Last Boy she chronicles her search to find out more about the person he was and , given what she discovers , to explain his mystifying hold on a generation of baseball fans , who were seduced by that lopsided , gap toothed grin It is an uncommon biography , with literary overtones not only a portrait of an icon , but an investigation of memory itself How long was the Tape Measure Home Run \? Did Mantle swing the same way right handed and left handed \? What really happened to his knee in the 1951 World Series \? What happened to the red haired , freckle faced boy known back home as Mickey Charles \? I believe in memory , not memorabilia , Leavy writes in her preface But in The Last Boy , she discovers that what we remember of our heroes and even what they remember of themselves is only where the story begins Amazon Q A Bill Madden Interviews Jane Leavy Madden Your best selling biography of Sandy Koufax was a tour de force , partly because Koufax was a very private man whose life story had never really been told before Mickey Mantle s life is quite the opposite , it s been in the subject of a spate of different autobiographies , some of which he even wrote Under those circumstances , what made you want to take up another book about him \? Leavy Originally , I wanted to write about Willie , Mickey and The Duke in New York in the Fifties The publisher said , Do The Mick Everybody loves The Mick I was wary because so much had been written about him he left a paper trail as long as the drive from Commerce , Oklahoma to the Bronx , so I didn t expect to learn that he d been raised by a den of Alaskan she wolves My challenge was to strip away all the layers of myth that had accumulated and let Mickey breathe And he , of all people , was my worst source For example the knee surgery he said he had after tripping over a drain in the 1951 World Series trying not to run into Joe DiMaggio in centerfield In fact , he didn t have surgery until two years later I only learned that because I went through every day of the New York Times from October 1951 to November 1953 looking for the date the knife fell ! That s why this book took five years and nearly 600 interviews I wanted to try to understand why after all these years , and all these revelations , Mickey Mantle still means so much to so many people including me and the first step was to get the basic facts straight Madden You make the point early on in the book that Mickey was a childhood hero , but you also have a recurring sequence in the book of your first interview with him in Atlantic City in 1983 , where at one point he drunkenly makes a pass at you What lingering effect did this have on how you ultimately approached your book \? Leavy I was plenty nervous when I met him Mickey was my hero But , he was also a very particular kind of role model I was born two months prematurely \( in a hospital a mile from Yankee Stadium \) and came with some of the flaws that afflict those who don t incubate as long as we re supposed to Mickey taught me how to function with pain and without complaint his triumphs were mine I was devastated with how he acted After I d taken his hand from my knee , I called the only person I could think of still awake at that hour , a new mother , who basically told me to grow up The next morning , over breakfast , I vented my anger and disappointment , railing at him for , among other things , greeting my youthful autograph request with flatulence He was stunned and remorseful , albeit in a hilariously idiosyncratic manner He gave me an 8 x 10 glossy that said , Sorry , I farted , your friend , Mick For a moment , I felt I saw behind his crude fa ade I decided the only way I could write this book was to acknowledge my lack of dispassion and scrutinize him completely That s what happened that weekend in Atlantic City It forced me to see the world as it was , not how I wanted it to be Madden One of the people I wish I 'd been able to interview for my Steinbrenner book was Mantle , if only because I detected a very strained relationship between the two of them Steinbrenner made a point to deify DiMaggio and had memorial services for Joe , Billy Martin , Roger Maris and Mel Allen , but did nothing for Mickey when he died In your conversations with Mickey did he ever talk about Steinbrenner and anything that might have led to ill feelings toward each other \? Leavy When I told Mantle I d heard the Boss was thinking of turning Monument Park in centerfield into a water park for the disadvantaged youth of the South Bronx , Mantle was completely incredulous He told me , It was 480 in centerfield when I played It s 420 now and he s talking about bringing them in farther , and shook his head I was at a banquet one time and I said to him , they ought to let those boys throw the ball up and hit it That pissed him off Mantle was interested in Yankee history he grilled a friend who saw Babe Ruth lying in state in the rotunda at the Stadium about what it was like to be there that day But I don t think he had a whole lot of patience with Yankeeography It was a quick disillusionment When he signed with the Yankees , reporters asked which Yankee had been his childhood hero He said , Stan Musial George Weiss , the general manager , immediately corrected his memory and from then on Joe D was his hero Furthermore , I think he was deeply disappointed with the baseball community s response or lack of response when commissioner Bowie Kuhn banned him in 1983 because of his affiliation with the Claridge Hotel and Casino , a job he had taken to pay for his son Billy s treatment for non Hodgkin s Lymphoma He told me , I feel really kind of bad no one took up for me By no one I was pretty sure he meant Steinbrenner The Yankees did little more than observe a moment of silence when Mantle died Madden It would seem that most everybody pertinent to the book cooperated with you , especially the Mantle family I was grateful for the cooperation I had from George Steinbrenner s friends and associates when I wrote Steinbrenner , but I had an advantage that you didn t in that most of them knew me personally and , I suppose , trusted me As a stranger , did you meet any significant resistance \? Leavy Danny and David Mantle Mickey s sons and their late mother , Merlyn were extremely generous with their recollections and insights Their openness about their lives and their relationship with their father was extraordinary Like him , they are extremely honest There s no put on , as folks in Commerce , Oklahoma like to say I hope they ll come away from the book with a deeper understanding of the forces that formed him and contributed to his downfall , but I don t know how they ll react Madden This is the definitive warts and all biography of Mickey , with heavy emphasis on all of his demons How do you think Mickey himself would feel about the book \? Leavy I think it s an honest book and Mantle was a very honest man I don t see this is as a dark book I hope it s enlightening in the most literal sense of the word and I hope that critics and readers at large will agree I think the tragedy of Mantle is that he had so little time , at the beginning of his baseball career , and at the beginning of his sober life , to be his best self He was a decent man who was genetically pre disposed to alcoholism and enabled his whole life by the trappings of his celebrity That s his story As Billy Crystal told me about his movie , 61 , Mickey wouldn t have wanted the sugar coat His late wife , Merlyn , wrote about the sexual abuse he suffered as a young boy in the family memoir , A Hero All His Life and she elaborated on it when we spoke , as did several of his close friends It turned out that his half sister wasn t his only abuser and experts tell me that many of the destructive behaviors he manifested are seen in victims of childhood sexual abuse So , I came away with enormous compassion for him and , I hope , with an answer to the question posed by one of his minor league teammates Mickey , what happened \?",true

"Mitsu Yasukawa The Star LedgerAssemblyman Declan J O'Scanlon speaks during a meeting of the Assembly Budget Committee at the Statehouse Annex in Trenton in June of 2008 By Declan O ScanlonIt s a simple question loaded with political appeal With so many people hurting and income disparities rising , shouldn t we ask New Jersey s millionaires to pay a fair share in taxes \? Okay , what s a fair share \? If the current share of state income tax paid by the top 1 percent of New Jersey s taxpayers about 37 percent isn t high enough , what is \? Would 80 percent be fair \? Or 90 percent \? Taxpayers earning 1 million pay an effective tax rate that is about four times what taxpayers earning 100 , 000 pay When and how will we know when we ve achieved fairness \? Unfortunately , intense partisanship feeding on visceral emotions has made it virtually impossible to have a rational conversation about taxes in America As a senior member of the state Assembly s Budget Committee , I think those of us in positions of leadership have a responsibility to do more than stoke emotions , and instead , adopt tax policies that generate the revenue needed to support budget priorities on a fair and sustainable basis Piling taxes on the rich may be great politics , but it s lousy public policy New Jersey already has a progressive income tax system , which , thanks to high income households receiving a greater proportion of their income from investments and capital gains , has made our revenue base highly volatile Increasing our relative reliance on high income taxpayers will increase volatility , making it more difficult to engage in prudent , long term financial planning Most experts believe increased volatility is a problem because fiscal stability is a condition precedent to sound policymaking Wild fluctuations in revenues fuel an inefficient boom and bust approach to budget making that mismanages expectations The impact of emergent budget cuts on New Jersey residents is regressive those at middle and lower income levels experience the pain of budget cuts disproportionately , since they more often benefit from state programs Some editorialists have suggested Gov Andrew Cuomo s recent decision to embrace higher rates for high income New Yorkers should serve as an example for New Jersey New York s current high rate is 8 97 percent , the same as New Jersey s Instead of letting the rate go down to 6 85 percent , as scheduled , Cuomo is saying he ll let the rate fall to 8 82 percent for taxpayers at 2 million or more , but let the rate fall to 6 85 percent for taxpayers between 300 , 000 and 2 million Everyone in New York will get a tax cut , but folks above 2 million will get less of a tax cut than they had expected If that s the standard of fairness , maybe the editorialists are right and we should follow New York s example Here s the critical point The top marginal rate in New York will soon fall below the top rate in New Jersey that s not good news for our competitive position A review of national IRS data by Charles Steindel , the state Treasury s chief economist , confirmed a statistical connection between tax increases enacted under former Gov James E McGreevey and an increase of affluent taxpayers who moved out of , or never moved into , New Jersey Steindel also conducted a survey confirming a significant proportion of tax advisers had discussed the idea of moving out of New Jersey with their relatively affluent clients The study and survey were modest in scope and merely confirmed what we already know Yes , Virginia , taxes matter Are they the only competitive consideration \? Absolutely not Infrastructure , regulations , climate , educational levels and other factors play a major role Instead of asking What s fair \? we should be asking What s in our long term self interest \? I suggest it s in New Jersey s interest to pursue policies that support sustainable and growing revenue collections over time Although New Jersey cannot expect to compete globally on the basis of low taxes alone , we should avoid negative outlier status and , with it , the kind of reputation that once prevented the Garden State from getting into the starting blocks when companies make site selections Assemblyman Declan O Scanlon \( R Monmouth \) is the ranking Republican on the state s Assembly Budget Committee Most Read",true

"In a breathtaking heart to heart , Ma Kali took New York on Saturday , August 1st , 2015 Just as this Venus Retrograde began to take us all deeper into the darkness of the underworld , the Divine Feminine Maha Shakti , goddess of spiritual death , destruction and resurrection , rode the zeitgeist straight onto the face of the Empire State Building and into the heart of collective consciousness This Kali apparition over Manhattan may be our last warning Fierce protectress of truth , she tells it like it is , she beckons us to dive into the dark , to face the stark reality of the global ecological crisis upon us , and to let heartbreak be the ground from which we awaken and serve Perhaps it is even too late now , perhaps only calamity can make us silence the ego and hear the cries of the World Soul , perhaps destruction must be our baptism into change , but this is the time and we are the ones summoned to be the shamans of the Shift Never underestimate the power of holy darkness to reveal the Soul of all matters The dark is where illusions are shattered , where false certainties are broken the dark is where the mind is cut off so that only the heart can see It is time to let holy darkness be our medicine The world as we know it must change or perish In an unprecedented and awe inspiring public display of art by filmmaker Louie Psihoyos and his team , Projecting Change , projected onto the NYC skyline by Obscura Digital , was meant to spark awareness of massive wildlife extinction , and be a chilling call to conservation turning the Empire State Building , New York s brightest and most recognizable symbol and capitalism s earliest totem , into the worlds greatest canvas , as well as its most epic tombstone and oracle of the Dark Feminine From the colossal projection of Cecil the Lion , whose recent tragic death provoked a mass outpouring of love and outrage , to the images of hundreds of nameless endangered animals , finned ones and scaled ones , horned ones and winged ones , two legged and four , creeping and crawling and running for their lives across the Empire State Building , this revolutionary and heart rending project , will not soon be forgotten If you are not heartbroken , you are not paying attention ! this project seems to scream from its illustrious rooftop For as the parade of near extinct animals appear on the screen , it is impossible not to face the crushing realization that it is not a question of if hundreds of species will continue to go extinct , but when Our shiny unsustainable systems based on glamour and greed have taken us to a world on the edge of collapse only holy darkness can save us now And it was Kali , the dark mother , the destroyer of illusions and the personification of time , death and holy change , by Android Jones , that stole the show in New York , as the final , spectacular image of the installation , leaving her fierce gaze to peer into our souls If there was ever a sign of the times , this is it In our bones we all recognize , we are in the death pangs of the old world , and that we make it through is anything but certain It is time to get our Kali on inside and out to cut off the head and commit to the heart on all levels So many of us are shedding our false selves , empty certainties and small lives , and no matter how much we wish for the safety of the old , the more desperately we hold on , the hotter the fires of the Real The quickening of the New Earth is upon us and what is needed now is the fierceness of Ma Kali A holy oracle of change , her medicine is darkness , her initiation is by fire she calls upon us to rise from our own ashes , to speak truth to power , take on all our shadows and take up the arms that we have , our own , to hold , serve and protect all life as we would our own child The Divine Feminine energy is pulsing through every pore of the planet right now , every whisper of the world soul is one intimately connected to our ecology The ecological consciousness is feminine consciousness , systemic , interconnected , relational and embodied nature and psyche , body and soul , the spiritual and the political can no longer remain apart May we burn up the convoluted narratives of separation , deprivation and control , cut off the dead promises of capitalism , step fully into our dharma , and let the Mother guide us through the fires of transfiguration May all beings be happy One Body One Heart Jai Ma ! In preparation for the birth of the Divine , the entire human race is now going through a global dark night , which will result in a new humanity that has been humbled and chastened by tragedy , so that it may open completely to the mystery of divine grace This dark night cannot be bargained with , explained away , leapt over or mitigated It is the destined crucifixion of a communal human ego now clearly revealed to be suicidal , matricidal , dangerous to itself and to the whole of creation No one and nothing will stop Kali dancing Her terrible dance of destruction and re creation There will be no resurrection of an embodied divine humanity without a systematic , perfectly organized , brutally complete crucifixion of everything in us that keeps us addicted to the systems of illusion that are now rapidly destroying everything Andrew Harvey Vera de Chalambert is a mystic mama , a holy misfit , a healing muse she is a spiritual facilitator and Harvard educated scholar of comparative religion Vera has studied with spiritual teachers , healers and visionaries the world over , and mined for her soul at the Barbara Brennan School of Healing , and Jason Shulman s School for Nondual Healing and Awakening She is deeply influenced by Buddhist and Kabbalistic lineages , and is a lover of the world s great wisdom traditions She teaches and writes about mindfulness in the modern world and the Divine Feminine You could visit Vera on her website , and follow her on Facebook and Twitter Comments",true

"Fact or fiction \? You be the judge I 'll never forget stumbling upon the wrinkled old photo that looked like something out of an old monster movie The picture could have been titled , The Catfish That Could Have Eaten Hardin County , Tennessee It was in the mid 1990s , and I was working on a story about the National Catfish Derby , an annual catfishing derby and festival held on the Tennessee River The derby president was the first to show me the black and white photo What do you think \? said the derby prez , Jay Barker I looked at the photo and then at Barker , who was grinning mischievously like the Cheshire cat Interesting , I said Very interesting Whether the photo and the talk it has generated are fact or fishy fiction does n't matter The mystery is part of the tale itself a tale that has more twists and turns than a hooked catfish And , true or not , Barker has long known the stories would get plenty of news play and help promote the event Many people do n't believe the photo is real , and that is all right But my mother told me it was , and she had no reason to lie Faye Callens Barker told me he first learned of the photo from Betty Coleman , a fellow resident of Savannah , Tenn She found it while gathering old photos for the Hardin County Historical Society Since then , people have told Barker the photo was taken in the Hardin County community of Cerro Gordo in 1914 Barker also has been told the man standing alongside the catfish was Warren McConnell and that a copy of the picture hung for many years in Pitts General Store The catfish has been estimated , by those who believe in the photo 's authenticity , to weigh from 500 to 800 pounds I interviewed the late Faye Callens , also of Savannah , who said his mother , Rilla Callens , handed down the photo to him He said his mother had worked as a bookkeeper at Pitts General Store , and she told him the photo was genuine a man named Green Bailey caught the fish on a trotline Indeed Bailey 's name is inscribed on the photo along with the date and place where the photo was taken , Cerro Gordo 1914 Callens also said he visited Bailey 's sister several years ago , and she told him her brother did catch the big fish Many people do n't believe the photo is real , and that is all right , Callens said But my mother told me it was , and she had no reason to lie There is the rub To call a fisherman a liar is one thing But to say so about his mother is enough to get filleted , and fast Some people say it 's fake , but others firmly believe the catfish was actually caught Jay Barker , president of Tennessee 's National Catfish Derby As I continued to investigate , though , I found many other stories attached to the old photo One was that the late Joe B Pitts , proprietor of Pitts General Store , actually caught the fish Another story claimed that the fish was caught during a dry summer after it became landlocked in shallow water \( before dams regulated water levels on the Tennessee River \) Then , too , there is the fishy side of the story Barker said some Savannah residents have told him the photo was a fake Many believe the catfish actually weighed 50 80 pounds and was placed on a child 's wagon to be photographed as an optical illusion To make the gag complete , a cardboard cutout of a man from a cigarette ad was placed on the wagon Perhaps this is the real truth behind this fish tale , because Barker also has a copy of another photo of the same man and fish taken from a different angle The man is posed exactly the same as he is in the other photo one hand on his thigh and the other on his hip , as he stoops to admire the fish The only difference is this photo was taken from the front of the wagon rather than from the side Some people say it 's fake , but others firmly believe the catfish was actually caught , Barker said What does Barker believe \? He 'd never admit the old photo is too fishy After all , can you get too fishy in a place that bills itself as the Catfish Capitol of the World \? Personally , I believe it is authentic , and it shows without a doubt why we 're \( Hardin County \) the Catfish Capitol of the World , Barker proclaimed \( Perhaps it is no coincidence this promotions man has the last name Barker \) Besides , he pointed out that there definitely are some big catfish swimming in the Hardin County waters of the Tennessee River , especially below Pickwick Dam Probably are some catfish out there that are this big , but anglers just are n't rigged with tackle strong enough to land them , he said What would happen if a cat as big as the one depicted in the old photo was caught during the county 's annual National Catfish Derby \? I 'd try to find a swimming pool big enough to put it in , Barker laughed A fish that big would be a tourist attraction all by itself At one time the famed photo had been made into a postcard used to promote the National Catfish Derby To learn more about the National Catfish Derby , its events and attractions , or simply the fishing the Hardin County section of the Tennessee River or Pickwick Lake , call \( 800 \) 552 3866",false

the court documents said The new court documents also identify for the first time the four officers involved in the incident All four were on paid administrative leave On May 4 , the Wilmington NAACP chapter called on state officials to shed more light on the death Wilmington police announced May 3 they 'd completed the investigation , but did not elaborate on the findings Thursday , May 12 Police officers in McDole shooting not charged The four Wilmington police officers were cleared in the shooting of Jeremy McDole , according to a report from the state Department of Justice But the report , which found serious deficiencies in how Wilmington police prepares its force for such incidents , said prosecutors considered filing a felony assault charge against one of the officers involved Dellose , who in a cellphone video that surfaced after the Sept 23 incident was seen firing a shotgun at Jeremy McDole Prosecutors considered the charge based on how Dellose immediately confronted him rather than communicating with officers who were already on the scene and how he discharged his shotgun Although the Department of Justice is not able to pursue criminal charges against Senior Cpl Dellose , it is DOJ 's position that Senior Cpl Dellose 's conduct in this case was extraordinarily poor police work that endangered both the public and his fellow officers , the 31 page report said DOJ does not believe that Senior Cpl Dellose should be employed by the Wilmington Police Department in any role where he would be carrying a firearm in public Friday , May 13 AG 's McDole report to help in federal civil suit Wilmington Attorney Thomas S Neuberger , who represents Jeremy McDole 's family , said the report issued by the state Attorney General 's Office would help in his federal civil case Calling the report historic and unprecedented because of the information it provided , Neuberger said it included portions of interviews with the shooting officers explaining what they saw on Sept 23 that caused them to fire at McDole Some of those interviews , Neuberger said , contradict what is seen in a cellphone video that was modified by the FBI and provided in the report issued by Attorney General Matt Denn 's office Instead of closing off the investigation , Denn goes on and helps us make the civil case for us , Neuberger said Friday , May 20 Confrontation marks McDole rally in Wilmington A march to protest the shooting of 28 year old Jeremy McDole by four Wilmington police officers , and the decision by the state Attorney General 's Office to not prosecute the officers , threatened to explode when police blocked protesters from continuing to march on Market Street toward Rodney Square where children were participating in the annual Tennis in the Streets program Officers , some who had been escorting marchers along the rally , confronted the protesters at Ninth and Market streets , instructing them to head down Ninth Street When protesters insisted they wanted to continue on Market Street , additional officers arrived and stood shoulder to shoulder preventing protesters access to the 900 block of Market Street A group of officers on motorcycles lined behind them , and at least one officer farther down the block was holding a teargas gun Protesters continued to insult and yell at officers Many pulled out cellphones and videoed the impasse About 20 minutes later , protesters turned east onto Ninth Street Tuesday , July 26 Phyllis McDole , mother of man shot by police , accepts plea deal Jeremy McDole 's mother , Phyllis , accepted plea deal in connection with the assault of a woman she believed placed the 911 call that eventually led to her son 's death McDole , 49 , pleaded guilty July 26 to third degree burglary The state dropped additional charges for conspiracy , terroristic threats and assault in exchange for her plea In October , she was sentenced to 45 days in prison , to be followed by 6 months of home confinement and a year of probation She also was ordered to have no contact with the victim , to take her medications as prescribed and to comply with all recommended substance abuse and mental health treatment She recently violated her probation and was being detained at Baylor Women 's Correctional Institution She has a violation of probation hearing scheduled for 9 a m Thursday Monday , Sept 19 Man who took McDole video claims he was never interviewed Nate Wilson , the man who captured Jeremy McDole 's fatal shooting on his cellphone camera , said in court documents for a civil suit that he was not interviewed by police investigating the incident But a report issued earlier in the year , about the four Wilmington officers who shot McDole , indicate Wilson was interviewed by investigators with the state Department of Justice In an affidavit filed Sept 19 with U S District Court in Wilmington , Wilson said he was at work detailing a car when he heard two shots and ducked into the vehicle he 'd been working on to avoid being hit because I did n't know where the shots were coming from Friday , Dec 16 City pays 1 5 million to settle lawsuit with McDole family The city of Wilmington has agreed to pay 1 5 million to settle a lawsuit brought by the family of Jeremy Bam McDole , a man in a wheelchair who was fatally shot by four police officers in September of 2015 As part of the agreement , Wilmington police will consider a comprehensive use of force policy that will outline when force is appropriate and train officers in de escalation procedures If this is n't a piecrust promise but this is something that 's going to come into being then Jeremy would not have died in vain , said Wilmington Attorney Thomas S Neuberger , who represents McDole 's family And members of the minority community and poor people in Wilmington , as well as throughout the state , will enjoy enhanced protections when they encounter police Friday , Jan 6 No federal charges in cop shooting of McDole Federal authorities concluded there is no evidence that four Wilmington officers willfully used excessive force in the 2015 fatal shooting of Jeremy Bam McDole Because of that , the U S Department of Justice said on Friday it would not pursue federal criminal civil rights charges against Wilmington police Senior Cpl Danny Silva , Cpl Thomas Lynch , Cpl James MacColl or Senior Cpl Joseph Dellose The announcement came as a blow to the McDole family , which has been seeking a criminal indictment against the officers , said Thomas S Neuberger , one of the attorneys representing McDole 's family The family strongly disagrees and are greatly disappointed with the conclusions and still feels a criminal prosecution would be warranted , Neuberger said",true

Meanwhile , President Obama is leading this country to financial ruin , borrowing over a trillion dollars a year for phony stimulus spending and other payoffs for his political cronies Nobody knows if or when the fiscal collapse will come , but if the country is broke , there likely won t be enough money to pay for police protection And the American people know it Hurricanes Tornadoes Riots Terrorists Gangs Lone criminals These are perils we are sure to face not just maybe It s not paranoia to buy a gun It s survival It s responsible behavior , and it s time we encourage law abiding Americans to do just that Since the election , millions of Americans have been lining up in front of gun stores , Cabela s and Bass Pro Shops exercising their freedom while they still have it They are demonstrating they have a mass determination to buy , own and use firearms Millions of Americans are using market forces like never before to demonstrate their ardent support for our firearm freedoms That s one of the very best ways we can Stand And Fight Inevitably , the anti gun media and the gun ban lobbies are demonizing the purchase of firearms They call us extremists because we wonder whether we will be able to buy a semi auto in three years or , even in some states , later this year That s despite the fact that President Obama long ago made clear that he wants to ban them all ! The media try to make rank and file Americans feel guilty about buying a gun The enemies of freedom demonize gun buyers and portray us as social lepers But we know the truth We know that responsible gun ownership exemplifies what is good and right about America Responsible Americans realize that the world as we know it has changed We , the American people , clearly see the daunting forces we will undoubtedly face terrorists , crime , drug gangs , the possibility of Euro style debt riots , civil unrest or natural disaster Gun owners are not buying firearms because they anticipate a confrontation with the government Rather , we anticipate confrontations where the government isn t there or simply doesn t show up in time To preserve the inalienable , individual human right to keep and bear arms to withstand the siege that is coming the NRA is building a four year communications and resistance movement The enemies of the Second Amendment will be met with unprecedented defiance , commitment and determination We will Stand And Fight First , we are going to devise legal capability like never before I fervently hope that President Obama does not get to appoint another anti gun Supreme Court justice like Sonia Sotomayor or Elena Kagan But he probably will , and we must meet that challenge His chances of appointing a replacement for one of the five pro rights justices in the 5 4 Heller and McDonald majorities are high And there s no doubt he is going to appoint a huge number of new judges to lifetime positions in the lower federal courts YOUR GUN RIGHTS ARE UNDER CONSTANT ATTACK !

"Levi Strauss Co established its brand in the mid 19th century by selling durable clothing to working class Americans As Levi s signature jeans gained popularity amongst a wider set in the middle of the last century , the pants came to symbolize American freedom As Stanford Historian Niall Ferguson points out in his book , Civilization The West and the Rest , during the Cold War , the American pants were so desirable behind the Iron Curtain that citizens would break any number of laws to obtain them At one point the company even celebrated America s armed heritage in a circa 1950 advertising brochure , Levi s Gallery of Western Guns Gunfighters It s with some irony then that Levi s has abandoned this rugged image to team up with a billionaire oligarch in an effort to empower the government to trample upon the fundamental rights of the American people View Related Articles On September 4th , Levi s CEO Chip Bergh announced that the San Francisco based clothing manufacturer \( which also owns Dockers \) would openly advocate for gun control As part of this campaign , the company will donate more than 1 million to radical anti gun groups , including Michael Bloomberg front group Everytown for Gun Safety and Giffords , formerly Americans for Responsible Solutions and the Legal Community Against Violence The company will also match employee donations to these groups and is encouraging its staff to devote their time to anti gun activism Further , Bergh stated that the company has joined the Everytown Business Leaders for Gun Safety The business wing of Bloomberg s outfit is dedicated to leveraging member companies market footprint employee networks , and public communications platforms to diminish Americans Second Amendment rights In a repulsive insult to the nation s 100 million gun owners , Bergh likened Levi s campaign to restrict the rights of law abiding Americans to previous company efforts aimed at combatting pre Civil Rights Era racial bigotry Among gun owners , Levi s intemperate foray into the world of gun control politics has been met with the disgust it deserves However , it shouldn t be met with surprise Since the late 1990s , Levi s has used its name and resources to attack gun rights In 1999 , the company gave 100 , 000 to gun control group PAX , followed by a 250 , 000 donation in 2000 and another 100 , 000 in 2001 PAX was founded in 1998 by Dan Gross , who went on to become president of the Brady Campaign to Prevent Gun Violence PAX would go on to change its name to the Center to Prevent Youth Violence and later merge with the Brady Campaign Much like Bloomberg s Everytown , PAX placed an emphasis on attracting corporate partners to their gun control efforts As part of Levi s relationship with PAX , in 1999 the apparel company teamed up with the band Goo Goo Dolls to attract support for the anti gun group during the Levi s Fuse 99 summer concert tour Concert goers , and visitors to Levi s website , were encouraged to sign the PAX Youth Petition Moreover , the denim company donated a percentage of all Levi s Fuse 99 t shirt proceeds to the gun control group The PAX Youth Petition endorsed a variety of severe gun control measures that have repeatedly been rejected by the American public through their elected representatives The document called for the licensing and registration of guns , like automobiles The petition also demanded the elimination of assault weapons and other weapons of war As the 1994 Clinton Assault Weapons ban was in place at the time of the petition , this imprecise demand appeared to call for prohibiting the sale of the remaining lawful semi automatic firearms , confiscation of the firearms grandfathered under the ban , or both Given the majority of Levi s 165 year history , Bergh s decision to use a formerly quintessential American company to attack a quintessential American right is a particularly sad episode in the current surge in corporate virtue signaling We can only assume that Levi s accountants have determined that resulting skinny jeans sales will be enough to offset the permanent damage to their once cherished brand",true

"b' Share191K TweetMadrid Doctors of the Carlos III hospital confirmed this morning in a press conference , the first case of human death caused by the ingestion of genetically modified food Juan Pedro Ramos died from anaphylaxis after eating some recently developed tomatoes containing fish genes , which provoked a violent and lethal allergic reaction This surprising announcement comes after the autopsy of the 31 year old Spanish man who died at the Madrid hospital in the beginning of January The young mans health rapidly deteriorated after he suffered an unexplained allergic reaction , and all the drugs used to refrain the anaphylaxis were entirely inefficient The team of experts claims to have been able to determine that the genetically modified tomatoes that the victim ingested at lunch were the cause of the allergic reaction that caused his death Mr Ramos was working as a clerk in a Madrid warehouse on January 7 , when he started feeling ill just after lunch A number of symptoms started to manifest themselves , including a violent itchy rash , some serious swelling of the throat and a drastic drop in blood pressure The man , who was known to have allergies , quickly injected himself some epinephrine , but his health condition continued to deteriorate The young man was rapidly carried to the hospital by co workers , but the medical staff was unable to identify the cause of his allergic reaction in time and none of the usual treatments or drugs seemed to work Mr Ramos was confirmed dead just over an hour after arriving at the hospital The young man appeared happy and healthy when this picture was taken by his roomate , less than 24 hours before he died The medical examiners and forensic experts at the Carlos III hospital had to execute a lot of tests and analysis before they could precisely determine what caused Mr Ramos to die of an allergic reaction to seafood , since all he had eaten before his death was a bacon , lettuce and tomato sandwich with a diet cola They were astonished when they discovered that the tomato he had ingested , not only contained some fish related allergens , but also some antibiotic resistant genes which had prevented Mr Ramos white blood cell from saving his life At first we thought that there had been some form of contamination of his food , from contact with fish or seafood during the preparation explained Dr Rafael Perez Santamarina It was only when we tested the tomato itself that we noticed that it contained some allergens usually found in seafood We did many different analysis and they all confirmed that the tomato was indeed the source of the allergens that killed Mr Ramos Many experiments on GMOs had produced some horrible tumors and event death in rats and other lab animals , but most genetically modified products on the market were considered to be harmless to humans The case of Mr Ramos is the first human death officially confirmed to be linked to the ingestion of genetically modified food It contradicts most studies on GMOs which had concluded that genetically engineered crops currently on the market were completely safe to eat A team led by University of Nebraska scientists had anticipated this kind of problem in 1996 , when they found that a Brazil nut protein introduced to improve the nutritional quality of genetically modified soybeans was able to provoke an allergic reaction in people with Brazil nut allergies However , this kind of problem was dismissed by most scientists as very improbable , since it could easily be avoided with proper safety testing The soybean injected with the Brazil nut gene was indeed abandoned during development , but it seems that the genetically modified tomato that caused Mr Ramos death had not been submitted to sufficient testing and the lethal risk had not been identified before it was marketed The Spanish ministry of Health , Social Services and Equality ordered for the tomatoes of Portugese origin which infected the young man , to be recalled and removed from stores and markets for safety reasons More than 7000 tons of tomatoes will therefore be ceased across the country by ministry inspectors and public safety officials The ministry also issued a public statement about the death of Mr Ramos in which it sends its condolences to his family and adds that it will immediately demand further research on the subject to determine if other genetically modified food products on the European market could represent a risk for the Spanish population Share191K Tweet '",false

"Michigan residents lost their right to farm this week thanks to a new ruling by the Michigan Commission of Agriculture and Rural Development Gail Philburn of the Michigan Sierra Club told Michigan Live , the new changes effectively remove Right to Farm Act protection for many urban and suburban backyard farmers raising small numbers of animals Backyard and urban farming were previously protected by Michigans Right to Farm Act The Commission ruled that the Right to Farm Act protections no longer apply to many homeowners who keep small numbers of livestock Kim White , who raises chickens and rabbits , said , They dont want us little guys feeding ourselves They want us to go all to the big farms They want to do away with small farms and I believe that is whats motivating it The ruling will allow local governments to arbitrarily ban goats , chickens and beehives on any property where there are 13 homes within one eighth mile or a residence within 250 feet of the property , according to Michigan Public Radio The Right to Farm Act was created in 1981 to protect farmers from the complaints of people from the city who moved to the country and then attempted to make it more urban with anti farming ordinances The new changes affect residents of rural Michigan too It is not simply an urban or suburban concern Shady Grove Farm in Gwinn , Michigan is the six and a half acre home to 150 egg laying hens that provide eggs to a local co op and a local restaurant The small Michigan farm also homes sheep for wool and a few turkeys and meat chickens to provide fresh healthy , local poultry We produce food with integrity , Randy Buchler told The Blaze about Shady Grove Farm Everything we do here is 100 percent natural we like to say its beyond organic We take a lot of pride and care in what were doing here Shady Grove Farm was doing its part to bring healthy , local , organic food to the tables of Gwinn residents , and it mirrors the attitudes of hundreds of other small farming operations in Michigan and thousands of others popping up around the nation The ruling comes within days of a report by The World Health Organization that stated the world is currently in grave danger of entering a post antibiotic era The WHOs director general Dr Margaret Chan argued that the antibiotic use in our industrialized food supply is the worst offender adding to the global crisis The Michigan Agriculture Commission passed up an opportunity to support one of the hottest trends in food in Michigan public demand for access to more local , healthy , sustainable food , Gail Philbin told MLive Meanwhile , neighboring Indiana Governor Mike Pence signed Senate Bill 179 a few weeks before which freed up poultry and egg sales from local and state regulation Yesterday , the USDA Secretary Tom Vilsack announced massive funding to support research about small and medium sized family farms , such as small farms ability to build up local and regional economic systems Theres a lot of unnecessary legal action being taken against small farms who are doing good things in their communities , said Randy Buchler , who is also on the board of directors for the Michigan Small Farm Council The Michigan Small Farm Council actively fought to support Michigan farming freedom , but ultimately the Commission voted to approve the new restrictions Farm Bureau has become another special interest beholden to big business and out of touch with small farmers , and constitutional and property rights of the little guy , Pine Hallow Farms wrote to the Michigan Small Farm Council The Michigan Farm Bureau endorsed the new regulatory changes Matthew Kapp , government relations specialist with Michigan Farm Bureau , told MLive that the members weighed in and felt that people raising livestock need to conform to local zoning ordinances The Farm Bureau did not feel Michigans Right To Farm Act was meant to protect the smaller farms , and ultimately the Michigan Commission of Agriculture and Rural Development agreed Photo courtesy of City Chickens Gone Country",false

"Says the health care reform bill was paid for , in part , by taking money from students and the student loan system Rob Portman on Saturday , April 28th , 2012 in a conference call with reportersRob Portman says student loan money was used to cover health care reformBy Stephen Koff on Monday , May 14th , 2012 at 6 00 a m Americans have their reasons for liking or disliking health care reform and its mandate to purchase insurance But Sen Rob Portman mentioned one that was new to us during a conference call with reporters He was actually talking about student loans , but in answer to a question from WSPD radio in Toledo , Portman said The truth is , by the way , you know part of the health care bill is paid for by the administration taking the difference of what \( interest rate \) they can borrow at , and what most students pay , and putting some of that money into the health care bill He repeated that we took from students and paid for a new entitlement program we ca n't afford And he rephrased it by saying the health care bill was paid for in part by taking money out of the student loan system Portman s comments , made April 28 , were in support of a Republican proposal to extend low interest student loan rates \( 3 4 percent \) for another year Republican lawmakers would do that by taking money out of the 2010 health care law , the Patient Protection and Affordable Care Act Specifically , the money would come from a fund in the health bill that covers prevention and public health We re not here to debate whether that s good policy But Portman , acknowledging Tennessee Sen Lamar Alexander s leadership role in the GOP proposal , suggested something fresh to our ears the notion that Obamacare , as it is commonly called , used student loan money PolitiFact Ohio decided to learn more Students once were considered a poor lending risk To prime the pump and expand educational opportunities , the federal government in 1965 decided to guarantee student loans against default The government also guaranteed a certain interest rate to the banks , even if the rates students paid were lower And the government paid additional fees to the banks for administration and collection of student loans This wound up providing a lucrative revenue stream for the banks , while putting millions of Americans through college But the system required billions of dollars in federal subsidies , and some in Washington , especially Democrats , started looking at alternatives What if the government cut out the middle man \( the banks \) and gave loans directly to students through their colleges financial aid offices \? Those offices already helped process most loans anyway By getting rid of the subsidies , the government could save billions and use the money for more financial aid for needy students , Democrats said Various pilot programs were tried Some universities , including Ohio State , said they liked dealing directly with the government But plenty of others liked the special attention private lenders gave them , and the private lenders spent millions lobbying Congress to keep the subsidy system This debate dragged on for years Then in early 2010 , Democrats found the opening they needed to permanently move away from subsidizing the lenders It coincided with passage of the Affordable Care Act The Senate generally needs 60 votes to overcome filibusters and objections to legislation Democrats lacked that number So they decided to employ a seldom used tactic involving budgets and government spending , known as reconciliation Reconciliation only requires 51 votes That s how Senate Democrats were able to pass a combined student loan health care bill , the Reconciliation Act of 2010 , on March 25 , 2010 , with 56 votes You might not have heard much about the student loan portion at the time , because health care , a monumental social initiative , consumed most of the oxygen in Washington But the two were connected through the reconciliation bill , which is where we come back to Portman s claim Did one component , student loans , help pay for health care \? The answer is not as simple as it sounds According to the Congressional Budget Office , the government was going to save 58 billion from the student loan program , over a 10 year period , by eliminating the middle man That would provide enough money to put an additional 36 billion into Pell grants and 3 billion more into several other programs , including Historically Black Colleges and Universities Even after these investments , the government would have 19 billion left , the CBO said So was this 19 billion going into Obamacare \? That s what Portman s press secretary , Christine Mangi , initially suggested when we first asked about Portman s statement The problem with that assumption is that the CBO did not show it that way It showed the 19 billion as savings , or a net reduction in the federal deficit And several budget experts we spoke with said that s exactly where the 19 billion was going The CBO also showed 124 billion in additional savings from the health care portion of the reconciliation act , thanks to new revenue , taxes and projected savings on Medicare Mangi was skeptical of this projection , as are other Republicans , saying the health care provisions are certain to cost much more than assumed in 2010 , wiping out any savings Where will the money come from then \? It ll come in part from the money the government got by changing its student loan program , she said She also noted that some private lenders used to provide interest rate reductions for borrowers , and new borrowers won t have that option That s speculation , however , and such private bank incentives to students became fewer after the 2008 financial crisis Still , we sought out budget and education officials on this , and then we called Alexander s office Alexander was secretary of education under President George H W Bush His staff referred us to other CBO figures , but that just led to more dispute among budget experts over how to interpret the numbers But then we found agreement from two key Senate offices on opposite sides of the aisle Alexander s office drew our attention to a statement made by Democratic Sen Tom Harkin of Iowa , a leader on education issues On March 23 , 2010 , on the Senate floor Harkin said that by ending the subsidies to banks , the government would have more money for Pell grants and historically black colleges He also said that 10 billion would go for debt reduction Notice that he said 10 billion \? But wait wasn t it supposed to be 19 billion , according to the CBO figures \? So where did the other 9 billion go \? It went to pay for a portion of health care reform , Alexander s staff insisted We turned to the staff of the Senate Health , Education , Labor and Pensions Committee , which Harkin chairs And at last , there was common ground Harkin indeed said 10 billion would go for debt reduction The other 9 billion , said committee spokeswoman Justine Sessions , went to help pay for expansion of community health centers , prescription drug access , and consumer protections in insurance That s 9 billion for health care out the student loan program With that , we return to Portman s claim that health care reform was paid for in part by taking money out of the student loan system Portman s statement is partially accurate The overall health care bill has hundreds of billions in features before revenue and tax offsets bring the costs down , if projections prove to be right We re not here to debate whether they will Nine billion dollars is a tiny share But Portman said in part , and that 9 billion is destined for health care , so he s right there But he suggested this is at the expense of students That s a big leap , leaving out important detail and context The combined student loan health care bill did not reduce the amount of money that students can borrow It actually expanded the amount of money available for student aid What it reduced is the banks share The money that was saved was n't money that was going into education it was money that was subsidizing private banks , Sessions , of the education committee , said in an email Period On the Truth O Meter , Portman s claim rates Half True Advertisement",false

"99 9 Of US Politicians Are Actual Psychopaths , New Study Reveals The new analysis ranked 48 continental states and the District of Columbia NeonNettle By Daniel Newton on 20th June 2018 2 30pm press The new analysis ranked 48 continental states and the District of Columbia A new study published by the Social Science Research Network has revealed that 99 9 of all politicians in the USA are actual psychopaths The question is , are politicians already psychopaths , or does the line of work change them as such \? The new analysis ranked 48 continental states and the District of Columbia by measuring the psychopathic personality of their residents The leader of the study , Ryan Murphy , told Newsweek These results are the first estimates we have , to the best of my knowledge , on the degree of psychopathy found in each state Murphy claimed that each state s ranking was computed on a previous study that ranked each state on the Big Five personality traits Agreeableness Extraversion Openness Conscientiousness neuroticism press According to Miamiherald com This was done by analyzing the results of personality surveys given to thousands of residents in each state People tended to have different levels of each of the Big 5 traits depending on where they lived That previous study , which was published in 2013 , aimed at separating the United States into broad regions of personality The states in the mid Atlantic and northeast were classified as temperamental and uninhibited Those in middle America were friendly and conventional , while those in the west coast , Rocky Mountains , and Sunbelt region were relaxed and creative Psychopaths tend to be extroverted and charming yet largely devoid of guilt , empathy , and love , according to Scientific American They do things purely for their own interests , have shallow relationships and place blame on others when things go wrong , according to the magazine Murphy used the data on personality from the previous study and used it to calculate a new score based on personality traits that indicated psychopathy , according to Quartz After all the number crunching , what was the top psychopath hotspot \? Washington D C The top five observations in psychopathy are the District of Columbia , Connecticut , California , New Jersey , and a tie of New York and Wyoming for fifth The states that are least psychopathic are West Virginia , Vermont , Tennessee , North Carolina , and New Mexico , Murphy wrote Murphy wrote that people should take the capitol s top spot with a little bit of skepticism press The D C area is small and entirely urban , so it is inherently different than comparing a state , which has a more diverse geography and population , he wrote Still , Murphy said in his study that the finding is consistent with a different study that found psychopaths are likely to be effective in the political sphere and could be tempted to work in the literal seat of power In general , Murphy writes that areas of the northeast are the most psychopathic , while rural areas are the least psychopathic , and that D C appears to be far more psychopathic on its own than any state in the country",false

There is really something strange about these guys , and we believe the CIA possibly knows more than what it is ready to admit The custom services have confirmed that the two men , who can t be identified due to the Intelligence Identities and Protection Act of 1982 , did carry valid CIA identifications and that the vehicle was indeed registered as a service vehicle of the organization The two men remain under the custody of the custom services at the moment , and are still being interrogated in a facility near El Paso They are facing charges of possessing , trafficking and importing illegal drugs , and could face other criminal charges once the investigation is over Both the FBI and the DEA have announced that they would collaborate with the U S Customs and Border Protection on this case , which as already attracted a lot of attention in Southern Texas",false
"GLOBAL PUBLIC ANNOUNCEMENT www 8march2003 com On this date an astounding discovery will be revealed to the world O n March 8th 2003 something extraordinary will be posted on this site S omething that could have Global implications S omething that will make you want to rethink your future My story Due to reasons you will come to understand as you read on I cannot reveal my identity at this time Some months ago while trekking through a mountain range on an amateur photo shoot during my holidays , my attention was taken by a glint of light from under a shrub I discovered it was the suns reflection off a piece of broken glass PHOTO glass lens By the curved polished surface on one side I thought it might have been from some type of magnifying lens I rummaged around under the shrub wondering if someone had dropped their binoculars , but instead , to my surprise I found a badly damaged camera lens I looked at the piece of glass in my hand It was a fragment from the shattered lens Beyond the shrub was a stony terrain that lead to the rock face of a sheer cliff towering high above the area I spotted some other parts of the lens scattered between the rocks Then I found the main body of the camera It was an Olympus OM40 SLR , which was in production during the early eighties The entire camera was smashed and covered in a silvery soot like powder , as if it had been thrown onto a fire Yet , on closer inspection , there was some oxidization on parts of the exposed metal casing It had obviously been there for quite some time PHOTO scorched camera PHOTO Back of camera My first thought was that someone must have dropped the camera from the top of the cliff causing it to shatter on the rocks below , and that there must have been a raging fire through the valley at some stage Taking a closer look at my surroundings there were no signs of recent fires Had someone tried to destroy the camera by burning it \? When I sniffed the soot it had a pungent explosives like smell to it I turned it over and wiped the film cartridge display window The hair on the back of my neck stood on end There was still film in the camera It was late evening by the time I arrived home some days later I 'd been having mysterious dreams about the camera every night since I found it Overwhelmed with curiosity and excited anticipation , I immediately took the camera to my darkroom I had to pry the back open with a screwdriver as the plastic section of the outer casing had melted then solidified over the cover Most of the film was badly damaged , parts of it having disintegrated due to extreme heat I developed the strips of film that were salvageable Nearly all of the negatives were color distorted The images on the film sent chills down my spine When I finally developed the photos and blew them up , I could n't believe what I was seeing It made me wonder what the hell was about to happen on the planet !

"Why the AR 15 keeps appearing at America 's deadliest mass shootingsWilliam Cummings and Bart JansenPublished 6 19 AM ET Thu , 15 Feb 2018USA TodayGeorge Frey Bloomberg Getty ImagesA man holds a Bushmaster AR 15 Model A2 semi automatic assault rifle at the Rocky Mountain Gun Show in Sandy , Utah A Las Vegas concert An Orlando night club An elementary school in Newtown , Conn A Texas church And now a high school in Parkland , Fla America 's most popular weapon was there for all of them AR 15 style rifles have increasingly appeared in American mass shootings , including the deadliest high school shooting in the nation 's modern history at Marjory Stoneman Douglas High School in Parkland , Fla , Wednesday More from USA Today Florida school shooting is the 6th to injure students this yearThe National Rifle Association has called the AR 15 the most popular rifle in America and estimates Americans own more than 8 million of them The NRA said the AR 15 has soared in popularity because it 's customizable , adaptable , reliable and accurate It is also versatile and can be used for sport shooting , hunting and self defense situations , the NRA said , adding the ability to personalize so many of the rifle 's components is one of the things that makes it so unique The Brady Campaign to Prevent Gun Violence said the AR 15 , a civilian model of the military 's M 16 , also cited the weapon 's versatility in evaluating its popularity They 're accurate and they can basically shoot as quickly as you can pull the trigger , according to a campaign statement Along those lines , they 're very customizable most average people can figure out how to install accessories like forward trigger grips that let you hold the gun at waist height and spray bullets while stabilizing the gun , laser sights , and you can add high capacity magazines But Dean Hazen , owner of The Gun Experts in Mahomet , Ill , and a master firearms instructor , said the reason mass shooters are turning to the AR 15 is due to a copy cat mentality more than any feature of the rifle It 's really just a perception thing , Hazen said There are rifles that are more powerful and more dangerous than that , but they 're not being used Hazen said the AR 15 has gotten a bad rap He believes mass shooters generally do n't know much about guns and choose the AR 15 because of the reputation it has gotten from being used in other mass shootings Thank God they do n't know any better because if they did they would use much more effective weapons , Hazen said Here is a list of mass shootings in the U S that

"PrintIt isn t known if schools in America are installing holy water fonts next to the classroom doors , although they are small , plastic , inexpensive , and unobtrusive , nor is it known if Christian students are now allowed 20 seconds a day to say Grace before lunch , and there is little evidence that school districts have made the switch to Kosher foods to accommodate the dietary restrictions of Jewish students The St Cloud , Minnesota school district , however , is devoting its resources to providing accommodations to Muslim students based solely on the basis of their religion , which under the current interpretation of the Establishment clause of the First Amendment , would be impermissible for Christian or Jewish students or Hindu , Buddhist or pagan students , either The accommodations come as a result of a federal lawsuit filed in 2011 by the Council of American Islamic Relations \( CAIR \) alleging that the school district had created a hostile environment for Muslim students Somalis are the fastest growing group of residents in St Cloud , a small city of 65 , 000 in central Minnesota comprising approximately 20 percent of the school district s 10 , 000 students Now Muslims students are not only given time both in class and in private rooms for prayer , which is required by their faith , but providing prayer rugs for them to use free of charge courtesy of the taxpayers The practice , which comes during the school day , disrupts classroom activities and leaves non Muslim students confused and resentful that they do not have an excuse to leave the classroom and be dismissed early on Friday , while forcing teachers to design lesson plans and manage the classroom schedule so that mandatory activities like tests and presentations do not conflict with Muslim prayer time The school district has also taken steps of hiring full time staff members to navigate cultural differences , but the efforts have been directed at non Muslims One staff member said teachers needed to be educated to understand that Somali students do not make eye contact as a sign of respect , rather than helping students become comfortable looking others in the eye , a basic communication skill that will help them form friendships , fit in on sports teams , and eventually in jobs and careers where they live now",false
"Monica Lewinsky was having a visit with a friend from high school this week that ended in tragedy Just moments ago , Freedom Crossroads Correspondent Louis Leweigh confirmed that The coroner just left the scene where Monica Lewinsky , who we now know never ended her affair with Clinton , was found murdered in a burglary Police Chief Randall Getty told Leweigh Pretty cut and dry We have a suspect we think we have on several area cameras who is a known pot addict He s been in and out of jail more than a dozen times for possession We re looking at him and we re also considering because of the high profile nature of the case other suspects like the Clintons When Louis asked him if the feds would take over he said that every protocol has changed for the past few months but he s fairly certain anything that has to do with anyone named Clinton will be on the Justice Department s radar In this case , to not investigate would be silly Chief Getty felt pretty strongly that his pothead was the culprit He may have seen or heard something that can t be released yet If that turns out to be true , the feds need to investigate this pot addict and find out just how much he was paid to be a patsy The cause of death is still unknown This is a developing story that will be updated",false
"In the wake of massacres similar to Wednesday s school shooting in Parkland , Fla , a small number of states have passed red flag laws that allow the seizure of guns before people can commit acts of violence California , Washington , Oregon , Indiana and Connecticut have statutes that can be used to temporarily take guns away from people a judge deems a threat to themselves or others Lawmakers in 18 other states including Florida plus the District of Columbia have proposed similar measures At the federal level , Rep Salud Carbajal \( D Calif \) and Sen Dianne Feinstein \( D Calif \) introduced legislation last May that would encourage states to adopt the approach Mental illness , escalating threats , substance abuse and domestic violence are among the circumstances in which a judge can order weapon restrictions under the statutes This morning I heard the sheriff in Parkland lament the fact that he did not have the tools to remove the firearms from the shooter , Joshua Horwitz , executive director of the Coalition to Stop Gun Violence , said Thursday The nation s patchwork of federal and state gun laws mainly involves background checks and actions to prevent people who pose a threat from buying firearms The approach of the red flag laws is to seize guns from people who have them and to restrict their access until they are no longer deemed dangerous We think of this as a new frontier , said Jonas Oransky , deputy legal director of Everytown for Gun Safety , an advocacy group founded in 2014 We don t have a perfect system in this country , and we can t stop every act of gun violence The laws allow family members or law enforcement officers to ask a judge for a gun violence restraining order or an extreme risk protection order against someone who behaves the way 19 year old Nikolas Cruz , the alleged Florida gunman , did in recent years According to news reports , Cruz killed squirrels with a pellet gun , trained his dogs to attack a neighbor s piglets , posted on Insta gram about guns and killing animals and eventually threatened at least one teen He showed signs of depression and had been treated at a mental health clinic Authorities say Cruz used an AR 15 assault style rifle to kill 17 people and wound at least 15 others at Marjory Stoneman Douglas High School on Wednesday Cruz has been charged with 17 counts of premeditated murder In an Everytown study of mass shootings from 2009 to 2016 , 42 percent of the attackers had shown warning signs of violent behavior In most situations , however , the danger is suicide , not homicide When Duke University researchers looked at the application of Connecticut s red flag law between 1999 and 2013 , they found that police served 762 so called risk warrants during that period and estimated that a gun suicide was prevented for every 10 to 20 seizures The police found guns in 99 percent of the cases in which they served the warrants , seizing an average of seven firearms from each person Twenty one people went on to commit suicide anyway , six by firearms Overall , suicides account for about 60 percent of gun deaths in the United States The National Alliance on Mental Illness has no formal position on red flag laws , according to Ron Honberg , a senior policy adviser for the organization , but hopes to see more states adopt them It creates some mechanism to intervene at a particular point in time when a person may be in bad shape , Honberg said Is it going to be 100 percent effective \? In the three Western states with such laws , all adopted since 2014 , a family member or law enforcement officer must petition a court about someone who appears to be a threat Relatives often go to the police and ask them to do so , experts said A judge can quickly order the weapons surrendered if convinced of the threat Within a few weeks , a full hearing is held on longer term restrictions , which can last a year Judges must allow people who want their weapons back to revisit the ruling In Connecticut , only law enforcement agents can ask for a risk warrant And in Indiana , law enforcement can confiscate weapons without a judge s order The gun owner must ask the court to get the weapons returned States have long prohibited some convicted felons and people committed involuntarily from having firearms At least seven states last year passed laws restricting access to guns for people convicted of misdemeanor domestic violence crimes , and three require that offenders turn their guns in Horwitz and Oransky said the National Rifle Association and other members of the gun lobby have not put up much opposition to the statutes We would be happy if they came to the table and were supportive of those laws , Oransky said",false

I love biscuits , Mars bars , and all things chocolate so these were heaven in a pod to me I'm not quite sure what it is but minature products seem to really appeal to me , when I saw these tasty looking morsels in a combination of my 3 most favourite things there was no questioning over whether or not I was to try them The fact there were 40 to a box made me not feel so guilty , as I portioned them out into bags of 5 which seemed just the right number to hit that sweet sugar craving The crisp biscuit shell was the perfect thickness and texture with just the right amount of crunch to them The caramel was smooth and flowing , with a creamy , rich taste The caramel is a bit runnier in consistency than that of the standard Mars but to fair I do actually prefer my caramel to be this way Topped with thick creamy chocolate these are perfect I have served these up at Christmas before and they are always so quick to go , my family absolutely loves them They make a perfect sweet treat for a lunch box and a great snack for watching a movie or sports match , grab a handful and your good to go \( Alex \) Dated 1st of June , 2014 Review by alexmoulton This Review 6 8 10 Taste Portions Uniqueness Personal Choice Out of the 3 flavours I had tried , this was the one that I had the highest expectations for Mars bars , were always my favourite compared to Twix and Snickers That being said , I prefered Milky Way 's compared to Mars Bars , because despite how much I enjoyed the flavour , the Mars Bars , were big enough , that I 'd be over the sweetness by the end of it Milky Way 's were small enough to enjoy without overdoing it But its the nougat that I have always enjoyed the most in chocolate bars , It was light and fluffy , compared with the thick , rich , intense flavour of the caramel Which is why I was let down by these Pods , While the flavour was less intense than the Twix and Snickers flavours , it was still too sweet and sickening for me It was okay for a few , but I would never be able to eat a packet that big , so it is wasteful Without the separation of nougat and caramel , it just did n't appeal to me I am still curious to try the Bounty Bars Pods , as I do love the coconut bars , and their lack of caramel may provide a flavour that I will enjoy , but I will have to wait and see These Pods just did n't do anything for me \( Samantha \) Dated 30th of August , 2013 Review by samantha203 This Review 9 0 10 Taste Portions Uniqueness Personal Choice I had never tried these before despite the fact they had been around for so many years , I only heard of them by seeing the reviews on KIWIreviews ! I decided I had to try them as they had such great reviews and was real gutted that I could n't find any bounty ones as bounty is my favourite chocolate bar of all time My choice because of that was these Mars bar ones I was impressed by the taste , which was a crispy biscuit shell filled with yummy mars bar I found the caramel was a bit more free flowing than in a normal mars bar but that did n't bother me because I love caramel The chocolate had that great mars bar quality They are quite a good size for a quick snack for a chocolate fix being so bite sized you can have a relatively guilt free handful The only complaint I have is there is just not enough in a pack , because they are just so moreish and after sharing around you are left wanting more , more , more Overall a great product although I really would like to try the Bounty ones ! \( Karyn \) Dated 21st of December , 2012 Review by flabbergastered This Review 3 3 10 Taste Portions Uniqueness Personal Choice Gosh from reading the other reviews about this product I must be the only one out there who does n't like them ! ! I have never bought my own packet of Pods but have tried them on a couple of occasions at friends parties or work shouts , and I ca n't say they are anything special and I am a fan of both biscuits and Mars bars ! ! But put these two ingredients together and I can happily turn these Pods down I do n't really understand the concept of them and maybe that is the problem , but I woud n't go out of my way to look for these at the supermarket or even recommend them to family or friends I have n't tried these in a few years and maybe my tastes may have changed but for now I ca n't give a raving review on Pods \( Jo \) Dated 14th of April , 2012 Review by jopukeko This Review 8 8 10 Taste Portions Uniqueness Personal Choice A few years ago when Mars first introduced Pods it seemed like I could n't go to a gathering without someone providing some Everyone was talking about them and of course I had to try them They are definitely are party food They are in a packet that is made for sharing They come in a sealed bag inside a box I am thankful they are packaged like this as there are a few crumbs in the bottom of the bag but would be even more it there was n't a double layer of protection Unlike other Mars products they are not individually wrapped and look great in a small bowl The biscuit base meant that the pods were not as sweet as most chocolate treats There are several other varieties to try but the mars one remains my favourite They are an expensive way to enjoy what is essentially a chocolate biscuit but great when you need to take something to a party and have no time or energy to prepare a plate \( Rosie \) Dated 8th of April , 2012 Review by rosielee3 This Review 10 10 Taste Portions Uniqueness Personal Choice Mars Pods are the king of biscuits and chocolate treats ! The hard shell that encases the Mars filling is the perfect thickness and the Mars filling is not too sweet , nor too sickly I really like that these are unique and still there is nothing in the market that is remotely similar to pods I find it hard to locate Mars Pods these days , but i was an avid buyer of these a few years back The price of them seems accurate in accordance to the size Pods go under the mantra of once you pop you ca n't stop so make sure you have a friend to share with ! \( Tess \) Dated 8th of April , 2012 Review by tessak This Review 9 0 10 Taste Portions Uniqueness Personal Choice Mars pods the ingenious combination of mars and bikkie in one and these are so good Chocolaty , bite sized , light and crunchy 'pods' full of flavor that wont let you down And best of all they are a nice little price that will not break the bank , which is a good thing , because once you start you cant sop eating these delightful little morsels And best of all they come in more other flavors , so you wont get bored Pods are great as snack for when your feeling a little peckish , and a definite must have for movie or games nights too \( Kym \) Dated 15th of January , 2012 Review by kymmage This Review 9 0 10 Taste Portions Uniqueness Personal Choice I was first introduced to Mars Pods at a party , where they sat in a bowl next to the chips and dip Everyone wanted to try one and as a result of the sheer guest volume , I only got one However , it was a delicious morsel The next time I saw them was at the movie theatres \( not sure why I blanked on them being in supermarkets \) but it became a little tradition for me and my daughter , that we would attend movies and eat pods Eventually I did find them in the supermarket , and often have a bag of them in my purse just in case of an adventure trip to the movies \( I know , I know \) We get a bit of popcorn now as well , but pods have always been a favourite I think it 's partly the wafer bottom , the odd UFO shape , and of course the chocolatey yumminess hiding inside They taste just like a Mars bar , only feel less naughty because you can have a bite , two , three you get the picture though to be far I dont remember a time when we have opened a pack and found any left at the end Thank goodness they only come out as treat food ! We have only tried the Mars ones , would love to find the Bounty ones but have never had the pleasure And as for the Snickers ones , I have had many years of not eating nuts due to pregnancy , breastfeeding and then a fusspot daughter who does n't eat peanuts \( just smooth peanut butter \) , so that rules that flavour out Mars Pods are definitely our Pods ! \( Janine \) Dated 18th of May , 2010 Review by angel7801 This Review 8 5 10 Taste Portions Uniqueness Personal Choice Mars pods are awesome Great flavour Great price very unique idea Great for chocoholics Approx 40 per packet of delicious bite size pieces of creamy caramel with a nice biscuit crust and pure chocolate topping What more could you want \? A mouthful of gooey bliss in each bite They are very addictive You cant just eat one \( Andrew \) Dated 18th of March , 2010 Review by monkeyspoon This Review 10 10 Taste Portions Uniqueness Personal Choice With mars bar being my favourite chocolate bar , I decided trying mars pods would be a great idea and it was It comes with a fair price and a lot of flavour The combination of biscuit shell , mars bar centre and topped with chocolate , makes for a snack for serious snackers Though one box is plenty for most I would be inclined to by at least two at once So if you want a snack to share with friends and family or something full of taste to pig out on , I reccomend the mars flavour PODS \( Amanda \) Dated 26th of August , 2007 Review by mandaz79 This Review 8 5 10 Taste Portions Uniqueness Personal Choice I have tried all the PODS \( I think \) I love them all ! !

With a deeper chocolate flavour than the Twix ones , these are good if you want the chocolate rush Personally , I doubt that I would eat too many in one sitting , as I'm not a huge chocolate fan , but great to have there to nibble on \) \( Marcus \) Dated 23rd of June , 2005 Review by testbot This Review 9 8 10 Taste Portions Uniqueness Personal Choice Of all of the Pods flavours , this one is my favourite I used to be an avid muncher of Mars bars , until my doctor warned me that so much sugar would give me diabetes I had to cut right back then These are biscuits I would eat , but not to any great extent , I have lost a lot of my 'sweet tooth' in the last few years But I know that if I still craved sugar the way I used to , these would be what I would happily sit in front of the TV , slap on a movie , and munch down by the box load \( Wayne \) Dated 23rd of June , 2005 Review by mr wayne This Review 8 3 10 Taste Portions Uniqueness Personal Choice Having eaten four boxes of these things I can safely say that i know what they taste like I can also say that I feel rather ill but that is beside the point At first they struck me as rather gimicky without the long term appeal of more classical chocolate treats , that they should have been bigger and more buscuit like and with more filling This view has been altered after extensive testing and thinking about where you would have cause to eat them As far as a sit down and munch out on them snack with a movie they are not perfect , as after about half a dozen you do n't want any more as they are quite sweet , even more so than normal chocolates thanks to the cereal like biscuit outer However they make up for this thanks to the novelty value gained from trying to eat all the biscuit first or trying to separate the two peices \( like pulling apart liqorice allsorts \) I am of the opinion that they would be best suited towards a dinner party of some description , as they would fit in amongst the crackers and cheeses as well as the chips and pineapple pieces on sticks , small and interesting to tide you over till dinner This I think is reenforced by the fact that they are packaged in a box rather than in a bag , even if this is just to protect the fragile pieces it elevates them to classy snack status , like those chocolate wafer sticks and magnum icecreams Pods are a tasty treat , but not to be overdone , enjoy a few with a cup of \( insert ridiculously named coffee beverage \) and enjoy the moment safe in the knowledge that you are far trendier than anyone else in the vicinity Or impress your friends and collegues with pre dinner nibbles and knock off the Jones' for First Place on the neighbourhood coolest dinner party list For you ease and convenience I have ranked each flavour in terms of my preference I'm not saying that this is The Be All and End All to these Flavours , it 's just my opinion Pods are labelled as Ingeniously Crunchy and while they are definately crunchy the ingenious part remains to be seen , they may not be my cup of tea , but then I do n't drink tea either Mars Pods The Mars bar , malt and chocolate overload , and the only competition for a moro These pods had a dark biscuit shell and tasted just like a mars bar , easier to eat than the twix with a richer flavour I got through 8 before I felt ill , which is better than the 5 twix it took , still very sweet but the nicer flavour meant that they only just missed out on the top spot but it was close , very close \( Hayden \) Dated 22nd of June , 2005 Review by boggie This Review 9 5 10 Taste Portions Uniqueness Personal Choice Two words to describe num nums !

Clinton Foundation CEO Braverman s efforts to establish normalcy within this criminal enterprise completely failed leading to what many believe was his ouster as his contract ran to 2017 and a shocking campaign of hatred against Chelsea Clinton too as evidenced by a Wikileaks released secret email showing top Hillary and Bill Clinton operatives saying about her she is acting like a spoiled brat kid who has nothing else to do but create issues to justify what she 's doing because she , as she has said , has n't found her way and has a lack of focus in her life Though Chelsea Clinton may have , indeed , not found her way in cleaning up the corrupt Clinton Foundation , this report continues , CEO Braverman was being confronted by an avalanche of it he was unable to stop , or even control and as Wikileaks released secret emails prove with the stunning revelation that Hillary Clinton accepted a 12 million bribe for favors from the King of Morocco , after which CEO Braverman left Most shocking of all in this SC report is its detailing through the Wikileaks release of secret Clinton emails that the mainstream US television news giant NBC had previously been warned to follow the money and find the real HRC scandal but with them being one of Hillary Clinton s media propaganda arms , they have not told the American people about This report concludes with an interesting addendum attached by the FSI speculating that Braverman may not actually want asylum as his actions seem more reliable credible of a person seeking to protect themselves by publicity as he did not request \( as is common \) anonymity from Russian consulate officials and has led to turmoil in the Kremlin as to what to do with some officials saying it s enough to just release this information without granting asylum , and that should it be granted , would create just another American accusation that Russia is trying to control the outcome of the US election while at the same time Hillary Clinton is using anti Russia red baiting at a level not seen since days of McCarthyism And though not mentioned in this report , it is , also , interesting to note that in the United States where one of Hillary Clinton s top aides secretly , and stunningly , admitted that the US economy is so bad that people are in despair about things are , and yet another Bill Clinton mistress \( nicknamed by the Secret Service as the Energizer Bunny \) has been revealed , and the shocking revelation that the Clinton s gave 675 , 000 to the wife of the FBI official investigating her , and Hillary Clinton being caught saying If that f ing bastard wins , we all hang from nooses ! the corrupt propagandist American mainstream media continues to outrageously manipulate the polls to show she is winning and that

"Alaska Fish Wildlife News September 2003 Lemming Suicide Myth Disney Film Faked Bogus Behavior By Riley Woodford Lemmings do not commit mass suicide It 's a myth , but it 's remarkable how many people believe it Ask a few It 's a complete urban legend , said state wildlife biologist Thomas McDonough I think it blew out of proportion based on a Disney documentary in the '50s , and that brought it to the mainstream Lemmings are a kind of short tailed vole , a mouse like rodent that favors tundra and open grasslands Three kinds are found in Alaska , including the collared lemming , the only rodent that turns white in winter In 1958 Walt Disney produced White Wilderness , part of the studio 's True Life Adventure series White Wilderness featured a segment on lemmings , detailing their strange compulsion to commit mass suicide According to a 1983 investigation by Canadian Broadcasting Corporation producer Brian Vallee , the lemming scenes were faked The lemmings supposedly committing mass suicide by leaping into the ocean were actually thrown off a cliff by the Disney filmmakers The epic lemming migration was staged using careful editing , tight camera angles and a few dozen lemmings running on snow covered lazy Susan style turntable White Wilderness was filmed in Alberta , Canada , a landlocked province , and not on location in lemmings' natural habitat There are about 20 lemming species found in the circumpolar north but evidently not in that area of Alberta So the Disney people bought lemmings from Inuit children a couple provinces away in Manitoba and staged the whole sequence In the lemming segment , the little rodents assemble for a mass migration , scamper across the tundra and ford a tiny stream as narrator Winston Hibbler explains that , A kind of compulsion seizes each tiny rodent and , carried along by an unreasoning hysteria , each falls into step for a march that will take them to a strange destiny That destiny is to jump into the ocean As they approach the sea , \( actually a river more tight cropping \) Hibbler continues , They 've become victims of an obsession a one track thought Move on ! Move on ! The pack of lemmings reaches the final precipice This is the last chance to turn back , Hibbler states Yet over they go , casting themselves out bodily into space Life loving lemming lemmings do not commit mass suicide , although in lean times they may become cannibalistic These mouse like rodents are found in Alaska and in northern countries around the world , mostly favoring tundra and open grassland Lemmings are seen flying into the water The final shot shows the sea awash with dying lemmings Certainly , some scenes in nature documentaries are staged In Sir David Attenborough 's recent documentary , The Life of Birds , the close up footage of a flying duck , filmed razor sharp from the bird 's wingtip , was shot from a car using a mallard drake trained to fly alongside the car But faking an entirely mythical event is something else Disney had to have gotten that idea from somewhere , said Thomas McDonough , the state wildlife biologist Disney likely confused dispersal with migration , he added , and embellished a kernel of truth Lemming populations fluctuate enormously based on predators , food , climate and other factors Under ideal conditions , in a single year a population of voles can increase by a factor of ten When they 've exhausted the local food supply , they disperse , as do moose , beaver and many other animals Lemmings can swim and will cross bodies of water in their quest for greener pastures Sometimes they drown Dispersal and accidental death is a far cry from the instinctive , deliberate mass suicide depicted in White Wilderness , but Hibbler explains that life is tough in the lemmings' weird world of frozen chaos The voice over implies that lemmings take the plunge every seven to ten years to alleviate overpopulation What people see is essentially mass dispersal , said zoologist Gordon Jarrell , an expert in small mammals with the University of Alaska Fairbanks Sometimes it 's pretty directional The classic example is in the Scandinavian mountains , where \( lemmings \) have been dramatically observed They will come to a body of water and be temporarily stopped , and eventually they 'll build up along the shore so dense and they will swim across If they get wet to the skin , they 're essentially dead There 's no question that at times they will build up to huge numbers , Jarrell added One description from Barrow does talk about them drowning and piling up on the shore Jarrell said when people learn that he works with lemmings , the mass suicide issue often comes up It 's a frequent question , he said 'Do they really kill themselves \? ' No The answer is unequivocal , no they do n't Receive a monthly notice about new issues and articles",true

The children answered , some via a teacher translating from Spanish to English The children are usually distraught when they arrive , Trump was told by officials , but when they see the environment , they start relaxing Basic needs are taken care of showers , clothing , food , medical care The first 24 hours are crucial , a staff member told the first lady How children are processed JUST WATCHED

such as this one remain there for approximately 58 days , receiving medical , dental , vision and psychological care , as well as what the official described as the ability to be inside a safe and happy environment The official emphasized the predominant mission at this stage of the process , for unaccompanied children is to place them back with appropriate sponsors Those sponsors can be their parents , if the parents are not involved in the judicial or criminal process or they can be other approved family members already living inside the United States If neither of those options is possible , which is the case in about 10 of the unaccompanied children , they are placed with vetted foster families or volunteers All of this information was something the first lady wanted to learn in person , said Grisham , who told the media Trump informed her staff and her husband , President Donald Trump that she had decided she needed to see for herself the family intake and unaccompanied children facilities The facilities have dominated the news for days on end , causing heated political battles from the White House to Capitol Hill , ricocheting around the world in an uproar of disbelief and consternation A readout of the trip from the White House on Thursday night included this statement from the first lady Today 's visit impacted me greatly I was very impressed with the center and the hardworking staff and leadership there and thank them for all of their hard work The children were eager to learn and were kind and in good spirits Spending time with them reinforces the fact that these kids are in this situation as a direct result of adult actions It is my hope that Members of Congress will finally reach across the aisle and work together to solve this problem with common sense immigration reform that secures our borders and keeps families together How it came together 'I'm headed down to Texas , ' is what Grisham said the first lady told her husband , and he was supportive Grisham confirmed the trip would have taken place whether or not the President had signed an executive order on Wednesday intended to stop the separations This was 100 her idea , said Grisham of Trump 's decision to travel to McAllen , making clear the first lady is not on a mission assigned by the President nor is she acting as his emissary She wanted to come down The first lady intends to inform the President of what she sees She will continue to update her husband , said Grisham , confirming what was reported first Wednesday by CNN , that the first lady had been lobbying the President behind the scenes , encouraging him to stop the separation of children as swiftly as possible , either via legislative process or executive power The latter was ultimately the route the President chose , in a stunning reversal of his previous rhetoric As with many topics she will continue to give her husband her opinions , Grisham said Like most of the country , the first lady has been watching media reports about children taken from their parents and placed in holding facilities It is unclear what , exactly , Trump intends to accomplish from this visit to Texas , outside of seeing firsthand what is happening Since becoming first lady , Trump has said she wants to champion helping children , yet has been for the most part vague about how exactly she intends to accomplish her goal In May , Trump unveiled her Be Best platform , which outlined three predominant avenues of focus health and well being kindness and safety online , and highlighting the effects of the opioid crisis on children and families",true

already hit the salary and overtime allowance meant to last the entire year USA TODAY Secret Service agents walk the parade route as President Donald J Trump 's motorcade moves along \( Photo Robert Hanashiro , USA TODAY \) 300186 CONNECT TWEET 574 LINKEDIN 1638 COMMENT EMAIL MORE WASHINGTON The Secret Service can no longer pay hundreds of agents it needs to carry out an expanded protective mission in large part due to the sheer size of President Trump 's family and efforts necessary to secure their multiple residences up and down the East Coast Secret Service Director Randolph Tex Alles , in an interview with USA TODAY , said more than 1 , 000 agents have already hit the federally mandated caps for salary and overtime allowances that were meant to last the entire year The agency has faced a crushing workload since the height of the contentious election season , and it has not relented in the first seven months of the administration Agents must protect Trump who has traveled almost every weekend to his properties in Florida , New Jersey and Virginia and his adult children whose business trips and vacations have taken them across the country and overseas The president has a large family , and our responsibility is required in law , '' Alles said I ca n't change that I have no flexibility '' Alles said the service is grappling with an unprecedented number of White House protectees Under Trump , 42 people have protection , a number that includes 18 members of his family That 's up from 31 during the Obama administration Overwork and constant travel have also been driving a recent exodus from the Secret Service ranks , yet without congressional intervention to provide additional funding , Alles will not even be able to pay agents for the work they have already done The compensation crunch is so serious that the director has begun discussions with key lawmakers to raise the combined salary and overtime cap for agents , from 160 , 000 per year to 187 , 000 for at least the duration of Trump 's first term But even if such a proposal was approved , about 130 veteran agents would not be fully compensated for hundreds of hours already amassed , according to the agency I do n't see this changing in the near term , '' Alles said Both Republican and Democratic lawmakers expressed deep concern for the continuing stress on the agency , first thrust into turmoil five years ago with disclosures about sexual misconduct by agents in Colombia and subsequent White House security breaches A special investigative panel formed after a particularly egregious 2014 White House breach also found that that agents and uniform officers worked an unsustainable number of hours , '' which also contributed to troubling attrition rates While about 800 agents and uniformed officers were hired during the past year as part of an ongoing recruiting blitz to bolster the ranks , attrition limited the agency 's net staffing gain to 300 , according to agency records And last year , Congress had to approve a one time fix to ensure that 1 , 400 agents would be compensated for thousands of hours of overtime earned above compensation limits Last year 's compensation shortfall was first disclosed by USA TODAY It is clear that the Secret Service 's demands will continue to be higher than ever throughout the Trump administration , '' said Jennifer Werner , a spokesperson for Maryland Rep Elijah Cummings Cummings , the ranking Democrat on the House Oversight and Government Reform Committee who was the first lawmaker to sound the alarm after last year 's disclosure that hundreds of agents had maxed out on pay , recently spoke with Alles and pledged support for a more permanent fix , Werner said We cannot expect the Secret Service to be able to recruit and keep the best of the best if they are not being paid for these increases \( in overtime hours \) South Carolina Rep Trey Gowdy , the Republican chairman of the House oversight panel , is working with other committees of jurisdiction to explore ways in which we can best support'' the Secret Service , his spokesperson Amanda Gonzalez said Talks also are underway in the Senate , where the Secret Service has briefed members of the Homeland Security Committee , which directly oversees the the agency 's operations Ensuring the men and women who put their lives on the line protecting the president , his family and others every day are getting paid fairly for their work is a priority , '' said Missouri Sen Claire McCaskill , the panel 's top Democrat I'm committed to working with my colleagues on both sides to get this done '' Without some legislative relief , though , at least 1 , 100 agents for now would not be eligible for overtime even as one of the agency 's largest protective assignments looms next month Nearly 150 foreign heads of state are expected to converge on New York City for the United Nations General Assembly Because of the sheer number of high level dignitaries , the United Nations gathering is traditionally designated by the U S , as a National Special Security Event and requires a massive deployment of security resources managed by the Secret Service That will be even trickier this year Normally , we are not this tapped out , '' said Alles , whom Trump appointed to his post in April The agents who have reached their compensation limits this year represent about a third of the Secret Service workforce , which was pressed last year to secure both national political conventions in the midst of a rollicking campaign cycle The campaign featured regular clashes involving protesters at Trump rallies across the country , prompting the Secret Service at one point to erect bike racks as buffers around stages to thwart potential rushes from people in the crowd Officials had hoped that the agency 's workload would normalize after the inauguration , but the president 's frequent weekend trips , his family 's business travel and the higher number of protectees has made that impossible Since his inauguration , Trump has taken seven trips to his estate in Mar a Lago , Fla , traveled to his Bedminster , N J , golf club five times and returned to Trump Tower in Manhattan once Trump 's frequent visits to his winter White House and summer White House are especially challenging for the agency , which must maintain a regular security infrastructure at each while still allowing access to paying members and guests Always costly in manpower and equipment , the president 's jaunts to Mar a Lago are estimated to cost at least 3 million each , based on a General Accounting Office estimate for similar travel by former President Obama The Secret Service has spent some 60 , 000 on golf cart rentals alone this year to protect Trump at both Mar a Lago and Bedminster The president , First Lady Melania Trump and the couple 's youngest son Barron who maintained a separate detail in Trump Tower until June are n't the only ones on the move with full time security details in tow Trump 's other sons , Trump Organization executives Donald Jr and Eric , based in New York , also are covered by security details , including when they travel frequently to promote Trump branded properties in other countries A few examples Earlier this year , Eric Trump 's business travel to Uruguay cost the Secret Service nearly 100 , 000 just for hotel rooms Other trips included the United Kingdom and the Dominican Republic In February , both sons and their security details traveled to Vancouver , British Columbia , for the opening of new Trump hotel there , and to Dubai to officially open a Trump International Golf Club In March , security details accompanied part of the family , including Ivanka Trump and husband Jared Kushner on a skiing vacation in Aspen , Colo Even Tiffany Trump , the president 's younger daughter , took vacations with her boyfriend to international locales such as Germany and Hungary , which also require Secret Service protection Secret Service agents rush Republican presidential candidate Donald Trump off the stage at a campaign rally in Reno , Nev , on Nov 5 , 2016 \( Photo John Locher , AP \) While Alles has characterized the security challenges posed by the Trump administration as a new reality of the agency 's mission , the former Marine Corps major general said he has discussed the agency 's

"12 52 p m April 7 , 2015Getting his Republican friends and supporters to say this was all a misunderstanding does not change the fact that Rep Hurd was appointed to the committee and that he himself is the one who said he was quitting the committee to focus on other committees If anyone mischaracterized the events it 's Rep Hurd I think any rational person would think that if this was all a clerical error then you would expect that to be stated in the letter Instead of just saying it was a clerical error , he gave an entirely different reason If anyone here was being dishonest , it 's Rep Hurd But I would also add that I find it incredibly difficult to believe that Rep Hurd and his staff only found out about the appointment from a committee press release on 1 23 The Congressional Record from the 1 13 , the day that committees were announced , lists Hurd as being on the small biz cmte It was announced on the House floor , approved by unanimous consent and printed in the record Here 's the link and I also attached as a pdf http thomas loc gov cgi bin query D \? r114 3 temp r114zfJ0fa That does n't prove or disprove our statement but , considering how much anticipation there is for committee assignments , I find it completely implausible to believe that neither Rep Hurd nor any member of his staff either saw the announcement on the House floor or read the congressional record So perhaps he was appointed in error but this was not a typo on a press release all the things we said were true according the the record , he clearly was in fact appointed to the committee , and according to his own letter , he did resign and he did give as his reason a desire to focus on his other committees",true
"Flashback Obama HHS Placed Migrant Children Into Custody Of Human Traffickers 1 01 AM 06 18 2018 Kerry Picket Reporter The Obama administration handed off an unknown number of migrant minors into the custody of human traffickers under the assumption that these so called caregivers were related to the children In the wake of the current debate over how to handle illegal aliens who claim asylum while crossing the border with children in tow , supporters of tighter border controls point to issues related to not knowing whether the children are indeed sons and daughters of the border crossers Previous reports say the federal government already had a poor record of placing these children in dangerous environments during the Obama administration The Associated Press reported two years ago that in April 2014 the U S Department of Health and Human Services relaxed its safety standards to promptly move migrant children out of government shelters and into sponsors homes when waves of illegal aliens surged across the southern border However , according to the AP s reporting , the lowered standards resulted in children landing in unsafe homes where they were sexually assaulted , starved or forced to work for little or no pay The AP found almost 30 children who were placed with caregivers who exposed them to sexual abuse , labor trafficking , abuse or neglect HHS lowered standards by ceasing required fingerprinting of much of the adults claiming children as theirs In April 2014 , HHS ceased asking for original copies of birth certificates from most sponsors to prove who they were In May 2014 , the AP noted , HHS stopped filling out forms that asked for sponsors identifying information prior to placing any of the children in the sponsors residence Finally , the agency ended FBI background checks of the caregivers they were sending the migrant children to HHS estimated that around 90 , 000 migrant children were placed into sponsor care between 2013 and 2015 , but the agency did not know how many of those children were trafficked because the department failed to keep track of them after their placement Following the AP s piece on the matter , the Senate Committee on Homeland Security and Government Affairs released a 56 page report on Protecting Unaccompanied Alien Children from Trafficking and Other Abuses The report urged HHS to roll back the loosening of safety standards by the agency and bring back fingerprinting and background checks of potential sponsors , among other things Presently , there is an impasse as to where the unaccompanied children should go when illegal aliens who cross the border with them claim they are their parents For those seeking asylum at ports of entry , we have continued the policy from previous Administrations and will only separate if the child is in danger , there is no custodial relationship between family members , or if the adult has broken a law Sec Kirstjen Nielsen \( SecNielsen \) June 17 , 2018 Democrats have accused the Trump administration of breaking up migrant families who reach the southern border but the White House says it is simply enforcing federal law that existed long before President Trump came to office The separation of illegal alien families is the product of the same legal loopholes that Democrats refuse to close And these laws are the same that have been on the books for over a decade The president is simply enforcing them , White House Press Secretary Sarah Huckabee Sanders told reporters last Thursday Between April 19 and May 31 , there were 1 , 995 children separated from 1 , 940 adults by U S Border Patrol , a spokesperson for the Department of Homeland Security \( DHS \) confirmed Saturday The numbers represent families who were separated because of illegal entry , immigration violations , possible criminal conduct by the parent , and cases where officials could not verify the family relationship , the DHS spokesperson said",true

"WASHINGTON , DC In a continued effort to help struggling families stay safe and healthy through initiatives that assist with energy costs , U S Senators Jack Reed \( D RI \) and Susan Collins \( R ME \) , who helm the Senate Appropriations Subcommittee on Transportation , Housing , and Urban Development \( THUD \) , are leading a bipartisan coalition of senators urging President Trump to include robust funding in his Fiscal Year \( FY \) 2018 budget request for the Low Income Home Energy Assistance Program \( LIHEAP \) and the Weatherization Assistance Program \( WAP \) In a letter to President Trump and Office of Management and Budget \( OMB \) Acting Director Mark Sandy , Senators Reed , Collins and 43 of their colleagues noted the bipartisan support behind both LIHEAP and WAP and described the critical role both programs play in providing vulnerable populations and low income households with affordable home energy LIHEAP helps low income households , veterans , and seniors with their energy bills , providing an indispensable lifeline during both the cold winters and hot summer months , the Senators wrote More than 90 percent of LIHEAP recipients have at least one household member who is a child , elderly , or disabled , and the percentage of households with at least one veteran has grown to 20 percent The program helps to ensure that eligible recipients do not have to choose between paying their energy bills and affording other necessities like food and medicine Preserving LIHEAP funding is a perennial bipartisan priority for Reed and Collins , who in recent years have worked together to prevent any funding cuts to the program The current funding level for LIHEAP is able to serve less than 20 percent of the eligible population and that those who receive LIHEAP assistance have seen their average grant significantly reduced In FY 2016 , Rhode Island households received over 26 million in LIHEAP funding , as part of 3 01 billion in total LIHEAP funds provided to states Last October , Reed helped secure funding under the FY 2017 Continuing Resolution \( CR \) , totaling over 3 billion nationally for LIHEAP and 22 49 million for Rhode Island The letter also emphasizes the importance of the Weatherization Assistance Program , which has helped reduce the burden of high energy prices for more than forty years by helping low income families , seniors , and individuals with disabilities make necessary energy efficient improvements to their homes Rhode Island households received nearly 1 1 million in WAP funds for FY 2016 as part of over 213 million allocated to states Since 1990 , Rhode Island has used WAP funds to successfully weatherize more than 13 , 250 low income homes and rental units , according to the U S Department of Energy \( DOE \) The DOE also notes that WAP helps eligible Rhode Island families reduce annual energy bills by an average of 264 By supporting lasting and cost effective home energy efficiency improvements for low income families , seniors , and individuals with disabilities , WAP is increasing the energy efficiency of dwellings , reducing residential energy bills , improving the health and safety of our most vulnerable citizens , and helping to lower the need for short term assistance , the letter reads LIHEAP and WAP are vital programs that help thousands of Rhode Islanders stay safe and help improve the energy efficiency of their homes through the coldest winters and the hottest summers , said Senator Reed , the Ranking Member of the Transportation , Housing and Urban Development \( THUD \) Appropriations Subcommittee We need robust funding for both programs to ensure vulnerable populations don t have to choose between paying high energy bills and paying for food , medicine , and other necessities Other Senators who signed the letter include Tammy Baldwin \( D WI \) , Michael Bennet \( D CO \) , Richard Blumenthal \( D CT \) , Cory Booker \( D NJ \) , Maria Cantwell \( D WA \)

D MD \) The full text of the letter is below The President The White House 1600 Pennsylvania Avenue , N W Washington , D C 20500 Dear Mr President We write in support of two successful federal programs , the Low Income Home Energy Assistance Program \( LIHEAP \) and the Weatherization Assistance Program \( WAP \) , that are currently helping to meet the energy needs of eligible low income households across the country Access to affordable home energy is a matter of health and safety for many low income households , children , veterans , and seniors LIHEAP and WAP have enjoyed bipartisan support , and we hope that you will prioritize funding for both programs in your fiscal year 2018 budget proposal LIHEAP helps low income households , veterans , and seniors with their energy bills , providing an indispensable lifeline during both the cold winters and hot summer months More than 90 percent of LIHEAP recipients have at least one household member who is a child , elderly , or disabled , and the percentage of households with at least one veteran has grown to 20 percent The program helps to ensure that eligible recipients do not have to choose between paying their energy bills and affording other necessities like food and medicine This is especially important during the peak winter heating and summer cooling seasons , when energy bills can comprise roughly 30 percent of a low income household s monthly income Sadly , though , the number of households eligible for LIHEAP assistance continues to exceed the program s capacity The Weatherization Assistance Program is another key initiative , which for 40 years has helped to reduce more permanently the burden of high home energy prices for over 7 4 million low income households By supporting lasting and cost effective home energy efficiency improvements for low income families , seniors , and individuals with disabilities , WAP is increasing the energy efficiency of dwellings , reducing residential energy bills , improving the health and safety of our most vulnerable citizens , and helping to lower the need for short term assistance WAP has been repeatedly demonstrated as cost effective and has supported thousands of high quality , skilled jobs A study by Oak Ridge National Laboratory found that weatherization saves eligible single family homes on average 283 in annual energy cost savings , which benefits not only the household but the local economy Thank you for your attention to and consideration of this important request We recognize the ongoing challenges facing the discretionary budget and look forward to working with you to support these vital programs and ensure access to affordable home energy for the most vulnerable households in every state",true
"The FDA is supposed to be a trusted organization , but many people who have even the remotest inkling of basic nutrition are scratching their heads over the agency s official definition of healthy You don t need an advanced science degree to wonder how a highly processed cereal made in a factory could be considered healthier than a fruit plucked directly from a tree , but that s exactly what the FDA would have you believe That s right according to the FDA , Frosted Flakes are healthier than avocados ! The system by which it classifies food as healthy or unhealthy is very basic and outdated It suggests that foods that have low amounts of sodium , fat and cholesterol , along with some beneficial nutrients , are considered healthy , without bothering to distinguish between unsaturated and saturated fats This is extremely misguided to say the least , as the source of a fat is a big consideration when it comes to health In addition , food that was formed naturally is a lot healthier than its chemically engineered counterparts According to the FDA s definition , avocados are not considered healthy because 1 ounce contains 4 5 grams of fat It doesn t matter to them that it is the good type of fat Likewise , almonds , with their 14 grams of fat per ounce , and salmon , with its 11 grams of fat per 3 ounce serving , are also considered unhealthy foods despite their well documented health benefits Pop Tarts , Spaghetti Os and Frosted Flakes are better than salmon and almonds \? On the other hand , some of the foods that make the cut according to their criteria are absolutely laughable We ve already discussed Frosted Flakes , which the agency deems healthy because it has 0 grams of fat per serving , is low in cholesterol and sodium , and has some beneficial ingredients Somehow the fact that it has 10 grams of sugar per serving doesn t matter Spaghetti Os with calcium do not even remotely resemble anything found in nature , yet they are considered healthy because they only contain 1 gram of fat per serving The highly artificial Low fat Pop Tarts are also considered healthy because they are low in fat Is Big Food money ensuring labels are kept intentionally vague \? The FDA s guidelines leave anyone with a half a brain wondering whether the agency is highly corrupt or just incompetent It s hard to rationalize their actions , but many people have speculated that Big Food money is influencing the FDA The FDA s delusion hit a fever pitch when it attacked the Kind food company for calling its bars , which are full of antioxidants , healthy Their essential fatty acids , while not bad , push their fat content over the outdated limit In the wake of this mess , the agency admitted its definitions were outdated , and said they would redefine the term for the first time in two decades However , many believe their new definition will be written in such a way that a number of Big Food products will still be able to somehow qualify as healthy even if they are not In addition , any changes could take years to be put in place because there will likely be hearings and proposals If you want to eat healthy food , you simply cannot rely on the FDA and Big Food companies to be honest about what is inside the products you buy in the store Regardless of what the FDA says , naturally grown food is always the best choice Nevertheless , it s important to keep in mind that much of the produce you find in your grocery store has been sprayed with toxic pesticides You can take matters into your own hands and know beyond a shadow of a doubt that what you are eating is completely natural by growing it yourself Sources include",false

"Hearing loss of US diplomats in Cuba blamed on covert deviceBy MATTHEW LEE and MICHAEL WEISSENSTEINAug 10 , 2017https www apnews com 51828908c6c84d78a29e833d0aae10aaLink copied ! WASHINGTON \( AP \) The two year old U S diplomatic relationship with Cuba was roiled Wednesday by what U S officials say was a string of bizarre incidents that left a group of American diplomats in Havana with severe hearing loss attributed to a covert sonic device In the fall of 2016 , a series of U S diplomats began suffering unexplained losses of hearing , according to officials with knowledge of the investigation into the case Several of the diplomats were recent arrivals at the embassy , which reopened in 2015 as part of former President Barack Obama 's reestablishment of diplomatic relations with Cuba Some of the diplomats' symptoms were so severe that they were forced to cancel their tours early and return to the United States , officials said After months of investigation , U S officials concluded that the diplomats had been exposed to an advanced device that operated outside the range of audible sound and had been deployed either inside or outside their residences It was not immediately clear if the device was a weapon used in a deliberate attack , or had some other purpose The U S officials were n't authorized to discuss the investigation publicly and spoke on condition of anonymity State Department spokeswoman Heather Nauert said the U S retaliated by expelling two Cuban diplomats from their embassy in Washington on May 23 She did not say how many U S diplomats were affected or confirm they had suffered hearing loss , saying only that they had a variety of physical symptoms The Cuban government said in a lengthy statement late Wednesday that Cuba has never permitted , nor will permit , that Cuban territory be used for any action against accredited diplomatic officials or their families , with no exception The statement from the Cuban Foreign Ministry said it had been informed of the incidents on Feb 17 and had launched an exhaustive , high priority , urgent investigation at the behest of the highest level of the Cuban government It said the decision to expel two Cuban diplomats was unjustified and baseless The ministry said it had created an expert committee to analyze the incidents and had reinforced security around the U S embassy and U S diplomatic residences Cuba is universally considered a safe destination for visitors and foreign diplomats , including U S citizens , the statement said U S officials told The Associated Press that about five diplomats , several with spouses , had been affected and that no children had been involved The FBI and Diplomatic Security Service are investigating Cuba employs a state security apparatus that keeps many people under surveillance and U S diplomats are among the most closely monitored people on the island Like virtually all foreign diplomats in Cuba , the victims of the incidents lived in housing owned and maintained by the Cuban government However , officials familiar with the probe said investigators were looking into the possibilities that the incidents were carried out by a third country such as Russia , possibly operating without the knowledge of Cuba 's formal chain of command Nauert said investigators did not yet have a definitive explanation for the incidents but stressed they take them very seriously , as shown by the Cuban diplomats' expulsions We requested their departure as a reciprocal measure since some U S personnel 's assignments in Havana had to be curtailed due to these incidents , she said Under the Vienna Convention , Cuba has an obligation to take measures to protect diplomats U S diplomats in Cuba said they suffered occasional harassment for years after the restoration of limited ties with the communist government in the 1970s , harassment reciprocated by U S agents against Cuban diplomats in Washington The use of sonic devices to intentionally harm diplomats would be unprecedented",false
"Coordinates Asha Jaquilla Degree \( born August 5 , 1990 \) went missing at the age of nine from Shelby , North Carolina , United States In the early morning hours of February 14 , 2000 , for reasons unknown , she packed her bookbag , left her family home north of the city and began walking along nearby North Carolina Highway 18 despite heavy rain and wind Several passing motorists saw her when one turned around at a point 1 3 miles \( 2 1 km \) from her home and began to approach her , she left the roadside and ran into a wooded area In the morning , her parents discovered her absence No one has seen her since 1 An intensive search that began that day led to the location of some of her personal effects near where she was last seen A year and a half later , her bookbag , still packed , was unearthed from a construction site along Highway 18 north of Shelby in Morganton At the point where she ran into the woods , a billboard now stands appealing for help finding her Her family hosts an annual walk from their home to the billboard to draw attention to the case While the circumstances of Degree 's disappearance at first seemed to suggest she was running away from home , investigators could not find a clear reason she might have done so , and she was younger than most children who do so They have speculated that she might have been abducted instead The case has drawn national media attention In 2015 , the Federal Bureau of Investigation \( FBI \) joined state and county authorities in a reopened investigation , offering a reward for information that could help solve the case Background edit Harold and Iquilla Degree married on Valentine 's Day in 1988 Asha was born two years later they also have a son , O'Bryant They raised both children in their house on Oakcrest Drive in a residential subdivision amidst a generally rural area north of Shelby , North Carolina , on the western edge of the Charlotte metropolitan area 2 Both worked regular jobs nearby The children let themselves in after school , 3 where their parents expected that they would either be doing their homework or finished with it by the time they returned 4 They made sure their children were insulated from outside influences and had a life centered around their extended family , church , and school The Degrees did not have a computer in the house E very time you turned on the TV there was some pedophile who had lured somebody 's child away , via the Internet Iquilla recalled in a 2013 Jet interview 5 Iquilla said Asha handled this well she was cautious , shy and content mostly to stay within the limits her parents set She was scared to death of dogs , she recalled years later I never thought she would go out of the house 6 Asha was in fourth grade at nearby Fallston Elementary School going into a three day weekend on the second week of February 2000 The Cleveland County Schools were closed on Friday , February 11 , while the Degrees still had to work the children spent the day at their aunt 's house in the same neighborhood , from which they went to their youth basketball practices at their school The following day , Asha 's basketball team , on which she was a star point guard , lost its first game of the season Asha had fouled out Her parents recalled that she was somewhat upset about this , crying along with her teammates afterwards , but seemed to have gotten over it and watched her brother 's game afterwards 4 Disappearance edit On Sunday , February 13 , the children went to church from a relative 's house and then returned home Harold Degree went out to work his second shift job at the nearby PPG Industries plant in the afternoon 4 Around 8 p m that night , both children went to bed in the room they shared Almost an hour later , the power went out in the neighborhood after a nearby car accident It was restored shortly after Harold returned from work , around 12 30 a m At that time he checked on his children and saw both of them asleep in their beds He checked again shortly before he went to bed at 2 30 a m on February 14 , and again saw them both 4 Shortly afterwards , O'Bryant recalls hearing Asha 's bed squeak He did not further rouse himself as he assumed she was merely changing positions in her sleep Apparently around this time , Asha got out of bed , taking a bookbag she had previously packed with several sets of clothes and personal items , and left the house Between 3 45 and 4 15 a m , a truck driver and a motorist saw her walking south along Highway 18 , wearing a long sleeved white T shirt and white pants , just north of its junction with Highway 180 7 They reported this to police after seeing a TV report about her disappearance 4 The motorist said that he turned his car around because he thought it was strange such a small child would be out by herself at that hour He circled three times and saw Degree run into the woods by the roadside and disappear It was a rainy night , and the witness said there was a storm raging when he saw her 6 8 County sheriff Dan Crawford said , We 're pretty sure it was her because the descriptions they gave are consistent with what we know she was wearing He added that they also saw her at the same place , heading the same direction 9 Iquilla awoke at 5 45 a m to get the children ready for school On the morning of February 14 , an important day since it was not only Valentine 's Day but the Degrees' wedding anniversary , 10 this involved drawing a bath for them as they had not been able to take one the night before due to the power outage When she opened the children 's room to wake them up before their 6 30 alarm and call them to the bath , O'Bryant was in his bed but Asha was not , and Iquilla was unable to find her in the house , nor in the family cars 5 She told Harold she could not find their daughter He suggested Asha might have gone over to his mother 's house across the street , but when Iquilla called there her sister in law said Asha was not there That 's when I went into panic mode I heard a car next door I put shoes on and ran outside Iquilla called her mother , who told her to call the police 5 Search edit By 6 40 a m , the first police officers had arrived on the scene Police dogs called to the scene could not pick up Asha 's scent Iquilla went through the neighborhood calling Asha 's name , which she said had awakened everyone by 7 a m 5 Friends , family and neighbors canceled their plans for the day to assist police in searching the vicinity while the pastor of their church , along with other area clergymen , came to the Degrees' home to support them By day 's end all that had been found was a mitten , which Iquilla Degree said did not belong to her daughter as she had found that no winter clothing had been taken from the house 11 Local news coverage resulted in the two drivers who had seen Asha walking along the road early that morning , including the one whose attempt to approach her apparently prompted Asha to flee into the woods , reporting the sightings to police 4 On February 15 , candy wrappers were found in a shed at a nearby business along the highway , near where Asha had been seen running into the woods 12 Along with them were a pencil , marker and Mickey Mouse shaped hair bow that were identified as belonging to her 6 13 It was the only trace of her found during the initial search On February 16 , Iquilla realized that Asha 's bedroom was missing her favorite clothing , such as a pair of blue jeans with a red stripe 14 4 7 A week later , after 9 , 000 man hours had been invested in a search of the 2 3 mile radius \( 3 2 4 8 km \) of where she had last been seen , flyers posted all over the area and 300 leads ranging from possible sightings to tips about abandoned houses and wells where Asha might have ended up , the search was called off We have never really had that first good , substantial lead , said county sheriff Dan Crawford at a news conference He urged the media to keep the story alive 15 Later developments edit At the news conference on February 22 , Crawford said he was going long range with the search for Asha Both the FBI and North Carolina 's State Bureau of Investigation \( SBI \) got involved and put her on their respective databases of missing children While the agencies were done searching in the area of her home and route , we 're following everything , he insisted 15 From Iquilla 's account of what Asha had taken with her , investigators believed she had planned and prepared for this departure over the several days preceding her disappearance She 's not your typical runaway , observed SBI agent Bart Burpeau Another expert , Ben Ermini of the National Center for Missing Exploited Children , noted that most children who run away are at least 12 8 An FBI agent also pointed to the lack of an issue she might have been running away from , such as a dysfunctional family or poor academic performance Still , investigators believed that was the most likely explanation for her departure , but that for some reason she either got off track or was abducted 15 The media attention went national A month after Asha 's disappearance , the Degree family appeared on The Montel Williams Show to call attention to the case America 's Most Wanted and The Oprah Winfrey Show also devoted segments to it 5 On August 3 , 2001 , Asha 's bookbag and other items were unearthed during a construction project off Highway 18 in Burke County , near Morganton , about 26 miles \( 42 km \) north of Shelby It was wrapped in a plastic bag 1 16 17 18 The worker who found it said the bookbag contained Asha 's name and phone number 13 The FBI took it to their headquarters for further forensic analysis results from that testing have not been shared publicly 19 To date it is the last evidence found in the case 20 Later leads have turned out to be dead ends In 2004 , acting on a tip reportedly received from an inmate at the county jail , the sheriff 's office began digging at an intersection in Lawndale The bones that were found turned out to be from an animal 17 External image Age progression of Degree to age 24 The Degrees took steps to keep Asha 's memory , and the case , alive in the public 's mind In 2008 , they established a scholarship in her name for a deserving local student 21 They host an annual walk to raise awareness and money to fund their search 22 The walk starts at their home and ends at a missing person 's billboard for Asha along Highway 18 , near where she was last seen 1 It was originally held on February 14 , but it was changed to February 7 in 2015 and February 6 in 2016 , as Harold and Iquilla felt it was not fair to participants to make Valentine 's Day a somber occasion 3 2 Pictures of Asha , both real and those showing her as she might appear in later years created by investigators to help the search , still decorate the Degree house I fully expect her to walk through the door , Iquilla says 2 Iquilla Degree complained in a 2013 interview with Jet that her daughter 's disappearance had not gotten as much media attention over the years as some subsequent cases of missing children She believed it was because Asha was black Missing white children get more attention I do n't understand why , she said I know if you ask them they will say it 's not racial Oh , really \? I'm not going to argue because I have common sense 5 In February 2015 , the FBI announced that FBI agents , Cleveland County Sheriff 's Office investigators , and State Bureau of Investigation agents were re examining the case and re interviewing witnesses They also announced a reward of up to 25 , 000 for information leading to the arrest and conviction of the person or persons responsible for her disappearance 23 A community group is offering an additional 20 , 000 reward 24 The FBI announced 15 months later , in May 2016 , that their reinvestigation of the case had turned up a possible new lead They disclosed that Asha may have been seen getting into a dark green early 1970s Lincoln Continental Mark IV , or possibly a Ford Thunderbird from the same era along Route 18 near where she was last seen later that night It was described as having rust around its wheel wells 25 In September 2017 , the FBI announced that its Child Abduction Rapid Deployment \( CARD \) team was in Cleveland County to assist in the investigation and provide on the ground investigative , technical , behavioral analysis , and analytical support to find out more about what happened to Asha The team worked alongside FBI Charlotte employees , Cleveland County Sheriff 's Office investigators , and North Carolina State Bureau of Investigation agents for ten days 26 The agencies also meet several times a month to go over the latest on the investigation Since September 2017 , local agents and investigators have conducted approximately 300 interviews 27 In October 2018 , the Cleveland County Sheriff 's Office detectives appealed for information from the public about two items of interest in the case McElligot 's Pool , a children 's book by Dr Seuss , which was borrowed from the Fallston Middle School library in early 2000 , and a New Kids on the Block concert T shirt An investigator said the items are critical to solving the case 28 29 See also edit",true

Medical cannabis , or medical marijuana , can refer to the use of cannabis and its cannabinoids to treat disease or improve symptoms However , there is no single agreed upon definition , says Wikipedia The use of cannabis as a medicine has not been rigorously scientifically tested , often due to production restrictions and other governmental regulations There is limited evidence suggesting cannabis can be used to reduce nausea and vomiting during chemotherapy , to improve appetite in people with HIV AIDS , and to treat chronic pain and muscle spasms Its use for other medical applications , however , is insufficient for conclusions about safety or effects In California , there are weed doctors who will write a prescription for cannabis to anyone claiming to suffer from anxiety , which means they passout prescriptions for pot like chocolate bars at a Halloween party As with so many other trends that started in California , expect to see medicinal marijuana sold in your town soon ! Medical cannabis can be administered using a variety of methods , including liquid tinctures , vaporizing or smoking dried buds , eating cannabis edibles , taking capsules , using lozenges , dermal patches or oral dermal sprays Synthetic cannabinoids are available as prescription drugs in some countries examples include dronabinol and nabilone Recreational use of cannabis is illegal in most parts of the world , but the medical use of cannabis is legal in certain countries , including Austria , Australia , Canada , Czech Republic , Finland , Germany , Israel , Italy , the Netherlands \( where it is also legal recreationally \) , Portugal and Spain In the United States , federal law outlaws all cannabis use , while 25 states and the District of Columbia no longer prosecute individuals for the possession or sale of medical marijuana , as long as the individuals are in compliance with the state 's medical marijuana sale regulations The DEA lawyer gave us his legal opinion that if you happen to live where recreational marijuana is now legal , i e Colorado or Washington State after August 1 , you will need a prescription , as you would need throughout the U S However , an appeals court ruled in January 2014 that a 2007 Ninth Circuit ruling remains binding in relation to the ongoing illegality , in federal legislative terms , of Californian cannabis dispensaries , reaffirming the impact of the federal Controlled Substances Act The Federal Government will make Marijuana a Schedule Two drug on August 1 , 2016 , effectively legalizing weed throughout the US You may be able to buy pot at Rite Aid in Santa Monica by the end of the year As explained above , moving marijuana from Schedule One to Schedule Two , would have the effect of legalizing medicinal marijuana , throughout all 50 States , the District of Columbia and U S territories This action may be taken by the DEA unilaterally i e , without specific Congressional authorization because Congress has previously granted the DEA rule making authority over what drugs are on which schedules The Drug Enforcement Administration \( DEA \) is a United States federal law enforcement agency under the U S Department of Justice , tasked with combating drug smuggling and use within the United States Not only is the DEA the lead agency for domestic enforcement of the Controlled Substances Act , sharing concurrent jurisdiction with the Federal Bureau of Investigation \( FBI \) and Immigration and Customs Enforcement \( ICE \) , it also has sole responsibility for coordinating and pursuing U S drug investigations abroad Update DEA Source Confirms Story , 7 04 2016 http www smobserved com story 2016 07 04 news dea source confirms that schedule ii marijuana is in the works 1562 htmlYou might be interested in",false

"Reena Rose Sibayan The Jersey JournalPeople waited recently for several hours for the computers at the Motor Vehicle Commission in Jersey City to be fixed By Kevin OToole As a member of the state Senate Budget and Appropriations Committee , I recently participated in a hearing about recent problems at some Motor Vehicle Commission \( MVC \) offices in our area Specifically , these problems include long wait times and customers being turned away due to computer problems The public hearing proved itself to be nothing more than naked political theater by the Democratic members of the committee and a brazen election year stunt The problems with MVC service are almost entirely caused by an outdated computer system that is 30 years old The technology was placed in service back when drivers licenses were little more than laminated pieces of paper , not the secure documents that we rely on today to prevent identity theft , crime and terrorism Since the beginning of the Christie administration , the MVC has made great strides in serving its customers It has placed a greater emphasis on moving critical technology projects forward to better position the commission for the future We have finally restarted much needed upgrades that were put on hold during the Codey and Corzine administrations Year after year , during budget hearings , those of us who serve on the budget committees were told about major MVC technology investments , such as the Motor Vehicle Automated Transaction System \( MATRX \) and the Enhanced Digital Driver License \( EDDL \) , which were planned to improve customer service and make the MVC computers more reliable The proposed introduction of an extended six year license , along with plans to implement online license renewals , were meant to be positive changes for New Jersey drivers Those changes would make renewing easier and would reduce customer volume spikes and long lines at MVC offices In reality , projections about the effects of a six year license were off , implementation of the new digital driver license was greatly delayed and customer volume spikes and long lines exist to this day Had the EDDL project moved forward within the planned time frame under previous administrations , a contract would have been awarded in August 2008 Under this timeline , online renewals would have been in place by late 2009 , and the delays caused by the outdated , unreliable technology would not continue to occur While previous governors never made improving customer service at the MVC a priority , the Christie administration has been proactive in addressing short term MVC needs while it works to complete its long term technological improvements MVC office hours have been increased 20 percent to 54 5 hours per week more hours than ever before and include the restoration of service on Mondays Additional staff is being added at high volume MVC offices to speed up transactions , and additional cameras that are needed to issue drivers licenses are being installed , as well And to ensure that customers are not left waiting in line exposed to the elements , MVC office space is being rearranged to shelter more customers comfortably indoors while they are waiting to be served These changes will yield near immediate results in improving the customer experience at MVC offices and are the best short term options available to remedy a bad situation left by previous governors and Motor Vehicle commissioners But they are just that short term solutions The key to modernizing the MVC and solving its problems in the long term lies in updated technology Gov Christie is fixing the problems left by other governors who failed to bring the MVCs computer technology up to modern standards The dramatic change at the MVC is not just about this administrations push to introduce new technology , but also a number of other positive steps designed to better serve its customers From instituting the greatest number of agency service hours in motor vehicle history and the opening of state of the art facilities on state owned land to installing more camera equipment and increasing staffing levels at our states busiest agencies , under Gov Christies leadership , the MVC is doing whats necessary to fulfill the needs of New Jersey drivers After all of the upgrades are completed and more services are online , the wait times at the MVC will drop significantly In fact , most drivers will have to visit the MVC only once every eight years a welcome change from the current situation I would have hoped that my colleagues in the Legislature who noted concerns about the MVC would have shown greater interest over the last several years when essential technology projects were languishing under previous administrations Updating the technological capabilities of the MVC is of critical importance and should not be used for political gain As we near the 10th anniversary of the 9 11 terrorist attacks , we should not forget that some of the hijackers used New Jersey drivers licenses to board those aircraft Efforts like these to make the state drivers license more secure and the MVC more efficient will go a long way toward making drivers happier and New Jersey safer Kevin OToole , a Republican , represents the 40th District in the New Jersey Senate , where he is a member of its budget and

"But it is a theme that his aides believe proved to be successful , and they are planning to use it aggressively ahead through the Republican convention and into the fall \( Britney Spears and Paris Hilton , whose appearance in the first celebrity ad drew ridicule from Democrats and Ms Hilton , will be retired from future spots after helping draw huge attention in the form of news coverage and nearly 2 million You Tube hits \) The American people are likely not going to want to elect someone to the presidency based on their ability to transform themselves into a celebrity , said Steve Schmidt , a senior adviser to Mr McCain The advertising is effective because it speaks to a truth that people instantly get This was inspired by what Mr McCain s advisers and some Democrats suspect was one mistake Mr Obama made on his otherwise well received overseas trip appearing at a rally before 200 , 000 Germans in Berlin , an event that lead Mr McCain s advisers to describe Mr Obama as presumptuous and provided the footage for the first so called celebrity ads \( expect to more of that in future ads , highlighted by Mr Obama presenting himself as a fellow citizen of the world \) If this kind of attack does strike a chord , then Mr Obama might find he gave Republicans a bit of a gift with his decision to deliver his convention acceptance speech before 76 , 000 people at a stadium in Denver , an appearance \( think tail gate parties \) that seems to have potential to underline the Republican message Implicit in this approach is an attempt to portray Mr Obama as different , or alien , from many Americans , reinforcing a reluctance that polls suggest many Americans have about voting for this newcomer Hence the references to his years at Harvard , his years in Chicago s Hyde Park , his affection for frequent gym visits and the food he eats , or to the McCain camp s use of words intended to make Mr Obama seem elite or effete Please verify you 're not a robot by clicking the box Invalid email address Please re enter You must select a newsletter to subscribe to You agree to receive occasional updates and special offers for The New York Times 's products and services Thank you for subscribing An error has occurred Please try again later You are already subscribed to this email Sen Obama appears to get fussy when asked tough questions , Brian Rogers , Mr McCain s campaign spokesman , said in an e mail to reporters last week Will all this work \? Mr Obama s advisers argue that public polling data shows no evidence that it is taking hold , and that the public has little tolerance for this kind of attack at a time when there are so many serious issues facing the nation Their intent is obvious , but I don t see any evidence that they are gaining with this , said David Axelrod , Mr Obama s senior strategist He said he did not believe that Mr McCain , of all candidates , could succeed in painting Mr Obama as elitist Obviously , his strategists met on the portico of the McCain estate in Sedona or maybe in one of his six other houses and decided what line of attack they were going to use , he said While Mr McCain has used this summer to figure out a way to go after Mr Obama , Mr Obama used it to patch up a hole in his resume with his overseas trip It produced images of Mr Obama meeting with foreign leaders and visiting troops that even Republicans say would go a long way to addressing voter concerns about his foreign policy credentials And they permitted Mr Obama to dominate political coverage for much of July In downplaying the effectiveness of the Republican attacks on Mr Obama , Mr Axelrod was echoing the way Mr Schmidt and other McCain advisers downplayed the effect of Mr Obama s trip In both cases , the campaigns pointed to polls as evidence that voters weren t impressed But now may not be the time to judge the effectiveness of these tactics things campaigns do in the summer often are not done with an eye to the daily Gallup tracking poll , but rather for setting the table for the fall Some people are paying attention , said Charlie Black , a senior adviser to Mr McCain But you are laying the foundation for the debate for the fall Even if people don t pay enough attention to say , I m changing my vote or I m making up my mind , they do absorb the information The fact that Mr McCain s campaign continues to push this line of attack it trotted out this summer suggests that his camp thinks it works And Mr Obama s campaign , which has seemed both awfully confident and at times hesitant in responding to Mr McCain , may have learned a lesson that it can put to use this fall We need to make sure that he is paying a price for his negativity , said David Plouffe , Mr Obama s campaign manager The lesson here is that the media is definitely going to cover the theater of the absurd And we have to be very mindful of that George Bush didn t have to worry so much about that , but John McCain is viewed by some independent voters as a different kind of politician",true

"You are here Home The College Speaks Position Statements of the College Health Issues New Concerns about the Human Papillomavirus VaccineNew Concerns about the Human Papillomavirus VaccineAmerican College of Pediatricians January 2016The American College of Pediatricians \( The College \) is committed to the health and well being of children , including prevention of disease by vaccines It has recently come to the attention of the College that one of the recommended vaccines could possibly be associated with the very rare but serious condition of premature ovarian failure \( POF \) , also known as premature menopause There have been two case report series \( 3 cases each \) published since 2013 in which post menarcheal adolescent girls developed laboratory documented POF within weeks to several years of receiving Gardasil , a four strain human papillomavirus vaccine \( HPV4 \) 1 , 2 Adverse events that occur after vaccines are frequently not caused by the vaccine and there has not been a noticeable rise in POF cases in the last 9 years since HPV4 vaccine has been widely used Nevertheless there are legitimate concerns that should be addressed \( 1 \) long term ovarian function was not assessed in either the original rat safety studies3 , 4 or in the human vaccine trials , \( 2 \) most primary care physicians are probably unaware of a possible association between HPV4 and POF and may not consider reporting POF cases or prolonged amenorrhea \( missing menstrual periods \) to the Vaccine Adverse Event Reporting System \( VAERS \) , \( 3 \) potential mechanisms of action have been postulated based on autoimmune associations with the aluminum adjuvant used1 and previously documented ovarian toxicity in rats from another component , polysorbate 80 , 2 and \( 4 \) since licensure of Gardasil in 2006 , there have been about 213 VAERS reports \( per the publicly available CDC WONDER VAERS database \) involving amenorrhea , POF or premature menopause , 88 of which have been associated with Gardasil 5 The two strain HPV2 , CervarixTM , was licensed late in 2009 and accounts for 4 7 of VAERS amenorrhea reports since 2006 , and 8 5 of those reports from February 2010 through May 2015 This compares to the pre HPV vaccine period from 1990 to 2006 during which no cases of POF or premature menopause and 32 cases of amenorrhea were reported to VAERS Many adolescent females are vaccinated with influenza , meningococcal , and tetanus vaccines without getting Gardasil , and yet only 5 6 of reports related to ovarian dysfunction since 2006 are associated with such vaccines in the absence of simultaneous Gardasil administration The overwhelming majority \( 76 \) of VAERS reports since 2006 with ovarian failure , premature menopause , and or amenorrhea are associated solely with Gardasil When VAERS reports since 2006 are restricted to cases in which amenorrhea occurred for at least 4 months and is not associated with other known causes like polycystic ovary syndrome or pregnancy , 86 89 cases are associated with Gardasil , 3 89 with CervarixTM , and 0 89 with other vaccines administered independently of an HPV vaccine 5 Using the same criteria , there are only 7 reports of amenorrhea from 1990 through 2005 and no more than 2 of those associated with any one vaccine type Few other vaccines besides Gardasil that are administered in adolescence contain polysorbate 80 6 Pre licensure safety trials for Gardasil used placebo that contained polysorbate 80 as well as aluminum adjuvant 2 , 7 Therefore , if such ingredients could cause ovarian dysfunction , an increase in amenorrhea probably would not have been detected in the placebo controlled trials Furthermore , a large number of girls in the original trials were taking hormonal contraceptives which can mask ovarian dysfunction including amenorrhea and ovarian failure 2 Thus a causal relationship between human papillomavirus vaccines \( if not Gardasil specifically \) and ovarian dysfunction cannot be ruled out at this time Numerous Gardasil safety studies , including one released recently , 8 have looked at demyelinating and autoimmune diseases and have not found any significant problems Unfortunately , none of them except clinical safety pre licensure studies totaling 11 , 778 vaccinees9 specifically addressed post vaccination ovarian dysfunction While data from those studies do not indicate an increased rate of amenorrhea after vaccination , the essential lack of saline placebos and the majority of participants taking hormonal contraceptives in those studies preclude meaningful data to rule out an effect on ovarian function A Vaccine Safety Datalink POF study is planned to address an association between these vaccines and POF , but it may be years before results will be determined Plus , POF within a few years of vaccination could be the tip of the iceberg since ovarian dysfunction manifested by months of amenorrhea may later progress to POF Meanwhile , the author of this statement has contacted the maker of Gardasil , the Advisory Committee on Immunization Practices \( ACIP \) , and the Food and Drug Administration \( FDA \) to make known the above concerns and request that \( 1 \) more rat studies be done to look at long term ovarian function after HPV4 injections , \( 2 \) the 89 VAERS reports identified with at least 4 months amenorrhea be reviewed by the CDC for further clarification since the publicly available WONDER VAERS database only contains initial reports , and \( 3 \) primary care providers be notified of a possible association between HPV and amenorrhea A U S Government Representative responded that they will continue to conduct studies and monitor the safety of HPV vaccines Should the weight of the evidence from VAERS or VSD and other sources indicate a likely causal association between POF and HPV vaccines , appropriate action will be taken in terms of communication and public health response The College is posting this statement so that individuals considering the use of human papillomavirus vaccines could be made aware of these concerns pending further action by the regulatory agencies and manufacturers While there is no strong evidence of a causal relationship between HPV4 and ovarian dysfunction , this information should be public knowledge for physicians and patients considering

"Russia and the United States have never been allies One easily remembers how tense and long lasting the Cold War was , and it left Russia very angry that they suffered such a demoralizing defeat as a world power While the United States should not become Vladimir Putin s best friend , we also have to realize that Russia is a super power in this world and we must take them seriously Hillary and Obama dislike Putin because he only answers to strength and toughness , which is exactly why it is evident he likes Donald Trump As a way to project strength , Obama and Hillary continue to call Putin every name in the book while blaming him for cyber attacks and WikiLeaks On Friday , October 21 , Putin issued a global message that if Hillary Clinton and Barrack Obama continue to slander Russia , he was going to shoot down U S jets in the Middle East and begin to prepare for World War III Putin , Fearing For His Country , Declares War Is Coming If Hillary Continues But now , As of Sunday , October 23 , Putin has ordered the Russian Defense Ministry to begin training and managing all local authorities , law enforcement , and state security as they are preparing for a nuclear war with the United States And with the United States at the eve of war , Hillary Clinton has spent the last two days blaming Putin and Russia for WikiLeaks and continues to call him a thug puppet Moscow is sending a blunt message to Obama and Hillary by purposefully stationing dozens of large aircraft carriers to conduct operations in Syria On top of that , Putin is set to deploy more Russian spy ships to survey underwater internet cables in the region , as well This move originally began as the U S and Russia continued to disagree over Syria , but not it has become the first step into World War III Putin has told Obama that if he does not begin to cooperate and allow Russia to help , he will begin to shoot down American jets as well as aim his missiles towards the United States This has nothing to do with whether or not Russia could defeat the United States This is a result of Obama and Hillary risking war with Russia just because they want to blame Putin for WikiLeaks rather than take blame for their leaked emails She s Very Friendly With Russia As we all recall , Hillary Clinton sold Russia 20 percent of our uranium a few years ago in exchange for 145 , 000 , 000 to the Clinton Foundation So if Russia did not possess enough uranium to bolster their nuclear arsenal then , they have been sufficiently equipped thanks to Hillary Clinton No , Russia cannot defeat the United States , but why not attempt to make the relationship better \? Donald Trump has openly stated he will work with Russia to eliminate ISIS from the Middle East According to Hillary and Democrats , that is a terrible idea Vladimir Putin will continue to take precautions for nuclear war with the United States because they know if Hillary Clinton wins this election , she will engage in warlike conflicts As Secretary of State , she created wars in Libya , Syria , and Iran while also creating ISIS Who can blame Russia for taking precautions \? If a President Clinton scares Russia so badly that they are preparing their entire country for nuclear war , imagine how scared we should be as Americans",false
"Post PoliticsTrump tells story about killing terrorists with bullets dipped in pigs blood , though there s no proof of itBy Jenna Johnson and Jose A DelReal By Jenna Johnson and Jose A DelReal Email the author February 20 , 2016 Email the author Follow wpjenna Follow jdelrealThis story has been updated NORTH CHARLESTON , S C To explain his support for waterboarding and other heavy handed interrogation tactics , Donald Trump told a rally audience a story Friday night that involved U S Gen John J Pershing , a terrorist attack in the Philippines more than a century ago , 50 terrorists and bullets dipped in pigs blood It s a tale that has circulated on the Internet for years and is most likely not true The story came up as Trump reiterated his support for waterboarding , the advanced interrogation technique that the Obama administration considers torture and has ceased using Earlier this week , Trump said he supports this controversial method , along with those that are much worse , because torture works Proponents of waterboarding have long been careful to not label it as torture , which is strictly forbidden by U S and international law Donald Trump 'Torture works' The big question is Is it torture or not \? Trump said at a rally at a convention center here , the night before the South Carolina primary It s so borderline It s like your minimal , minimal , minimal torture Trump criticized his Republican rivals for not embracing waterboarding as enthusiastically as he has , which he says sends the wrong message to terrorists who use barbaric techniques like chopping off the heads of their foes You know , I read a story it s a terrible story , but I ll tell you , Trump said Should I tell you \? Or should I not \? As the crowd cheered him on , Trump told them about Pershing rough guy , rough guy who was fighting terrorism in the early 1900s Trump did n't say where this happened , but variations of this story online usually state that it happened in the Philippines during the Philippine American War part of the island nation 's protracted battle for independence early in Pershing s career They were having terrorism problems , just like we do , Trump said And he caught 50 terrorists who did tremendous damage and killed many people And he took the 50 terrorists , and he took 50 men and he dipped 50 bullets in pigs blood you heard that , right \? He took 50 bullets , and he dipped them in pigs blood And he had his men load his rifles , and he lined up the 50 people , and they shot 49 of those people And the 50th person , he said You go back to your people , and you tell them what happened And for 25 years , there wasn t a problem Okay \? Twenty five years , there wasn t a problem At one point in telling this story , Trump said By the way , this is something you can read in the history books not a lot of history books because they don t like teaching this Donald Trump s final pitch to South Carolina Although Trump never used the word Muslim in this story , he was clearly referring to Muslim terrorists and at one point commented There s a whole thing with swine and animals and pigs , and you know the story , you know they don t like that Pigs are deemed impure by the Koran Trump finished the story with this message So we better start getting tough , and we better start getting vigilant , and we better start using our heads , or we re not going to have a country , folks We re not going to have a country A guy in the audience then shouted This is the greatest country in the world While the story was well received by the cheering audience , it appears to be more of a military fable than a history lesson The website snopes com which investigates urban legends , myths , rumors and pretty much anything forwarded in a chain email could find little proof that the story is true There are several versions of the tale circulating , including one in which the prisoners were buried with dead pigs The pigs blood on the bullets , according to at least one version , would keep a Muslim from entering heaven The Council on American Islamic Relations denounced Trump 's remarks Saturday in a sharply worded statement that accused the billionaire of inciting anti Muslim attacks The group has frequently tussled with Trump over anti Muslim rhetoric , including Trump 's call to temporary prevent all Muslims from entering the country Donald Trump 's inflammatory rhetoric has crossed the line from spreading hatred to inciting violence , said Nihad Awad , national executive director of CAIR By directly stating that the only way to stop terrorism is to murder Muslims in graphic and religiously offensive ways , he places the millions of innocent , law abiding citizens in the American Muslim community at risk from rogue vigilantes Republican presidential rival Sen Marco Rubio \( Fla \) called the story bizarre and questioned its historical authenticity I'm sure people are offended I hope people are offended by that That 's not what the United States is about , Rubio said on NBC 's Today show on Saturday morning Look , we 're in a very weird year here And obviously things are going on , people are saying whatever they want in politics today and there seems to be no accountability The presidency is a serious job and so I hope we can get this campaign back focused on the serious aspect of it and not the circus aspect of it , Rubio added Trump s campaign had yet to respond to a request for comment Saturday afternoon The real estate mogul found himself mired in multiple controversies in the days leading to Saturday 's South Carolina primary On Friday , he called for a boycott of Apple products over the tech firm 's refusal to assist the FBI in unlocking an iPhone belonging to one of the San Bernardino , Calif , shooters On Thursday , he had sharp words for Pope Francis after the holy leader seemingly condemned Trump 's calls to build a wall along the U S Mexico border The billionaire tweeted a message Saturday morning that knocked President Obama for not attending Supreme Court Justice Antonin Scalia 's funeral and echoed past statements made by himself and others questioning the president 's Christian faith I wonder if President Obama would have attended the funeral of Justice Scalia if it were held in a Mosque \?

"Gallagher Bettman has changed his tune on NHL expansionTony Gallagher \( The Province \) Updated August 28 , 2014 9 56 AMFiled Under EmailNHL commissioner Gary Bettman says the National Hockey League will listen to expressions of interest in adding teams Photo by Mark HumphreyIt wasn t very long ago that NHL commissioner Gary Bettman was treating talk of expansion as though he was being asked if he d like an epidemic of Ebola But recently the nature of the rhetoric has changed so much that the question is becoming not if , but when And then the ultimate question Will they be able to limit the number of new teams to just two \? Sources close to the situation have indicated Las Vegas is a done deal , the only thing to be determined being which owner will be entitled to proclaim that he brought the first major league sports franchise to Sin City And given how dead set against a team in the gambling haven the commissioner was 10 years ago , this move into another player friendly state tax free zone represents a considerable about face indeed But people have been betting on hockey games for years and to pretend games couldn t be fixed just as easily anywhere as in Vegas is pretty ridiculous , so that posturing has fallen by the wayside A new team close to the newly renamed Arizona squad and California s big three is all but assured , the only question being when and with which other city Or should that be plural \? With all the activity going on in the Seattle area in the last little bit it would be quite a stretch to imagine that much time and effort being spent by so many wealthy men being frittered away for nothing At the moment there are no surefire plans to build a new rink , but that could change at any time with Vancouver billionaire Victor Coleman among many reportedly showing interest in putting an NHL team into the city And Bettman hasn t been visiting there to see if it really does rain a lot It s been 15 years since the NHL expanded and given there are 16 teams in the east and just 14 in the west , taking in two more teams would certainly seem to make a lot of sense , the same amount of sense it made when realignment was first announced And expanding without the players getting their mitts on any of the money other than the increase in payrolls is surely tempting , at least to those owners who remember the hefty cheques they cashed for Columbus and Minnesota Whereas before the commissioner balked at expansion , this is a sample of his more recent verbal footwork There s a lot of interest We re hearing from multiple groups in Seattle and in Vegas and Kansas City and Quebec City , Bettman said to the Tribune while scoping out Target field in Minny for yet another trip to the well of outdoor games We have not decided to engage in a formal expansion process but we listen to expressions of interest It s not something we ve seriously considered yet Like hell it isn t They d have to be nuts not to be thinking about it seriously And since then things have changed for a commissioner who hates to move teams in his league no matter how dire the circumstances might appear one of the most likable aspects of his regime for most hockey fans Once the league comes to your area , it is going to stay through thick , thin and the almost impossible , as seems to be the case in Phoenix But could that long standing policy and loyalty change with the Florida situation \? True there s a lease until 2028 , but with the Panthers bleeding money , even the city of Sunrise can t seem to see the point of carrying on much longer , so perhaps one of these new cities could get an existing team after all And while Kansas City isn t really likely to be a serious contender in this expansion soup unless they re going to stretch it to four teams , saying no to Quebec City in favour of two more U S cities with no proven NHL backgrounds is almost certainly not going to happen Going back to Minnesota has been a success , and there s no question there s more money and corporate backing than ever before in Quebec Even an expansion team there in a new arena would be virtually assured of sellouts into perpetuity There will be all manner of bleating about there being insufficient talent , of course , but even if it s true , after such a long wait this trivial detail which only troubles the fans isn t going to get in the way of a financial windfall like this And any time the league decides it could use talent , they can start doing away with most of the coaches they employ whose chief calling in life is to devise ways to stop offensive players and choke the very life out of the game that s paying their salaries Expansion will be happening , and soon The only question is how many new cities will be involved",false

summer , the US has had several record smashing natural disasters over 110 large fires are burning throughout the country , especially in the West California recently had a deadly heat wave that set all time heat records in several towns , including San Francisco and after Hurricane Harvey brought unprecedented raining and flooding to Texas , Hurricane Irma swept through the Caribbean and Florida the strongest storm ever recorded in the Atlantic Ocean outside of the Caribbean and the Gulf of Mexico Although it s impossible to attribute any one of these single events to climate change , the signals are clear , scientists say \( That kind of attribution may be possible with certain kinds of modeling studies those studies have not yet been conducted \) These extreme weather events are very consistent with what climate change is expected to bring in the years ahead global weirding Extreme weather events become more extreme , and climate change is loading the dice toward more extreme floods , heat waves , droughts , and hurricanes , says Michael Mann , a climatologist and director of the Earth System Science Center at Pennsylvania State University , in an email to The Verge We shouldn t be surprised we re turning up snake eyes so often now This is going to be the future Mann s not alone in thinking this summer has the shape of things to come This is going to be the future , says David Titley , a meteorologist and director of the Center for Solutions to Weather and Climate Risk at Penn State The future is going to have stronger heat waves , more wildfires , heavier rain storms , and a greater number of very intense hurricanes , Titley says At some point , our luck will run out It s wrong to say that climate change caused this summer s extreme weather events , scientists say Hurricanes and fires have occurred in the past , after all But undoubtedly climate change is playing a role , says Kevin Trenberth , a distinguished senior scientist at the National Center for Atmospheric Research These extreme weather events are being exacerbated by the climate change element So here s the role climate change might have played in this summer s record breaking heat waves , wildfires , and hurricanes Heat wavesOver Labor Day weekend , California was broiled by a record setting heat wave that killed six people San Francisco reached 106 degrees Fahrenheit , the hottest it s ever been since record keeping started about 150 years ago \( The previous record was 103 degrees Fahrenheit , set in 2000 \) A few other cities broke heat records , as well In June , Phoenix , Arizona , also hit a daily record , reaching 119 degrees Fahrenheit Update One additional all time record high temp to report from recent heat event 6 all time record warm overnight lows CAwx CAheatwave pic twitter com Xdl63XZQUV NWS Bay Area \( NWSBayArea \) September 5 , 2017Heat waves are the simplest weather event to attribute to climate change , says Adam Sobel , an atmospheric scientist at Lamont Doherty Earth Observatory and head of Columbia University s Initiative on Extreme Weather and Climate A variety of studies have shown that a warming climate increases the chances of heat waves and how severe those heat waves are going to be , Sobel says The world s average temperature has increased roughly by 1 53 degrees Fahrenheit from 1880 to 2012 , according to the Intergovernmental Panel on Climate Change That may not seem like a lot , but if we don t keep global warming well below 3 6 degrees Fahrenheit , we could see irreversible changes like melting polar ice caps , extensive flooding , bleached coral reefs , food shortages , and deadly diseases As temperatures rise , there s a greater chance of getting more intense heat waves and setting new heat records , says Sobel WildfiresAll over the US , there are more than 110 large fires , burning through almost 2 million acres of land , including more than 80 wildfires in the western part of the country These fires are making it hard to breathe all over the Pacific Northwest It s very unusual to have this many fires burning this many acres across such a broad area at this time in September , National Interagency Fire Center spokeswoman Jennifer Jones told Reuters So far this year , we ve had more than 48 , 000 fires , burning more than 8 million acres of land , 2 million acres over the national yearly average from 2007 to 2016 An image taken on September 4th by the NOAA NASA 's Suomi NPP satellite shows the direct path of the smoke from the West Coast fires that stretches across the entire countryPhoto NASA image courtesy Jeff Schmaltz LANCE EOSDIS MODIS Rapid Response Team , GSFCThere are several ingredients required for wildfires some connected to climate change and some that have nothing to do with it But dry conditions and extreme heat create good tinder , making wildfires worse in certain areas , says Benjamin Bond Lamberty , an ecosystem ecologist with the Joint Global Change Research Institute A warmer planet will cause more water to evaporate off the landscapes , drying trees and grasses which then burn more easily That sets the stage for increased fire , Bond Lamberty says Climate change can also make forests more prone to burning , since some pests can spread more readily in warmer temperatures , Bond Lamberty says The mountain pine beetle , for instance , is thriving because warmer winters don t kill its larvae , allowing the beetles to spread and kill more trees , which serve as fuel That really sets up a lot of forest ready for things like a wildfire , he says Flames spread on a moonlit night at the La Tuna Fire on September 2nd near Burbank , California Los Angeles Mayor Eric Garcetti said at a news conference that officials believe the fire , which is at 5 , 000 acres and growing , is the largest fire ever in LA Photo by David McNew Getty ImagesOf course , climate change alone doesn t cause wildfires lightning or people are still required A Forest Service policy of suppressing fires over much of the 20th century has also made our forests older , and more prone to burning We re still paying the cost of that 20th century policy , Bond Lamberty says There s a big accumulation of fuel built up on the landscape Still , climate change might already have an effect A study last year found that in the West , climate change has doubled the area affected by forest fires over the last 30 years Washington state had its biggest fire in state history in 2015 , breaking its 2014 record , says Amy Snover , the director of the University of Washington s Climate Impacts Group The fire season has also lengthened , starting a month earlier in Alaska , she writes in an email to The Verge HurricanesThis hurricane season has been incredibly active , with a number of severe storms First , Hurricane Harvey barreled into Texas , dumping record rains and causing unprecedented flooding in cities like Houston Then , Hurricane Katia struck the east coast of Mexico , and Hurricane Irma a Category 5 hurricane and one of the strongest storms ever recorded in the Atlantic wreaked havoc on the Caribbean \( Irma smashed a bunch of other records \) Another hurricane , called Jose , followed Irma , but now it seems the storm may remain out in the ocean Floodwaters surround homes on September 7th in Richwood , Texas Over a week after Hurricane Harvey hit Southern Texas , residents are beginning the long process of recovering from the storm Photo by Justin Sullivan Getty ImagesThe intensity of these hurricanes seem to match what climate scientists are expecting in the future , says Titley Research shows that strong hurricanes , like Harvey and Irma , will become more frequent as the planet warms , says Suzana Camargo , a professor of ocean and climate physics at Lamont Doherty Earth Observatory at Columbia University Climate change is expected to affect hurricanes in a few ways warmer ocean waters will provide more energy to these storms , and more moisture in the atmosphere will increase the amount of rain these hurricanes can dump Rising sea levels will also make storm surge from hurricanes worse , leading to higher floods Whether climate change is already affecting hurricanes is up for debate , Sobel and Camargo say It s true that Harvey was fueled by warmer than usual waters in the Gulf of Mexico , but it was also particularly destructive because it stalled over Texas for a few days , dumping unprecedented amounts of rain It s still an open question whether climate change has anything to do with wind patterns , Titley says And we don t have enough data on hurricanes to understand whether stronger storms like Harvey and Irma are part of a larger trend , Sobel says Boats , cars and other debris clog waterways in the Florida Keys two days after Hurricane Irma slammed into the state September 12th , 2017 in Marathon , Florida Photo by Chip Somodevilla Getty Images The change might be there but it s hard to prove it , he says It s like you re listening to somebody talking quietly in a loud room You may not be able to hear them but that doesn t mean they re not talking Whether we can attribute Harvey and Irma directly to climate change , however , kind of misses the point , Titley says People can see that these changes are coming and they are very consistent with what the vast majority of climate scientists have told us for decades is going to happen , he says We should n't really be surprised Climate change is a known threat multiplier this summer s extreme weather events are just a taste of what s about to come and the sooner we address climate change , the better off we ll be That means lowering greenhouse gas emissions and building infrastructure that can survive sea level rise , for instance By and large , I think most of us don t really like the change what we ve seen , Titley says , and the climate system is kind of saying , Hey guys , you ain t seen nothing yet Next Up In Science",false

"We have the highest \( corporate tax rates \) in the world right now Pat Toomey on Sunday , January 2nd , 2011 in an interview on NBC 's Meet the Press Pat Toomey says U S has highest corporate tax rates in the worldBy Louis Jacobson on Monday , January 3rd , 2011 at 4 50 p m Sen elect Pat Toomey , R Pa , said during a Meet the Press roundtable that the U S has the world 's highest corporate tax rates We wondered whether he was correct On the Jan 2 , 2011 , edition of NBC 's Meet the Press , Sen elect Pat Toomey , R Pa , cited a striking statistic in urging the United States to lower its corporate tax rates Asked by host David Gregory about possible areas where President Barack Obama and congressional Republicans can work together , Toomey suggested several areas , including taxes I think tax policy is a possible area , one with plenty of landmines but plenty of opportunities , Toomey said Simplify the code , lower rates We should be lowering corporate tax rates because we have the highest in the world right now \( Later in the roundtable discussion , Yale Law School professor Stephen Carter repeated the statistic , but we 'll check Toomey 's quote here \) We wondered whether the U S really has the highest corporate tax rates in the world Using the most straightforward definition of corporate tax rates , Toomey is right The Organization for Economic Cooperation and Development , a group of 32 large , industrialized democracies , ranks the combined corporate income tax rate in its member nations That means the highest tax bracket for general corporate income , excluding taxes levied on specific products or services For 2010 , the U S ranks second to Japan by a fraction of a percentage point 39 54 percent for Japan to 39 21 percent for the U S But that figure is already outdated Japan has recently moved to cut its rate for 2011 by 5 percentage points , leaving the U S with the highest corporate tax rate among OECD nations But before we declare Toomey 's statement True , let 's dig a little deeper The OECD rate is the statutory rate that is , the top corporate tax rate on the books But many companies pay considerably less than that , due to deductions and other exclusions Adjusting for these factors produces a statistic called the effective tax rate The World Bank has assembled data from 183 nations and made a series of statistical adjustments to produce a full international comparison of effective tax rates By this measurement , the U S rate is considerably lower than the published rate 27 6 percent But in a comparative sense , that 's still pretty high Among larger international economies , only Japan , New Zealand and Thailand produced a higher effective rate in the World Bank study And Japan 's number should fall by the time next year 's study comes out The World Bank also produces another and broader statistic This measure factors in not only the corporate profit tax but also a range of other taxes paid by businesses , including the cost of employee taxes borne by the employer When the World Bank ranked countries from the lowest level of taxes to the highest , the U S ranked 124th out of 183 meaning corporate taxes were relatively high A number of other large and or democratic countries were higher , including Austria , Belgium , Brazil , China , France , Hungary , India , Italy , Spain and Sweden This last measure provides a wider snapshot of U S tax policy toward businesses , but it also introduces some complications Factoring in the employer paid portion of labor taxes makes the corporate tax rate seem higher in countries that provide higher benefits such as pensions or health care through business taxes , while making the rate seem lower for countries that provide less generous benefits through the tax code So making apples to apples comparisons can be tricky There 's also broader context that Toomey does n't get into In a previous item , we noted that when all taxes , including those such as personal income taxes and property taxes not just corporate taxes are taken into account and compared to gross domestic product , the U S does n't rank near the top of the OECD table in total tax burden Still , if you rate Toomey on his specific wording by looking at corporate tax rates , he 's right that the U S does now have the highest corporate tax rates on the books , at least among the biggest industrialized democracies , which is most economists' typical yardstick So we rate his statement Mostly True Advertisement",true

"BABY IN A BOX B F Skinner Ladies Home Journal , October 1945 In that brave new world which science is preparing for the housewife of the future , the young mother has apparently been forgotten Almost nothing has been done to ease her lot by simplifying and improving the care of babies When we decided to have another child , my wife and I felt that it was time to apply a little labor saving invention and design to the problems of the nursery We began by going over the disheartening schedule of the young mother , step by step We asked only one question Is this practice important for the physical and psychological health of the baby \? When it was not , we marked it for elimination Then the gadgeteering began The result was an inexpensive apparatus in which our baby daughter has now been living for eleven months Her remarkable good health and happiness and my wife s welcome leisure have exceeded our most optimistic predictions , and we are convinced that a new deal for both mother and baby is at hand We tackled first the problem of warmth The usual solution is to wrap the baby in half a dozen layers of cloth shirt , nightdress , sheet , and blankets This is never completely successful The baby is likely to be found steaming in its own fluids or lying cold and uncovered Schemes to prevent uncovering may be dangerous , and in fact they have sometimes even proved fatal Clothing and bedding also interfere with normal exercise and growth and keep the baby from taking comfortable postures or changing posture during sleep They also encourage rashes and sores Nothing can be said for the system on the score of convenience , because frequent changes and launderings are necessary Why not , we thought , dispense with clothing altogether except for the diaper , which serves another purpose and warm the space in which the baby lives \? This should be a simple technical problem in the modern home Our solution is a closed compartment about as spacious as a standard crib \( Figure 1 \) The walls are well insulated , and one side , which can be raised like a window , is a large pane of safety glass The heating is electrical , and special precautions have been taken to insure accurate control After a little experimentation we found that our baby , when first home from the hospital , was completely comfortable and relaxed without benefit of clothing at about 86 F As she grew older , it was possible to lower the temperature by easy stages Now , at eleven months , we are operating at about 78 , with a relative humidity of 50 per cent Raising or lowering the temperature by more than a degree or two produces a surprising change in the baby s condition and behavior This response is so sensitive that we wonder how a comfortable temperature is ever reached with clothing and blankets The discovery , which pleased us most , was that crying and fussing could always be stopped by slightly lowering the temperature During the first three months , it is true , the baby would also cry when wet or hungry , but in that case she would stop when changed or fed During the past six months she has not cried at all except for a moment or tow when injured or sharply distressed for example , when inoculated The lung exercise which so often is appealed to reassure the mother of a baby who cries a good deal takes the much pleasanter form of shouts and gurgles How much of this sustained cheerfulness is due to the temperature is hard to say , because the baby enjoys many other kinds of comfort She sleeps in curious postures , not half of which would be possible under securely fastened blankets When awake , she exercises almost constantly and often with surprising violence Her leg , stomach , and back muscles are especially active and have become strong and hard It is necessary to watch this performance for only a few minutes to realize how severely restrained the average baby is , and how much energy must be diverted into the only remaining channel crying A wider range and variety of behavior are also encouraged by the freedom from clothing For example , our baby acquitted an amusing , almost apelike skill in the use of her feet We have devised a number of toys , which are occasionally suspended from the ceiling of the compartment She often plays with these with her feet alone and with her hands and feet in close cooperation One toy is a ring suspended from a modified music box A note can be played by pulling the ring downward , and a series of rapid jerks will produce Three Blind Mice At seven months our baby would grasp the ring in her toes , stretch out her leg and play the tune with a rhythmic movement of her foot We are not especially interested in developing skills of this sort , but they are valuable for the baby because they arouse and hold her interest Many babies seem to cry from sheer boredom their behavior is restrained and they have nothing else to do In our compartment , the waking hours are invariably active and happy ones Freedom from clothes and bedding is especially important for the older baby who plays and falls asleep off and on during the day Unless the mother is constantly on the alert , it is hard to cover the baby promptly when it falls asleep and to remove and arrange sheets and blankets as soon as it is ready to play All this is now unnecessary Remember that these advantages for the baby do not mean additional labor or attention on the part of the mother On the contrary , there is an almost unbelievable saving in time and effort For one thing , there is no bed to be made or changed The mattress is a tightly stretched canvas , which is kept dry by warm air A single bottom sheet operates like a roller towel 1 It is stored on a spool outside the compartment at one end and passes into a wire hamper at the other It is ten yards long and lasts a week A clean section can be locked into place in a few seconds The time which is usually spent in changing clothes is also saved This is especially important in the early months When we take the baby up for feeding or play , she is wrapped in a small blanket or a simple nightdress Occasionally she is dressed up for fun or for her play period But that is all The wrapping blanket , roller sheet , and the usual diapers are the only laundry actually required Time and labor are also saved because the air which passes through the compartment is thoroughly filtered The baby s eyes , ears , and nostrils remain fresh and clean A weekly bath is enough , provided the face and diaper region are frequently washed These little attentions are easy because the compartment is at waist level 1The canvas and endless sheet arrangement was soon replaced with a single layer of woven plastic , which would be cleaned and instantly wiped dry It takes about one and one half hours each day to feed , change , and otherwise care for the baby This includes everything except washing diapers and preparing formula We are not interested in reducing the time any further As a baby grows older , it needs a certain amount of social stimulation And after all , when unnecessary chores have been eliminated , taking care of a baby is fun An unforeseen dividend has been the contribution to the baby s good health Our pediatrician readily approved the plan before the baby was born , and he has followed the results enthusiastically from month to month Here are some points on the health score When the baby was only ten days old , we could place her in the preferred face down position without danger of smothering , and she has slept that way ever since , with the usual advantages She has always enjoyed deep and extended sleep , and her feeding and eliminative habits have been extraordinarily regular She has never had a stomach upset , and she has never missed a daily bowel movement The compartment is relatively free of spray and air borne infection , as well as dust and allergic substances Although there have been colds in the family , it has been easy to avoid contagion , and the baby has completely escaped The neighborhood children troop in to see her , but they see her through glass and keep their school age diseases to themselves She has never had a diaper rash We have also enjoyed the advantages of a fixed daily routine Child specialists are still not agreed as to whether the mother should watch the baby or the clock , but no one denies that a strict schedule saves time , for the mother can plan her day in advance and find time for relaxation or freedom for other activities The trouble is that a routine acceptable to the baby often conflicts with the schedule of the household Our compartment helps out here in two ways Even in crowded living quarters it can be kept free of unwanted lights and sounds The insulated walls muffle all ordinary noises , and a curtain can be drawn down over the window The result is that , in the space taken by a standard crib , the baby has in effect a separate room We are never concerned lest the doorbell , telephone , piano , or children at play wake the baby , and we can therefore let her set up any routine she likes But a more interesting possibility is that her routine may be changed to suit our convenience A good example of this occurred when we dropped her schedule from four to three meals per day The baby began to wake up in the morning about an hour before we wanted to feed her This annoying habit , once established , may persist for months However , by slightly raising the temperature during the night we were able to postpone her demand for breakfast The explanation is simple The evening meal is used by the baby mainly to keep herself warm during the night How long it lasts will depend in part upon how fast heat is absorbed by the surrounding air One advantage not to be overlooked is that the soundproofing also protects the family from the baby ! Our intentions in this direction were misunderstood by some of our friends We were never put to the test , because there was no crying to contend with , but it was never our policy to use the compartment in order to let the baby cry it out Every effort should be made to discover just why a baby cries But if the condition cannot be remedied , there is no reason why the family , and perhaps the neighborhood as well , must suffer \( Such a compartment , by the way , might persuade many a landlord to drop a no babies rule , since other tenants can be completely protected \) Before the baby was born , when we were still building the apparatus , some of the friends and acquaintances who had heard about what we proposed to do were rather shocked Mechanical dish washers , garbage disposers , air cleaners , and other laborsaving devices were all very fine , but a mechanical baby tender that was carrying science too far ! However , all the specific objections , which were raised against the plan , have faded way in the bright light of our results A very brief acquaintance with the scheme in operation is enough to resolve all doubts Some of the toughest skeptics have become our most enthusiastic supporters One of the commonest objections was that we were gong to raise a softie who would be unprepared for the real world But instead of becoming hypersensitive , our baby has acquired a surprisingly serene tolerance for annoyances She is not bothered by the clothes she wears at playtime , she is not frightened by loud or sudden noises , she is not frustrated by toys out of reach , and she takes a lot of pummeling from her older sister like a good sport It is possible that she will have to learn to sleep in a noisy room , but adjustments of that sort are always necessary A tolerance for any annoyance can be built up by administering it in controlled dosages , rather than in the usual accidental way Certainly there is no reason to annoy the child throughout the whole of its infancy , merely to prepare it for later childhood It is not , of course , the favorable conditions to which people object , but the fact that in our compartment they are artificial All of them occur naturally in one favorable environment or another , where the same objection should apply but is never raised It is quite in the spirit of the world of the future to make favorable conditions available everywhere through simple mechanical means A few critics have objected that they would not like to live in such a compartment themselves they feel that it would stifle them or give them claustrophobia The baby obviously does not share in this opinion The compartment is well ventilated and much more spacious than a Pullman berth , considering the size of the occupant The baby cannot get out , of course , but that is true of a crib as well There is less actual restraint in the compartment because the baby is freer to move about The plain fact is that she is perfectly happy She has never tried to get out nor resisted being put back in , and that seems to be the final test Another early objection was that the baby would be socially starved and robbed of the affection and mother love , which she needs This has simply not been true The compartment does not ostracize the baby The large window is no more of a social barrier than the bars of a crib The baby follows what is going on in the room , smiles at passers by , plays peek a boo games , and obviously delights in company And she is handled , talked to , and played with whenever she is changed or fed , and each afternoon during a play period , which is becoming longer as she grows older The fact is that a baby will probably get more love and affection when it is easily cared for , because the mother is likely to feel overworked and resentful of the demands made upon her She will express her love in a practical way and give the baby genuinely affectionate care It is common practice to advise the troubled mother to be patient and tender and to enjoy her baby And , of course , that is what any baby needs But is is the exceptional mother who can fill this prescription upon demand , especially if there are other children in the family and she has no help We need to go one step further and teat the mother with affection also Simplified childcare will give mother love a chance A similar complaint was that such an apparatus would encourage neglect But easier care is sure to be better care The mother will resist the temptation to put the baby back into a damp bed if she can conjure up a dry one in five seconds She may very well spend less time with her baby , but babies do not suffer from being left alone but only from the discomforts , which arise from being , left alone in the ordinary crib How long do we intend to keep the baby in the compartment \? The baby will answer that in time , but almost certainly until she is two years old , or perhaps three After the first year of course , she will spend a fair part of each day in a playpen or out of doors The compartment takes the place of a crib and will get about the same use Eventually it will serve as sleeping quarters only",false
"Yet it remains all too possible that health care reform will fail , as it has so many times before I m not that worried about the issue of costs Yes , the Congressional Budget Office s preliminary cost estimates for Senate plans were higher than expected , and caused considerable consternation last week But the fundamental fact is that we can afford universal health insurance even those high estimates were less than the 1 8 trillion cost of the Bush tax cuts Furthermore , Democratic leaders know that they have to pass a health care bill for the sake of their own survival One way or another , the numbers will be brought in line The real risk is that health care reform will be undermined by centrist Democratic senators who either prevent the passage of a bill or insist on watering down key elements of reform I use scare quotes around centrist , by the way , because if the center means the position held by most Americans , the self proclaimed centrists are in fact way out in right field What the balking Democrats seem most determined to do is to kill the public option , either by eliminating it or by carrying out a bait and switch , replacing a true public option with something meaningless For the record , neither regional health cooperatives nor state level public plans , both of which have been proposed as alternatives , would have the financial stability and bargaining power needed to bring down health care costs Whatever may be motivating these Democrats , they don t seem able to explain their reasons in public Please verify you 're not a robot by clicking the box Invalid email address Please re enter You must select a newsletter to subscribe to You agree to receive occasional updates and special offers for The New York Times 's products and services Thank you for subscribing An error has occurred Please try again later You are already subscribed to this email Thus Senator Ben Nelson of Nebraska initially declared that the public option which , remember , has overwhelming popular support was a deal breaker Why \? Because he didn t think private insurers could compete At the end of the day , the public plan wins the day Um , isn t the purpose of health care reform to protect American citizens , not insurance companies \? Mr Nelson softened his stand after reform advocates began a public campaign targeting him for his position on the public option And Senator Kent Conrad of North Dakota offers a perfectly circular argument we can t have the public option , because if we do , health care reform won t get the votes of senators like him Honestly , I don t know what these Democrats are trying to achieve Yes , some of the balking senators receive large campaign contributions from the medical industrial complex but who in politics doesn t \? If I had to guess , I d say that what s really going on is that relatively conservative Democrats still cling to the old dream of becoming kingmakers , of recreating the bipartisan center that used to run America But this fantasy can t be allowed to stand in the way of giving America the health care reform it needs This time , the alleged center must not hold A version of this op ed appears in print on , on Page A21 of the New York edition with the headline Health Care Showdown",true

"FORT KNOX , KY In an effort to increase soldiers interchangeability and world wide assignment eligibility , the Army has announced that married individuals will no longer be considered for enlistment , and all active duty married soldiers must divorce their spouses within thirty days or be subject to administrative separation in accordance with AR 600 8 2 Dependents must return to their home of record at their own expense What we re seeing is an awful lot of dependents in the Army community , who let s be honest contribute nothing to military readiness , said Army Secretary John McHugh to reporters They distract our married soldiers from putting the mission first , and they suck up a huge amount of resources McHugh pointed to Army spouse and family wellness programs like the Family Readiness Group , the MyCAA spouse education program , Army Community Services , and the Army Family Action Plan , which cost the Army roughly 475 million a year to maintain In addition , you have the DEERS system and the DoDDS school system , which cost a fortune , plus the massive costs involved in providing healthcare , exchange and commissary services to dependents There s also the higher cost of living allowances and all the other allotments to which married soldiers are entitled But there s also the elephant in the room the spiraling cost of married soldiers housing Unlike single soldiers , who live in on post barracks and often live two to four per room , which is more space than anyone really needs anyway , said McHugh , married soldiers enjoy lavishly opulent housing accommodations at government expense , with one , sometimes two bathrooms , a full kitchen , even a backyard in most cases You can t tell me that a family of five NEEDS a three bedroom house In this time of fiscal austerity , it s a luxury that we can no longer afford Army leaders applauded the move , calling it long overdue This is more than I could have ever hoped for Finally , we can put our soldiers wherever we need them without having to worry about their do nothing families causing problems for us , said one USAREUR command sergeant major , who had previously called for the ending of all command sponsored overseas tours Seriously , I can t tell you how many times I had some whiny soldier ask to leave the field or return early from a deployment because their wife had another baby , or she crashed her car and wound up in the hospital , or their kid had a seizure or something Plus , housing has always been an issue at OCONUS duty stations in Europe , where we just don t have the housing facilities to accommodate families , and oftentimes have to put married soldiers up in off post government leased apartments , which is a huge expense Now that these married soldiers are going to become geo bachelors , we ll have a lot more flexibility in our billeting options The move will likely generate intense backlash among married soldiers who will be affected by the policy change The simple fact is , these soldiers joined an all volunteer Army , McHugh said If the Army wanted its soldiers to have families , they d have been issued one However , the reaction among married soldiers was sharply negative If this doesn t just beat all , said SFC Gregory Martineau , of 1st Battalion , 508th Infantry , 4th BCT , 82nd Airborne Division , an eighteen year Army veteran who is married with four children I ve never regretted my service until now Martineau would have been eligible to retire in two years , but now will separate with no retirement benefits because he s unwilling to comply with the new policy If I wanted to join a service branch that craps all over families , I d have joined the Marines At least they re up front about it",false
"A homeless mother in Connecticut has been charged with theft of education expenses totaling nearly 16 , 000 after it was discovered that she registered her son for school using the babysitter 's address The Stamford Advocate reports A homeless woman from Bridgeport who enrolled her 6 year old son at a Norwalk elementary school has become the first in the city to be charged with stealing more than 15 , 000 for the cost of her child 's education Tanya McDowell , 33 , whose last known address was 66 Priscilla St , Bridgeport , was charged Thursday with first degree larceny and conspiracy to commit first degree larceny for allegedly stealing 15 , 686 from Norwalk schools She was released after posting a 25 , 000 bond McDowell 's babysitter , Ana Rebecca Marques , was also evicted from her Roodner Court public housing apartment for providing documents to enroll the child at Brookside Elementary School According to the story , McDowell was primarily sleeping at a home in a different city , although she could not be there during the days , and also spent time at a local shelter The boy went to the sitter 's house daily after school An argument could be made that as they had no permanent home , there is no reason why the babysitter 's house is n't a place of residence , as it was a place he went to daily and had more permanence than their other living situations appeared to However , the school disagreed and decided after an investigation to press charges against the mother , claiming theft The Chair of the board of education admits the move is unusual normally a child found attending school out of district is just sent away Others are speculating why this case became the case that the district appears to be interested in using to set an example in order to discourage other parents from attempting to send their children to school with false addresses , especially since the mother obviously has no ability to pay for the theft A lawyer involved in a similar case wonders why they would n't choose to go after someone where they may have a chance to get reimbursement back for the educational costs while making their point Could it be that the district is less concerned about sending a general example and more concerned about sending one geared to a specific audience \?

"By Amanda Froelich People who refuse chemotherapy treatment live on average 12 and a half years longer than people who undergo chemotherapy , says Dr Jones chemotherapy doesn t work 97 of the time According to recent statistics , approximately 1 in 2 men and 1 in 3 women will develop cancer in their lifetimes This saddening reality is made worse when it is acknowledged that modern methods of treating the disease are often ineffective and only make the symptoms of the disease worse In fact , according to one Berkeley doctor , In the eye opening video above , Dr Hardin B Jones , a former professor of medical physics and physiology at the University of California , Berkeley , discusses how leading edge cancer treatment is a sham He has personally studied the life expectancy of patients for more than 25 years and has come to the conclusion that chemotherapy does more harm than good The bone chilling realization prompted Dr Jones to speak out against the billion dollar cancer industry People who refused chemotherapy treatment live on average 12 and a half years longer than people who are undergoing chemotherapy , said Dr Jones of his study , which was published in the New York Academy of Science People who accepted chemotherapy die within three years of diagnosis , a large number dies immediately after a few weeks According to the physician , the only reason doctors prescribe chemotherapy is because they make money from it Such an accusation doesn t seem unreasonable , as cancer treatment runs , on average , between 300 , 000 1 , 000 , 000 per treatment Patients with breast cancer who reject conventional therapy live four times longer than those who follow the system So this is something that you will not hear in the mass media , which will continue the myth Despite the fact that the United States spends more on healthcare than any other high income nation in the world , diseases of affluence continue to increase in prevalence , resulting in a shorter life expectancy Perhaps this is because mainstream media and the allopathic healthcare system don t teach about the importance of preventative medicine Eating a healthy diet , engaging in exercise , thinking positive thoughts , reducing stress , and enjoying the company of others or habits that bring joy are all proven to improve longevity and happiness As it is , there is no money in a healthy population , which is why fast food joints and pharmaceutical industries thrive in America Hopefully , Dr Jones efforts will inspire people to seek out alternative options if they or someone they know develops the debilitating disease What are your thoughts \?

"PolitiFact Sheet 8 things to know about the Planned Parenthood controversyBy Will Cabaniss , Joshua Gillin on Wednesday , August 5th , 2015 at 11 32 a m The Center for Medical Progress , an anti abortion group , recorded undercover video of Dr Mary Gatter , Planned Parenthood Federation of America s Medical Directors Council president , discussing fetal tissue donations Controversial videos released by an anti abortion group have highlighted the murky guidelines for using fetal tissue for research purposes The group , called the Center for Medical Progress , has accused Planned Parenthood of selling aborted fetuses for a profit , a charge Planned Parenthood has denied One of its videos , recorded in secret and released July 14 , 2015 , shows members of the anti abortion group posing as tissue brokers discussing terms for procuring fetal tissue To some , it appeared that Planned Parenthood was proposing to illegally sell tissue , prompting lawmakers in several states to launch investigations and Republicans in Congress to attempt cutting off more than 500 million in federal money But Planned Parenthood maintains that its process is legal and limited to a handful of states Confused about what s going on \? We re here to help Here s our rundown of eight things we know and don t know about fetal tissue donation and Planned Parenthood 1 It is illegal to sell fetal tissue But donations are legal The National Institutes of Health Revitalization Act of 1993 allows a woman to consent to donating fetal tissue after an abortion The federal law sets restrictions that prevent the woman from knowing or having a say in how the tissue is used , or profiting from it Fetuses also can t be aborted for the specific purpose of using tissue , especially to sell it The option can t be discussed with the woman until after she has decided to have an abortion Researchers have used fetal tissue since the 1930s experimentation on the tissue was instrumental in eventually developing the polio vaccine Current studies are using the tissue to research diseases like AIDS , muscular dystrophy and Parkinson s disease 2 The law allows for reasonable fees to cover the group s costs of donating the tissue Part of the video shows Deborah Nucatola , senior director of medical services at the Planned Parenthood Federation of America , telling undercover activists that tissues can be obtained for fees in the 30 to 100 range Activists against abortion rights point to this as proof that Planned Parenthood is selling the body parts of aborted children But the 1993 law also makes allowances for reasonable payments associated with the transportation , implantation , processing , preservation , quality control , or storage of human fetal tissue The fees Nucatola discusses in the video likely fall under that definition , experts told PolitiFact 3 Nothing specifies how much appropriate fees should be What counts as a reasonable payment is not explicitly outlined in the law Organizations don t have to publicly report how much they are charging buyers that process the tissue and isolate specific cells before selling them to researchers Activists in the videos were posing as brokers and went back and forth with Nucatola to get her to disclose Planned Parenthood s fees The amounts she cites do not appear to be out of the ordinary , but no one knows because there is no registry or compendium of fees charged by organizations \( or \) institutions supplying fetal tissue , said Arthur Caplan , director of the Division of Medical Ethics at New York University s Langone Medical Center When she haggles about fees , that does not appear to me to be trying to profit 4 There are no regulations for what brokers charge researchers , either While abortion clinics or hospitals sometimes provide tissue directly to researchers , organizations or private companies like the tissue brokers mentioned above often act as middlemen Profiteering may be occurring on this level , Caplan said Caplan said brokers can resell tissue to researchers at what seem like fairly high markups , but regulations do n't exist on fees , so what they charge is set by market California based StemExpress is one such broker and is cited in one of the Center for Medical Progress videos as contracting with Planned Parenthood for fetal tissue The company charges fees for many kinds of human cells , from 100 for a vial of peripheral blood to 24 , 000 for a vial of highly concentrated fetal liver cells The company reported 2 2 million in revenue in 2013 , according to a profile in Inc Magazine Prue Talbot , the director of the Stem Cell Center at the University of California , Riverside , agreed with a StemExpress statement that said research methods and expensive medical equipment are expensive Talbot said skilled technicians that can isolate and preserve specific kinds of cells also command high salaries , driving up costs 5 Political pressure is driving the issue in some states Since the videos were released , at least 12 states , including Florida , Texas , Georgia and South Carolina , have called for investigations into the organization s tissue program States follow the federal law , but Wisconsin legislators have vowed to ban fetal tissue donation in the fall Louisiana Gov Bobby Jindal , a presidential candidate , canceled his state s contract with Planned Parenthood even though the two facilities in that state don t offer abortion services It is against the law for any organization to sell body parts , Florida Gov Rick Scott said on July 29 If a Planned Parenthood office is not following the law , we will move quickly to take legal and regulatory action against them Florida 's health services agency announced Aug 5 that three facilities would be cited for performing second trimester abortions without a proper license and a fourth will be cited for improper recordkeeping following its investigation 6 Planned Parenthood says it only has donation programs in a few states But we don t know which ones Planned Parenthood president Cecile Richards has said her organization conducts tissue donations in less than five states But no one not from Planned Parenthood , its state affiliates or companies that procure the stem cells will disclose the states where this happens A spokeswoman for the Planned Parenthood Federation of America , the organization s national wing , cited security concerns So far , affiliates in Maine , Vermont , New Hampshire , Indiana and Florida have denied having any form of a tissue donation program 7 Federal law does not require Planned Parenthood to disclose this information on their tax forms You may think that because Planned Parenthood receives federal money , it has to disclose more information about its business , including the fetal tissue donation locations But that s not the case Planned Parenthood is a network of affiliated organizations that cooperate with each other , led by the Planned Parenthood Federation of America As a registered 501 \( c \) \( 4 \) nonprofit , each affiliate only has to release a yearly tax report called a Form 990 On the 990 , those affiliates have to list their five largest contractors , but don t have to provide any other details about their operations 8 Abortions do not make up the majority of Planned Parenthood s services But neither do mammograms The tissue donation controversy has reignited the country s abortion wars , with advocates and critics alike slinging statistics about what Planned Parenthood really does In a recent interview with GOP presidential candidate Mike Huckabee , Fox Business reporter Smith said almost 95 percent of all their pregnancy services were abortions That rates False The cherry picked statistic traces back to a political action committee that opposes abortion By the group s measure , which considered only Planned Parenthood s reported abortions , prenatal care services and adoption referrals , abortions made up 94 percent of Planned Parenthood s pregnancy services But the majority of Planned Parenthood s work does not focus on prenatal care , and the group does not keep records on how many pregnant women it refers to outside health care providers Democratic presidential candidate and former Maryland Gov Martin O Malley went the opposite direction , telling reporters 97 percent of the work that Planned Parenthood does is about mammograms and preventative health That rates Half True The 97 percent figure accounts for services other than abortion , including contraception , STD testing and treatment , cancer screenings , and more Preventive care comprises about 85 to 90 percent of all their services Mammograms are part of that group , but Planned Parenthood doesn t offer mammograms They perform breast exams and give referrals to outside clinics that provide mammograms Editor 's note Hours after this story was published , Florida announced the results of its investigation into Planned Parenthood The piece has been

"The 2016 Election has been a roller coaster of emotions and scandals for everyone involved But if Donald Trump somehow gets elected and if the early days of his presidency look anything like his campaign , he may find himself becoming particularly familiar with the 25th Amendment to the U S Constitution So what is the 25th Amendment \? Ratified and adopted in 1967 following the assassination of John F Kennedy , the 25th Amendment lays out the rules of succession in the case of a president 's death , resignation , removal , or incapacitation The key part of the 25th Amendment for a Trump presidency is Section Four , which gives the vice president , backed by the majority of the executive cabinet , the power to declare the president unable to serve and assume the role of acting president In such a case , we would all be waving bye bye to President Trump and hello to President Mike Pence If Trump were to object to this action , the decision would be left up to a two thirds vote in Congress Considering the number of senators and representatives who opposed a Trump presidency , the odds of Trump winning a congressional vote are unlikely MANDEL NGAN AFP Getty Images Pence invoking the 25th Amendment would be a move straight out of a political thriller , and though the first three sections of the amendment have been cited before , the fourth never has The last time the 25th Amendment was used , in 2007 , President George Bush cited Section Three to temporarily transfer his powers to Vice President Dick Cheney before undergoing a colonoscopy Bush reassumed his powers only a couple hours later Possible reasons for Pence to invoke the 25th Amendment could include anything from a classic Trumpian outburst in which he \( if elected \) threatens to act against the wishes of his party to yet another revelation of Trump 's sexual misconduct In any case , the moment the 25th Amendment comes into play after a Inauguration Day is the moment Trump and Melania should start getting ready to move out of the White House \( if they make it there \)",true

"The President of the United States has issued an executive order \( see here \) government agencies are to use insights from behavioral sciences to better serve the American people In my view this is a good thing Science is our friend Obama s heart is in the right place Nonetheless , the order raises a number of ethical and practical issues The term behavioral sciences is a little broad However , the executive order mentions the behavioral economics and psychology of decision making as an example of what is in mind This indicates that what this order is really about is the implementation of nudge policies Some have objected to such policies on the grounds that they violate autonomy or dignity in some way Perhaps that is right , although it appears to depend on the case at hand As Cass Sunstein who has been influential for the Obama administration s stance on the importance of behavioural science has pointed out , nudges are inevitable in policy making A failure to take this into account ensures that the nudges in play will be unintentional rather than intentional Further , considerations of welfare , autonomy , and fairness may very well support nudge policies in many instances This will depend heavily on the effectiveness of the nudge policy , which itself depends in part on the quality of the behavioral science Given recent evidence that many results from experimental and social psychology fail to replicate , there might be reason to worry here The executive order does not define what counts as an insight from behavioral science Is it the result of one study \? A couple \? Deployment of an insight that is nothing more than an experimental artifact could be damaging , or wasteful Suppose a genuine insight exists Even so , implementing it is not straightforward The executive order reflects thought on this matter , as it encourages executive departments and agencies to \( i \) identify policies , programs , and operations where applying behavioral science insights may yield substantial improvements in public welfare , program outcomes , and program cost effectiveness \( ii \) develop strategies for applying behavioral science insights to programs and , where possible , rigorously test and evaluate the impact of these insights \( iii \) recruit behavioral science experts to join the Federal Government as necessary to achieve the goals of this directive and \( iv \) strengthen agency relationships with the research community to better use empirical findings from the behavioral sciences This seems like solid advice , although in practice given the state of behavioral science there is sure to be some trial and error in following it This is not a post on the ethics of horrible journalism , so I won t comment overmuch on just how silly and paranoid the response to this directive has been from various conservative publications Nor will I dignify the publications I have in mind with links But it is worth noting that beneath the scaremongering you may see regarding this directive may be a legitimate concern It is this greater government attention to behavioral science data creates a motivation to collect and analyze and implement such data more generally This is an issue much broader than the implementation of nudge policy making , but it affects this policy making as well Since the relevant kind of data can be both collected and implemented in ways we would deem unethical , it is important that government collection and use of such data be highly transparent The executive order makes provisions for a yearly report by the National Science and Technology Council that will summarize agency implementation of section 1 of this order each year until 2019 That s some transparency , but arguably not enough much more can be done to keep the public informed regarding the use of behavioral science in guiding policy Ideally , the scientists assisting in this initiative would be given explicit roles in so informing the public",false

"Facebook Employee Admits To Bernie Sanders Blackout Posted By admin March 30 , 2016This is really scary , I m a member in a lot of different groups from cars and trucks to Bernie Sanders even Hillary or Trump groups on Facebook I use them all to promote Bernie , trying to change 1 mind a day Today I was talking to a Hillary supporter within a group called Hillary VS Bernie It was a very good conversation that lasted over 2 hours with a total of 86 comments The Hillary supporters main subject was about how Hillary Tells The Truth I was trying to explain to her how Hillary lies over and over She then turned the subject into saying So does everyone even Bernie After about an hour of asking her to show any REAL proof of Bernie lying she gave up and said Look it up your self and I don t have time for you \( These statements come after 2 hours of conversation \) My last comment was going to be , Clearly you can t post any proof nor can I because he never lies But when I hit enter I got this popup I though it was just a glitch , so I refreshed the page but same thing happened \? \? \? I clicked the link and was sent to a Facebook appeal form I filled it out saying I have done nothing wrong A few hours went by and I got an email titled Your Facebook appeal PLEASE READ It was not from abuse facebook com or any of the Facebook email addresses so I first thought spam , then I was like how can anyone know I m blocked from posting anything on Facebook besides me \? The email was a guy saying he works for Facebook and to contact him via Skype This was extremely weird , but I was curious to see where this was going I added him on Skype He accepted me right away and said I m going to tell you something you may or may not believe All I ask is you do not share my email or Skype I replied back Ok but why not just contact me via a fake email and Skype then \? He said They are fake but I still feel I could be traced I said Fair enough , but what is this all about \? He said I work for Facebook , and I m reaching out to people who have been blocked on Facebook after posting keywords like FeelTheBern At this point I m kinda freaking out How does anyone know I have been blocked from posting \? They also have my personal email and know about me posting FeelTheBern He then began to explain to me Facebook is actively and automatically blocking millions of accounts with a algorithm that detects people who post keywords like FeelTheBurn I for example was banned from posting anything for 30 days due to the fact I posted FeelTheBernHe also said Quote In a staff briefing everyone was told to deny any appeal that happened due to posting political opinions \( As he laughed and said these members are banned due to spamming give them time to calm down \) I asked him why not go public with a widely viewed TV network or huge websites like HuffingtonPost \? He said I have emailed a few local news TV stations plus all the big well known websites and 100 s of Facebook users , yet I haven t seen this story get viral I told him most likely the reason huge websites or news stations won t talk about it is because they are scared to post something without having a face to back it up with But I understand why he is scared to come out He can be sued for breach of contractHe will lose his good paying jobHe would never be hired after leaking company information I promised I would do my best to get this information out to the world This is insane ! I knew the corrupt corporations ran the media but I never thought it would get down to blocking people from Facebook What can you do \? Share this post on Twitter , Facebook , YouTube , etc Contact HuffingtonPost asking them to reply to the emails sent Contact Woodland Hills , CA News station ABC7 to reply to the emails sent We can not let this subject get swept under the rug This is a 1000 times worse then corrupt corporations running Fox News This is like YouTube or Google removing any blog or video that says anything good about Bernie",false

"My 1975 'Cooling World' Story Does n't Make Today 's Climate Scientists Wrong It 's time for deniers of human caused global warming to stop using an old magazine story against climate scientists Peter Gwynne , Contributor Inside Science Minds presents an ongoing series of guest columnists and personal perspectives presented by scientists , engineers , mathematicians , and others in the science community showcasing some of the most interesting ideas in science today The opinions contained in this piece are those of the author and do not necessarily reflect those of Inside Science nor the American Institute of Physics and its Member Societies \( Inside Science \) The central fact is that , after three quarters of a century of extraordinarily mild conditions , the Earth seems to be cooling down Meteorologists disagree about the cause and extent of the cooling trend , as well as over its specific impact on local weather conditions But they are almost unanimous in the view that the trend will reduce agricultural productivity for the rest of the century Newsweek April 28 , 1975 That 's an excerpt from a story I wrote about climate science that appeared almost 40 years ago Titled The Cooling World , it was remarkably popular in fact it might be the only decades old magazine story about science ever carried onto the set of a late night TV talk show Now , as the author of that story , after decades of scientific advances , let me say this while the hypotheses described in that original story seemed right at the time , climate scientists now know that they were seriously incomplete Our climate is warming not cooling , as the original story suggested Nevertheless , certain websites and individuals that dispute , disparage and deny the science that shows that humans are causing the Earth to warm continue to quote my article Their message how can we believe climatologists who tell us that the Earth 's atmosphere is warming when their colleagues asserted that it 's actually cooling \? Well , yes , we should trust them , despite the views of detractors such as comedian Dennis Miller , who brought my story to The Tonight Show in 2006 Several atmospheric scientists did indeed believe in global cooling , as I reported in the April 28 , 1975 issue of Newsweek But that was then Photo removed May 2 , 2019 In the 39 years since , biotechnology has flowered from a promising academic topic to a major global industry , the first test tube baby has been born and become a mother herself , cosmologists have learned that the universe is expanding at an accelerating rate rather than slowing down , and particle physicists have detected the Higgs boson , an entity once regarded as only a theoretical concept Seven presidents have served most of 11 terms And Newsweek has become a shadow of its former self And on the climate front \? The vast majority of climatologists now assure us that Earth 's atmosphere is not cooling Rather it 's warming up And the main responsibility for the phenomenon lies with human activity There 's no serious dispute any more about whether the globe is warming , whether humans are responsible , and whether we will see large and dangerous changes in the future in the words of the National Academy of Sciences which we did n't know in the 1970s , said Michael Mann , a climatologist at Pennsylvania State University in University Park He added that nearly every U S scientific society has assessed the evidence and come to the same conclusion The recent National Climate Assessment takes an equally emphatic view What is new over the last decade is that we know with increasing certainty that climate change is happening now , it states While scientists continue to refine projections of the future , observations unequivocally show that climate is changing and that the warming of the past 50 years is primarily due to human induced emissions of heat trapping gases I'm sure it 's clear by now that I accept the views of the National Academy , National Climate Assessment , Mann , and the huge majority of his fellow climatologists Nevertheless , websites devoted to denying the existence of human caused climate change or at least promoting the idea that nothing should be done about it continue to use my article to validate their thinking In fact the article has reportedly become the most cited article in Newsweek 's history Those that reject climate science ignore the fact that , like other fields , climatology has evolved since 1975 The certainty that our atmosphere is indeed warming stems from a series of rigorous observations and theoretical concepts that fit into computer models and an overall framework outlining the nature of Earth 's climate These capabilities were primitive or non existent in 1975 In fact my report reflected a real strand of climatological thinking back then I was far from the only science writer to cover the possibility of global cooling Time , Science News , and the New York Times , among other media outlets , wrote about it , because some climate scientists had genuine reasons to believe that the global climate might be cooling and had published scholarly papers on the matter Speaking personally , though , I accept that I did n't tell the full story back then Indeed , the issue raises questions about the relationship between science writers and scientists as well as the attitudes toward science of individuals with political agendas Three independent strands of science at the time got conflated in the articles analyses of direct temperature data that showed a decline in temperatures particularly over the Northern Hemisphere since the 1940s a very high level of pollution by sulfate aerosols that cooled the planet and evidence that the timing of ice ages was caused by wobbles in Earth 's orbit , explained Gavin Schmidt , deputy chief of NASA 's Goddard Institute for Space Studies , in New York Indeed , he added , some parts of the article are OK even today At the same time , however , evidence had emerged of increases in the atmospheric concentration of carbon dioxide , a gas known to warm the atmosphere The science was sort of speculative in 1975 , Mann recalled A National Academy of Sciences report concluded there was n't enough information at that particular time because we had two competing forces aerosols and greenhouse gases It was n't entirely clear which would win out Ironically , efforts to clean up the atmosphere made it possible to resolve the scientific mystery and convince climatologists that human activity is warming the planet Policy actions such as the Clean Air Act of 1970 in the United States and similar initiatives in other countries aimed to reduce the amount of sulfate aerosols in the atmosphere Since those compounds primarily reflect heat , their reduction effectively gave carbon dioxide and other greenhouse gases more control over the Earth 's temperature NASA scientist James Hansen was the first to sound the alarm In 1988 , he pointed out that a sort of Faustian bargain had cleaned up the atmosphere but at the cost of worsening the greenhouse problem \( Click image to enlarge \) Hansen and other climatologists began to develop models of the climate which showed the influence of human activity , via the burning of fossil fuels , on global temperatures Observations and analyses since then have confirmed and strengthened the models and the broad understanding of climate change , along with the portion that 's due to human activity Richard Somerville , a climate scientist at the Scripps Institution of Oceanography and the University of California , San Diego , summarized the findings in an email There are many lines of observational evidence that the world is warming , including globally rising air and ocean temperatures , retreating glaciers worldwide , increasing sea level , decreasing Arctic Sea ice extent , and mass loss on the ice sheets of Greenland and Antarctica , he wrote In addition , an entire new body of climate science called 'detection and attribution' convincingly shows that the observed climate changes have distinctive space time patterns that are consistent with causes due to human activities The counterattack had started by the beginning of the 1990s The purported evidence against global warming included the news articles on cooling by myself and others Some commentators , such as Dixy Lee Ray , former chair of the Atomic Energy Commission , asserted that the articles represented climate scares that inevitably turned out to be untrue as would the idea of global warming , they asserted Others took a less subtle route The articles proved , they argued , that the atmosphere was cooling and that there was no reason to change that conclusion In that view , climate science never changes However , both types of warming deniers , along with policymakers who have consistently opposed any regulation designed to reduce acid rain , the destruction of the ozone layer , and other perceived ills , have consistently used the articles particularly mine as ammunition But that 's just one line of attack Mann suffered another starting in 1998 , after he published an article in the journal Nature that included a hockey stick model that demonstrated a dramatic increase in the rate of recent global warming I was at the receiving end of the attacks from many of the same individuals , think tanks , and organizations implicated in past attacks on other climate scientists , such as late climatologist Steve Schneider , he wrote in an email The attacks on climate science and on me specifically have escalated for a simple reason As the scientific evidence becomes clearer and the threat becomes clearer , it takes yet more disinformation and propaganda to obscure the truth Hundreds of millions of dollars have been spent by fossil fuel interests seeking to muddy the waters That has , in turn , provided cover for politicians doing their bidding in opposing any attempts to regulate carbon emissions Opponents of Mann and his fellow climatologists also seek to highlight areas of disagreements among climatologists Certainly those disagreements exist But they do n't affect the reality that human activity is the primary trigger of warming in recent decades Icemelt jpg Muir Glacier , Alaska Left August 13 , 1941 Right August 31 , 2004 1941 photo taken by Ulysses William O Field 2004 photo taken by Bruce F Molnia Courtesy of the Glacier Photograph Collection , National Snow and Ice Data Center World Data Center for Glaciology Take , for example , research on the relationship between climate change and extreme weather It is a very nuanced subject , and a legitimate controversy , Mann said in an interview There really are different schools of thought , each of which are credible and making arguments in good faith Jennifer Francis at Rutgers argues that there is a connection with loss of sea ice , and others are skeptical Schmidt agrees It is a genuine debate , he said Scientists do n't just sit around congratulating ourselves on what we 've done We look for things at the cutting edge between known and unknown It 's a complex terrain and that 's what makes it interesting Certainly , the disputes have become more nuanced But their existence provides opponents of scientific findings that they find unpopular with opportunities to muddle the facts The American political system has always had a rather odd connection to the role of expertise , Schmidt added There 's a clear strand in American discourse that is anti intellectual and anti expertise While the affair reveals much about the relationship between politics and science , it also casts a shadow on science writing There 's too much handwaving in science journalism , Schmidt noted Scientists do n't spend a lot of time when talking to journalists about what their research does n't mean One of the fault lines between science and journalism is how you pull together the bigger picture So a reticence on the part of scientists to fill in the big picture , and over enthusiasm on the part of journalists to say what does it all mean , means that the journalists do n't get it quite right Here I must admit mea culpa In retrospect , I was over enthusiastic in parts of my Newsweek article Thus , I suggested a connection between the purported global cooling and increases in tornado activity that was unjustified by climate science I also predicted a forthcoming impact of global cooling on the world 's food production that had scant research to back it The messages for science writers are to ask questions beyond the obvious and to seek out what the science does n't imply as well as what it does If I had applied those lessons back in 1975 , I might not now be in the embarrassing position of being a cat 's paw for denial of climate change Over my career I 've covered subjects as diverse as cell biology , the world of physics a century after Einstein 's birth , space commerce , and World Cup soccer I 've won prizes for my writing , including a lifetime award from the American Chemical Society But I fear that my obituary will be dominated by that single article in Newsweek",false

2016 Since 2013 , nearly 6 , 500 nursing homes four of every 10 have been cited at least once for a serious violation , federal records show Medicare has fined two thirds of those homes Common citations include failing to protect residents from avoidable accidents , neglect , mistreatment and bedsores AdvertisementContinue reading the main storyThe change in policy aligns with Mr Trump s promise to reduce bureaucracy , regulation and government intervention in business Dr Kate Goodrich , director of clinical standards and quality at the Centers for Medicare and Medicaid Services , said in a statement that unnecessary regulation was the main concern that health care providers raised with officials Rather than spending quality time with their patients , the providers are spending time complying with regulations that get in the way of caring for their patients and doesn t increase the quality of care they provide , Dr Goodrich said But advocates for nursing home residents say the revised penalties are weakening a valuable patient safety tool They ve pretty much emasculated enforcement , which was already weak , said Toby Edelman , a senior attorney at the Center for Medicare Advocacy Medicare has different ways of applying penalties It can impose a specific fine for a particular violation It can assess a fine for each day that a nursing home was in violation Or it can deny payments for new admissions The average fine in recent years has been 33 , 453 , but 531 nursing homes amassed combined federal fines above 100 , 000 , records show In 2016 , Congress increased the fines to factor in several years of inflation that had not been accounted for previously AdvertisementContinue reading the main storyThe new rules have been instituted gradually throughout the year In October , the Centers for Medicare and Medicaid Services discouraged its regional offices from levying fines , even in the most serious health violations , if the error was a one time mistake The centers said that intentional disregard for residents health and safety or systemic errors should still merit fines A July memo from the centers discouraged the directors of state agencies that survey nursing homes from issuing daily fines for violations that began before an inspection , favoring one time fines instead Daily fines remain the recommended approach for major

subscribed to this email Opt out or contact us anytimeDavid Gifford , the American Health Care Association s senior vice president for quality , said daily fines were intended to prompt quick remedies but were pointless when applied to past errors that had already been fixed by the time inspectors discovered them What was happening is you were seeing massive fines accumulating because they were applying them on a per day basis retrospectively , Mr Gifford said But the change means that some nursing homes could be sheltered from fines above the maximum per instance fine of 20 , 965 even for egregious mistakes In September 2016 , for instance , health inspectors faulted Lincoln Manor , a nursing home in Decatur , Ill , for failing to monitor and treat the wound of a patient whose implanted pain medication pump gradually slipped over eight days through a ruptured suture and protruded from her abdomen The patient died The Centers for Medicare and Medicaid Services fined Lincoln Manor 282 , 954 , including 10 , 091 a day for 28 days , from the time the nursing home noticed the problem with the wound until supervisors had retrained nurses to avoid similar errors An administrative law judge called the penalties quite modest given the appalling care The fines were issued before the new guidelines took effect if the agency had issued a one time fine , the maximum would have been less than 21 , 000 Lincoln Manor closed in September Its owner could not be reached for comment , and his lawyer did not respond to an interview request AdvertisementContinue reading the main storyAdvocates for nursing home residents say that relaxing penalties threatens to undo progress at deterring wrongdoing Janet Wells , a consultant for California Advocates for Nursing Home Reform , said the changes come as some egregious violations and injuries to residents are being penalized finally at a level that gets the industry s attention and isn t just the cost of doing business In November , the Trump administration exempted nursing homes that violate eight new safety rules from penalties for 18 months Homes must still follow the rules , which are intended , among other things , to reduce the overuse of psychotropic drugs and to ensure that every home has adequate resources to assist residents with major psychological problems In June , the Centers for Medicare and Medicaid Services rescinded another Obama administration action that banned nursing homes from pre emptively requiring residents to submit to arbitration to settle disputes rather than going to court We publish nearly 11 , 000 pages of regulation every year , the agency s administrator , Seema Verma , said in a speech in October That paperwork is taking doctors away from what matters most

"This isn t exactly the kind of story the IRS wants buzzing around at tax time The IRS and Justice Department normally want 'scared straight' stories just before Tax Day Ideally , when an indictment or conviction for tax evasion hits the news , it makes you think twice Somehow , you think just a bit more about all those deductions , or if you really reported all your income , before you sign your return under penalties of perjury Instead , we have the top dog at the IRS , the IRS Commissioner himself , admitting that , well , there s a problem with illegal immigrants and taxes In fact , the top IRS official this time wasn t talking about how the IRS wipes some hard drives or can t find emails He wasn t even asking for a bigger budget to give bonuses to IRS employees This time , he was talking about illegal immigrants , and about the IRS turning a blind eye Or maybe worse The IRS actually wants illegal immigrants to illegally use Social Security numbers , he suggested IRS Commissioner John Koskinen made the surprising statement in response to a question from Sen Dan Coats , R Ind , at a Senate Finance Committee meeting The question was a touchy one Gee , is the IRS collaborating with taxpayers who file tax returns using fraudulent information \? It was n't put exactly that way According to Senator Coats What we learned is that the IRS continues to process tax returns with false W 2 information and issue refunds as if they were routine tax returns , and say that 's not really our job We also learned the IRS ignores notifications from the Social Security Administration that a name does not match a Social Security number , and you use your own system to determine whether a number is valid Commissioner Koskinen was asked to explain this He suggested that as long as the information is being used only to fraudulently obtain jobs , the IRS was OK with it In fact , he said that the IRS actually had an interest in helping the illegal immigrants to crook these rules In fairness , perhaps it 's just the 'that 's not my department' response that abounds in big government Perhaps this just is n't the IRS 's problem , but it sure seems odd to have any agency chief encouraging illegal immigrant theft of SSNs Commissioner Koskinen was asked to explain this He suggested that as long as the information is being used only to fraudulently obtain jobs , the IRS was OK with it In fact , he said that the IRS actually had an interest inhelpingthe illegal immigrants to crook these rules In fairness , perhaps it 's just the 'that 's not my department' response that abounds in big government Perhaps this just is n't theIRS 'sproblem , but it sure seems odd to haveany You 'll love this next part The IRS chief tried to distinguish between the various bad uses and misuses of someone else 's personal data It is at least vaguely reminiscent of the flap a year ago that differentiated President Obama and Donald Trump over immigration and taxes Mr Trump said You 'll love this next part The IRS chief tried to distinguish between the various bad uses and misuses of someone else 's personal data It is at least vaguely reminiscent of the flap a year ago that differentiated President Obama and Donald Trump over immigration and taxes Mr Trump said illegal immigrants get 4 2 billion in tax credits A 2011 audit by the Treasury Inspector General for Tax Administration confirmed that individuals who are not authorized to work in the United States were paid 4 2 billion in refundable credits Of course , undocumented immigrants cannot legitimately get Social Security numbers , but it seems the IRS does n't care Besides , they can file taxes with an Individual Taxpayer Identification Number ITIN he Earned Income Tax Credit that is responsible for billions in fraudulent refunds undocumented immigrants cannot legitimately get Social Security numbers , but it seems the IRS does n't care Besides , they can file taxes with an Individual Taxpayer Identification Number They are not supposed to get the Earned Income Tax Credit , but they can receive the additional child tax credit If the President succeeds in legitimizing the status of illegal immigrants , they could even get t The recipe goes like this First , get a Social Security number , then claim the Earned Income Tax Credit for the last three years Then , wait for the IRS to send you three years of tax refunds The gambit could apparently work even if you never paid taxes , never filed a return , and worked off the books And the IRS says this is the way the Earned Income Tax Credit works Cautious IRS Commissioner Koskinen himself explained the seemingly bizarre result to Sen Charles Grassley \( R Iowa \) in 2015 Illegal immigrants covered by the President s amnesty deal can claim back tax credits for work they performed illegally , even if they never filed a tax return during those years This written respons e clarified the IRS chief s earlier statements , confirming that illegals can get back taxes Cautious IRS Commissioner Koskinen himself explained the seemingly bizarre result to Sen Charles Grassley \( R Iowa \) in 2015 Illegal immigrants covered by the President s amnesty deal can claim back tax credits for work they performed illegally , even if they never filed a tax return during those years In 2015 , IRS Commissioner Koskinen In 2015 , IRS Commissioner Koskinen said that to claim a refund , an illegal immigrant would need to have filed past tax returns But the IRS chief later corrected himself and said that they can claim the money even if they never filed tax returns in the past According to the IRS , illegal immigrants granted amnesty and Social Security numbers can claim up to three years of back tax credits",false

SALTON I was here in my house I was sitting in my computer room on the computer And so I was running between after a few minutes I was trying to check the TV and the computer and just trying to figure out what was going on ZAHN I understand the computer was a bit of a lifeline between you and your sister , and she fired off an e mail to you a couple of days ago Can you share with us what she was trying to tell you \? SALTON It was an e mail to all of her family It was a very special e mail for us because it was the last real communication we had directly from her And she just talked about how thrilled she was to be up there , the view from up there , how great it was seeing different sites , being able to see on her very first day Wind Point in Wisconsin , which is where Racine is , and seeing something familiar there Also different places around the world And then getting into how blessed she felt to be serving her country and getting to do the medical experiments , working with scientists around the world and how thrilling it was And really helping to share with us a little bit of what she was going through what it was like to eat in space and how she was acclimating to it , and that she was having fun And I think it was it was great to get that at the end ZAHN How passionate was she about the science that was being done on this mission \? SALTON Well , any time you talk to her actually it 's what you ended up talking about usually It 's what she wanted to talk about It 's what she really cared for She was being a medical doctor , I think it 's what she really got out , and what she was excited about the space program is what they were able to do in the microgravity research And she was very into it and loved to talk about it So I think she was very excited about it ZAHN Were you part of any calls the president made to members of the family affected by this tragedy \? SALTON I think that the president called the people who were down in Houston I had my sister Lynn was in Houston and my brother in law John Clark and Ian were there , of course And he talked to them So we are heading to I'm sorry They were in Florida at Kennedy Space Center in Florida And I think that 's where he talked to them We are heading to Houston after this Well , sometime in the next day or two , where we 're going to be with family and hopefully there will be a memorial service I think there 's a plan to having a memorial service there that we plan on attending ZAHN I know you mentioned your sister 's husband Without violating your privacy , are you able to share with us anything this morning about how your sister 's 8 year old son is doing and her husband \? SALTON Well , we 're very thankful that one of his brothers , Dave Clark , was able to get down to Houston And my brother John Salton , was able to get down there to Houston last night to help out And so they 're there now and helping out any way they can And we 'll be hearing from them later as to what the plans are , when the rest of us should come down and how it will all work And I'm just thankful that they were able to get there ZAHN You 've said so much this morning about what drove your sister to the excellence that she accomplished in her life Just a final thought on what else you want people in America to know about the sacrifice she made and how serious she was about serving her country SALTON Well , Laurel was a very intense person who would set goals and would go for them And I think that that 's a great role model for kids today , to know that the goal oriented stuff that they talk about , that the counselors at school tell you about , it works It gets you places You can do great things for humanity if you just set some small goals and always go for the next thing and set your sights higher When you reach that goal , go for the next thing And that 's what she did And we 're all very proud for what she was able to do And we certainly all hope that NASA keeps going and continues on with its research I think it 's very important for humanity to keep this going",true

"Islamic Tribunal Confirmed in Texas Attorney Claims It s Voluntary Islamic Tribunal Websiteby Bob Price 27 Jan 2015 027 Jan , 201527 Jan , 2015An Islamic Tribunal using Sharia law in Texas has been confirmed by Breitbart Texas The tribunal is operating as a non profit organization in Dallas One of the attorneys for the tribunal said participation and acceptance of the tribunal s decisions are voluntary Breitbart Texas spoke with one of the judges , Dr Taher El badawi He said the tribunal operates under Sharia law as a form of non binding dispute resolution El badawi said their organization is a tribunal , not arbitration A tribunal is defined by Meriam Webster s Dictionary as a court or forum of justice The four Islamic attorneys call themselves judges not arbitrators El badawi said the tribunal follows Sharia law to resolve civil disputes in family and business matters He said they also resolve workplace disputes In matters of divorce , El badawi said that while participation in the tribunal is voluntary , a married couple cannot be considered divorced by the Islamic community unless it is granted by the tribunal He compared their divorce , known as Talaq , as something similar to the Catholic practice of annulment in that the church does not recognize civil divorce proceedings as ending a marriage He also said there is a difference between how a man and a woman can request a divorce under their system The husband can request the divorce directly from the tribunal , El badawi stated The wife must go to an Imam who will request the divorce for her He called it two paths to the same result The practice of Khula is the process where a wife can initiate a divorce proceeding and where the husband can agree to the divorce in exchange for a financial compensation It appears the wife must agree to give up any claim to the dower that was not already paid or to return it if it has already been paid Once the financial issues are resolved the husband can then proclaim the Talaq \( divorce \) El badawi said they follow Texas family law when it comes to child support , visitation , and custody He said that in most cases , custody of children is awarded to the mother Breitbart Texas asked what happens when there is a conflict between Sharia law and Texas law El badawi said most of the time , the laws are in agreement When pushed further he admitted that , we follow Sharia law However , he explained , If the parties are not satisfied with the tribunal s decision , they do not have to accept it and they can take the matter to Texas civil courts He did not say what the social ramifications of rejecting the judge s decision would be The website for the Islamic Tribunal states , The courts of the United States of America are costly and consist of ineffective lawyers Discontent with the legal system leads many Muslims in America to postpone justice in this world and opt for an audience on the Day of Judgment It goes on to state , It is with this issue that Muslims here in America are obligated to find a way to solve conflicts and disputes according to the principles of Islamic Law and its legal heritage of fairness and justice in a manner that is reasonable and cost effective In explaining Sharia law , the website states , Stoning adulterers , cutting of the hands , polyandry and the like \( all can be traced in the relevant literature and can be explained in their Islamic legal mentality and rational context in fairness and justice \) , are mainly a part of Islamic Criminal Law In fact criminal law within Islam only makes up a fraction of the Shari ah It is unscholarly and unfair to generalize that type of understanding , that is Criminal Law , to compromise the whole of Islamic law if we stick to speaking in technical terms The website lists four judges Imam Yusuf Z Kavakci , Imam Moujahed Bakhach , Imam Zia ul Haque Sheikh and Dr El badawi It states the Islamic Tribunal resolves business disputes , divorce \( Talaq \) cases , community problems , serious family problems , and Khula El badawi restated several times that participation in the tribunal is voluntary However , he would not discuss what happens to someone who did not follow their rulings Bob Price is a senior political news contributor for Breitbart Texas and a member of the original Breitbart Texas team Follow him on Twitter BobPriceBBTX Read More Stories About Comment count on this article reflects comments made on Breitbart com and Facebook Visit Breitbart 's Facebook Page BREITBART CONNECT",false
"Carob is a brown powder made from the pulverized fruit of a Mediterranean evergreen Some consider carob an adequate substitute for chocolate because it can , when combined with vegetable fat and sugar , be made to approximate the color and consistency of chocolate Of course , the same arguments can as persuasively be made in favor of dirt Sandra Boynton CHOCOLATE The Consuming Passion Strawberries dipped in chocolate Photo by Flickr user kristina For chocolate lovers , there is simply no substitute , and if cocoa beans could be cultivated anywhere , cocoa \( Theobroma cacao \) trees might outnumber apple trees in American yards They would certainly outnumber any plants that produced vegetables Unfortunately , cacao trees do n't thrive in the temperate climate of the continental United States Chocolate grows best in the places where it would quickly melt in your hands Over the next several decades , those places may grow warmer , drier , and less suitable to cacao cultivation But with planning and adaptation , cacao farmers can keep producing our favorite treat The geography of chocolate Cacao can only grow within about 20 north and south of the equator south of the Mediterranean home of carob , in fact Cacao trees only prosper under specific conditions , including fairly uniform temperatures , high humidity , abundant rain , nitrogen rich soil , and protection from wind In short , cacao trees thrive in rainforests Chocolate is now grown around the globe typically within 10 north and south of the equator The world 's leading producers are C te d Ivoire , Ghana , and Indonesia C te d'Ivoire and Ghana produce over half of the world 's chocolate But research highlighted in the Intergovernmental Panel on Climate Change \( IPCC \) Climate Change 2014 Impacts , Adaptation , and Vulnerability report indicates that , under a business as usual scenario , those countries will experience a 3 8 F \( 2 1 C \) increase in temperature by 2050 , and a marked reduction in suitable cultivation area It s not the heat , it s the \( lack of \) humidity Another staple of American consumption , coffee , suffers direct harm from rising temperatures , but chocolate is different Rising temperatures alone won t necessarily hurt cacao production Cacao cultivation areas in Malaysia , for instance , already endure a warmer climate than in West Africa without any obvious negative effect Cacao blossoms in the New York Botanical Garden , Bronx Photo by Flickr user Kerry Woods The danger to chocolate comes from an increase in evapotranspiration , especially since the higher temperatures projected for West Africa by 2050 are unlikely to be accompanied by an increase in rainfall , according to business as usual carbon dioxide emissions scenarios In other words , as higher temperatures squeeze more water out of soil and plants , it 's unlikely that rainfall will increase enough to offset the moisture loss Some of the research highlighted by the IPCC 2014 report is a 2013 study headed by Peter L derach L derach authored a 2011 paper giving a pretty dire forecast for cacao cultivation the 2013 study reaches slightly less worrisome conclusions , though challenges to West Africa cacao growers remain An uphill battle By 2050 , rising temperatures will push the suitable cacao cultivation areas uphill The IPCC reported that C te d'Ivoire and Ghana s optimal altitude for cacao cultivation is expected to rise from 350 800 feet \( 100 250 meters \) to 1 , 500 1 , 600 feet \( 450 500 meters \) above sea level These maps show suitability for cacao cultivation at present \( left \) and projected for 2050 \( right \) Image adapted from L derach et al 2013 L derach and his team report that areas expected to show improved cultivation conditions are often hilly terrain One example is Ghana s Atewa Range It s a forest preserve where cultivation isn t permitted Cacao growing countries may have to choose which priority matters more growing a product to meet a global demand , or preserving natural habitat In fact , L derach and coauthors found that , of the 294 locations examined in the study , only 10 5 showed increasing suitability for cacao production the remaining 89 5 were likely to become less suitable by 2050 The authors continued , These changes in climatic suitability are predicted to take place over a time period of almost 40 years , so they will mostly impact the next rather than the current generation of cocoa trees and farmers In other words , there is time for adaptation Helping chocolate cope with climate change One adaptation strategy could be providing cacao growers with selectively bred seeds that have superior drought resistance Another strategy involves a traditional cacao cultivation method that takes advantage of the conditions under which cacao naturally grows Cacao harvesting in Colombia Photo by the U S Agency for International Development \( USAID \) Known in Brazil as cabruca , this approach involves retaining , or in some cases replanting , other rainforest trees , which provide cacao trees with shade \( Like Northern European tourists in the Mediterranean , cacao trees benefit enormously from shade \) This approach could help decrease both temperature and evapotranspiration The taller trees also provide protection from wind and soil erosion , and nutrient rich leaf litter Cacao trees cultivated in this approach appear less vulnerable to pests , and the soil better retains its ability to support cacao over the long term Cabruca offers one more advantage Carbon that would otherwise be released into the atmosphere when forests are cleared is n't It remains stored in the trees A study conducted in southern Cameroon and published in 2009 found that cacao forests in that region store on average 243 metric tons per hectare \( about 2 5 acres \) \( For comparison , in 2011 2015 , the World Bank reported , U S citizens released about 17 0 metric tons of carbon dioxide per person per year \) Another study , conducted in Brazil and published in 2014 , concluded that judicious cabruca practices could double cacao production in a climate friendly manner Chocolate promotes science literacy among children by forming dinosaurs Photo by Flickr user Daniele Civello So while you may not be able to grow your own

Now , what does this have to do with John Kerry and George Bush and Vietnam and the Air National Guard \? The same schizophrenia prevails with regard to that story To repeat As in the late 1960s and early '70s , media reportage of today 's events often has very little to do with the events themselves Let 's see George W Bush was in the National Guard , flew planes , and at least took the risk that he might be called up for service in Vietnam more than a thousand reservists and national guardsmen were killed in that conflict , although one gets the idea that for John Kerry and the press corps they were somehow not really soldiers , since they were n't regular army During the same period , after his discharge from the service \( and even during the time he was on active duty \) , Kerry was a principal in one of the most virulent antiwar groups this country has ever known , and he gave testimony about supposed atrocities committed by our troops in Vietnam The media bought it hook , line , and sinker at the time And while lapping up Kerry 's witness about American atrocities , they all but ignored the Hue massacre committed by the North Vietnamese against the South The Hue massacre of more than 3 , 500 Vietnamese civilians , you 'll recall wait , you probably wo n't recall , because Walter Cronkite et al hushed it up was perpetrated when the battle for the town of Hue turned against the Vietcong , who proceeded to slaughter the men , women , and children of several villages surrounding the besieged city when they discovered that South Vietnamese support for their cause was less than expected After the Hue massacre it was understood among the South Vietnamese that , as local provincial chief Le Van Than said at the time , the Vietcong would kill them , regardless of their political belief America never suffered a military defeat in Vietnam The infamous 1968 Tet Offensive resulted in the deaths of tens of thousands of enemy troops \( for those of you who do n't remember , enemy refers to North Vietnamese troops and not , as Kerry and the media of the time tried to convince us , American troops \) As Victor Davis Hansen has recounted in The American Legion Magazine \( September , 2003 \) North Vietnamese Commander General Vo Nguyen Giap told a French television interviewer that his most important guerrilla ally during the war was the America press George W Bush is the person who , by his courageous and undaunted response to the use of weapons of mass destruction against the United States \( a jetliner loaded with fuel qualifies as such a weapon if it 's crashed into a building with the intent to kill thousands of people \) has uncovered a viper 's nest of WMD traffickers of heretofore unimagined proportions and complexity I know that we can trust President Bush not to turn on his country and somehow declare that we are the ones guilty of atrocities in the current conflict The President 's patriotism is definitely not the issue The kicker is , however , that , aided and abetted by journalistic media , this message is not getting delivered Writer Greg Lewis is the co author of the Warner Books hardcover End Your Addiction Now He can be reached by One thing John Kerry 's insistence on focusing attention on his and George W Bush 's military records has done is to give us the opportunity to revisit the Vietnam War era , if not to have it practically shoved down our throats And among the things that has accomplished is to bring to light the perpetuation of a campaign of lies and disinformation that has been waged in and by print and broadcast media It 's a methodology which has a long history but which has been particularly effective in the U S since the late 1960s It turns out that the media versions of many important events for more than a quarter century have often borne very little relation to the events themselves John Kerry 's involvement in those events , particularly in the aftermath of the War in Vietnam , is one of the elements of that story A few weeks ago in a column about Kerry , I referred to what has turned out to be an urban legend Specifically , based on a news item that appeared on NewsMax com , I repeated a reference to a volume of memoirs supposedly published by North Vietnamese General Vo Nguyen Giap in 1985 as the source of an assertion by Colonel Oliver North After a reader requested a reference to Giap 's 1985 Memoirs , I did research that convinced me no such volume exists For that matter , I have n't been able to verify through Fox News that Colonel North actually made the comments he is said to have made and which I repeated My apologies to Colonel North and to WashingtonDispatch com readers for including inadequately verified material in my piece on Kerry What has emerged for me from all this , however , is something truly bizarre having to do with verifiable and unverifiable reportage and commentary On the one hand , the current President of the United States \( with the backing depending on which week 's polls you refer to and how the poll questions are loaded of anywhere from just above half to well over 70 percent of the American people \) has conducted enormously successful and necessary wars and subsequent police actions in Afghanistan and Iraq The same was true in the late 1960s and early '70s Popular support in America for the War in Vietnam held consistently above 50 percent through the end of the war On the other hand , as in the Vietnam era , U S tactical and strategic successes in Iraq are barely even mentioned in most of the media The print and broadcast headlines represent such a disconnect from reality

"Source Neon NettleOne of the highest ranking officials in the Catholic Church has stated that he would rather go to prison than report pedophilia to police Australia s most powerful clergy , Archbishop of Melbourne Denis Hart , says he s prepared to be jailed for failing to report child sex abuse by pedophile priests He made the shocking statement in response to the Australian Royal Commission into Institutional Responses to Child Sexual Abuse saying there should be no excuse , protection nor privilege for clergy who failed to alert police of abuse Hart insisted that sexual abuse was a spiritual encounter with God through the priest and was of a higher order than criminal law A new report by the commission proposed 85 sweeping changes to the criminal justice system and recommended that priests face criminal charges for failing to report serious crimes such as sexual abuse to the police As the law currently stands , clergy are not legally obliged to report crimes to the police and disciplinary proceedings for criminal activity by members of the Catholic Church are handled internally by Canon law , which operates independently of the regular legal procedure Following an investigation by the commission , officials believe that the Catholic Church is using confessional confidentiality as a cover for not reporting child sex abuse to the authorities We understand the significance of religious confession in particular , the inviolability of the confessional seal to people of some faiths , particularly the Catholic faith , said the report However , we heard evidence of a number of instances where disclosures of child sexual abuse were made in religious confession , by both victims and perpetrators We are satisfied that confession is a forum where Catholic children have disclosed their sexual abuse and where clergy have disclosed their abusive behavior in order to deal with their own guilt Archbishop Hart , who s also the President of the Australian Catholic Bishops Conference , argued that the confessional seal should remain protected from the law , saying in a statement It is a fundamental part of the freedom of religion , and it is recognized in the law of Australia and many other countries It must remain so here in Australia Outside of this , all offenses against children must be reported to the authorities , and we are absolutely committed to doing so We understand the significance of religious confession in particular , the inviolability of the confessional seal to people of some faiths , particularly the Catholic faith , said the report However , we heard evidence of a number of instances where disclosures of child sexual abuse were made in religious confession , by both victims and perpetrators We are

of the freedom of religion , and it is recognized in the law of Australia and many other countries It must remain so here in Australia Outside of this , all offenses against children must be reported to the authorities , and we are absolutely committed to doing so Independent reports Asked on Tuesday if he would rather go to prison than breach the seal of confession , he told ABC Radio Melbourne I ve said that I would I believe that this is an absolutely sacrosanct communication of a higher order I would go to extreme lengths outside of the confessional to make sure that the law was observed But there are some matters which are of a higher order , things to do with God His stance was backed by other high profile clerics , including his Brisbane counterpart Mark Coleridge and priest and lawyer Frank Brennan , who he said he would conscientiously refuse to comply with the law if it was changed Writing in the Sydney Morning Herald , Father Brennan suggested requiring clerics to report abuse allegations would make children less safe because it may take away the one possibility that a sex offender will repent and turn himself in But lawyer Vivian Walker , who has represented child sex abuse victims , welcomed the commission s recommendations I think it s about time the Catholic Church was dragged out of the dark ages , she said We can no longer think about sexual offending against children as some kind of forgivable sin In its submission to the commission , the Catholic Church s Trust Justice and Healing Council argued requiring priests to disclose information heard during confession would undermine freedom of religion The whole concept of confession in the Catholic Church is built on repentance , forgiveness , and penance , said Frances Sullivan , the council s chief executive Part of this forgiveness process , certainly in the case of a child sex abuser , would normally require they turn themselves in to the police But the commission s report stressed The right to practice one s religious beliefs must accommodate civil society s obligation to provide for the safety of all and , in particular , children s safety from sexual abuse Reporting information relevant to child sexual abuse to the police is critical to ensuring the safety of children Australia s Parliament will decide whether to enact the changes contained in the report Archbishop Hart s

"43rd Governor of the State of Florida Jeb2016 comJan 24 , 2016Realigning the Courts with the ConstitutionAs president , I will appoint judges who believe in the rule of law , judges who will apply the law as written , and follow the Constitution above all I will nominate judges who will look to the text , original understanding , history , and structure of the Constitution for answers not to their own views about public policy , to the popular opinion of the moment , or to what might win favor on liberal newspaper editorial pages They will defer to the elected branches on issues where the Constitution is silent But when laws conflict with the Constitution , they will not hesitate to strike them down I believe the federal courts are at a crossroads The next president will help to determine whether we move further away from constitutional government , or correct course We cannot afford to elect a president who will pack the courts with politicians in robes who subvert the law to advance their own political agendas We need a president who will nominate individuals with a record of respecting the difference between judges and legislators which is exactly what I pledge to do I have a proven record of appointing conservatives to the Florida judiciary as governor , and my administration devoted substantial time to vetting nominees We sought judges who had shown humility , courage , an appreciation of the duties of a judge , a respect for the will of the people , and devotion to full application of the law without equivocation My two appointments to the Florida Supreme Court , Raoul Cantero and Kenneth Bell , have earned reputations as its most consistent conservatives Additionally , two of the appellate judges I named as governor , Charles Canady and Ricky Polston , are now serving with distinction on the Florida Supreme Court I will approach nominations to the federal courts and the U S Supreme Court with the same rigor and care My strategy is to assemble the broadest possible pool of candidates who meet the core qualifications , scour their records and vet their references Only those people with a history of respecting both the limits of government power and the will of the people will stay on the list The final criterion will be to identify those most willing to stand up for the law , even when it runs contrary to their own ideology If our court system continues in the wrong direction , we face a troubling future Our strong tradition of religious liberty , which is already under assault , could erode precipitously The right to bear arms could be read out of our Constitution Judicial fiat could end school choice programs that have given hope to children across our country The states could be reduced to mere administrative sub units of the federal government Liberal dogma could block reasonable protections for unborn children , even when most people agree on them So , this is my promise I will fight for the confirmation of my judicial nominees They will all have a long , clear conservative record Opposition from Senate Democrats is all but guaranteed I am eager to fight for good judges , to make the case in the court of public opinion , and I am confident that those of us who believe in judicial fidelity to the Constitution will win the battle Read more on Jeb2016 com",true
"Shock as Worm Infested Weaves from Dead People Find Their Way into the Market 6 years ago Advertisement Nairobi , Kenya Irene Myangoh , a personal assistant working at a law firm in Nairobi went to an upmarket hair salon along Kenyatta Avenue , and spent more than 2994 93 Kenyan Shilling on a human hair weave Two weeks later she started suffering from severe headache that would not go away She would wake up with severe headache at night She went to a private doctor who gave her drugs for the relief of mild to moderate pain of inflammatory origin with or without fever they would only work for a few hours and then the headache would be back worse than even before Desperate , she went to see a specialist who did blood tests and even a brain scan All the tests were negative but the headache persisted , making her unable to concentrate at work and sleeping very poorly She went back to her doctor who decided to examine her scalp and under the beautiful weave he found worms ! The worms were burrowing into her skull and after sending the samples to the lab they found that the hair had eggs from which the worms had hatched The doctor told her that the hair was probably from a corpse because those worms are usually found on dead bodies Efforts to reach her doctor for further comments were fruitless for he was said to be out of the country The manager of the salon where Irene got the hair product was traumatised and said they had fitted ten weaves from the package already , adding that the particular batch of hair had sold very fast in less than a month , she had sold over 150 pieces I am shocked to hear this because this is the first time such a thing is happening to my clients I will get more information from my supplier because we import these weaves from the UK , USA and India , says the salon manager who did not want to be mentioned She continued to say Maybe , the supplier sent us rejects from the factory or weaves that had overstayed in the stores but I promise to follow up on the matter and compensate Irene Irene had to shave after this ordeal and took antibiotics for two weeks Dr CK Musau , a surgeon at Nairobi hospital says that he has dealt with more than ten cases of the same in a period of six months He further urges ladies to be very careful with what they put on their heads , and adds that it is better to appreciate natural beauty and be content with what God has blessed them instead of chasing artificial beauty It is unfortunate how the West has influenced Kenyan youth especially ladies They should stick to their natural African beauty as opposed to trying to ape what they see , says Musau Dr Musau reiterated that the youth must keep in mind that of late , Kenyans can sell anything from body parts to human beings to used coffins and now even weaves that seem to come from corpses Elsewhere , 16 year old girl from Buruburu , a Nairobi surburb , also suffered the same fate but unfortunately for her she died Cobweb eggs were found in her hair after she died There was a profound cobweb design in her weaved hair She dropped dead after constant headaches The root cause \? The weave had unnoticed spider eggs The warmth produced after weaving provided a very conducive environment for the eggs to hatch A spider grew in her scalp and bit her The poison found its way to her blood She could not survive the attack",false
"Dear Ed 1 I think that such answer as I can give to your letter of November first will be arranged in reverse order at least I shall comment first on your final paragraph You keep harping on the Constitution I should like to point out that the meaning of the Constitution is what the Supreme Court says it is Consequently no powers are exercised by the Federal government except where such exercise is approved by the Supreme Court \( lawyers \) of the land 2 I admit that the Supreme Court has in the past made certain decisions in this general field that have been astonishing to me A recent case in point was the decision in the Phillips case 3 Others , and older ones , involved interstate commerce 4 But until some future Supreme Court decision denies the right and responsibility of the Federal government to do certain things , you cannot possibly remove them from the political activities of the Federal government Now it is true that I believe this country is following a dangerous trend when it permits too great a degree of centralization of governmental functions I oppose this in some instances the fight is a rather desperate one But to attain any success it is quite clear that the Federal government cannot avoid or escape responsibilities which the mass of the people firmly believe should be undertaken by it The political processes of our country are such that if a rule of reason is not applied in this effort , we will lose everything even to a possible and drastic change in the Constitution This is what I mean by my constant insistence upon moderation in government Should any political party attempt to abolish social security , unemployment insurance , and eliminate labor laws and farm programs , you would not hear of that party again in our political history There is a tiny splinter group , of course , that believes you can do these things Among them are H L Hunt \( you possibly know his background \) , a few other Texas oil millionaires , and an occasional politician or business man from other areas 5 Their number is negligible and they are stupid To say , therefore , that in some instances the policies of this Administration have not been radically changed from those of the last is perfectly true 6 Both Administrations levied taxes , both maintained military establishments , customs officials , and so on But in all governmental fields of action a combination of purpose , procedure and objectives must be considered if you are to get a true evaluation of the relative merits You say that the foreign policy of the two Administrations is the same I suppose that even the most violent critic would agree that it is well for us to have friends in the world , to encourage them to oppose communism both in its external form and in its internal manifestations , to promote trade in the world that would be mutually profitable between us and our friends \( and it must be mutually profitable or it will dry up \) , and to attempt the promotion of peace in the world , negotiating from a position of moral , intellectual , economic and military strength No matter what the party is in power , it must perforce follow a program that is related to these general purposes and aspirations But the great difference is in how it is done and , particularly , in the results achieved A year ago last January we were in imminent danger of losing Iran , and sixty percent of the known oil reserves of the world 7 You may have forgotten this Lots of people have But there has been no greater threat that has in recent years overhung the free world That threat has been largely , if not totally , removed I could name at least a half dozen other spots of the same character This being true , how can anyone be so unaware of what is happening as to say that this Administration has conducted foreign affairs under the same policies as did the former Administration \? As a matter of fact , if you will press any individual who brings to you all these strictures and comments , I venture that your experience will be the same as mine That experience is that these individuals have no idea of what the foreign policy of the previous Administration was and what the present one is They have heard certain slogans , such as give away programs They have no slightest idea as to what has been the effect of these programs in sustaining American security and prosperity Moreover , they have no idea whatsoever as to comparative size of them now as compared to even two or three years ago You say that these critics also complain about the continuance of controls , presumably over our economy There is nothing in your letter that shows such complete ignorance as to what has actually happened as does this term When we came into office there were Federal controls exercised over prices , wages , rents , as well as over the allocation and use of raw materials The first thing this Administration did was to set about the elimination of those controls This it did amid the most dire predictions of disaster , run away inflation , and so on and so on We were proved right , but I must say that if the people of the United States do not even remember what took place , one is almost tempted to regret the agony of study , analysis and decision that was then our daily ration You also talk about bad political advice I am getting I always assumed that lawyers attempted accuracy in their statements How do you know that I am getting any political advice \? Next , if I do get political advice , how do you know that it is not weighted in the direction that you seem to think it should be although I am tempted at times to believe that you are just thrashing around rather than thinking anything through to a definite conclusion \? So how can you say I am getting bad advice why do n't you just assume I am stupid , trying to wreck the nation , and leave our Constitution in tatters \? I assure you that you have more reason , based on sixty four years of contact , to say this than you do to make the bland assumption that I am surrounded by a group of Machiavellian characters who are seeking the downfall of the United States and the ascendancy of socialism and communism in the world Incidentally , I notice that everybody seems to be a great Constitutionalist until his idea of what the Constitution ought to do is violated then he suddenly becomes very strong for amendments or some peculiar and individualistic interpretation of his own Finally , I must assure you again that I am delighted to get your own honest criticisms , particularly if you will only take the trouble to lay down the facts on which you reach what seem to me to be some remarkable conclusions But the mere repetition of aphorisms and political slogans and newspaper headlines leaves me cold I am sorry you are not going to be at Abilene 8 It would be easier to tell you these things than to write them except that by this method I hope to make you do a little thinking rather than devote yourself just to the winning of a noisy argument As ever P S I attach a paragraph and a cartoon that came to me in the same mail as did your letter At least it represents a different viewpoint Incidentally , it comes from one of the most successful businessmen in the nation 9",true
"Innovative Genomics Institute University of California at Berkeley Cacao plants are slated to disappear by as early as 2050 thanks to warmer temperatures and dryer weather conditions Scientists at the University of California are teaming up with Mars company to try to save the crop before it 's too late They 're exploring the possibility of using the gene editing technology CRISPR to make crops that can survive the new challenges Beyond the glittery glass and sandstone walls of the University of California s new biosciences building , rows of tiny green cacao seedlings in refrigerated greenhouses await judgment day Under the watchful eye of Myeong Je Cho , the director of plant genomics at an institute that 's working with food and candy company Mars , the plants will be transformed If all goes well , these tiny seedlings will soon be capable of surviving and thriving in the dryer , warmer climate that is sending chills through the spines of farmers across the globe It 's all thanks to a new technology called CRISPR , which allows for tiny , precise tweaks to DNA that were never possible before These tweaks are already being used to make crops cheaper and more reliable But their most important use may be in the developing world , where many of the plants that people rely on to avoid starvation are threatened by the impacts of climate change , including more pests and a lack of water Cacao plants occupy a precarious position on the globe They can only grow within a narrow strip of rainforested land roughly 20 degrees north and south of the equator , where temperature , rain , and humidity all stay relatively constant throughout the year Over half of the world 's chocolate now comes from just two countries in West Africa C te d Ivoire and Ghana But those areas wo n't be suitable for chocolate in the next few decades By 2050 , rising temperatures will push today 's chocolate growing regions more than 1 , 000 feet uphill into mountainous terrain much of which is currently preserved for wildlife , according to the National Oceanic and Atmospheric Administration Mars , the 35 billion corporation best known for Snickers , is aware of these problems and others presented by climate change In September , the company pledged 1 billion as part of an effort called Sustainability in a Generation , which aims to reduce the carbon footprint of its business and supply chain by more than 60 by 2050 We 're trying to go all in here , Barry Parkin , Mars' chief sustainability officer , told Business Insider There are obviously commitments the world is leaning into but , frankly , we do n't think we 're getting there fast enough collectively Its initiative with Cho at UC Berkeley is another arm of that efforts If all goes as planned , they could develop cacao plants that don t wilt or rot at their current elevations , doing away with the need to relocate farms or find another approach Jennifer Doudna , the UC Berkeley geneticist who invented CRISPR , is overseeing the collaboration with Mars Although her tool has received more attention for its potential to eradicate human diseases and make so called designer babies , Doudna thinks its most profound applications won t be on humans but rather on the food they eat Courtney Verrill An avid tomato gardener , Doudna thinks her tool can benefit everyone from large food companies like Mars to individual hobbyists like herself Personally , I d love a tomato plant with fruit that stayed on the vine longer , Doudna told Business Insider The research lab she oversees at UC Berkeley is called the Innovative Genomics Institute Many of the efforts by graduate students there focus on using CRISPR to benefit small holder farmers in the developing world One such project aims to protect cassava a key crop that prevents millions of people from starving each year from climate change by tweaking its DNA to produce less of a dangerous toxin that it makes in hotter temperatures Doudna founded a company called Caribou Biosciences to put CRISPR into practice , and has also licensed the technology to agricultural company DuPont Pioneer for use in crops like corn and mushrooms Regardless of which crop the public sees CRISPR successfully used in first , the technology will be a key tool in a growing arsenal of techniques we 'll need if we plan to continue eating things like chocolate as the planet warms",false
"I first heard of the frozen shaving cream prank during my first year at U C Santa Barbara The prank goes like this If you freeze a can of shaving cream in liquid nitrogen , then carefully hacksaw the can open , you can pull out a frozen shaving cream cylinder This frozen foam block will expand at it heats up , making a huge mess ! Two frozen shaving cream bombs can fill an entire car , so a car with a window rolled down makes the perfect target ! This prank idea is well documented on the internet It is posted in several places , with some skepticism about the expansion possibilities of a frozen block of cream The problem with this joke is the liquid nitrogen Who has access to it \? I love science I love chemistry and physics One time I held both Potassium and Daisy in my very hands , but I 've never even seen liquid Nitrogen in person Nevertheless , I accepted this prank as possible for many years Upon completion of how much is inside shaving cream , I began to have serious doubts about the legitimacy of this story I witnessed first hand the pitiful patty of shaving cream that lives in those cans Then , one day , I heard that a can of shaving cream could be frozen solid by a household freezer I decided I 'd have to try that some day I kept a can of Colgate shaving cream in my freezer for about four days I wanted to use it as a cool , whipped desert topping , but one night Tony left his car window down a bit and I decided to act The steel can was extremely cold to the touch , and felt very solid I wore an oven mitt to protect my hand from the cold I also wanted to shield the can from my warm hand I wonder how one would grip a can frozen in liquid nitrogen I used bolt cutters to snip the bottom seam of the can A little shaving cream puffed out , so I continued to work quickly After a few minutes of work , I was able to remove the bottom of the can with some pliers I peeled off the thin steel and extracted the frozen core The inside of a wrecked shaving cream can I had my prize , an 11 ounce frozen block of shaving cream It was already starting to heat up and foam out It was a frozen cylinder There was a little mound on the top , where the cream had reached into the dome of the can I placed the cream bomb into a small metal bowl In 17 minutes , it was surrounded by a little lake of shaving cream The lake grew and grew as the shaving cream thawed The shaving cream was n't holding my attention , so I started watching television instead Unfortunately , Blind Date was the only show on , so I went back to watching the shaving cream Two hours after it was released from the can , the shaving cream crested the sides of the bowl This was about 8 cups of foam After three hours , I fell asleep The next morning , I was in a panic I had somehow forgotten to study for my Music117 exam ! As I rushed to locate my backpack , I found the entire back room overflowing with shaving cream ! Luckily , this was just a dream When I actually awoke , the shaving cream had reached the end of it 's growth The shaving cream had nearly overflowed from the bowl , overfilling it with about 12 cups of foam It appears that the foam had expanded to about 850 of its frozen volume Unfortunately , this is n't very much shaving cream This could make a real mess , but it certainly is n't enough to fill up a car",false

"It s no secret that Betsy DeVos , President elect Donald Trump s pick to lead the Education Department , is a political fundraising juggernaut Her contributions to candidates and school choice causes around the country have been all over the news since she was named the nominee More consequential , though , are the depth and breadth of contributions by her family by birth and by marriage going back decades The donations have helped make the clan a pillar of the Republican Party , immensely influential in steering GOP politics and causes Since 1989 , Betsy DeVos and her relatives have given at least 20 2 million to Republican candidates , party committees , PACs and super PACs , according to an OpenSecrets org analysis \( A tabbed spreadsheet is here \) Amway , the multilevel marketing giant now known as Alticor that earned much of the family its wealth , gave another nearly 3 6 million to the party prior to 2002 And that s just at the federal level family members have given hundreds of millions more to state and local level politics and to nonprofit groups , think tanks and media outlets championing their favored conservative causes At the federal level since 1989 In the 2016 cycle alone , the family had given at least 10 million as of late October to a host of GOP candidates and committees Much of that 4 4 million went to super PACs those supporting the White House bids of Sens Marco Rubio and Ted Cruz as well as former Florida Gov Jeb Bush and businesswoman Carly Fiorina , and the Koch brothers backed Freedom Partners Action Fund and the super PAC started by Republican strategist Karl Rove , American Crossroads the latter two groups helped support numerous Republicans in tight House and Senate races Betsy herself , along with her husband , Dick DeVos , Jr , has contributed more than 7 7 million to federal candidates , committees and parties since 1990 , including almost 4 8 million to super PACs DeVos and her husband ramped up their gifts significantly in the 2016 cycle , setting a new personal record of about 2 7 million None of that , however , went to Trump or his supporting super PACs Not so for her brother , Erik Prince , co founder of controversial private security contractor Blackwater \( now known as Academi \) He made two donations to Make America Number 1 , a super PAC that backed Cruz and then Trump Prince s 150 , 000 in gifts came after Trump had become the Republican party nominee Since 1990 , he and his ex wives have given 519 , 546 , including 175 , 309 in 2016 Betsy DeVos voiced her thoughts about her family s abundant political giving in a 1997 piece in Roll Call , in which she wrote that she had decided to stop taking offense at the suggestion that we are buying influence Now I simply concede the point They are right We do expect some things in return We expect to foster a conservative governing philosophy consisting of limited government and respect for traditional American values The definition of traditional American values is in the eye of the beholder , of course , a secretive network of conservative leaders of which he was an early funder It was Dick Jr s father , 90 year old Richard Rich DeVos , Sr , who first established the family as a force in conservative fundraising The elder DeVos , who co founded Amway , which his sons have helped lead in various capacities , and owns the NBA s Orlando Magic , has an estimated worth of 5 1 billion , according to Forbes He s a past president of the Council for National Policy At the federal level since 1989 This cycle , he and his wife , Helen , also contributed their highest ever cash totals , donating almost 2 9 million the first election cycle they have crested 1 million since 1998 Overall , the elder DeVoses have given nearly 6 8 million in federal elections since 1990 These are big numbers , relatively speaking On the Center for Responsive Politics list of top individual donors for 2016 , Rich and Helen DeVos came in at No 61 and Dick and Betsy DeVos at No 65 Family members also made the list in previous election cycles Dick and Betsy were 53rd in 2014 The Richard DeVos family ranked 54th in 2010 More broadly , Amway s employees and PAC combined also rank highly among organizational donors They placed 19in 2004 and fourth in the nation in 1994 A web of nonprofits OpenSecrets keeps money in politics transparent and accountable Please support our work by making a donation today Help us count cash and make change by making a donation today Savvy political players like the DeVoses don t engage only in direct electoral action Through organized giving by its various foundations and strategic involvement in the institutions that receive their money , the DeVos family has leveraged extensive influence in nonprofit networks structured around their pet causes Most DeVos giving in this sphere is done through five foundations the Richard and Helen DeVos Foundation the Dick and Betsy DeVos Foundation the Daniel and Pamella DeVos Foundation Cheri DeVos CDV5 Foundation and the Douglas and Maria DeVos Foundation \( Daniel , Cheri and Douglas DeVos are all siblings of Dick Jr , Betsy s husband \) According to one analysis of foundation tax records , the DeVos family donated more than 90 million in 2013 altogether and around 94 million in 2014 with nearly half going to groups involved in education The DeVos family s philanthropic efforts have a more social conservative bent than those of , say , the Koch brothers for years the DeVoses have provided generous grants to religious based organizations and in particular religious schools Still , they have found common ground with the Kochs on a number of issues Regular attendees at Koch network biannual donor meeting s , the DeVoses have provided substantial support to the Koch seeded charitable arm of their Americans for Prosperity , a very active dark money group the FreedomWorks Foundation , which is connected to another dark money outfit that originated with one started by the Kochs and the Mercatus Institute , a market focused research center at George Mason University that has received funding from the Kochs since the 1980s And the family has actively fought to sweep away restrictions on money in politics with substantial contributions to nonprofits that litigate against such limits Those include the Center for Competitive Politics and the James Madison Center for Free Speech , a nonprofit set up by Citizens United attorney James Bopp and Sen Mitch McConnell \( R Ky \) that consistently funnels nearly the entirety of its funds to Bopp s firm each year Bopp has taken a broadsword to campaign finance restrictions nationwide , mounting legal challenges to them at the federal , state and local levels Betsy DeVos may have married into the DeVos dynasty , but her own family has its own strong ties to the conservative movement Her father , Edgar Prince , helped Gary Bauer create the Family Research Council , an influential conservative group And along with her siblings , Betsy sits on the board of the Edgar Elsa Prince Foundation , a major donor to groups that include the Education Freedom Fund , the Heritage Foundation and the Alliance Defense Fund Trump s pick holds strategic advisory positions with a number of nonprofit organizations that lobby to varying degrees on education issues , including Jeb Bush s Foundation for Excellence in Education But her baby is the American Federation for Children a 501 \( c \) \( 4 \) dark money group that promotes school voucher programs and charter schools across the country AFC has significantly increased its efforts in recent years It told the IRS that it made just 250 , 000 in political expenditures in 2009 , a figure that increased to over 1 million by 2010 and nearly 1 7 million by 2011 In 2014 , the number dropped a bit to just over 1 million But that year , AFC and its affiliated organizations boasted spending 4 5 million between the primary and general elections on 242 races in nine states without ever disclosing its donors It reported that pro school choice candidates mainly governors , state legislators and other non federal politicians won in 92 percent of the general election races it targeted , distinguishing AFC , with Betsy DeVos as its chair , as a powerhouse in the movement And AFC s efforts go far beyond direct involvement in political contests Among other activities , it has funneled money into other dark money groups that support contenders for state supreme court seats deemed likely to be friendly to policies advocated by AFC that could be legally challenged The Education nominee also heads All Children Matter , a political committee that lobbies for school choice Started with seed money from DeVos Advocates for School Choice , the predecessor to AFC , All Children Matter has been funded by millions from the DeVos family over the years , but has also received substantial sums from the Walton family \( of Walmart fame \) and other high profile conservative donors Though DeVos was not personally named in the case , All Children Matter has millions in outstanding fines for election law violations dating back to 2008 a record amount that is nearly a decade past due Betsy DeVos led the group at the time of the violations in fact , she is the only person who has been listed on All Children Matter s leadership page since 2006 Supporting the bench Megadonors tend not to focus their contributions only on those in the majors they direct some of their investments to minor leaguers , too , as well as those who might have a more direct local impact on their concerns The Grand Rapids , Mich based DeVoses are no exception , giving extensively in state and local elections They ve contributed , for instance , a combined 9 5 million to the Michigan Republican Party in the last 20 years According to National Institute on Money in State Politics data , Betsy DeVos has given over 1 9 million in state and local elections since 1996 , a total that pales in comparison to her husband Dick s 40 2 million To be fair , the lion s share of that sum was the nearly 35 4 million that he gave to his own 2006 gubernatorial campaign In that contest , DeVos family members \( including the candidate \) accounted for three of his top four donors But DeVos , who was challenging Democratic incumbent Jennifer Granholm , fell short in the general election by a 56 to 42 percent margin Overall , Dick DeVos s siblings have cut large checks at the state and local levels Doug DeVos , the current president of Amway , has donated almost 2 8 million in these elections with his wife , Maria , according to the National Institute on Money in State Politics Dan , a sports executive and the current chairman of the Orlando Magic , has contributed a little less than 2 4 million with his wife , Pamella Their sister , Cheri DeVos , a former Amway vice president , has given more than 1 25 million to state and local political causes State level advocacy organizations have also drawn significant DeVos largesse For example , eight DeVos family members together gave an even 2 million to Protecting Michigan Taxpayers , a group that sought unsuccessfully \) in 2015 to repeal Michigan s prevailing wage law , which ensures state construction contractors pay union wages to their workers But if the family has adopted a second state , it s Florida DeVos ownership of the Magic dates back to 1991 , and family members have donated to a number of Florida politicians and advocacy organizations In 2008 , when the group Florida4Marriage sponsored an amendment to the state constitution that would limit the definition of marriage to a heterosexual union , Dick DeVos contributed 100 , 000 , making him the second highest donor to the effort The measure passed but it was later struck down by the Supreme Court s 2015 decision in Obergefell v Hodges Researchers Doug Weber and

"November 4 , 2007Patrick Stewart Keep on trekkin'From the USS Enterprise to the London stage , Patrick Stewart has had a brilliant career So how come he left the rave reviews till last \? Bryan AppleyardJust over 20 years ago , in his mid forties , Patrick Stewart was doing pretty well as an actor He didn t have any savings , but he had a nice house in Chiswick and could afford to send his two children to private schools My career , he says , had been chugging along in an okay way Then he appeared in Peter Shaffer s Yonadab at the National Theatre It was Shaffer s only flop , and Stewart found himself playing to an almost empty house Next came Who s Afraid of Virginia Woolf \? with Billie Whitelaw at the Young Vic It was a hit and ready to transfer to the West End , but Whitelaw didn t want to go The money man said the loss of Whitelaw was a problem He couldn t take it into the West End without a star people had heard of It really hurt , that remark All those years of work at the RSC But I guess it was a pragmatic point of view I wasn t bankable , and he couldn t sell this production on my name So , in 1987 , he took a television job in Hollywood Everybody told him to do it he could make some money , be seen by millions and then come home It was no big commitment , he was assured , as the series would certainly bomb It sounded like a great plan It was a great deal That s why I did it The series was certain to fail because it seemed like little more than a desperate attempt to revive an old one Furthermore , Stewart was to be cast as the most unAmerican hero imaginable , an earl grey drinking , vaguely aristocratic , vaguely naval type with a French French ! name , who preferred talking to fighting On the face of it , the series only made sense as some sort of tax scam Stewart and the rest of the cast thought nothing of signing up for six years But , of course , Star Trek The Next Generation lasted for seven years , and Stewart was Captain Jean Luc Picard of the Starship Enterprise for 178 episodes Then it turned into a series of films , culminating in Star Trek Nemesis , in 2002 It came to a point where I had no idea where Picard began and I ended We completely overlapped His voice became my voice , and there were other elements of him that became me Stewart was now unbankable in a wholly new way No director in Hollywood wanted to cast this grand , deep voiced , bald English guy because everybody knew he was Picard and couldn t possibly be anybody else In the event , he effectively reprised the part as Professor Charles Xavier a grand , deep voiced , bald English guy in the X Men films I don t have a film career , he says wryly , I have a franchise career In 2004 , however , homesick , pining for the stage and with his second marriage coming to an end \( he now lives with the actress Lisa Dillon \) , he came home with , for a Shakespearian star , a gaping hole in his CV There comes a point where you have to start ticking off these roles I ve missed out on Hamlet and Romeo , probably Richard III , too I was even uncomfortably aware when I took on Macbeth that people were saying I was a little old for it I ve not done Lear , but Ian McKellen has closed that door for a good few years If I could fit in only one more Shakespeare role , it would be Falstaff I ve always thought of him as a middle aged Hamlet It s a great role He s 67 now and so absurdly buff that he could pass for an absurdly buff 50 We meet at the stage door of the Gielgud theatre or , rather , we fail to meet , because he rushed in with a Huddersfield Town cap pulled over his face He doesn t like the hooker and thug infested bit of Soho around Rupert Street , and he and the rest of the cast leave by the front entrance in the evening , hence the speed of his entry and the disguise He s doing his Macbeth at the Gielgud , and both he and the show are magnificent , mesmerising The reviews are raves , and it s just about to go to New York It was , I say , the play that turned me on to Shakespeare when I was 14 He laughs I think you ll find a lot of people will say that I got a sniff of it when I was 14 I thought I was going to play it , and somebody said to me , Stewart , you re going to get a lot of opportunities to play parts like this we re giving it to somebody else As it happened , that production didn t eventually happen There seem to be three important things about Stewart s childhood his luck , his dad and the Yorkshire countryside He was lucky because , in spite of abject academic failure he skived off on the day of his 11 plus he was spotted by a smart English teacher and was taught outside school by a brilliant drama teacher It was clear where he was going , and , after a spell on the local paper , he became a full time actor It was a smart move , bunking off the 11 plus I would never have met Cecil Dormand a great man and I would have been a grammar school failure His father had been in the army for 10 years and then enlisted again in 1939 He was an imposing man , regimental sergeant major in the Parachute Regiment He had a terrific voice , better than mine Somebody said when my father walked on the parade ground , the birds stopped singing The Macbeth production is set in a modern , military state Stewart has grown a sergeant majorish moustache for the part When I put my uniform on and look in the mirror , he stares straight back at me From the first , he was a workaholic , an affliction that , he admits , made him a bad father , remote like his dad I always chose work over the family I regret that , I really do I have a great relationship with my children now , terrific , but I didn t always have it I missed out so much And I don t think I supported their mother as much as I might have done It would never occur to me to put family first It s still a struggle It wasn t because I didn t love them , I just loved the job so much He did bits of film and television , but everything else was theatre He pursued his craft with awesome austerity , a habit that backfired on him when he got on the Star Trek set At an early shoot , he snapped at the rest of the cast We re not here to have fun , we re here to work He says now I came to think there was too much fooling around on set I was very aware of the clock ticking I was the oldest person on the set , and we were working until midnight or beyond , and it took more of a toll on me than on them The others also concluded he had a poverty mentality , another aspect of his austerity He was in denial about what he was being paid for playing Picard For 15 minutes overtime , he earned an extra 125 , exactly what he had been making in a week at the Young Vic But he still lived above somebody s garage After a year , he did buy a new car a Honda The rest of the cast were in Mercedes and Fer raris But the point was and this , I am sure , is why his Star Trek was easily the most successful iteration of the franchise that he took Picard seriously I m very proud of the series I think we did really good work Every now and then we did absolute crap , but it was 178 episodes We really fought to keep the standards high the script , the language , the story lines , everything We also acquired an astonishing number of eminent fans several secretaries of state , chiefs of staff , chancellors of universities Frank Sinatra never missed Earth is released on November 16 www bryanappleyard com a show , and Tom Hanks knows the name of every episode Perhaps the key was that Stewart was such a team player He speaks warmly of the cast , and they are plainly still friends , especially Jonathan Frakes , who played Riker , Picard s deputy , and whose shouting of Red alert ! gave me and my daughter hours of innocent delight He mentions proudly that Marina Sirtis , the pompous counsellor Deanna Troi , had lunch with him in London recently Best of all , he loves the movie Galaxy Quest , a sublime Star Trek spoof Jonathan told me to see it I said I didn t want to see the piss taken out of me by Alan Rickman and the rest He told me to see it in Santa Monica on a Saturday night I did , and it was perfect , fantastic , one of my all time favourites They got it exactly right that s how it was , and the ending was right at the heart of the spirit of Star Trek He was missing theatre from the beginning And so , in his room above the garage , he constructed a series of one man shows that he took to universities and drama schools in California The best , A Christmas Carol , made it to Broad way The first few nights were full of Trekkies , many in uniform But now , he s back His rich voice provides the narration for the movie Earth , made by the BBC Natural History Unit , a feature length version of Planet Earth And , best of all , he is immersed , for at least two years , in the theatre and Shakespeare This makes him very happy He revels in the ensemble and he wallows in the language When Macbeth starts , I have three hours to inhabit this role , this man who s saying these amazing things It s not just a great story , it s mind expanding just getting your head round this imagery and this language It s like a drug there s nothing to match it And that third important thing , the countryside \? Well , he used to cycle up to the Dales as a boy Turning back to go home was a physical pain and the landscape infected him for life In Hollywood , he pined for English hills and valleys Now he has a house in the south Dales He reckons he could walk northeastward for three days from there and never see a road He has also learnt to love southern England He has just done up a house in Oxfordshire And he remembers a walk he took over the South Downs One evening that I didn t have a show , I had been rehearsing and I went home It was midsummer , so it was light , and I started walking I walked for hours and got to some high point looking down on this valley He sighs and his eyes are damp And smoke was coming up I was overwhelmed with feelings I couldn t articulate Overwhelmed It moved me so much Great actor , good man As the Vulcans used to say , live long and prosper , Captain Picard sorry , Patrick Stewart I live in Ann Arbor , Michigan and it was a little over a year ago that I saw Patrick Stewart performing here with the Royal Shakespeare Company and I enjoyed the performances immensely What moved me most I think was the awareness that here 's someone who sets the example for one who has found a love in his own work that we should all strive to find in ours Chris Kaltwasser , Ann Arbor , Michigan USI was a pretty big Star Trek TNG fan when I was a kid Patrick Stewart is an amazing actor And kind of hot for an old bald dude \) I heard he 's a Beavis and Butthead fan That blows my mind And is awesome Sarah , Virginia , USAPatrick Stewart was also good in the original version of Dune Kerry Rose , Houston , TexasI 've seen a lot of Macbeths over the years of my professional career , and Mr Stewart 's made me hear the words as if newly written for him alone It was a magnificent , mindaltering performance And , to bow to my inner geek , to be in the same room with Picard was a thrill Long live Patrick Stewart ! Robert A Wright , Atlanta , Geogia , USAAround the early 80s I bump into Mr Stewart on a video of Derek Jacobi s Hamlet in a High School British Literature Class Needless to say , due to being in high school , I was not that consistently interested in it I think I sleep through half of it over a four day period of classes Then as an insatiable curious budding actor studying Shakespeare in an Illinois college library , I came across John Barton s Playing Shakespeare Video Series which introduced me again to Mr Stewart From then on I was hooked and keep track of what he was doing And now , in light of where he has taken his career in these last two years , I am inspired It serves as a model to be constantly evolving and challenging oneself in a life 's work Mr Stewart Thank You !

"Updated NIH says cancer study also hit by fetal tissue ban Update , 13 December , 11 45 a m A third laboratory at the National Institutes of Health \( NIH \) is also affected by the agency s temporary ban on acquiring new human fetal tissue , an agency spokesperson confirmed last night Initially , NIH said only research projects run by staff scientists at the National Eye Institute \( NEI \) and the National Institute of Allergy and Infectious Diseases \( NIAID \) would be affected The third laboratory is at the National Cancer Institute \( NCI \) , which is pursuing a project on cancer immunotherapy , which will need tissue by January 31 , the agency said in a statement We are determining appropriate next steps to obtain tissue so that the NIAID project can begin and to avoid interruption of the NCI project NEI does not have an immediate need to procure new fetal tissue \( they have frozen stores \) Here is our story from 7 December U S President Donald Trump s administration has ordered scientists employed by the U S National Institutes of Health \( NIH \) to stop acquiring new human fetal tissue for experiments , Science Insider has learned The suspension , imposed this past September without a public announcement , came as the government launched a review of all fetal tissue research funded by the federal government The pause affects two laboratories run by the Bethesda , Maryland based agency , NIH officials say In one case , it disrupted a study probing how the virus that causes AIDS initially colonizes human tissues We were all poised to go and then the bombshell was dropped , says HIV researcher Warner Greene , director of the Gladstone Center for HIV Cure Research in San Francisco , California , who was collaborating with an NIH laboratory that received the order The decision completely knocked our collaboration off the rails We were devastated The order expands the scope of the Trump administration s interventions into federally funded research that uses human fetal tissue from elective abortions , which is legal but fiercely opposed by antiabortion groups In September , it canceled a Food and Drug Administration \( FDA \) contract for acquiring human fetal tissue for testing candidate drugs This week , the Department of Health and Human Services \( HHS \) , which oversees NIH , told researchers at the University of California \( UC \) , San Francisco , that it would be extending a contract for work involving human fetal tissue for just 90 days instead of the usual 1 year , prompting media reports that the department was preparing to cancel the contract HHS denied those reports , saying it has made no decisions regarding federal funding for human fetal tissue research pending the outcome of the ongoing review of all such work Today , however , an NIH spokesperson confirmed that the agency asked staff scientists to pause procurements of fetal tissue pending the outcome of the HHS review The suspension applies only to scientists who work directly for NIH s intramural program , and not extramural researchers who typically work at universities and receive grants from the government It affects two laboratories , NIH officials say One is operated by the National Eye Institute \( Fetal retinal tissue is used to study eye diseases \) The other is run by the National Institute of Allergy and Infectious Diseases \( NIAID \) Yes , we have instituted a pause of further procurements of human fetal tissue pending the audit review that HHS is undertaking , an NIAID spokeperson confirmed The HIV experiment disrupted by the suspension was being conducted at NIAID s Rocky Mountain Laboratories \( RML \) in Hamilton , Montana , which focus on infectious diseases Researchers there use fetal tissue donated by women who have had legal abortions to create so called humanized mice , which have immune systems that behave like a human s Humanized mice have played a key role in testing and developing treatments for HIV AIDS The NIH lab had , for several years , obtained the human fetal tissue from Advanced Bioscience Resources \( ABR \) , based in Alameda , California According to emails provided to Science Insider by Greene , RML researcher Kim Hasenkrug had prepared humanized mice for a trial of an antibody that the researchers believed based on promising lab dish studies might prevent HIV from establishing reservoirs in the human body \( Hasenkrug could not be reached for comment \) On 11 September , Hasenkrug informed Greene and Thomas Packard , a postdoctoral student of Greene s , that he had obtained needed reagents and the mice were ready Packard responded that they were excited at the prospect of getting the study started , and would immediately send Hasenkrug a batch of the antibodies I ll not be able to get the antibodies on the 3 PM FedEx today , but I ll ship the antibodies to you tomorrow , so you should have it on Thursday , Packard wrote in an email On 28 September , however , Greene received a message from Hasenkrug that left him stunned The email , which bore the subject line HHS directive , read in part HHS has directed me to discontinue procuring fetal tissue from ABR , the only source for us I think that they are the only provider of fetal tissue for scientists in the nation who don t have direct access to aborted fetal tissue This effectively stops all of our research to discover a cure for HIV Hasenkrug had not yet launched the experiment , Greene says , and his supplies of existing mice were too small to conduct the repeated experiments required to reach convincing scientific conclusions The order to Hasenkrug came just as HHS launched its review of human fetal tissue research , and at the same time that the department killed the FDA contract , which was with ABR \( The department wrote at that time that it was not sufficiently assured that the contract included the appropriate protections applicable to fetal tissue research , but provided no evidence of violations \) It is unclear whether HHS will next place restrictions on the grants of NIH funded investigators at universities who don t work for NIH but whose projects also rely on access to new fetal tissue Science Insider posed this question and others to Assistant Secretary of Health Brett Giroir , who is heading the review , but did not receive a response by press time Some extramural scientists are concerned Everything I am doing involves humanized mice It would shut my lab down if we were not able to use fetal tissues , says Jerome Zack , a virologist who studies HIV at UC Los Angeles , and has been using humanized mice for 25 years Such mice are particularly valuable for HIV drug testing in part because tissue from a single human fetus can readily generate a group of 40 to 50 genetically identical mice , and because the animals can , unlike monkeys , be infected with the human virus , HIV Potential drugs can then be tested in such a group , with ample mice as controls , giving the studies robust statistical power Packard calls the HHS review and its attendant constraints really just a travesty for the outlook for HIV research Mice made with human fetal tissue are critical to moving from discoveries in the lab to clinical treatments Blocking this significantly hurts our chances of finding an HIV cure Greene adds that even if the HHS order is eventually lifted , the lost time would be consequential If we were given the green light right now to resume acquiring fetal tissue , he says , it would probably take us a year to get back in the position we were in when the ban was put in place After this story was published , NIH emailed an additional statement It said the agency in September put a pause in place for staff scientists procuring new human fetal tissue , an action NIH thought was prudent given the examination of these procurements Research with tissue already on hand could proceed , and NIH leaders asked to be notified by intramural investigators if new procurement would be necessary NIH leadership was not informed that new procurement was necessary for the study you reference in your story We are looking into why this did not occur Update , 8 December , 10 p m This story has been updated to clarify a quote from Thomas Packard Update , 9 December , 9 30 a m This story is updated with an additional

"DID YOU KNOW \? Trump Won 3 , 084 out of 3 , 151 Counties Hillary Only Won 57DID YOU KNOW \? Trump Won 3 , 084 out of 3 , 151 Counties Hillary Only Won 57Politics By Eren Moreno December 1 , 2016Are you growing tired of liberals crying over the so called popular vote , as if Hillary Clinton is some beloved disenfranchised leader \? There are rules to the contest , and Trump won fair and square The rest is just noise and sore loser whining If she wants , Hillary can go be the governor of California , or President of Saudi Arabia Aside from her popularity in the ultra liberal strongholds California and New York , the final election breakdown of the numbers shows what an ass kickin Hillary received from the American people From Allen West The keening and caterwauling we ve been treated to by the left since Hillary Clinton s defeat has been monumental Most entertaining has been the snowflake retreat to safe spaces with puppies and coloring books to assuage their anguish Less entertaining were the violent protests whichwere paid foreruptedPutting aside Jill Stein s quixotic effort to force a recount , the left has been loudest with its demands to dismantle the Electoral College After all it s unfair Hillary Clinton won the popular vote so she should win , right \? Wrong Our Founders in their infinite wisdom created the Electoral College to ensure the STATES were fairly represented Why should one or two densely populated areas speak for the whole of the nation \? The following list of statistics has been making the rounds on the Internet and it should finally put an end to the argument as to why the Electoral College makes sense Share this with as many whiners as you can There are 3 , 141 counties in the United States Trump won 3 , 084 of them Clinton won 57 There are 62 counties in New York State Trump won 46 of them Clinton won 16 Clinton won the popular vote by approx 1 5 million votes In the 5 counties that encompass NYC , \( Bronx , Brooklyn , Manhattan , Richmond Queens \) Clinton received well over 2 million more votes than Trump \( Clinton only won 4 of these counties Trump won Richmond \) Therefore these 5 counties alone , more than accounted for Clinton winning the popular vote of the entire country These 5 counties comprise 319 square miles The United States is comprised of 3 , 797 , 000 square miles When you have a country that encompasses almost 4 million square miles of territory , it would be ludicrous to even suggest that the vote of those who inhabit a mere 319 square miles should dictate the outcome of a national election Large , densely populated Democrat cities \( NYC , Chicago , LA , etc \) don t and shouldn t speak for the rest of our country Support the Trump Presidency and help us fight Liberal Media Bias Please LIKE and SHARE this story on Facebook or Twitter",false
"Danish swimmers escape waters fearing killer fishKiller fishThe capture in the Danish Swedish strait of Oresund of a fish some twenty centimeters in size and with long sharp teeth has caused Danish swimmers to leave the water fearing an invasion of meat eating killer fish , Piranhas There is however no cause for panic say experts The fish , though exotic , is a Pacu , not a piranha None the less they caution male swimmers to protect their privates when swimming in the sound Pacu teeth Photo Henrik Carl Discovering whether this fish is a lone wanderer or a new invasive species will be very exciting And a bit scary It 's the first time this species has been caught in the wild in Scandinavia , says Associate Professor and fish expert Peter Rask M ller of the Natural History Museum of Denmark , University of Copenhagen Caught by hobby fishermanThe frightening fish was caught by hobby fisherman Einar Lindgreen on August 4 As he emptied his nets north of Danish isle Saltholm in the strait Oresund which seperates Denmark and Sweden he saw the red bellied bigtooth among eels and perch Back in the harbour the exotic fish caused quite an uproar , as several of Lindgreens colleagues were convinced that they were staring at a South American Piranha Fortunately the fish was sent for study at the Natural History Museum of Denmark Here Peter Rask M ller and fellow fish expert Henrik Carl examined the animal Their calming communique for Danish bathers is that the fish is not a Piranha but a close South American relative the Pacu Pacu Photo Henrik CarlThough the Pacu , like its cousin the Piranha , belongs in waters like the Amazon it has found its way to other waters around the globe by way of aquariums and fish farms In large parts of the USA and Asia it is now considered an invasive species It grows to as much as 25 kilograms and is a popular fish for farming and eating But how this fish ended up in Scandinavian waters is a bit of a puzzler Some have imagined that it escaped from the recently established The Blue Planet Denmark 's Aquarium This Copenhagen attraction is situated right next to Oresund and gets its water from there But that is flat out impossible assures curator at The Blue Planet Lars Skou Olsen We do exhibit Pacus in our Amazonas exhibition , but ours are a lot larger than the one caught And even though the distance between our aquariums and resund can be measured in meters there are sophisticated filters in place to avoid contamination So this is not one of our fish , assures Olsen The usual suspects Amateur aquarium owners and fish farmers are The usual suspects when we meet fish where they do not belong , says Peter Rask M ller It is not unlikely that someone has emptied their fish tank into a nearby stream just before a vacation and that the Pacu then swam out into the brackish waters of Oresund We do n't know of any commercial farming of Pacus in Europe But just like the Piranhas the Pacus are quite easy for amateurs to raise , says M ller Danish boy Malthe with Pacu Photo Henrik CarlOnly once before has a Pacu been caught anywhere in Europe That was in 2002 , when a sportsfisher hooked one near a power plant on the Odra river in Poland The river Odra empties into the Baltic Sea very close to Denmark , says Peter Rask M ller The Pacu is known as the peaceful cousin of the Piranha as it is largely vegetarian Their powerful teeth are not as sharp as those of the Piranhas , but they are fully capable of severing fishing lines and even fingers In order to be one hundred percent certain of the identification we will now perform a genetic examination , as there are several species of Pacu which are very similar when young In the aqua culture busines they even produce hybrids between species , explains Peter Rask M ller The teeth are used mainly to crush nuts and other fruits , but the Pacu eats fish and small invertebrates as well Its preference for nuts have had fatal results though In Papua New Guinea where the species has also escaped it is rumoured to have mistaken nuts for male reproductive organs So anyone choosing to bathe in the resund these days had best keep their swimsuits well tied Contact",false

You re going to take the guns away from hunters \? He also pointed out that many people have rifles for entertainment Morgan s data point is incorrect According to the Gun Violence Archive , 234 people were shot and killed in the United States the week of the Paris attacks There are more gun suicides than homicides in the United States , but , even so , France has averaged more than 1 , 800 gun deaths per year in recent years It s still the case , though , that other nations see far fewer gun deaths than does the United States Looking at estimates since 1990 , calculated by the Global Health Data Exchange at the University of Washington , there were more homicides by gun in the United States in 1990 alone than there were from 1990 through 2017 in the United Kingdom , Canada and Germany combined \( Philip Bump The Washington Post \) Most of those killed in the United States this year died in incidents in which they were the only victim While we focus on mass shootings \( defined by the Gun Violence Archive as incidents in which four or more people were killed or wounded \) , victims of these incidents make up only a tiny fraction of all those killed in 2019 \( Philip Bump The Washington Post \) The number of those killed and wounded by guns in the United States has already topped 16 , 000 this year \( Philip Bump The Washington Post \) An after action report compiled by the U S Army after D Day found that between June 6 , 1944 , and July 1 , the United States suffered 2 , 811 deaths and 13 , 564 wounded That s 16 , 375 casualties combined slightly less than the total from shooting incidents in the United States this year through June 6",true

"Microwave radiation permeates households Microwaves change the nature of food , depleting nutritional value Russia 's warning to the world \( NaturalNews \) What would your life be like if you did n't have a microwave oven \? While your microwave certainly saves you time , is it slowly destroying your health \? Not only do microwaves attract the most unhealthy , nutrient depleted foods , but they also expose families to electromagnetic radiation that permeates the walls and the human body The electromagnetic field \( EMF \) produced by common household microwaves is something Russia has taken seriously in the past After conducting thorough research into the health effects of microwave EMFs , Russia determined in 1976 that microwaves were dangerous to their people In that year , Russia banned the devices to protect their citizenry The radio frequency radiation emitted by microwaves does n't remain contained in the microwave oven In fact , the FDA has their own set of safety standards limiting the amount of microwaves that can leak from an oven throughout its lifetime In the U S , any microwave that lets off over 5 milliwatts \( mW \) of microwave radiation per square centimeter up to 2 inches from the oven 's surface is faulty and dangerous In the real world , is this radiation really being measured from household to household \? Most likely not , and consumers are led to believe that this new age cooking method is safe for their bodies A handheld EMF meter can be used to test household microwave appliances for radio frequency radiation levels When a microwave is turned on , its non ionizing radiation can penetrate the walls and permeate the human body In May 2011 the World Health Organization classified this EMF exposure as a class 2B possible carcinogen Microwaves seem fast and simple , but how they prepare food is far from what the body would recognize as natural When foods are cooked in microwaves the molecules are exposed to waves of energy that vibrate at the speed of 2 4 billion times per second this causes the food molecules to resonate at very high frequencies The food molecules quickly generate heat from the inside , where water is present This cooking method is strikingly different from a convection oven , which emits a slow heat that warms the food from the outside in Microwave ovens , on the other hand , heat the food up from the inside out , changing the very nature of the food , deforming the structures of the food molecules This is why microwave food loses 60 to 90 percent of its nutritional value In fact , the amino acids in milk and cereal grains break down into carcinogenic substances after they are put through a microwave When meats are put through the microwave a carcinogen called d Nitrosodienthanolamines forms When fruits are exposed to microwaves , their glucoside and galactoside content breaks down into carcinogenic substances When food is heated up in plastic containers , the chemicals from the plastic can heat up and leach into the food as well Known carcinogens and endocrine disrupters such as BPA , phthalates , polyethylene terpthalate \( PET \) , benzene , toluene and xylene can leech directly into microwave food Berlin research dating back to 1942 investigated the health hazards associated with microwave food this was the same research that led Russia to ban the devices in 1976 The ban was eventually lifted to promote free trade with the west however , the problems with microwaves are still the same today Russia ultimately issued an international warning for microwaves and cell phones , which release similar frequencies that cause biological and environmental hazards The good news is that transitioning from a microwave to a convection oven is easy Steamers or turbo ovens are great alternatives , too It 's much safer to let food defrost and allow it to cook naturally through convection , to avoid depleting the food 's nutritional properties and changing its natural molecular chemistry It 's important to remember that food is information for the cells , and if the body no longer recognizes what is going in , then it cannot utilize nutrition that is no longer there",false
"Penguins are turning to prostitution But instead of doing it for money , Antarctic dolly birds are turning tricks to get rocks off their menfolk Stones are essential for penguins to build their nests A shortage has led to the unorthodox tactics Stones are the valuable currency in penguin terms , said Dr Fiona Hunter , a researcher in the Zoology Department at Cambridge University , who has spent five years observing the birds' mating patterns Prostitution is described as the world 's oldest profession But Dr Hunter is convinced it is the first time it has been seen in animals Penguin partners All of the female penguins Dr Hunter observed trading sex for stones had partners Penguins stick to the same mate , she said , but none of the males twigged what was happening There was no suspicion on the part of the males Females quite often go off on their own to collect stones , so as far as the males are concerned there is no reason to suspect She added It tends to be females targeting single males , otherwise the partner female would beat the intruder up Dr Hunter and Dr Lloyd Davis of the University of Otago watched the penguins at work on Ross Island , about 800 miles from the South Pole as part of a Antarctica New Zealand programme Tricking their prey On some occasions the prostitute penguins trick the males They carry out the elaborate courtship ritual , which usually leads to mating Having bagged their stone , they would then run off The courtship display is a head bowing display , Dr Hunter said It usually starts with the male , who bows his head and looks out the corner of his eye She said she does not think the female penguins are doing it just for the stones The female only takes one or two stones , she said It takes hundreds to build the nest to get their eggs off the ground I think what they are doing is having copulation for another reason and just taking the stones as well We do n't know exactly why , but they are using the males She said the female penguins could also be testing potential future mates , in case their existing partner died before the next mating period The single male penguins appeared to have only their own pleasure as a motive The action takes place during a three week mating period starting in late October The most stones Dr Hunter saw a single female taking was 62 , although she said she suspects her final total was higher The number of prostitute penguins is quite low , she said It 's probably only a few percent , she said I was watching opportunistically , so I ca n't give an exact figure of how common it really is Other animals have been seen trading food for sexual favours but only within a partnership",false

Old books , decomposing newspapers , pansy artwork and a bunch of black and white movies about women and illegal immigrants have no business being protected with our hard earned tax dollars My first act as President would be to dissolve wasteful branches of government like the Library and that Kennedy Center for Peforming Arts stuff , and sell the material to China for huge profits The statement caused a surprisingly quick response from Acting Librarian of Congress David S Mao Having just been named to the position by retired Congressional Librarian James H Billington this past October , Mao did not foresee such inflammatory attention being brought to his doorstep so quickly , The threat of dissolution of the Library of Congress is unprecedented , Mao stated in a missive sent to AP It s not within the scope of the Presidency to deny such funding David S Mao , Acting Librarian of CongressMao went on to define the depth and breadth , and impact such a cavalier undertaking could mean We are the largest library in the world , with over 162 million items Books , films , photographs , audio recordings , maps and manuscripts , our collection is unprecedented To lose these vital touchstones to all of civilization would be catastrophic When asked to respond , Trump s campaign manager , Corey Lewandowski , issued this statement The President of the United States appoints the Librarian of Congress and can just as easily unappoint him Mr Mao should be more concerned with his ancestry , which sounds a little Communistic , if anything CNN s Anderson Cooper attempted to reach Lewandowski live on air following the statement , but was informed the campaign manager is currently focused on his arrest for battery against a female reporter As expected , the statement caused shockwaves across social media Martin Scorsese , proponent for film preservation , immediately tweeted Inconceivable Drumpf \( referring to Trump s real name \) will destroy the United States of America as he dismantles our heritage Casablanca , 1942 , starring Humphrey Bogart and Ingrid Bergman , could be destroyedAt press time , UCLA Film and Television Archives , AFI , The Paley Center for Media and the Hubbard Celebrity Centre International all chimed in with vows to step in and archive as many of the films involved as possible Dr Jan Christopher Horak , UCLA Film and Television Archive Director issued this statement Edison Kinetoscopes , Citizen Kane , To Kill a Mockingbird , Lawrence of Arabia , I could go on and on These are our International life s blood And that s just the films Only one of three known Gutenberg Bibles are housed in the Library of Congress Mr Trump is actually heralding the Apocalypse Surprisingly , there were voices of support When questioned , the Cruz Campaign commented , We re not ready to comment , however , the country needs to make some tough decisions , and the Library of Congress does fit the criteria of wasteful spending The recently released Rosa Parks Papers , could potentially be on the burn list Attempting to return to the spotlight , Sarah Palin tweeted To Kill a Mockingbird \?

"0125010213 tfrwresponsespftexasEmails \( excerpted \) , responses from Laura Sorrell , volunteer spokeswoman , the Texas Federation of Republican Women , Jan 25 through Feb 1 , 2013306 pmJan 25 , 2013 \( from Laura Sorrell , Austin spokeswoman \) Below is a statement from Carolyn Hodges Please let me know if you need any additional clarification Carolyn Hodges , TFRW President We sought information from many sources and immigration groups across the nation to find a high and low number While working with the groups , there were widely varied estimates Because the range of numbers is so broad , we hoped to use the broadest of numbers so that we could get down to the point of finding smart solutions , not just more disagreement Here is an example of the difficulty in estimating the number The residual method is widely used to estimate the undocumented population of the USA With this method , the known number of legal immigrants to the United States is subtracted from the reported U S Census number of self proclaimed foreign born people to obtain the total , unauthorized immigrant \( residual \) population 2 This methodology is used by the US Department of Homeland Security , 3 the Pew Hispanic Center , the US Census Bureau and others Since undocumented immigrants have many reasons for not answering the U S Census correctly and since there are no penalties for answering the U S Census incorrectly , a direct subtraction is a well known source of undercount error and has to be corrected All known users of this methodology correct the foreign born population \( about 35 50 million \) by 10 40 \( 3 12 million \) to account for this undercount effect Critics claim this correction is in error no matter which size correction is used \( Jeffery Passel , Unauthorized Migrants Numbers and Characteristics , Pew Hispanic Center , June 2005 Michael Hoefer and Christopher Campbell , Estimates of the Unauthorized Immigrant Population Residing in the United States May 2006 , US Department of Homeland Security , Office of Immigration Statistics , Policy Directorate , January 2005 \) From Selby , Gardner \( CMG Austin \) wgselby statesman com Date Friday , January 25 , 2013 3 08 PMTo Laura SorrellThanks , Laura Where did the group field the 9 million and 50 million figures \? 326 pmJan 25 , 2013The example provided below there is a large margin of error when figuring out the number using the residual data method Because the number varies from each report you see when browsing for the figure , it was clear that there is no correct number Even the government agencies \( US Dept Homeland Security and the Census Bureau \) agree that the margin of error can range anywhere from 10 40 more than what is actually published Again , the point is to show that no one knows the actual number and that is why TFRW is offering a smart solution to the issue , instead of just continuing the disagreement 4 pmJan 29 , 2013The 50 million source TFRW used was Joan Neuhaus Schaan , who at the time of speaking with TFRW , was the Fellow for Homeland Security Terrorism Programs at the James A Baker III Institute for Public Policy at Rice University 1151 amJan 31 , 2013The 50 million source TFRW used was Joan Neuhaus Schaan , who at the time of speaking with TFRW , was the Fellow for Homeland Security Terrorism Programs at the James A Baker III Institute for Public Policy at Rice University The 50 million source TFRW used was Joan Neuhaus Schaan , who at the time of speaking with TFRW , was the Fellow for Homeland Security Terrorism Programs at the James A Baker III Institute for Public Policy at Rice University 1153 amThe point was to show you 're using sources that people do not view as credible Sorry about not providing the source for the 9 million Thought you had already proven that number to be correct on your own Here are some sources below The U S Census Bureau estimates that there are 8 to 9 million undocumented workers , as they are often called , in the U S , and each year the number goes up by about 500 , 000 Other estimates are much higher the official number put out by the U S Census of 9 million Again , the point of the resolution was to not get bogged down with the numbers , but to prove a point that no one knows what the actual numbers are The overall resolution is to show that the real discussion should be about the policy and overall reform not specific numbers From Selby , Gardner \( CMG Austin \) wgselby statesman com Date Friday , February 1 , 2013 12 12 PMTo Laura Sorrell I rechecked with the census bureau It has made no estimates Let me know if you have a source for the 9 million figure \?",false

Because He s sick of what he s seeing But the best part about it , and the thing that we are obviously too stubborn to realize , the activist added , is He is more than willing to forgive He will always offer you a clean slate and a fresh start , no matter how sinful you ve become All we need to do now , all we need to do to help our women be better and more virtuous , is make them stop having dirty fantasies As if that wasn t enough , Scarborough also stated his theory on how the deed should be done I can t say from personal experience , but I ve heard that talking to women never works because they re too stubborn Beating the living daylights out of them is another way to go , and that s what I d recommend I think every single woman who has dirty fantasies should be beaten and beaten well Then and only then will God even consider giving us the cure for breast cancer And another thing , Scarborough added I m pretty sure that therapy by beating might also work on a certain percentage of the gay population I m not sure what percentage , since a number of them probably loves to be roughed up during their filthy intercourse anyway , but it might prove to be a positive form of physical therapy after all",false

"Most of us grew up watching Disney cartoons and we continue to love them both the old and new ones These animated films tell us about love and friendship , all while making us laugh But when we watch Disney cartoons as adults , we can t help noticing some of the things that we didn t see before These films gave us innocent laughs as kids , but now , we have questions Lots of questions For example , why was Roger Rabbit married to Jessica Rabbit \? Why did Esmeralda show us scandalous dance moves \? Why did Ursula from The Little Mermaid sing a song about body language to young viewers \? Was it all done on purpose or was it accidental \? We just can t pretend like we did n't see these now obvious things , so we decided to write about them instead Go ahead and read our list of inappropriate moments Disney that will leave you going , Wait , our parents let us watch THAT \? ! Continue scrolling to keep reading Click the button below to start this article in quick view Share Tweet Email Copy Link Copied advertising 15 I Guess Size Doesn t Matter For Anna Frozen didn t escape our list of Disney inappropriateness For example , in one of the scenes , Anna and Kristoff discuss her obsession with Hans Anna hears for the second time that she can t marry a man she s just met \( which destroys the stereotypes of all Disney movies \) Kristoff asks if she knows Hans well enough to become his wife At first , he asks Anna what his last name is , to which the girl replies of the Southern Isles \( apparently Kristoff is right and she has no clue on what kind of person Hans is \) Then he asks what Hans s shoe size is , which is a seemingly innocent question But we know that shoe size can be related to something more intimate And , as if confirming our suspicions , Anna replies , Foot size doesn t matter Wow , things escalated quickly ! 14 Is This A Bump , Or What \? A couple of inappropriate things slipped into the Hercules movie as well Do you recall the moment when the son of Zeus hits the River Guardian \? The horseshoe lands right on his head and it results in a huge bump appearing on top of the poor guy 's head Due to the presence of those two huge eyebrows under this bump , the injury gets a striking resemblance to a male 's nether regions Whether it was done intentionally or not , this bump ca n't be unseen ! And there is one more inappropriate scene in the same cartoon the dance of muses The next time you watch this flick , take notice of the skirts that the beautiful women are wearing and how they fly up and show nothing underneath ! 13 Ursula s Inappropriate Body Language Another inappropriate thing about The Little Mermaid is Ursula 's behavior Ariel asks this evil sea witch for help since she wants to get legs and join her beloved on land Ursula agrees and says that the mermaid will have to give up her voice as payment At first Ariel disagrees to such a deal , but ultimately gives up Among everything else , the sea witch reminds Ariel of one more thing body language She sings a song that is a little too sultry for a Disney film , and the lyrics are a tad inappropriate She says that men are not all that impressed with conversation and that it 's she who holds her tongue who gets a man But the epitome of it all is her reminder of the importance of body language that is accompanied by unequivocal body movements advertising 12 Are Those Gummies For Kids \? As it turns out , Miley Cyrus went bad long before singing Wrecking Ball and twerking live When she was playing Hannah Montana , a number of products with her name appeared in stores for kids One of those items were these gummies that were designed as , as they put it , guitar and microphone shapes But the person who created these candies was either a complete pervert or just straight up clueless The shape of these gummies is far from resembling guitars or mics Obviously , these candies are n't appropriate for kids But , on the other hand , they would be appropriate for bachelorette parties Did it occur to the Disney marketers to create a new package for these gummies and sell them in shops for adults \? That would be a better idea , for sure ! 11 Dumbo s Unfortunate Trip This is a scene that should have freaked us out while we were watching Dumbo as kids If you don t remember what was going on here , we re here to remind you Dumbo , our lovely big eared elephant , drinks champagne spiked water and gets lit AF What follows is the scene with his horrific hallucinations He sees multiple colorful elephants that are dancing strangely They even \( at times \) form into a single huge elephant with multiple heads The most terrifying thing is that all these heads have black lifeless eyes Yikes ! Was there acid or a stronger drug in Dumbo 's champagne laced water \? What were they thinking when creating these scenes for children \? Did they intend to show that it 's bad to get drunk \? Isn t there a less creepy way to do this \? advertising 10 Donald Duck Was A Nazi \? We all remember this funny duck and his fascinating adventures But do we know everything about him \? No , apparently we don t ! In 1942 , when World War II was in action , Disney released the cartoon Der Fuehrer s Face It was an animated short film that featured Donald Duck as a Nazi \( a reluctant one , but still \) ! In the cartoon , Donald Duck has a nightmare in which he is a Nazi who lives in the town where everything has the shape of swastika He has to arrange food rations for German Fascists and work overtime at the factory that is producing weapons But in the end , Donald wakes up and demonstrates gratitude for being an American citizen Der Fuehrer s Face was an anti Nazi propaganda Since it had a highly controversial content , it wasn t generally released , even though \( oddly enough \) it received an Academy Award 9 So Many Things About Jessica Rabbit There are quite a few inappropriate things about Jessica Rabbit from Who Framed Roger Rabbit First of all , why the hell is she , a human , married to a rabbit \? Of course , some people say that kids can t see far into those things , but still is it okay to show them that a human character is married to an animal character \? It probably messed us up in some way that a shrink could probably figure out It seems kind of far fetched Why was n't Jessica Rabbit a rabbit lady \( like Roger \) \? She would still look hot as a rabbit and probably less controversial , too Now , let s discuss another major inappropriate thing about Jessica Rabbit In one of the scenes , she s thrown out of the car When she falls down , her dress flies up and everyone sees that she doesn t wear any underwear under that high slit dress How appropriate is this to show lady parts of a character to children \? advertising 8 Topless Harpies In Fantasia Fantasia is a 1940 Disney animated movie that had numerous weird imagery \( It must have scared the pants off kid viewers back in the day \) In one of its programs , namely Night on Bald Mountain , we saw a Ukrainian demon , Chernabog This demon rules all other dark creatures that gather on the Sabbath and is an explicitly horrifying creature Honestly , it s hard to even understand why this terrifying demon was added to a children s cartoon at all But the inappropriateness doesn t end there To make matters worse , his fellow demons known as 'Harpies' appear And we re dumbfounded to see that all of them are topless ! I understand this was back in the '40s and things were different then , but how on earth is it appropriate to show the perky nipples of female demons to kids \? 7 Continuation Of The Boob Theme The Lion King is one of our favorite Disney movies It has a ton of good messages for kids , such as the importance of courage and belief in oneself But it also has some inappropriate hidden messages You most likely already know about the dust that forms into the word sex in the sky , about the shape of a female s backside on the nose of Simba , and about the seductive gaze Nala gives Simba when they meet as adults But did you know that there is one more thing in this cartoon that is certainly not for kids \? In the scene when Zazu is showing Simba and Nala where the watering hole is , he s flying past some palm trees and sand dunes But why would sand dunes have those weird dark spots at the very top \? Don t they look more like nipples \? It s actually the only thing they resemble ! advertising 6 Highly Inappropriate Background The Disney s 1977 animated film , The Rescuers , is a sweet story about two mice from the Rescue Aid Society that are rescuing a little girl kidnapped by treasure hunters Despite how neat and kosher it sounds , there are inappropriate additions as well Do you notice anything strange in the scene when Bernard and Bianca are flying through the city in their sardine can \? If you don t , let us point it out to you there is a topless woman standing in the window in the background ! Interestingly enough , Disney has been trying to make excuses , saying that the image was added some time after post production of the movie But does it really matter when it happened \? It 's still in the final product ! 5 What A Beautiful Castle ! Wait , What \? Look at this marvelous castle that belongs to King Triton It s very beautiful and extravagant , isn t it \? In fact , it 's pretty much flawless But if we zoom in a little closer , we see a glittery male , ahem , organ ! Some people say we 're crazy and it 's just a column But there are a few rumors circling around this supposed column One of them suggests that the illustrator who created this poster was in a hurry and didn t notice that he had drawn something inappropriate for a children 's cartoon Another rumor suggests that this illustrator was going to quit his job and drew the image on purpose out of spite We still don t know which story is true and we doubt we 'll ever know Regardless of what we think though , there is a column on the cover of The Little Mermaid that looks like a penis Damn 4 If You Know What I Mean Here is another example of a line in a kids movie that you probably did n't think twice about Until now , that is ! This line definitely flew over kids' heads but adults were shocked after hearing it When Aladdin and Jasmine were getting married in Aladdin and the King of Thieves , an unusual earthquake suddenly began While everything was rambling , Genie cried out that he thought that the Earth wasn t supposed to move until the honeymoon When you were a kid , you probably didn t notice the sexual reference here it was just a funny line But being an adult now , you know that the first night as husband and wife is usually accompanied by not getting too much time to sleep If you know what we mean 3 Too Small Of A Tent In The Emperor 's New Groove , there was a character named Kronk \( a big , kind hearted man who was assisting the main antagonist \) In one of the scenes , Kronk is peacefully sleeping while holding a stuffed teddy bear in his hands But it 's not the adult sleeping with a stuffed bear that we 're going to talk about when we say inappropriate here It 's Kronk 's tent When we see the tent , a question comes to mind immediately why is it so small \?

Secret US Mission To Iran By Sorcha Faal , and as reported to her Western Subscribers A new Foreign Military Intelligence \( GRU \) report circulating in the Kremlin today is saying that United States Secretary of State Hillary Clinton photo 2nd left was injured , and a top US Navy Seal Commander killed when their C 12 Huron military passenger and transport aircraft crash landed nearly 3 weeks ago in the Iranian city of Ahvaz near the Iraqi border Iranian intelligence agents quoted in this GRU report confirm that the C 12 Huron aircraft is still in their possession in Ahvaz , but will only admit that the plane was forced to land because of technical problems The US Navy Seal member reported killed in this bizarre incident , this report says , was indentified as Commander Job W Price photo 3rd left who as a leader of this highly specialized American Special Forces unit protects high ranking diplomats traveling in Middle Eastern and Asian combat zones Curiously , US media reports on Commander Price s death say it being investigated as a possible suicide as he died from what the American Defense Department describes as a non combat related injury Equally as curious , US media reports state that Secretary Clinton will return to work next week after her having suffered what they describe as a nasty bout with stomach flu and a concussion which have kept her missing from public view the past three weeks This GRU report , however , states that US military flight logs recorded by Russian air and space forces confirm that Commander Price , and other members of US Navy Seal Team 4 , left their base in Urozgan Province , Afghanistan on a flight to US Naval Support Activity Bahrain where they met up with Secretary Clinton and all of them transferred to the C 12 Huron that began a flight path to Baghdad , Iraq Within minutes of leaving Bahrain airspace , this report says , the C 12 Huron carrying Secretary Clinton and her US Navy Seal protectors , without notice , deviated from their assigned flight path heading , instead , directly towards Iran s Ahwaz International Airport where , coincidentally , Iranian President Mahmoud Ahmadinejad had previously landed on an unscheduled visit Important to note , GRU analysts say in this report , was that when the C 12 Huron entered into Iranian airspace neither American nor Iran air force units responded clearly indicating that this secret mission was sanctioned Upon the C 12 Huron landing at Ahwaz , however , this report says it encountered extreme turbulence causing it to leave the runway where its main landing gear then collapsed causing it to crash Within seconds of the C 12 Huron crashing , this report continues , Iranian emergency and security personal responded freeing the victims , including Secretary Clinton who was reportedly unconscious and bleeding profusely After emergency aid was given , GRU agents stationed in Iran state that another US military flight was dispatched from Bahrain to Ahwaz which evacuated all of those wounded and killed in the crash including Secretary Clinton Strangely to note , this report says , is that in the aftermath of this crash , Iran s main oil company announced today that they were buying the Ahwaz airport with the intention of moving it because , they say , oil was discovered beneath it To what the Americans mission to Iran was about this report doesn t speculate upon , other than to note that with the Gulf State Monarchies rapidly approaching a union of their oil rich nations to counter Iranian power , and with President Obama signing a new law this past week to strengthen American borders against threats from Iran , and with the highly publicized Velayat 91 Iranian military exercises now taking place across a wide area from the Strait of Hormuz , a new and catastrophic war in this region is much closer to being a reality than many realize To if Secretary Clinton s mission was meant to forestall such a war it is not in our knowing , other than to note , that with the United States continued backing of some of the cruelest dictatorships in the world , our entire planet is but one spark away from a fire that could very

"6 4 million more Americans living in poverty under President Obama David Dewhurst on Wednesday , April 4th , 2012 in an online videoDavid Dewhurst says poverty ranks up by 6 4 million under ObamaBy Meghan Ashford Grooms on Tuesday , April 10th , 2012 at 12 33 p m In this web video , 90 Rounds , Texas U S Senate candidate David Dewhurst criticizes Barack Obama for playing golf during economically difficult times In an online video suggesting that President Barack Obama plays golf while Americans suffer , U S Senate candidate David Dewhurst highlights the increase in the number of people living in poverty since Obama took office The ad from the Texas lieutenant governor shows video of Obama golfing or riding a golf cart along with snippets of others speaking about the nation s economic troubles The video culminates with these claims , which appear in red letters 6 4 million more Americans living in poverty under President Obama and over 90 rounds of golf We ve already checked the sporty part of that claim , rating as True the statement that Obama has played more than 90 rounds of golf since he became president Here , we ll focus on Dewhurst s claim that the ranks of the poor have grown by 6 4 million As backup , Dewhurst s campaign sent us a January 2012 editorial from the conservative Washington Examiner that says there are 6 4 million more Americans in poverty today than when Obama took office Dewhurst s campaign also pointed us to a page from the website of the Senate Republican Conference , which consists of Republican members of the U S Senate The page dated April 2 , 2012 , and titled He s Made it Worse The Obama Economic Record is presented as a comparison of conditions when Obama became president and today according to statistics such as the unemployment rate and the size of the federal debt Under Americans in Poverty , the page says there were 39 8 million on Obama s inauguration day \( Jan 20 , 2009 \) and are 46 2 million today The difference 6 4 million people The page does not give a source for the poverty numbers , so we turned to the U S Census Bureau , which is the official federal source of poverty statistics The bureau uses a measure of poverty called the poverty thresholds to help determine the number of U S residents living in poverty If a family has an income below the relevant threshold , then the members of that family are considered to be living in poverty The bureau s thresholds , which are adjusted annually for inflation , vary by family size For example , the preliminary figures for 2011 , which are the most recent thresholds , show that a family of four people would be considered to be living in poverty if it earned less than 23 , 018 through the year Alternatively , the 2011 threshold for single people younger than 65 is 11 , 702 The bureau s thresholds are different from the poverty guidelines overseen by the U S Department of Health and Human Services , which are used to determine if applicants are eligible for government assistance programs Census Bureau spokesman Robert Bernstein told us that the bureau estimates the number of U S residents living in poverty on an annual basis The figure is based on a survey of a scientifically selected sample of about 100 , 000 households that takes place between February and April each year The survey asks respondents their income for the previous year And from the survey results , the bureau extrapolates the number of U S residents that were living in poverty that year The 2010 poverty statistics were released in September 2011 The next estimate of the number of U S residents living in poverty , for 2011 , is scheduled for release in September 2012 We should note that there have long been concerns about the bureau s measure , which determines a person or family s poverty status based on before tax cash income One of the primary identified weaknesses with this method is that it does not take into account government policies or benefits that can shrink a family s income \( such as payroll taxes \) or enhance it \( such as food stamps \) Another criticism The thresholds are not adjusted to account for variations in the cost of living in different places We checked the bureau s poverty figures to compare with the Senate Republican Conference s data and found that the group was comparing the number of Americans in poverty in 2008 to the number in 2010 In other words , the Senate group used the bureau s 2008 statistic 39 8 million for the number of people in poverty on Obama s inauguration day in January 2009 And it used the 2010 statistic 46 2 million , the most recent for its count of poor Americans in April 2012 The bureau data show that the estimated number of U S residents in poverty in 2010 , Obama s second year in office , was greater by 6 4 million than it was in 2008 , George W Bush s final full year in office The largest increase came in 2009 , Obama s first year in office , when the poverty total was 3 8 million higher than the year before In 2010 , the number was 2 6 million greater than the 2009 level The 46 2 million residents in poverty in 2010 amounted to the greatest number of Americans in the low income category since the government started tracking the statistic in 1959 But the recent increase did not start on Obama s watch The number of Americans living in poverty , by the bureau s measure , first creeped up in 2007 , when 800 , 000 more people were in poverty than the year before The subsequent 2008 increase 2 5 million people In fact , during Bush s eight years as president , the estimated number of Americans in poverty rose every year but two We applied the Dewhurst campaign s methodology to the Bush years , comparing the number of people in poverty the year before Bush took office \( 2000 \) with the number during his last full year in office \( 2008 \) We found an increase of 8 2 million people In making such comparisons , though , there is another , better way to judge change As PolitiFact noted in a previous fact check , because of population growth , it s important to notice shifts in the share of all residents in poverty And during the years Dewhurst focused on , the portion of U S residents in poverty increased , although like the estimated number of people in poverty , the climb began in 2007 The figures 2006 12 3 percent 2007 12 5 percent \( 0 2 percentage point increase \) 2008 13 2 percent \( 0 7 percentage point increase \) 2009 14 3 percent \( 1 1 percentage point increase \) 2010 15 1 percent \( 0 8 percentage point increase \) The 2010 poverty rate of 15 1 percent was higher than that of every year for more than four decades , save two 1983 , when the rate was 15 2 percent , and 1993 , when it was the same as the 2010 figure , 15 1 percent A September 2011 New York Times news article about the 2010 poverty statistics said economists pointed to joblessness associated with the 2008 financial collapse and subsequent recession as the main factor pushing more Americans into poverty A final note Dewhurst implies that Obama is to blame for the rising number of people in poverty But our sense is that it s unfair to place all the responsibility in the president s lap The economic downturn began before Obama took office Also , poverty experts such as Sheldon Danziger , director of the National Poverty Center at the University of Michigan , say that more Americans would have been forced into poverty without the 2009 federal stimulus plan , championed by Obama , which included billions of dollars for programs that help low income Americans such as Medicaid and unemployment insurance More broadly , no single official controls the number of Americans living in poverty Our rulingDewhurst s figures draw from a reliable source on Americans in poverty in 2010 which , of course , is not 2012 compared with 2008 , the year before Obama became president A better understanding of the extent of U S poverty lies in looking at the share of Americans in dire straits That measure also supports Dewhurst s point that poverty has increased during Obama s term Then again , the percentage of residents in poverty had begun to grow in 2007 , two years before Obama s first in office Finally , it s a reach to say Obama is personally to blame for the increase in poverty On balance , we rate Dewhurst s statement Half True Advertisement",true

Just think about it I have to admit , I don t know who Waka Flocka is , or what he sings , but I agree with him on this ! 2 Listen to what rapper , writer , actor , director Ice Cube said about the OscarSoWhite controversy We don t do movies for the industry We do movies for the fans , for the people , Ice Cube said Friday To cry about not winning an award is like crying because you don t have enough icing on your cake ! Though he didn t mention Stacey by name , isn t it interesting how he echoed her sentiments exactly \? We shouldn t segregate ourselves or limit Black History Month to one month a year I wish things were really colorblind I don t know what we can do as a society to come together as one Ss far as what I have seen about the OscarSoWhiteControversy , it seems Jada Smith started it because her husband wasn t getting nominated I don t know how other people think about it , but I hope my son sees early on that not everyone gets a trophy Buy my Mom s new devotional , Sweet Freedom , in bookstores everywhere !",false

"b' Netanyahu We wont tolerate Hamas or ISIS flags at protests in Israel Profile of a freedom fighter The Canadian Israeli who joined the fight against ISIS WATCH How do American college students react to ISIS , Israeli flags \? Share on facebookShare on twitterGila Rosenberg \( photo credit FACEBOOK \) Uncertainty abounds concerning the fate of Israeli Canadian Gill Rosenberg , who was reportedly captured by Islamic State Islamist websites some of them known to be close to , or even serving as a front for , the terrorist organization reported Sunday that the 31 year old adventurer was captured during fierce battles with Kurdish fighters in unspecified areas Be the first to know Join our Facebook page According to the websites , Rosenberg was taken hostage following three suicide attacks on sites where Kurdish fighters had barricaded themselves The websites gave no further details regarding the circumstances of the capture , nor provided any proof of it The Islamic State claims do not make clear whether Rosenberg was captured in Iraq or in Syria The main battlefield between the Kurds and Islamic State is in the Syrian Turkish border town of Kobani Kurdish sources approached by Israel Radio reporter Eran Cicurel expressed doubt over the Islamic State report They said Rosenberg was not in Kobani In the assessment of these Kurdish sources , the reports of Rosenbergs capture are probably the terrorists propaganda The Shin Bet \( Israel Security Agency \) told The Jerusalem Post that there are no further details at this stage Rosenberg wrote on her Facebook page on November 20 that she was handing over management of her account to someone else and would be without Internet access for at least two weeks , until December 8 , she wrote It is not clear where she went at this time If the websites reports are true , Rosenberg would be the first confirmed Western female to fall into Islamic State captivity Holding Israeli citizenship would complicate her situation even further Unlike the US and the UK , which refused to negotiate over their respective captured nationals , thus giving the impression of a laissez faire interest , Israel invests intense concern into the fate of its citizens captured by terrorists This does not mean Israel will negotiate for Rosenberg , if she has indeed been captured or that Islamic State would agree to talk with Israel , making her nationality Canadian alone If Rosenberg is in captivity , she would be the second Israeli of dual nationality in this position Steven Sotloff , a freelance American journalist who also held Israeli citizenship and filed for The Jerusalem Report on the Syrian civil war , was captured by Islamic State last year shortly after crossing the Syrian border and beheaded by the Islamist group this past August As well , Rosenberg breached Israeli law by flying to Iraq , an enemy country , which Israeli citizens are forbidden to enter No matter what has happened to her since joining the Kurdish forces , upon return to Israel she will be arrested and prosecuted , as was the case of several Israeli Arabs who joined Islamic State and subsequently returned to Israel This is not Rosenbergs first tryst with adventurism in 2009 she was arrested in an American con scandal and sentenced to four years in jail This is , however , her first serious willful encounter with death Rosenberg was born in Vancouver , and experienced a family crisis after her parents divorced In an interview with Maariv in 2009 , she said that already at the age of 22 she was pursuing a promising career as a pilot of Boeing passenger planes , but decided to leave everything behind and immigrate in 2006 In Israel , she joined the IDF , serving as an instructor for Kenyan soldiers who came to Israel for home front search and rescue training Rosenberg said she had ambitions to join the Mossad , but was hurt during her military training and afterwards had money problems She met an American friend in an ulpan Hebrew language course who led her into crime , she said She joined a group of Israelis who were accused of setting up a ring to cheat elderly Americans and steal their money through a fake lottery scheme According to the indictments filed against them , they stole hundreds of thousands of dollars , perhaps even millions , from the unknowing pensioners After a number of complaints were filed , a joint Israel Police and FBI investigation was launched The probe led to the arrest of several suspects and their extradition to the US , where they were tried Rosenberg served four years in jail She may have decided to fulfill an act of redemption after getting out of jail and regaining her freedom Hopefully the Kurdish sources are right , and Rosenberg is indeed far from executioners Canada is trying to confirm reports that Rosenberg has been captured , a foreign ministry spokesman said Sunday Canada is pursuing all appropriate channels to seek further information and is in touch with local authorities , the spokesman said in a statement Yossi Melman is an Israeli journalist and writer who specializes in security and intelligence affairs He is co author of Spies Against Armageddon inside

marginalized extremists A propaganda video released by the Somali based al Qaeda affiliate al Shabab includes a clip of Trump calling on the United States to bar Muslims from entering the country ,

calls upon African Americans to join a holy war against the United States , according to the BBC Kareem Abdul Jabbar Donald Trump is ISIS s greatest triumph Claiming the United States is a hotbed of racial inequality , police brutality and anti Muslim sentiment , the film is an indictment of U S race relations and also includes historical civil rights era footage of Malcolm X , an unnamed white

"Confessions Of A Terrorist AMERICA has entered one of its periods of historical madness , but this is the worst I can remember worse than McCarthyism , worse than the Bay of Pigs and in the long term potentially more disastrous than the Vietnam war The reaction to 9 11 is beyond anything Osama could have hoped for in his nastiest dreams As in McCarthy times , the domestic rights and freedoms that have made America the envy of the world are being systematically eroded The hounding of non national US residents continues apace 'Non permanent' males of North Korean and Middle Eastern descent are disappearing into secret imprisonment on secret charges on the secret word of judges US resident Palestinians who were formerly ruled stateless , and therefore not deportable , are being handed over to Israel for 'resettlement' in Gaza and the West Bank , places where they may never have set foot before Are we playing the same game here in Britain \?

Blair 's worst chance is that , with or without the United Nations , he will drag us into a war that , if the will to negotiate energetically had ever been there , could have been avoided a war that has been no more democratically debated in Britain than it has in America or the UN By doing so , Blair will have helped provoke unforeseeable retaliation , great domestic unrest , and regional chaos in the Middle East He will have set back our relations with Europe and the Middle East for decades to come Welcome to the party of the Ethical Foreign Policy There is a middle way , but it 's a tough one Bush dives in without UN approval and Blair stays on the bank Goodbye to the Special Relationship The stink of religious self righteousness in the American air recalls the British Empire at its worst Lord Curzon 's cloak sits poorly on the shoulders of Washington 's fashionably conservative columnists I cringe even more when I hear my Prime Minister lend his Head Prefect 's sophistries to this patently colonialist adventure His very real anxieties about terror are shared by all sane men What he ca n't explain is how he reconciles a global assault on al Qaeda with a territorial assault on Iraq We are in this war , if it takes place , in order to secure the fig leaf of our special relationship with America , to grab our share of the oil pot , and because , after all the public hand holding in Washington and Camp David , Blair has to show up at the altar 'But will we win , Daddy \? ' 'Of course , child It will all be over while you 're still in bed ' 'Why \? ' 'Because otherwise Mr Bush 's voters will get terribly impatient and may decide not to vote for him after all ' 'But will people be killed , Daddy \?

"Activists speak out about shooting of man in wheelchair Community leaders continued Sunday to sound off about the Wilmington police shooting that left a 28 year old wheelchair bound man dead Jeremy Bam McDole , 28 , was shot and killed by four city officers Wednesday around 3 p m in the 1800 block of Tulip Street Some called for the Attorney General s Office to swiftly file charges against the four officers three of whom are white and one of whom is Hispanic Others denied police accounts that McDole had a 38 caliber gun , pointing to a YouTube video where a gun is not visible This is an injustice , said community activist and Hilltop resident Robert Bovell There is no way someone in a wheelchair should be shot that many times Wilmington Police Chief Bobby Cummings said McDole was armed when officers arrived around 3 p m to a report of a man who had shot himself McDole was reaching for a gun when the officers opened fire , he said Police also say they found a 38 caliber gun at McDole s side after the shooting Cell phone video captured by a bystander and posted to YouTube shows an officer pointing a shotgun at McDole , screaming at him to drop the gun , while other officers scream hands up McDole , who was paralyzed from the waist down , is seen fidgeting and trying to raise himself from the wheelchair Then he slides his hands up his thigh and toward his waist as the officers open fire The video has drawn international attention and a growing chorus of questions about what led up to the shooting In response , police released a portion of the 911 call where a woman reported to police that a man had shot himself She asked police to get an ambulance to the AutoZone parking lot along Lancaster Avenue , saying that the man was still moving and had a gun The recording did little to quell some activists disbelief that McDole had a gun There was no weapon in that video , Bovell said There is no system in this place we call America that they give you justification for what happened to Mr McDole Two investigations one by city police and another by Attorney General Matt Denn s office are ongoing Few details have been released from either office , and a city police spokeswoman said the department may provide more information Monday depending how the investigation progresses Frustration over the lack of details could be seen Sunday during Bovell s live television program called Community Conversations McDole s family , including his mother Phyllis , were invited to be on the show They arrived for the taping , but then left , refusing to talk about McDole s shooting The show went on with Bovell hosting three activists for an hour long discussion One of the guests , who identified himself as Hope , from New Jersey , said the city community needs to unite No matter who you are , we will be here to step in to help , he said He questioned the police training that led the four officers to open fire , rather than negotiate with McDole or try to help him Bovell agreed At what point were your lives threatened \?

"Simon Dures This lion king \( pictured above \) is a queen And she s not the only one Five lionesses in Botswana have grown a mane and are showing male like behaviours One is even roaring and mounting other females Male lions are distinguished by their mane , which they use to attract females , and they roar to protect their territory or call upon members of their pride Females lack a mane and are not as vocal But sometimes lionesses grow a mane and even behave a bit like males However , until now , reports of such maned lionesses have been extremely rare and largely anecdotal We knew they existed , but little about how they behave Now , Geoffrey D Gilfillan at the University of Sussex in Falmer , UK , and colleagues have reported five lionesses sporting a mane at the Moremi Game Reserve in Botswana s Okavango delta Gilfillan started studying these lionesses back in March 2014 , and for the next two years he focused on recording the behaviour of one of them , called SaF05 She had an underdeveloped mane and was larger than most females While SaF05 is mostly female in her behaviour staying with the pride , mating males she also has some male behaviours , such as increased scent marking and roaring , as well as mounting other females , says Gilfillan Although females do roar and scent mark like males , they usually do so less frequently , he says SaF05 , however , was much more male like in her behaviour , regularly scent marking and roaring Jessica Vitale A likely explanation is an increased level of testosterone as these lionesses mature , says Luke Hunter , president and chief conservation officer at the global wild cat conservation organisation Panthera In lions , testosterone directly affects the development of manes Castrated males , for example , lose their ability to produce testosterone and promptly lose their mane , too In 2011 , a captive lioness called Emma at the National Zoological Gardens of South Africa developed a mane Tests revealed high levels of testosterone due to a problem in her ovaries , and once they were removed she reverted to a typical lioness The idea that testosterone is implicated in the Botswana lionesses is also backed by observations of their reproductive success , says Kathleen Alexander at Virginia Tech in Blacksburg While some of the maned lionesses were observed mating , none of them became pregnant , suggesting they are infertile , a known consequence of high levels of androgens such as testosterone in females , she says The behavioural changes suggest this is likely the case Hunter suspects this explanation applies to the animals studied by Gilfillan and his colleagues Given all five known maned females come from the Okavango region , there must be a genetic component in this population underlying the phenomenon , he says I don t think this is anything to be concerned about , says Hunter Although the females are apparently infertile , they otherwise appear to live long , healthy lives And from a conservation perspective , there is nothing to suggest the pattern is increasing or will ever be anything more than a rare , local phenomenon No one seems to be studying the exact genetic and hormonal causes of this phenomenon at the moment I guess there are just one or a few genes altered , says Vincent Savolainen at Imperial College London , who had a student briefly work on the possible causes I believe some masculinised genes have been documented in domesticated cats it would be good to look into this , especially given that the cat genome is available as reference Could the masculinised females in fact be a boon to the pride when it comes to competing with other prides \? It s possible , it seems Gilfillan says he once saw SaF05 bring down a zebra A neighbouring pride stole the zebra from SaF05 , but in return SaF05 killed two of their cubs Cub killing behaviour is rare in females but common in males Journal reference African Journal of Ecology , DOI 10 1111 aje 12360",true

"The IRS hates patriots and loves Satan seems to be the message in some coverage of Judicial Watch 's revelation about the speedy approval of exempt status for the organization that sponsors the After School Satan program Judicial Watch 's release led with While the Internal Revenue Service \( IRS \) makes conservative groups wait years for tax exempt status an After School Satan Club launched to hinder Christian based counterparts got its nonprofit ranking in just ten days , records obtained by Judicial Watch show Breitbart picked up on the issue with 'After School Satan Club' Received Fast Tracked Tax Exempt Status From IRS Documents obtained by Judicial Watch show the Internal Revenue Service \( IRS \) fast tracked tax exempt status for an After School Satan Club in Tacoma , Washington , while the federal agency was discovered to be either denying conservative and Christian groups the same status or making them wait for years Not surprisingly the Tax Prof picked up the story as Day 1409 of The IRS Scandal The Prof suspended daily coverage a while ago , but does post when something comes up The nice thing about Judicial Watch is that they provide the source documents that they base their fantasies on So you can see for yourself that Reason Alliance Ltd , which does in fact sponsor the After School Satan program , applied for exempt status on October 21 , 2014 using Form 1023 EZ and that the IRS positive response is date stamped October 31 , 2014 Reason Alliance Ltd is connected to The Satanic Temple According to Lucien Greaves , who responded to my request for information about Reason Alliance , the program that After School Satan is countering is the Good News Club , a project of Child Evangelism Fellowship Well there you go YOU MAY ALSO LIKE Only that document does not support Judicial Watch 's claim when you include the While the IRS makes conservative groups wait years part In a way it is because of the activities of Judicial Watch and the other scandal narrative promoters , that Professor Samuel Brunson calls the Outrage Industrial Complex in his coverage of this flap You have to know a bit about the IRS Scandal to understand that , so I will give you a little background The IRS Scandal Competing Narratives My talk with Lucien Greaves , who is kind of the public face of Reason Alliance Ltd and as far as I can tell The Satanic Temple , made me realize this part is necessary Lucien was kind of shocked and a little bewildered by the Judicial Watch release This is because he , like many people , is not really aware of the IRS Scandal which those of us in the tax blogosphere have lived and breathed for going on four years now Day 1 by Tax Prof count is May 10 , 2013 with a report that Lois Lerner , Director of the IRS 's Exempt Organizations Division , admitted that the IRS had been giving additional scrutiny to applications for tax exempt status from goups with the Tea Party or patriot in their title She denied there was any political motivation and blamed the practice on a low level employee in Cincinnati I am the last IRS Scandal agnostic I lean towards the theory that the whole thing was not politically motivated , but contrary opinions of Joe Kristan and George Will make me hesitate to commit to that view People on the right tend to believe that Lois Lerner was President Obama 's minion and that the IRS stole the 2012 election So now maybe it is shown that she was taking her orders from Satan rather than the President Same difference Regardless , the competing narrative accepted by the IRS is that the scandal was a service failure Even if the Tea Party groups were not eligible for the exemption status they applied for , they had the right to get a decision one way or another Actually the IRS might have come out of this better if they had issued a batch of denials , since the groups that wanted to take a denial to court would have had to talk about what they had been doing themselves rather than focus solely on what the IRS did wrong One of the IRS response to the service failure was to provide an expedited exemption process for smaller groups \( Less than 50 , 000 in income and 250 , 000 in assets \) Form 1023 EZ is two pages as opposed to 26 pages for Form 1023 It is filed electronically and according to this story in the Journal of Accountancy , average processing time is thirteen days Lucien told me that it had actually taken five weeks , but he was measuring from the time they hired a lawyer to set the group up Sending the exempt application to the IRS was likely about the lawyer 's last step So Judicial Watch 's disparate treatment claim is entirely unfounded Unless they can find some conservative or Christian groups that have had different results from using the expedited process established in 2014 in order to avoid a repeat of Teapartygate , there is nothing to complain about As with many of the tax stories I cover , the story behind the story is more interesting So I think it is worth knowing a little more about After School Satan , which frankly is a pretty disturbing notion Would You Sign Your Kid Up For After School Satan \? After School Satan was a response to the Good News Club which addresses the Establishment Clause concerns of Christian evangelism in public schools by making it about neutral facility use that requires parental permission The Satanic Temple and Reason Alliance Ltd do not actually advocate Satan worship , pacts with the devil or even belief in a supernatural entity of any sort The mission of The Satanic Temple is to encourage benevolence and empathy among all people , reject tyrannical authority , advocate practical common sense and justice , and be directed by the human conscience to undertake noble pursuits guided by the individual will I remain puzzled as to why they use the term Satan other than to be obnoxious \( Lucien admitted that there is just a bit of that in calling themselves Satanists \) They do however offer an explanation here No , this program wouldn t be better if we merely called ourselves Humanists We are Satanists That is how we identify , and it is how we ll continue to identify It makes no difference who does or does not choose to recognize an atheistic Satanic philosophy as a legitimate religion Satanism is the foundation of our sense of cultural identity and we re not willing to change how we contextualize our own lives to make ourselves more palatable to others Just the same , there are those who will lament that our program , introduced into public schools , would be better for children if done under the label of Humanism , Skepticism , or anything less controversial than Satanism We wholeheartedly disagree As we are intentionally and pointedly placing After School Satan Clubs in schools where proselytizing evangelicals have established clubs , we think that the counter balance of a Satanic club isn t simply acceptable , but necessary While the Good News Clubs try to invade children s minds with traumatic and unhealthy guilt ridden admonishments such as that they deserve God s punishment for sin , which is death the very presence of Satanic after school clubs demonstrate that there are opposing religious beliefs held by responsible , respectable , moral people who live productive lives without the burden of superstitious fear For children to see and understand that blasphemous names and iconography can be utilized by good people without repercussions , sends a positive message encouraging critical examination and free thought All the material online by the After School Satan program seems pretty benign likely suitable for use in a Unitarian Universalist religious education program except for the introductory video which is really creepy For me it evoked the Blair Witch Project I asked Jonathan Schwartz of Interlock Media to take a look at it He reported back The Satanists got a pretty good video editor , but saved big time by not shooting a frame Backed by a typical heavy metal Satanist soundtrack , a dark musical movement that has been banned in some countries , we see stock images of the devil , Shirley Temple and her gleeful playmates , old running footage of kids getting on buses but played backward , kids running in a field , this time backwards , and a Maypole for fun \( Full disclosure all the video on my own youtube channel was produced by Interlock \) Lucien told me that he put the video together himself and that it was meant to be a provocative response to the Good News Club being allowed to use public school facilities Bottom line , I would say that I would not feel real good about signing my kids up for After School Satan , even though I do n't find their actual philosophy objectionable About Lucien Greaves Lucien Greaves is a nom de guerre You wo n't find it hard to penetrate , but I decided to leave it at that for this piece Lucien is a little shy about revealing details about himself like his age , although he does own to be part of Generation X His identification as a satanist arises out of his study of the satanic ritual abuse panic of the 1980s and 1990s As best as I can tell that thing would have allowed the shade of Charles McKay to an another chapter to Extraordinary Popular Delusions and the Madness of Crowds This article Conviction of Things Not Seen The Uniquely American Myth of Satanic Cults by Dan Shewan includes comments by Lucien Other Views I reached out to some of the Christians I became acquainted during my Kent Hovind coverage Ernie Land , Kent 's consigliere , wrote me Satanism is an evil belief that is destructive to a society , as well as being against any Christian value Christianity , my description as adhering to Christ Teachings or Bible teaching , is a noble teaching with very worthy , and loving beliefs that advance a society All this said and against my beliefs on life if the law defines Churches and if they , even against my beliefs , fall under legal definition , then the law has to apply to them as well It s up to a society to choose to live at peace , with joy , happiness , and the blessings of a true God , or choose to allow such evils , allowing that society to fall away into sins that will ultimately destroy the society or move it to become an unblessed society As it happens Reason Alliance was not claiming church status , but I probably did n't frame the question to Ernie as well as I should have Rudy Davis , probably the most vocal of the Hovindicators , wrote me So in regards to your question about the Satanic Temple , I want the government to stay out of the business of selective enforcement of taxation What is good for the goose is good for the gander so the Satanists should not be treated any differently than Christians when it comes to taxation by the government as long as they can refrain themselves from the baby sacrifices to Beezlebub , in my humble opinion Practical Takeaway When people asked me about applying for exempt status for fairly modest organizations I generally advised that I thought that the game might not be worth the candle Looking at how simple Form 1023 EZ has made things , I'm rethinking that For a long time I have believed that the dose of credibility that organizations get from having 501 \( c \) \( 3 \) status was largely unfounded The new process means that it should confer no credibility at all If someone implies that their 501 \( c \) \( 3 \) status is somehow a seal of approval , you need to put your bs detector on high alert A storm is coming The extreme ease of obtaining exempt status combined with extremely limited IRS resources is likely to create severe problems with phony charities as time goes on The danger is a recurring theme in Paul Streckfus 's EO Tax Journal Referring to Professor Brunson 's post he wrote",false

"In Florida it s Illegal to Power Your Home with Solar Panels Thanks to Lobbying Spread the love 1 Thanks to a system of corrupt corporate government collusion , Florida residents can lose their homes if they attempt to solely power them with solar Thanks to a system of corrupt corporate government collusion , Florida residents can lose their homes if they attempt to solely power them with solar With roughly 1 5 million Floridians initially without electricity from the damage inflicted on Florida s energy infrastructure , many in the Sunshine State are now questioning why it s so difficult for people to utilize solar energy The simple answer is that one of the major electrical suppliers in the state Florida Power and Light \( FPL \) has utilized a massive lobbying campaign , directed at state lawmakers , to create legal barriers to disallow people from powering their own homes with solar panels without being subject to power companies In fact , current Florida state law makes it illegal This is the definition of crony capitalism Companies lobby government officials , who then vote in favor of the corporate position often for a quid pro quo in the form of financial support for the officials reelection campaign Any solar panels erected on a home must be connected to the local electrical power grid So , if you want to build an off the grid home it is illegal to install solar panels on your home Just ask Robert Tarr who , according to WFTV , spent more than 60 , 000 for a system of 32 solar panels for his roof But even though his house can generate enough electricity to run indefinitely without being hooked to a power company , legally , he still has to be connected and pay the Leesburg Electric Department for power he doesn t even need So you can be completely free of the grid \? Channel 9 s Jamie Holmes asked Yes , Tarr said But they make you attach to the grid , Holmes asked Yes , Tarr said I have a problem with it , OK \? I think if I want to be totally independent of them , I should be allowed to be , Tarr said If Tarr were to stop paying his electric bill , reports WFTV , he said Leesburg would shut off his power City officials could also revoke his certificate of occupancy for not being hooked up to the system So , if this family wanted to defy the power company and remove his solar from the control of the power company , the government could revoke his certificate of occupancy making it illegal for anyone to live in the home ! Rest assured that any attempt to resist one s removal from said home would be met with police force and violent escalation The extreme crony capitalism at work in Florida is astounding , and nothing less than draconian With roof mounted solar panels becoming an increasingly inexpensive means of producing cheap renewable energy , the fact that the state panders to the old energy dinosaurs to stifle consumer friendly innovation is nothing less than infuriating In fact , Project Drawdown , which is a broad coalition of researchers , scientists , graduate students , PhDs , post docs , policymakers , business leaders and activists that have assembled to find and present the best available information on climate solutions in order to describe their beneficial financial , social and environmental impact over the next thirty years has found that widespread solar use would save 3 5 trillion dollars and reduce carbon dioxide emissions by 24 6 billion tons over the next 30 years if utilized Ironically , solar panels would make for a completely self sustaining method of energy production if the local electrical grid were to fail during a crisis like a hurricane Make no mistake , the old energy oligarchy simply refuses to be cut out of potential profits , which is what happens when you no longer need to rely on them for power needs and possess the ability to power your own home Instead of owning their greedy intentions , companies like FPL , instead , attempt to rationalize their actions through absurd explanations Operating your renewable system without the bi directional meter can result in an inaccurate meter reading causing your bill to increase , FPL claims , which essentially means that for proactively approaching your energy needs , it could result in a potential glitch in their system that will charge you more money on your electrical bill They also recommend that all homes powered by FPL , that have solar panels , be connected through the same electrical wiring , and the renewable system must shut down when FPL s grid shuts down in order to prevent dangerous back feed on FPL s grid This is required to protect FPL employees who may be working on the grid Ironically , FPL is basically saying that their workers could potentially be electrocuted if they re doing maintenance on the grid during an inadvertent or scheduled shutdown , while completely ignoring the fact that there would be NO risk to those workers if the home wasn t legally required to be connected to the grid ! If Florida residents were not forced to have their solar panels connected to the electrical grid , which FPL lobbied state lawmakers to require , there would be absolutely no problem Aside from the clear environmental and security benefits of producing your own energy , becoming a leader in the solar industry would be a boon for the economy in the Sunshine State Sadly , it s these crony capitalist policies that leave states like Florida in the dark Short sighted policies like these have definitely not served the people of Florida , to which the 1 5 million Floridians without power can most certainly attest Please share this story to expose how governmental corruption picks the winners and losers and decimates a free market that could much better serve the people !",false

"72 A 2d 260 \( 1950 \) STATE v ROBINSON Supreme Judicial Court of Maine March 8 , 1950 Lloyd H Stitham , County Attorney for the County of Somerset , Pittsfield , for the State Dubord Dubord , by F Harold Dubord , Waterville , Lewis L Levine , Waterville , for defendant Before MURCHIE , C J , and THAXTER , FELLOWS , MERRILL , NULTY and WILLIAMSON , JJ MERRILL , Justice On exceptions The respondent , Rodney L Robinson , was tried at the May Term of the Superior Court in the County of Somerset , upon a complaint and warrant charging him with assault and battery upon one John B Gallant At the close of the testimony , motion for a directed verdict of not guilty was seasonably made , denied , and exceptions alleged and allowed At the conclusion of the charge , the respondent in writing requested eleven instructions to the jury To the denial of the eleventh request , the respondent seasonably alleged exceptions which were allowed The jury having found the respondent guilty , the case is now before this Court upon the foregoing exceptions The record clearly discloses that the complaining witness , John B Gallant , a deputy sheriff , and the respondent engaged in a serious physical struggle in which both parties were severely and grieviously injured Each of them complained that the other was the unprovoked aggressor and struck the first blow The respondent 's plea was not guilty He admitted striking the complainant , and relied upon self defense in justification thereof He sought to justify his acts upon two grounds , repelling an unwarranted attack by the complaining witness upon him , and resistance of an unlawful arrest 261 It would be profitless to relate the conflicting testimony of the complaining witness and the respondent and the witnesses called on behalf of the State and the respondent Issues of fact were raised and their solution in a large measure depended upon the credence given by the jury to the conflicting testimony of the complaining witness and the respondent The determination of these questions of fact was peculiarly within the province of the jury which observed and heard the witnesses As said by this Court in State v Hume , 131 Me 458 , 460 , 164 A 198 , 199 We are of opinion that , if the testimony of the state 's witnesses was believed , it was sufficient to establish the guilt of the respondent beyond a reasonable doubt A direct denial of the state 's charges and a contradiction of its witnesses raised an issue of fact which was for the jury There was no error in the denial of the respondent 's motion for a directed verdict State v Donahue , 125 Me 516 , 517 , 133 A 433 State v Harvey , 124 Me 226 , 127 A 275 The exception to the refusal to direct a verdict of not guilty must be overruled The requested instruction which was refused was as follows The jury is instructed as a matter of law that the evidence adduced by the State is insufficient for you to find that the respondent at the time of the alleged assault was intoxicated to that degree sufficient to authorize the officer to arrest the respondent without a warrant for intoxication This being true , the attempted arrest without a warrant was unlawful and the respondent had a right to resist with reasonable force You are further instructed that unless you are convinced beyond a reasonable doubt that the respondent used more force to resist the unlawful arrest than was reasonable , that you should find the respondent not guilty The rule of law with respect to the denial of requested instructions is correctly stated in State v Cox , 138 Me 151 , 169 , 23 A 2d 634 , 644 , where we said A requested instruction which is not , in its totality , sound law , is properly withheld It is no part of the duty of the court to eliminate errors in a requested instruction State v Cleaves , 59 Me 298 , 303 , 8 Am Rep 422 Neither is it the duty of the Court to supply omissions in a requested instruction in order that the same may be applicable to the case at bar Whether or not the respondent was intoxicated was peculiarly a question of fact for the jury The jury were properly instructed by the court as to what constituted intoxication , and this at the request of the respondent The determination thereof depended upon the condition of the accused as exhibited by conduct There was a sharp conflict of testimony between the respondent and his witnesses and the State 's witnesses , including the complaining witness , as to the conduct of the accused It was an undisputed fact that the respondent had been drinking at the time the alleged assault occurred This fact , coupled with his unprovoked assault upon the complaining witness , his use of vile epithets , and his appearance both to the witness and to the other officers at the scene of the altercation and later at the jail as related by the State 's witnesses , even though denied by the respondent , was sufficient to justify the court in submitting the question of his intoxication at the time of the alleged assault to the jury The requested instruction , however , has another infirmity The instruction taken as a whole was a direction to the jury to return a verdict for the respondent unless they were convinced beyond a reasonable doubt that the respondent used more force than was reasonable in resisting unlawful arrest To entitle a respondent to an instruction that he should be acquitted if the jury find or fail to find the existence of a single fact set forth in the instruction , the fact so set forth must be absolutely determinative of the guilt or innocence of the accused upon the entire evidence before the jury In other words , the record must show that such fact is the only disputed fact upon which the guilt or innocence of the accused depends 262 An illegal arrest is an assault and battery The person so attempted to be restrained of his liberty has the same right , and only the same right , to use force in defending himself as he would have in repelling any other assault and battery See 4 Am Jur Sec 41 , Page 148 According to the testimony of the complaining witness , he was seated in his truck behind the steering wheel with the door closed and the window open The respondent was in the street close to the truck The State 's witness testified as follows as to the beginning of the trouble A After I saw Mr Robinson I thought he was waving at me to stop , so I stopped , rolled down the window and asked him if he wanted to see me and he said no , that he was talking to his wife Then I started rolling back up the window and he run up , opened the door and said `You sons of bitches are laying for me ' I said `We are watching you and if you continue to drive as you are we will pick you up ' Then he said `You sons of bitches , you are laying for me now and this is once you ca n't pick me up ' And then he came into the truck , grabbed me by the throat , choked me in the truck , cut off my wind We had some struggling and scuffling in the truck Even if the officer told the respondent that he was under arrest before he entered the officer 's truck , which is denied by the respondent , this evidence would show that the respondent violently assaulted the officer before the officer made the slightest attempt to take physical custody of him While it is true that a person who is illegally arrested may use such force as is reasonably necessary to resist the force used against him , he cannot initiate the use of force We recognize that there are circumstances under which an assault may be repelled by a battery , and a show of force may be repelled by actual force But words alone do not justify an assault A mere statement by an officer that a person is under arrest , even if the officer has no authority to arrest , does not justify an attack by him on the officer before any physical attempt is made to take him into custody As said in Harris v State , 21 Ga App 792 , 95 S E 268 The officer must , by some physical attempt , endeavor to make the unlawful arrest before the other person can lawfully strike him or otherwise resist him by the use of physical force Absent physical attempt to arrest , the question is not whether the respondent used reasonable force but whether he used any force whatsoever Even though the complaining witness , an officer , without right told the respondent he was under arrest , it was a question of fact for the jury whether or not the respondent attacked the officer before the latter made any physical attempt to make the arrest If so , the respondent was not entitled to use any force whatsoever and he would be guilty The requested instruction ignored this question of fact It did not leave its determination to the jury It presupposed the right of the respondent to use some force and that the only question of fact was whether the force actually used was reasonable As the instruction did not require the jury to pass upon this issue of fact which could be determinative of the respondent 's guilt it was properly refused and the exception to its refusal should be overruled Exceptions overruled Judgment for the State",false

"Vice President Joseph R Biden Jr created a stir Tuesday at a campaign speech in Virginia when he told the crowd that Mitt Romney s policies would enable the banking and financial sectors to put you all back in chains The remark came roughly two thirds of the way through Mr Biden s 30 minute speech , which was delivered to a crowd that included many African Americans at the Institute for Advanced Learning and Research in Danville , Va Romney wants to let the he said in the first hundred days , he s going to let the big banks once again write their own rules , unchain Wall Street , Mr Biden said They re going to put you all back in chains On a C Span video of the speech , the audience does not appear to react negatively to Mr Biden s phrasing indeed , laughter can be heard among the crowd President Obama and his surrogates have been campaigning heavily in Virginia , and the campaign s strategy relies in part on energizing the black vote to take the traditionally Republican state , which moved to the Democratic column in the 2008 presidential election According to the Census , the population of Danville is roughly 48 8 percent white and 48 6 percent black After Mr Biden s address , some Republicans assailed Mr Biden s remark On Twitter , Ari Fleischer , a former press secretary for President George W Bush , likened the comment to one made by Sarah Palin when she compared critical press coverage to blood libel , a term alluding to the false allegation that Jews once killed Christian children to use their blood for religious rituals The press pounded Palin when she talked about blood libel , Mr Fleischer wrote What will they do about Biden s chains remark \? Later Tuesday , both presidential campaigns responded to the vice president s remarks , with Mr Romney s campaign calling the phrasing not acceptable After weeks of slanderous and baseless accusations leveled against Governor Romney , the Obama campaign has reached a new low , Andrea Saul , Mr Romney s press secretary , said in a statement The comments made by the vice president of the United States are not acceptable in our political discourse and demonstrate yet again that the Obama campaign will say and do anything to win this election President Obama should tell the American people whether he agrees with Joe Biden s comments In a statement , Stephanie Cutter , Mr Obama s deputy campaign manager , defended Mr Biden For months , Speaker Boehner , Congressman Ryan and other Republicans have called for the unshackling of the private sector from regulations that protect Americans from risky financial deals and other reckless behavior that crashed our economy Since then , the vice president has often used a similar metaphor to describe the need to unshackle the middle class Today s comments were a derivative of those remarks , describing the devastating impact letting Wall Street write its own rules again would have on middle class families We find the Romney campaign s outrage over the vice president s comments today hypocritical , particularly in light of their own candidate s stump speech questioning the president s patriotism Now , let s return to that substantive debate Mitt Romney and Paul Ryan promised 72 hours ago , but quickly abandoned As he concluded his speech , Mr Biden confused North Carolina with Virginia , where Danville is located With you we can win North Carolina again , and if we do , we win the election if we win you , Mr Biden said The city of Danville abuts the northern border of North Carolina , which also went for Mr Obama in 2008 but is considered a more challenging state for his campaign this time around At a second appearance on Tuesday , in Wytheville , Va , Mr Biden said his remarks had merely alluded to a term used previously by Republicans , including Mr Romney s running mate , Representative Paul D Ryan In his response to Mr Obama s State of the Union address in 2011 , Mr Ryan said , We believe a renewed commitment to limited government will unshackle our economy and create millions of new jobs and opportunities for all people , of every background , to succeed and prosper And I m told that when I made that comment earlier today in Danville , Va , the Romney campaign put out a tweet , Mr Biden told the crowd in Wytheville You know , tweets these days \? Put out a tweet , went on the airwaves saying , Biden , he s outrageous in saying that , I think I said instead of unshackled , unchained Outrageous to say that That s what we had I m using their own words I got a message for them , Mr Biden continued If you want to know what s outrageous , it s their policies and the effects of their policies on middle class America That s what s outrageous Mr Romney addressed Mr Biden s original remark in a speech Tuesday evening in Chillicothe , Ohio , calling it an indicator that Mr Obama s presidency had become angry and desperate , according to The Associated Press",true

the course of investigating the Apple Watch , I ve spoken to several sources who have spent extended time with it There are a lot of interesting details , some of which we ll get into But , by far , the biggest recurring theme is how little you use your iPhone once you have one After these discussions , it seems certain that the Apple Watch will shortly be the primary way you access your iPhone during the day People that have worn the Watch say that they take their phones out of their pockets far , far less than they used to A simple tap to reply or glance on the wrist or dictation is a massively different interaction model than pulling out an iPhone , unlocking it and being pulled into its merciless vortex of attention suck One user told me that they nearly stopped using their phone during the day they used to have it out and now they don t , period That s insane when you think about how much the blue glow of smartphone screens has dominated our social interactions over the past decade There are a few ways Apple is making this happen Stay On The WatchThe Watch will have more context about you than a phone alone ever could For example , it takes your heart rate periodically , providing you with a last checked time , which could offer major benefits to health applications and other contextual processes Here s a tidbit you might not know in order to receive notifications from apps , the Watch must be on your wrist and locked The Watch requires contact with your skin to receive notifications There will be no in app dropdown notifications or constant pinging while it s off your wrist Push notifications also cease when the battery reaches 10 percent Those decisions speak to the care with which Apple is handling notifications The notifications are also different at an elemental level than the ones on your phone both on the developer and user side of things These are seen right away rather than at some point You act on them quickly and they don t stack up like they do on the phone There is that added bit of context because you know exactly when they got it , which means that time sensitive notifications like those that recommend a precise establishment or ping you during a live event become much more germane One user told me that they nearly stopped using their phone during the day they used to have it out and now they don t , period If you re a developer who deals with notifications you know how powerful that could be And , as a user , those notifications activate as part of the app right on the Watch home screen , allowing you to act on them without any sort of sliding , unlocking or other junk These are immediate , actionable items that you can access without the obligations inherent in taking out your phone MechanicsBecause the screen of the Watch is so small , there has been a lot of talk about its use as a notification window Yes , notifications are a powerful part of it , but the mechanics of the device actually support much , much more than that People that have used the Watch extensively say that the touch targets are actually very precise and sensitive This means that you will be able to trigger smaller buttons and interactive elements fairly easily \( As a note , the unusual clustered home screen layout means that the hot spots for apps will be at the edges , rather than the center This way you can jet out to the edge of a group in any direction and find an app Your bottom row will become your outer ring \) The display is also very sharp and easily readable from your wrist When your attention is on the Watch , you re going to want to do more there than you think , rather than having to move over to your phone This means that you may find yourself reading short articles and other content on your wrist This could affect the way that publishers want to build their apps They shouldn t just be redirection machines that punt people to their phones there is an opportunity to give people what they need now and let them get back to what they re doing Battery life is also much better than some previous reports , so Apple has been working on it In a normal day of on and off use , the battery usually ends up at around 25 percent , which means that you should be able to make it through a full day It only takes around two hours to charge fully The digital crown is an important part of the navigation process and has been matched precisely to the scroll velocity This should give a sense of context that helps when viewing on the smaller screen , as you re not chasing the scroll with your finger It s also changed physically since the Watch was first shown off , and now has more friction for a weightier , higher end feel Pressing and holding the crown activates Siri , which sources have said works incredibly well on the Watch It can be used for labeling , directions , commands executed by the phone and more If and this is a big IF as Siri has been hit and miss over the years for me if it is truly a say it and forget it experience , the confidence in using your wrist as a commander for your life is expansive Why Watch \? So , let s discuss Does it kind of suck that we have to buy a 500 accessory to return to a normal life \? Sure But such is the deal You re not going to give up your smartphone That Faustian bargain has already been struck We get access to an entire universe of information and communication and we sacrifice our bloody attention on its smooth glass altar But the Apple Watch can return some of that attention and , more importantly , time back to you If you argue the Watch isn t going to sell or do well , it s worth pointing out that there are very , very , very few products that allow you to hand someone cash and be given back TIME This will be the Apple Watch metric to track time saved We re getting a tad metaphysical here , but really the only resource we all have exactly in common is time Kings don t have more of it than peasants Not everyone will be able to afford an Apple Watch \( or even an iPhone \) , but if they re in an economic situation where that s feasible then they re also in the situation where they are probably willing to trade money for time And that is the target market of the Apple Watch Not rich people \( though there s a model specially for them \) , not tech geeks and not Apple fanatics It s people who want more time , and that is a very large target This , for some reason , is the thing that Apple has had a hard time articulating This is the primary use case of the Watch It s not just that it s a notification center it s that it allows you to act without any additional distraction For now , the iPhone is a dominant business for Apple and the smartphone is a domineering force in our daily lives But one day something will come along to destroy it And , as Apple has expressed many times in the past , it is willing to be the one that finds that thing With the Apple Watch , we could be seeing the beginnings of that process Perhaps someday , the Apple Watch could do the impossible it could make you stop using your phone Over the course of investigating the Apple Watch , I ve spoken to several sources who have spent extended time with it

"Guns are deeply rooted within Swiss culture but the gun crime rate is so low that statistics are not even kept The country has a population of six million , but there are estimated to be at least two million publicly owned firearms , including about 600 , 000 automatic rifles and 500 , 000 pistols This is in a very large part due to Switzerland 's unique system of national defence , developed over the centuries Instead of a standing , full time army , the country requires every man to undergo some form of military training for a few days or weeks a year throughout most of their lives Between the ages of 21 and 32 men serve as frontline troops They are given an M 57 assault rifle and 24 rounds of ammunition which they are required to keep at home Once discharged , men serve in the Swiss equivalent of the US National Guard , but still have to train occasionally and are given bolt rifles Women do not have to own firearms , but are encouraged to Few restrictions In addition to the government provided arms , there are few restrictions on buying weapons Some cantons restrict the carrying of firearms others do not The government even sells off surplus weaponry to the general public when new equipment is introduced Guns and shooting are popular national pastimes More than 200 , 000 Swiss attend national annual marksmanship competitions But despite the wide ownership and availability of guns , violent crime is extremely rare There are only minimal controls at public buildings and politicians rarely have police protection Mark Eisenecker , a sociologist from the University of Zurich told BBC News Online that guns are anchored in Swiss society and that gun control is simply not an issue Some pro gun groups argue that Switzerland proves their contention that there is not necessarily a link between the availability of guns and violent crime in society Low crime But other commentators suggest that the reality is more complicated Switzerland is one of the world 's richest countries , but has remained relatively isolated It has none of the social problems associated with gun crime seen in other industrialised countries like drugs or urban deprivation Despite the lack of rigid gun laws , firearms are strictly connected to a sense of collective responsibility From an early age Swiss men and women associate weaponry with being called to defend their country",true

This from the Denver Mint Web Site My story has caused a huge amount of fallout for the folks trying to perpetrate this AMERO switch and they are doing everything possible to spin it , cover it up and say it is n't so Hal Turner THE AMERO IS REAL I HAVE ONE TO PROVE IT ! UNITED STATES , CANADA AND MEXICO TO BE MERGED INTO SINGLE NEW ENTITY NAMED NORTH AMERICAN UNION ! By Hal Turner Three weeks ago , I published a brief snippet on the front page of my web site reporting the governments of the US Canada and Mexico are conspiring in secret to merge the three nations into a new entity called the North American Union There has been much talk of this on various internet blogs for over a year Most of those blogs have been smeared as conspiracy theorists and have been largely ignored by the main stream What prompted my interest in the issue was money I was sent professional images of actual AMERO coins by someone in the US Treasury ! The person included a note saying they like my radio show and are frightened by what 's been going on in secret within our government This Treasury Department person was outraged that our country was beginning to coin money as part of a merger that would do away with our country , via a merger the American public knew nothing about ! When I got the professional images of the AMERO coin , I was finally intrigued enough to make mention of it on my web site My site has gotten over 20 Million visits in the last couple years and is becoming more popular because of the brutal honesty and timely delivery of news that folks do n't find elsewhere This story about AMERO coins would fit my niche of breaking news , so I ran a snippet of a story As part of my report , I included the professional images sent to me by the Treasury person They appear below I also mentioned that very pricey Collector Proofs of the coins were also being Minted in Silver and Gold , and I posted an image of one such Silver Proof , shown below The story went on to say that the US Government has intentionally overspent itself for the purpose of irreversibly Bankrupting the country The idea is that they will drive the country into economic failure , then when millions of Americans are panicking at the prospect , offer them a solution of merging the three countries as the only possible way to avoid losing everything They will force Canada into the merger by telling them the US currency they hold and rely upon will be worthless and the only way Canada can even hope to salvage any of the funds is to join the NAU They will sell it to the Mexican people by saying it will instantly improve their buying power and quality of life In reality , the value of the US and Canadian dollars will be significantly reduced to counter the worthless peso being absorbed People in the US and Canada will suffer great financial loss while Mexicans will see significant gain In the meantime , the financial elite and the politicians they own will make out like bandits ! That 's the reason politicians are doing this to get rich for themselves and their financial elite pals The folks in power within government and their buddies in Banking and finance know that in any currency switch , some lose big while others gain big Really big ! In fact , folks with foreknowledge of such a switch can make hundreds of millions , perhaps even billions for themselves overnight Those without foreknowledge \( common folks like you and me \) usually end up being wiped out INSTANT , FULL BLAST SPIN I published the images and the small story and went to bed I had no idea what my little story would do Within a matter of hours , there was a full blown effort to discredit my story and the images as fake I was accused of lying I was accused of having photoshopped the images by creating them in Adobe Photoshop Within a couple days , a basic web site for AMERO FANTASY COINS was erected on the internet and word of that site was spread quickly The site contained the same images as I had run on my front page , so clearly whatever SPIN was happening was being driven by others who also had the professional images There was intense effort to claim the whole idea of these coins was a fantasy and there was absolutely no truth to them whatsoever That effort to spin the story out of existence worked Folks quickly lost interest I did not Get me the real thing by any means necessary I reached out to the person in the Treasury who first alerted me to the coins That person told me The shit hit the fan around here when your story ran The person went on to say They told everyone in all the Mints that anyone revealing information about the AMERO would be fired and perhaps even criminally prosecuted for endangering national security Ahhhh yes , the grand old catch all of national security When they wheel that one out , you just KNOW they 're pissed off about something ! I told the Treasury person that the only way anyone might believe this is happening , is for me to actually get one of the coins The Treasury guy balked He said there 's no way to get one without stealing it I though about that for a moment then decided that if my government is concealing the actual Minting of coins for a new sovereign entity which may end up with power over me , but which I have n't been told about , then that government deserves whatever gets done to it I told the Treasury person to get me an Amero by any means necessary even if that meant stealing it The Treasury person said it would require them to think about for awhile and if it could be done , I would get one in the mail I waited And waited Frankly , after about three weeks , I lost track of the story until today A real AMERO coin arrived at my home in the mail this afternoon ! The real thing arrives ! Today , I received a single 20 AMERO coin in the mail A real coin Real metal , really MINTED by the US Mint in Denver , CO The proof that it is being Minted in Denver is that the coin is stamped with the Mint Identity letter D on the bottom right of the side with the eagle just like regular US coins already in circulation today ! Click each image to enlarge it , CLICK TWICE TO SUPER ENLARGE IT ! ! Please note the letter D stamped below and to the right of the Planet earth at the bottom right of the coin in this photo That D stands for the United States Mint at Denver , CO VIDEO ! So that you can see this is a real , metal coin , I have made a small video of me holding the coin , turning it , then dropping it on a wooden table top so you can hear what it sounds like when it hits Download the Windows Media Video here I WAS RIGHT ! I stand vindicated All those who claimed I fabricated the images now owe me an apology All those who claimed these were fantasy coins can now explain why anyone in their right mind would spend Millions of dollars to create the rare and expensive professional dies and plates necessary for minting coins that will not be issued \? The simple truth is , the coins are real The plan to merge the US , Canada and Mexico is real Our government is lying about it and the fact they are minting money at the Denver Mint bearing the name of Union of North America is proof So America , Canada and Mexico , our governments are betraying us and planning to merge our countries without our knowledge or consent , or by financial disaster they bring on intentionally What are we going to do about it \? For my part , the Second Amendment comes to mind Hal Turner TV NETWORK CNBC CONFIRMS U S DOLLAR , CANADIAN DOLLAR AND MEXICAN PESO TO BE REPLACED BY THE AMERO THOSE WHO ARE DELUDED INTO THINKING THESE ARE FANTASY COINS NEED TO GET THEIR HEADS OUT OF THEIR ASS !

"As seen in a recent FB post Earlier today , law enforcement officers was dispatched to a call of an older , disheveled , apparently homeless , suspicious subject who was sitting in a restaurant without having ordered any food The first deputy responding to the call reportedly approached the subject , and in an attempt to treat him with humanizing kindness and compassion , sat down to him and asked the man how his day was going The man responded by putting a gun to the deputy 's temple and pulling the trigger He then proceeded outside , where he killed another responding deputy sheriff For those of you who have not worn a badge , please remember this case The next time you interact with a police officer \( or Sheriff 's deputy \) , the next time you witness someone else interacting with the cops , before you criticize the officer for not being as friendly as you think they should be , before you judge his or her demeanor as being cold , condescending , or excessively cautious , before you accuse them of overreacting or countering resistance or force with brutality , please remember this case Because there 's a good chance that officer does There 's a good chance they knew , remember , or heard about the deputy who was murdered in cold blood for simply being polite",true
"In this Friday , June 30 , 2017 photo Richard Perkins , right , and Robert Maurais stand outside their home in Ogunquit , Maine Politicians have been chipping away at funding for heating aid to low income Americans for a decade Now President Donald Trump has proposed ending it altogether , eliciting an outcry from low income residents who depend on the program to stay warm Perkins called the proposed elimination of heating aid cruel \( AP Photo Stephan Savoia \) PORTLAND , Maine \( AP \) The summer air is sizzling as the Fourth of July approaches , yet 86 year old Richard Perkins already worries about how he s going to stay warm this winter President Donald Trump has proposed eliminating heating aid for low income Americans , claiming it s no longer necessary and rife with fraud People needn t worry about being left in the cold , he says , because utilities cannot cut off customers in the dead of winter But he is wrong on all counts The heating program provides a critical lifeline for people like Perkins , and officials close to the program don t see any widespread fraud Guidelines for winter shutoffs by utilities vary from state to state and don t apply to heating oil , a key energy source in the brittle New England winter It s beyond my thinking that anyone could be that cruel , said Perkins , a retired restaurateur who relies on the program to keep warm in Ogunquit , Maine The proposal to kill the program , which has distributed 3 4 billion to about 6 million households this fiscal year , will face strong opposition in Congress Forty three senators from mostly cold weather states already signed a letter urging the Republican chairman and ranking Democrat on an appropriations subcommittee to ensure funding for the Low Income Home Energy Assistance Program , known in many states by its acronym , LIHEAP \( pronounced LY heep \) In Maine , the poorest state in New England , the program helped about 77 , 000 people over the past winter , and those numbers represented less than a quarter of eligible households , said Deborah Turcotte of MaineHousing , which helps to run the program Perkins is a typical recipient His income was fine 10 or 12 years ago when he retired , but gasoline , food and other expenses grew faster than he anticipated In the winter , he keeps an eye on his oil storage tank , and the local community action agency sends 100 gallons when it gets low It s difficult for him to keep warm because he s on a blood thinner , and he shudders at the thought of being cold But he doesn t want to move south , either I was born and raised here , he said Maine is part of me I can t imagine living anywhere else Mark Wolfe , of the National Energy Assistance Directors Association , said that the Trump administration is relying on an old General Accounting Office report on the fraud claim , and that improvements have been made since then In Maine , for example , only 100 cases 0 3 percent of all submitted applications are being investigated for potential fraud , according to MaineHousing And programs aimed at preventing utilities from being turned off wouldn t protect everyone Utility regulations vary , with some states preventing shutoffs during the entire winter and others doing so only on exceptionally cold days And there s absolutely no requirement for heating oil and propane dealers , which are not regulated like electric and natural gas utilities , to make deliveries to customers who cannot pay That s a big problem in the Northeast , which accounts for more than 80 percent of the nation s residential heating oil consumption Health and Human Services Secretary Thomas Price , who contends the LIHEAP program doesn t demonstrate strong performance outcomes , said difficult decisions are necessary to streamline the government to focus on the administration s goals of defense and public safety The LIHEAP program already has undergone substantial cuts The average benefit has been reduced by 100 from 2010 to 2015 as funding was slashed during the Obama administration That coincides with Venezuela s Citgo Petroleum Corp ending participation in a free oil program run by a Massachusetts based nonprofit Nationwide , the average home heating cost last winter was 1 , 448 for propane , 1 , 227 for heating oil , 902 for electricity and 577 for natural gas Many observers refuse to accept that the program will be eliminated altogether It s just too popular in Congress , and it also distributes aid to poor people in states like Florida and Arizona to keep cool on blazing hot summer days Sen Angus King , an independent from Maine , said he and other senators , including fellow Mainer Susan Collins , a Republican , will fight for the program , which he said ensures that needy people aren t forced to make the impossible choice between heat and food , medications , or other necessities This story has been corrected to show that the senators sent a letter to leaders of an appropriations subcommittee , not the Senate Appropriations Committee",true

"Every parent is terrified of making a mistake Not even concerning the big things It could be as easy as I hope that was the kind of sandwich he likes when packing your son s lunch But the worst nightmare of every single parent is having your kids taken away from you For one mom in Cambridgeshire , this nightmare became reality after she did something most parents have probably done The mother , who remains unnamed , had her two young children stripped from her hands after continually ignoring advice That advice \? Don t let your kids sleep in your bed Social workers raised concerns after they saw bruises on both kids Social workers advised both parents to stop letting their kids sleep in the family bed , but they did not take the advice A judge says he believes the bruises are unintentional , but were still caused by excessive force and rough handling by both parents The youngest boy had bruises and a broken wrist when he was just months old The case is kind of odd , because the judge says he has no doubts this mom loves her kids and keeps saying she wasn t intentionally hurting her kids , but he says she s still abusing them by co sleeping He also was shown evidence how this mother always thinks she knows best and ignores everyone s advice The children were both taken from their parents and , at the judge s discretion , were put up for adoption The claim is that after being warned by professionals since the birth of her first child to not allow the children to co sleep with them , neither parent took any measure to protect their children The entire case seems fishy , and as though they re not revealing more aspects of the story that would make everything connect It s still a scary thought , though Thinking your kids could be taken away from you due to something so simple What do you think \?",false

"Donald Trump has gained a ton of momentum He isn t running a campaign , it is a movement Movements start out small and grow because millions of others agree with the message and feel that same passion or anger towards an issue Since 2008 , the United States has declined in nearly every aspect that made us great Our allies don t trust us , our enemies don t fear us , we have domestic terrorist groups like Black Lives Matter being called heroic instead of our law enforcement officers , and we are allowing more than 12 million illegal immigrants to stay here undocumented What sense does that make \?

"An environmental activist was almost killed Yesterday in the Indian Ocean , after the great white shark he was trying to hug suddenly attacked him and bit his arm off 21 year old Darrell Waterford , from Eugene in Oregon , was participating in a promotional video for Greenpeace , some 100 nautical miles away from the Australian city of Perth Along with four other members of the organization , Mr Waterford decided to dive with some great white sharks in order to improve the marine predator s public image and raise awareness about shark hunting The group shot some incredible footage during the first 30 minutes , as they swam with a group of sharks caressing and even hugging the large animals Unfortunately for the young American , one of the sharks suddenly became aggressive after being hugged and suddenly attacked him It attacked Mr Waterford and tore off his right arm right below the elbow The young man lost a large amount of blood , but was able to get out of the water and was rapidly taken to the hospital Huei Li Chong , the leader of the expedition , described the violent attack in an interview with the Australian Broadcasting Corporation The shark seemed really friendly at first , but then it went totally berserk It charged Darrell and bit off his hand in an instant , so we all hurried out of the water before it killed us According to him , the shark might have turned aggressive after smelling blood in the water Sharks can be affectionate an cuddly when they re calm , but the smell of blood activates their predator instincts It s not their fault , and we shouldn t hold them responsible Huei Li Chong , who was diving with Mr Waterford at the time of the attack , believes the shark may have become aggressive after smelling blood Greenpeace has been campaigning for years against shark finning , which consists of the removal of fins from sharks , often while the shark is alive Despite the organization s efforts , finning has increased dramatically since 1997 largely due to the increasing demand for shark fins for shark fin soup and traditional cures Greenpeace has been trying for years to improve the white shark s image in order to obtain an international ban , similar to the international treaty that applies to commercial whaling Several members of the organization now fear that this incident will compromise their campaign to restore the white shark s image as a peaceful marine creature",false
"By Dwayne 'The Rock' Johnson Politics February 1 , 2017 Comments \( \) By Dwayne 'The Rock' Johnson Politics February 1 , 2017 Hi My name is Dwayne Johnson Many of you may know me better as The Rock I am running for the President of the United States I know that this may sound like a joke to many of you But it s not I am throwing my hat in the ring for 2020 I am not running against Donald Trump I am not running against whatever candidate the Democrats field I am not running against anyone I am running for the country As an independent I am running on a simple platform of compassion and civility You may ask why someone who has never publicly expressed a political opinion is running for office , and I will tell you that is exactly why I am running for the Presidency I do not owe any obligation to either party , so I do not need to feel beholden to either of their platforms or their ideologies Mine , again , is a simple platform based on civility and compassion It is based on a desire to lift everyone up rich , poor , young , old , black , white , American born or foreign born , gay , straight or transgender to bring us together again , to make this country whole The fact that I have expressed so few political opinions I hope will help me in this effort because it is my hope not to advocate for the extreme positions of either party , but to find a middle ground between them both It used to be possible to find some common ground , for each side to listen to each other , negotiate , and find a place in the middle that leaves everyone happy enough I am running for the 70 percent of this country who wants to get along , who is willing to give a little to get a little Who is nostalgic for dinnertime conversations that revolve around workdays or school , dance recitals , little league games , movies , TV shows , worship services , and celebrity gossip , instead of eating dinner fraught with anxiety about what s going on in the news I am someone who has worked successfully with people from both sides of the political spectrum and who , I believe , has gained the respect of people from all political stripes I ve been a popular college football player I ve been a popular professional wrestler , and I have been a popular actor , but I have also been careful never to let my ego get in the way I have had a lot of box office hits , and I have had a lot of box office bombs , but I have never been defined by ratings , by the number of people who go see my movies , or by the crowds that came out to see me during my football and wrestling careers I am the same , big hearted , caring person every day , whether Hercules makes 10 million at the box office , or whether Fast Furious 10 makes 100 million There is one position where I will not bend , however , and that s where it concerns compassion for everyone , from immigrants to low income white people to the people of color in our cities , in our suburbs , and in rural America , to the people from abroad escaping poverty , famine , or brutal dictators We live in a huge country , and there is plenty of space for everyone , and plenty of money and resources to go around , even if that means taking a little more from the extremely well off to help out the extremely unfortunate As Commander in Chief , I will refashion foreign policy to align with my own personality I will use my strength and might of our military to serve the big heart of the American public It s important that we stand up for the little guy , but that in doing so , never become bullies ourselves Bullying and bluster is the surest sign of insecurity and weakness , and it is not who we are It sure as hell isn t who I am We have to be better than that Some of you may be wondering why I ve announced my intention to run for the President of the United States only 12 days into the existing administration There s two reasons , actually First of all , President Trump signed papers to begin his run for 2020 on Inauguration Day , so I am already 12 days behind ! More importantly , however , is my hope to use my popularity , my broad demographic appeal , and my name recognition to shift focus away from the ugly partisanship going on in D C right now and onto the themes on which I plan to run I intend to hit the campaign trail immediately , and it is my hope that whatever cultural capital I have accrued over the years fighting Hulk Hogan or Vin Diesel is enough to attract both crowds and the media It is also my hope that those crowds and the media might begin to absorb some of the lessons about compassion and civility that I plan to impart and apply them long before our next election rolls around I won t run a negative campaign , because I don t need to I m Dwayne Johnson I will never begin a sentence with , But my opponent I don t need to tear anyone down in order to make myself look bigger God has also blessed me with a smile that has a calming effect on those around me , and I hope to put it good use over the next four years as I tour this country in an effort to bring us all back together I want to rebuild us around a very simple idea that that a difference of opinion does not have to separate us , that within most of us , there is goodness , that we can put that goodness to use , and that we are a better country when we are united than when we let our leaders divide us I m not asking for your vote now I m just asking you to listen Give me four years to let me convince you that I deserve your vote before you make a decision I ll probably regret a few of the things I saw along the way , and in a campaign this long , there will probably be a backlash , and then a backlash to the backlash , but for the first three years , anyway , I m not here to win your vote I m here to offer you hope , to remind you that there s an alternative to this current political climate waiting in the wings I hope that I can offer you all a light at the end of the tunnel I am Dwayne The Rock Johnson , and I hope to be your next President of the United States Thank you , God bless you , and God bless this country we love Get entertainment , celebrity and politics updates via Facebook or Twitter Buy Pajiba merch at the Pajiba Store Bigots , Trolls MRAs Are Not Welcome in the CommentsThe Pajiba Store",false

"WASHINGTON , DC A senior U S general has confirmed that the military has secretly drawn up plans to round up large numbers of privately owned firearms from American gun owners Gen James M Scott of the U S Air Force confirmed that the Pentagon received a series of formal directives from the White House between November 7 and December 13 to begin plans for a massive nationwide operation to confiscate guns using a series of federal databases compiled over the last few decades Scott spoke with Duffel Blog reporters in a parking garage in northern Virginia Scott also confirmed that a certain four star general who heads the U S Transportation Command was intimately involved in the planning General Scott would not reveal the general s name out of concerns for his safety The plan , known in the military as Operation PREAKNESS , combines a series of tactics developed for house sweeps and room clearing in Iraq and Afghanistan , which Scott admitted had been used as test runs for the U S If we can confiscate millions of firearms in a country where we don t speak the language or understand the culture , the U S should be easy , Scott told Duffel Blog I just feel sorry for that poor Osama fellow we had to kill to justify the whole thing According to Scott , the actual planning for Operation PREAKNESS was initiated in early 2009 and developed in conjunction with the United Nations , Senator Dianne Feinstein , and several other liberal organizations such as the National Organization for Women , Planned Parenthood , Greenpeace , the American Federation of Labor , and the National Rifle Association , which is apparently a front for all the previous groups While there was initially some concern about the constitutionality of using the military on American soil , page 2131 of the ObamaCare Act actually amends the Posse Comitatus law to allow the military to disarm private citizens at the direction of the Secretary of Homeland Security Objections by then CIA Director David Petraeus were quietly silenced in November A test run for PREAKNESS was actually conducted in early December in Clinger , Pennsylvania A joint platoon of Army Rangers and UN Peacekeepers , working with select state and local officials and using imagery collected by the Google Street View Car , quietly went door to door and managed to collect all the firearms from Clinger owners The few owners who did complain were initially transported to Fort Leavenworth in Kansas to explain their case before a special international tribunal , before being sent to the National Center For Gun Control in Guantanamo Bay , Cuba A follow on operation using just the UN Peacekeepers is planned later this week for any owners missed in the previous sweep , although the Peacekeepers have confirmed they will be using a post office truck to infiltrate the area",false

Both the SAT and the PSAT NMSQT measure verbal and math reasoning skills The PSAT NMSQT contains questions from actual SATs but it is designed to be slightly easier than the SAT The PSAT NMSQT also measures writing skills , with multiple choice questions like those on the SAT Subject Tests in Writing , and like those that will be on the new SAT in March 2005 The PSAT NMSQT is two hours and 10 minutes , whereas the SAT is a three hour test The SAT is used for college admission , but PSAT NMSQT scores are not sent to colleges The PSAT NMSQT Score Report gives you personalized feedback on areas in which you could improve , along with specific advice on how to improve Taking the PSAT NMSQT gives you a chance to qualify for scholarship and recognition programs and is a good way to practice for the SAT Back to top Is it true that you get a 200 on the SAT just for signing your name \? Theoretically speaking , if you just sign your name and do n't complete the answer sheet , you would get a score of 200 That 's because we do n't report scores that are lower than 200 In reality , if we received an answer sheet that was n't filled out , it would be considered an automatic request to cancel scores and no scores would be reported Back to top Are some SAT tests more difficult than other ones \? All editions of the SAT are developed using the same test specifications Even if there are tiny differences in difficulty from test to test , a statistical process called equating ensures that a score for a test taken on one date or at one place is equivalent to a score for a test taken on another date or in another place The rumors that the SAT in one month , say in October , is easier , are false Back to top Are all SAT questions multiple choice \?

You can take the test as many times as you want Your score report shows your current test score , in addition to scores for up to six SAT and six Subject Test administrations Back to top What test should I take first , the SAT or the Subject Tests \? Most students take the SAT in the spring of their junior year and again in the fall of their senior year of high school Most students who take Subject Tests take them toward the end of their junior year or at the beginning of their senior year Because Subject Tests are directly related to course work , it 's helpful to take tests such as World History , Biology E M , Chemistry , or Physics as soon as possible after completing the course in the subject , even as a freshman or sophomore , while the material is still fresh in your mind You 'll do better on other tests like languages after at least two years of study Back to top Will the SAT Subject Test in Writing still be offered after the new SAT is introduced \? When the new SAT is introduced in March 2005 , all students will be required to take a test with a writing section For this reason , the Subject Test in Writing will no longer be offered after January 22 , 2005 Read more about the new SAT Back to top Which test should I take \?

You may have to take the test because it is an admission requirement of the college you are interested in attending Many colleges require the SAT for admission because it is a standard way of measuring a student 's ability to do college level work The SAT is the best independent , standardized measure of a student 's college readiness It is standardized across all students , schools , and states , providing a common and objective scale for comparison High school grades are a very useful indicator of how students perform in college , yet there is great variation in grading standards and course rigor within and across high schools Remember , too , that the SAT in only one of a number of factors that colleges consider when making admission decisions Other factors , like your high school record , essays , recommendations , interviews , and extracurricular activities , also play a role in admission decisions Back to top What do my SAT scores tell college admission staff about me \? Your SAT scores can tell admission staff how you compare with other students who took the test That 's because all scores are reported on the 200 to 800 scale For example , if your verbal and math scores were about 500 , which is the average score , then college admission staff would know you scored about as well as half of the students who took the test Back to top Can the SAT really show how well I 'll do in my first year of college \? No test can accurately predict with 100 percent certainty what your grades will be in college That 's because many factors , including personal motivation , influence your college grades However , colleges admissions offices use SAT scores to help estimate how well students are likely to do at a particular college For example , a college looks at the SAT scores , high school grade point average \( GPA \) , and college grades of its freshman class The college finds that students who scored between 450 and 550 on the SAT and maintained a B average in high school are the students who perform well at its school Knowing your SAT scores and high school GPA helps the college make a decision about how likely it is that you 'll do well at the school Back to top Why does the SAT have the kinds of questions that it does \? The SAT measures verbal and math reasoning abilities These abilities relate to some of the things you need to know to be successful in college The SAT was designed with questions that reflect or show your reasoning abilities , not just the amount of information you 've accumulated during school As an example , many math items can be answered by using complex equations , but they can also be answered correctly if you can reason through the problem Reading passages do n't just test that you can read but require extended reasoning in order to answer the questions related to the passage This means that you have to be able to make inferences , assumptions , and interpretations based on the passage provided , in order to understand what the author is trying to say Back to top Why do n't the questions on the SAT ask about the things I'm learning in my high school courses \? The SAT measures verbal and math reasoning abilities that you develop over years of schooling and in your outside reading and study The test is designed to allow you to demonstrate your abilities in these areas regardless of the particular type of instruction you 've received or textbooks you 've used These important abilities understanding and analyzing written material , drawing inferences , differentiating shades of meaning , drawing conclusions , and solving math problems are necessary for success in college and life in general This does n't mean that the SAT is irrelavent to your course work , however In March 2005 , the new SAT will align more closely with the type of skills being taught in the classroom and necessary for college success Read more about the new SAT Back to top Who comes up with the questions \?

Are you trying to catch me \? The test questions are not designed to be tricky !

"For the first time , the Fukushima fingerprint isotope , cesium 134 \( 134Cs half life 2 years \) , has been detected at an extremely low level in a Canadian salmon by the InFORM project The single sockeye salmon that tested positive was sampled from Osoyoos Lake in the summer of 2015 , according to scientists from the Radiation Protection Bureau at Health Canada , in cooperation with Fisheries and Oceans Canada and local First Nations The sample was one of a few \( 8 out of 156 total \) individual fish that had trace levels of the longer lived cesium 137 \( 137Cs \) \( 30 yr half life \) that we reported on last winter To determine if this trace 137Cs was from Fukushima or remnant from atmospheric weapons testing , InFORM reexamined these individual fish samples to see if extremely low levels of 134Cs may be present The results of this extended analysis show that trace \( 0 07 Bq kg 1 \) levels of 134Cs were detected in one sample from Okanagan Columbia River population No 134Cs was detectable in the other samples The observed levels remain well below the action level \( 1000 Bq kg 1 \) set by Health Canada guidelines As we reported in the winter 2016 update , 8 individual fish \( out of the 156 measured \) from 2015 tested positive for low levels \( 1 Bq kg 1 \) of cesium 137 \( 137Cs \) With its 30 year half life , 137Cs is still present in the environment from 20th century atmospheric weapons testing and Chernobyl in addition to the Fukushima accident In contrast , no individual fish from the 2014 monitoring effort were found to contain detectable levels of 137Cs This difference led the team at the Radiation Protection Bureau to conduct a more detailed investigation of some of those few positive samples to determine if 134Cs , the Fukushima fingerprint isotope , was present Results from 5 of those 8 are now available and discussed below The remaining three samples have now been processed , and no elevated levels of 137Cs or 134Cs A more detailed investigation requires that the minimum detectable concentration \( MDC \) be lowered When studying ionizing radiation , the MDC is a threshold that refers to the statistics of detecting individual nuclear disintegrations after a sample has been on a detector for a period of time With each additional disintegration detected , the signal becomes more distinct from the noise When detecting trace concentrations of isotopes , disintegrations are infrequent and thus more time on the gamma spectrometer detector is necessary to lower the MDC and determine with confidence \( signal clearly , and statistically , above the noise \) that an isotope is present Lowering the MDC is analogous to increasing the exposure time for a camera to capture a good night scene as shown below For these salmon samples , each was freeze dried , to prevent the meat from going rancid , then placed on the detector for a full two weeks \( 336 hours \) For comparison , InFORM salmon samples are normally counted for 6 hours Similar to the photos above , after 6 hours on the detector , you can just make out the scene of a campfire on the beach , but it is difficult In the case of those 8 samples , it was even possible to see that something was present , as with the logs on the shoreline in the photo \( red square \) , but there is not enough signal to clearly resolve what that item might be When placed on the detector for 2 weeks the decay signal is improved and the MDC threshold is lowered , similar to increasing the length of the camera s shutter speed to capture more light With the lower MDC , the results are more statistically robust In the graph above we see the 2 week results \( darker teal and brown vertical bars \) are now above the associated MDCs \( horizontal lines \) so we have greater confidence in the signal In four of the five samples reporting , those early indications of of 137Cs in the sample turned out to be cases that weren t statistically significant and the longer analysis revealed that levels of 137Cs decreased and the new results were in agreement with the average value for all the 2015 samples This result is not totally surprising and is a good example of statistical regression to the mean However , one of the samples from Osoyoos Lake confirmed the level of 137Cs \( 0 53 Bq kg 1 \) and showed a very low \( 0 07 Bq kg 1 \) , signal for 134Cs , the Fukushima fingerprint isotope We can validate that the observed signal comes from Fukushima by comparing the observed levels of 134Cs and 137Cs The salmon sample was collected in 2015 , almost exactly 2 half lives of 134Cs \( t 1 2 2 06 years \) , or 4 years , after the majority of this radioisotope was released into the environment If we decay correct the 134Cs in the sample to the time of the Fukushima disaster in 2011 , we get 0 35 Bq kg 1 We know from previous work by other scientists that 134Cs and 137Cs were released from the Fukushima accident in equal amounts This should mean that the level of 137Cs in the sockeye sample is approximately equal , so what is the source of the additional 0 2 Bq kg 1 \? Examining the results of the 155 other salmon collected in 2015 we see from the sum of their spectra that the average concentration of 137Cs in all of these fish was 0 2 Bq kg 1 Since no Fukushima radiation was detected in any of those samples we deduce that this is the level of contamination attributable to historic atmospheric weapons testing Therefore , we conclude that just over half of the observed levels of radiocesium in this sample are from Fukushima contamination with the rest being from historical sources of human contamination in the 20th century The InFORM team stresses that even though the results presented confirm Fukushima radiation in this Pacific salmon , the levels of contamination do not approach levels that represent a significant health threat to the fish or to a human consumer Based on this measurement , the total cesium \( 137Cs 134Cs \) radioactivity in this sample is 0 60 Bq kg 1 , which is over 1000x lower than the level of concern according to Health Canada For perspective , you would need to consume 1000 1500 kg of salmon with this level of contamination in a short period of time to increase your radiation dose by the same amount as a single 5 hour cross country flight To view the full results from all 156 salmon from 2015 that were analyzed as part of our Fukushima biotic monitoring effort see our earlier summary or Open Data Canada Initial results from the 2016 biotic monitoring program will be available shortly Updated 1 Mar 2017 Correction was made to the source location of the salmon that tested positive The fish was caught in Osoyoos Lake and is known to spawn in the Okanagan River The fish was not from Okanagan Lake , as previously reported",false

"Dandelion Weed Can Boost Your Immune System And Cure CancerScientists Find Root That Kills 98 Of Cancer Cells In Only 48 HoursMarilyn Caylor9 21 2016Dandelion has been used medicinally since ancient times for its various health benefits However , the most powerful benefit to come out of this common weed is something that medical researchers are super excited to have discovered which is its potential to cure cancer ! proverbsthirtyonewoman blogspot comThis potent root builds up blood and immune system cures prostate , lung , and other cancers better than chemotherapy According to Dr Carolyn Hamm from the Windsor Regional Cancer Centre in Ontario , Canada , dandelion root extract was the only thing that helped with chronic myelomonocytic leukemia This form of cancer typically affects older adults John Di Carlo , who at the time was a 72 year old cancer patient at the hospital , was sent home to live out his final days after all efforts failed to treat his leukemia He told CBC News that he was advised to drink dandelion root tea as a last ditch effort Perhaps it should have been the first option offered in his treatment plan , as his cancer went into remission only four months later ! His doctors attributed this to the dandelion tea that he drank Screenshot via YouTubeRecent studies have shown that dandelion root extract can work very quickly on cancer cells , as was evidenced in Di Carlo 's case Within 48 hours of coming into contact with the extract , cancerous cells begin to disintegrate The body happily replaces these with healthy new cells Further studies have concluded that the extract also has anti cancer benefits for other types of cancer , including breast , colon , prostate , liver , and lung cancer ! Dandelion root tea may not taste as pleasant as other teas , but it 's certainly more pleasant than living with the side effects of chemotherapy or radiation treatments Traditional cancer therapies harm the immune system by killing all cells , even the healthy ones Dandelion root has the opposite effect it actually helps boost your immune system and only targets the unhealthy cells It 's definitely a win win situation ! Dr Hamm warns , however , that dandelion root extract can negatively impact the effects of chemotherapy It 's always best to consult with your doctor , and let them know any and all supplements or foods that you are consuming on a regular basis Screenshot via YouTubeEven if you do n't have cancer , eating the greens or drinking dandelion tea can still give you great health !

The liver aids the digestive system by producing bile , and it also filters the blood of chemicals and other impurities According to Dr Axe , the vitamins and minerals found in dandelions can help cleanse the liver and keep it in tip top shape So by supporting your liver , you are actually creating better health ! Screenshot via YouTubeDandelions are also high in antioxidants and vitamin C , which is crucial to helping your body fight off infections , such as the bacteria that cause urinary tract infections If you suffer from frequent bouts of UTI , drinking dandelion tea on a daily basis may prevent it from happening ever again Dandelion greens are bitter , but completely edible as long as you get it from an area that has n't been sprayed with chemicals The greens are rich in fiber , which is great for intestinal health !

"WASHINGTON Immigrant children as young as 14 housed at a juvenile detention center in Virginia say they were beaten while handcuffed and locked up for long periods in solitary confinement , left nude and shivering in concrete cells The abuse claims against the Shenandoah Valley Juvenile Center near Staunton , Virginia , are detailed in federal court filings that include a half dozen sworn statements from Latino teens jailed there for months or years Multiple detainees say the guards stripped them of their clothes and strapped them to chairs with bags placed over their heads Whenever they used to restrain me and put me in the chair , they would handcuff me , said a Honduran immigrant who was sent to the facility when he was 15 years old Strapped me down all the way , from your feet all the way to your chest , you could n't really move They have total control over you They also put a bag over your head It has little holes you can see through it But you feel suffocated with the bag on In addition to the children 's first hand , translated accounts in court filings , a former child development specialist who worked inside the facility independently told The Associated Press this week that she saw kids there with bruises and broken bones they blamed on guards She spoke on condition of anonymity because she was not authorized to publicly discuss the children 's cases In court filings , lawyers for the detention facility have denied all allegations of physical abuse Many of the children were sent there after U S immigration authorities accused them of belonging to violent gangs , including MS 13 President Donald Trump has repeatedly cited gang activity as justification for his crackdown on illegal immigration Mr Trump said Wednesday that our Border Patrol agents and our ICE agents have done one great job cracking down on MS 13 gang members We 're throwing them out by the thousands , he said But a top manager at the Shenandoah center said during a recent congressional hearing that the children did not appear to be gang members and were suffering from mental health issues resulting from trauma that happened in their home countries problems the detention facility is ill equipped to treat The youth were being screened as gang involved individuals And then when they came into our care , and they were assessed by our clinical and case management staff they were n't necessarily identified as gang involved individuals , said Kelsey Wong , a program director at the facility She testified April 26 before a Senate subcommittee reviewing the treatment of immigrant children apprehended by the Homeland Security Department Most children held in the Shenandoah facility who were the focus of the abuse lawsuit were caught crossing the border illegally alone They were not the children who have been separated from their families under the Trump administration 's recent policy and are now in the government 's care But the facility there operates under the same program run by the U S Office of Refugee Resettlement It was not immediately clear whether any separated children have been sent to Shenandoah Valley since the Trump administration in April announced its zero tolerance policy toward immigrant families , after the lawsuit was filed Trump signs executive order to reverse his immigration policy The Shenandoah lockup is one of only three juvenile detention facilities in the United States with federal contracts to provide secure placement for children who had problems at less restrictive housing The Yolo County Juvenile Detention Facility in California has faced litigation over immigrant children mischaracterized as gang members In Alexandria , Virginia , a board overseeing the Northern Virginia Juvenile Detention Center voted this week to end its contract to house federal immigration detainees , bowing to public pressure The Shenandoah detention center was built by a coalition of seven nearby towns and counties to lock up local kids charged with serious crimes Since 2007 , about half the 58 beds are occupied by both male and female immigrants between the ages of 12 and 17 facing deportation proceedings or awaiting rulings on asylum claims Though incarcerated in a facility similar to a prison , the children detained on administrative immigration charges have not yet been convicted of any crime Virginia ranks among the worst states in the nation for wait times in federal immigration courts , with an average of 806 days before a ruling Nationally , only about half of juveniles facing deportation are represented by a lawyer , according to Justice Department data On average , 92 immigrant children each year cycle through Shenandoah , most of them from Mexico and Central America Wong said many of the 30 or so children housed there on any given day have mental health needs that would be better served in a residential treatment unit But such facilities are often unwilling to accept children with significant behavioral issues , she said Wong and other managers at the Shenandoah center , including Executive Director Timothy J Smith , did not respond to phone and email messages seeking comment this week A city manager on the local commission that oversees the facility referred questions to an official at the Refugee Resettlement agency , who did not respond to a phone message Financial statements reviewed by AP shows the local government commission that operates the center received nearly 4 2 million in federal funds last year to house the immigrant children enough to cover about two thirds of the total operating expenses The lawsuit filed against Shenandoah alleges that young Latino immigrants held there are subjected to unconstitutional conditions that shock the conscience , including violence by staff , abusive and excessive use of seclusion and restraints , and the denial of necessary mental health care The complaint filed by the nonprofit Washington Lawyers' Committee for Civil Rights and Urban Affairs recounts the story of an unnamed 17 year old Mexican citizen apprehended at the southern border The teen fled an abusive father and violence fueled by drug cartels to seek asylum in the United States in 2015 After stops at facilities in Texas and New York , he was transferred to Shenandoah in April 2016 and diagnosed during an initial screening by a psychologist with three mental disorders , including depression Besides weekly sessions speaking with a counselor , the lawsuit alleges the teen has received no further mental health treatment , such as medications that might help regulate his moods and behavior The lawsuit recounts multiple alleged violent incidents between Latino children and staff at the Shenandoah center It describes the guards as mostly white , non Spanish speakers who are undertrained in dealing with individuals with mental illness The suit alleges staff members routinely taunt the Latino youths with racially charged epithets , including wetback , ''onion head and pendejo , which roughly translates to dumbass in Spanish A 16 year old who said he had lived in Texas with his mother since he was an infant ended up at Shenandoah in September after a police officer pulled over a car he was riding in and asked for ID , which he could n't provide As one of the few Latino kids who is fluent in English , the teen would translate for other detainees the taunts and names the staff members were calling them He said that angered the guards , resulting in his losing such modest privileges as attending art classes If you are behaving bad , resisting the staff when they try to remove you from the program , they will take everything in your room away your mattress , blanket , everything , he said They will also take your clothes Then they will leave you locked in there for a while This has happened to me , and I know it has happened to other kids , too The immigrant detainees said they were largely segregated from the mostly white juveniles being held on criminal charges , but they could see that the other housing units had amenities that included plush chairs and video gaming consoles not available in the Spartan pods housing the Latinos In their sworn statements , the teens reported spending the bulk of their days locked alone in their cells , with a few hours set aside for classroom instruction , recreation and meals Some said they had never been allowed outdoors , while the U S born children were afforded a spacious recreation yard The Latino children reported being fed sparse and often cold meals that left them hungry , though meals of American fast food were occasionally provided Records show Shenandoah receives nearly 82 , 000 a year from the Agriculture Department to feed the immigration detainees The lawsuit said the poor conditions , frequent physical searches and verbal abuse by staff often escalated into confrontations , as the frustrated children acted out The staff regularly responded by physically assaulting the youth , applying an excessive amount of force that goes far beyond what is needed to establish or regain control In the case of the Mexican 17 year old , the lawsuit said a staff member who suspected him of possessing contraband threw him to the ground and forcibly tore off his clothes for an impromptu strip search Though no forbidden items were found , the teenager was transferred to Alpha Pod , described in the lawsuit as a unit within the facility designated for children who engage in bad behavior The lawsuit said Latino children were frequently punished by being restrained for hours in chairs , with handcuffs and cloth shackles on their legs Often , the lawsuit alleged , the children were beaten by staff while bound As a result of such malicious and sadistic applications of force , the immigrant youths have sustained significant injuries , both physical and psychological , the lawsuit said After an altercation during which the lawsuit alleged the Mexican teenager bit a staff member during a beating , he was restrained in handcuffs and shackles for 10 days , resulting in bruises and cuts Other teens interviewed as part of the court case also reported being punished for minor infractions with stints in solitary confinement , during which some of the children said they were left nude and shivering in cold concrete cells Academic studies of prison inmates kept in solitary confinement have found they often experience high anxiety that can cause panic attacks , paranoia and disordered thinking that may trigger angry outbursts For those with mental health issues , the effects can be exacerbated , often worsening the very behaviors the staff is attempting to discourage A Guatemalan youth sent to the center when he was 14 years old said he was often locked in his tiny cell for up to 23 hours a day After resisting the guards , he said he was also restrained for long periods When they could n't get one of the kids to calm down , the guards would put us in a chair a safety chair , I do n't know what they call it but they would just put us in there all day , the teen said in a sworn statement This happened to me , and I saw it happen to others , too It was excessive A 15 year old from Mexico held at Shenandoah for nine months also recounted being restrained with a bag over his head They handcuffed me and put a white bag of some kind over my head , he said , according to his sworn statement They took off all of my clothes and put me into a restraint chair , where they attached my hands and feet to the chair They also put a strap across my chest They left me naked and attached to that chair for two and a half days , including at night After being subjected to such treatment , the 17 year old Mexican youth said he tried to kill himself in August , only to be punished with further isolation On other occasions , he said , he has responded to feelings of desperation and hopelessness by cutting his wrists with a piece of glass and banging his head against the wall or floor One time I cut myself after I had gotten into a fight with staff , the teen recounted I filled the room with blood This happened on a Friday , but it was n't until Monday that they gave me a bandage or medicine for the pain The lawsuit alleges other immigrant youths held at Shenandoah have also engaged in cutting and other self harming behaviors , including ingesting shampoo and attempting to choke themselves A hearing in the case is set for July 3 before a federal judge in the Western District of Virginia Lawyers on both sides in the lawsuit either did not respond to messages or declined to comment , citing strict confidentiality requirements in the case involving children The child development specialist who previously worked with teens at Shenandoah told AP that many there developed severe psychological problems after experiencing abuse from guards The majority of the kids we worked with when we went to visit them were emotionally and verbally abused I had a kid whose foot was broken by a guard , she said They would get put in isolation for months for things like picking up a pencil when a guard had said not to move Some of them started hearing voices that were telling them to hurt people or hurt themselves , and I knew when they had gotten to Shenandoah they were not having any violent thoughts She said she never witnessed staff abuse teens first hand , but that teens would complain to her of injuries from being tackled by guards and reveal bruises The specialist encouraged them to file a formal complaint Though lawyers for Shenandoah responded with court filings denying all wrongdoing , information contained in a separate 2016 lawsuit appears to support some of the information contained in the recent abuse complaints In a wrongful termination lawsuit filed against the Shenandoah center , a former staff member said he worked in unit called Alpha Pod where immigrant minors were held , including those with psychological and mental issues and those who tend to fight more frequently The guard , Trenton Farris , who denied claims that he punched two children , sued the justice center alleging he was wrongly targeted for firing because he is black Farris said most staff members at the facility are white , and that two white staff members involved in the incident over which he was fired went unpunished Lawyers for the center denied the former guard 's claims , and the case was settled in January",true

could just be one more bit of proof that the state is becoming a global mecca for marijuana After all , the state s legalized marijuana experiment has so far been an unqualified success Despite the surprisingly limited number of recreational pot shops that opened their doors on Jan 1 and the hefty crowds waiting in line to patronize them the state hasn t experienced widespread product shortages or weed prices high enough to trigger an Uber style backlash Yes , there was that story about 37 deadly marijuana overdoses on the first day of sales , but it turned out to be an obvious hoax The few pundits who ve complained about Colorado s legalized pot , like David Brooks and Nancy Grace , have found their arguments blasted full of holes , not to mention lambasted on Saturday Night Live The Justice Department is looking into ways to help banks play nice with marijuana businesses a very serious problem and even President Obama in a recent New Yorker profile conceded it s important for the experiment to go forward Soon enough , then , Colorado s small scale experiment should spread far and wide , with controversial drug laws getting the boot , millions of clandestine tokers coming out of the closet , and governments reaping the benefits in taxes and fees That is unless something goes terribly wrong , derailing the whole legalization movement AdvertisementSuch a gloomy outcome isn t out of the question The only reason that Colorado is enjoying fame as the first place to legalize pot is thanks to a combination of fortunate timing , plucky advocates , forward thinking lawmakers , and a remarkable lack of snafus Colorado s 2012 legalization attempt very well could have floundered if the effort hadn t enjoyed remarkably positive media coverage Considering the precipitous rise of the state s medical marijuana industry and lawmakers keen efforts to moderate it , all it could have taken was the right bad headline a high profile crime or a boneheaded political move to set the endeavor back considerably Recall that alcohol prohibition was built on the temperance movement s carefully crafted tales of woe and violence As Salvation Army Commander Evangeline Booth once put it Drink has drained more blood Dishonored more womanhood , Blasted more lives , Driven more to suicide , andDug more graves than any other poisoned scourge that ever swept its death dealing waves across the world Mixed shatter slab by TC Labs The product is broken prior to packaging to fit into the 1 gram or less packaging requirements Courtesy of Ry Prichard CannabisEncyclopedia comIn Colorado , however , there have been very few sordid marijuana tales that could be used to demonize the drug so far Weed fueled horror stories could still emerge in the state and with the world watching , such calamities could have an international impact So what are the biggest potential risks \? A major concern is diversion , taking Colorado s legal pot and offloading it to the black market or selling it out of state While Colorado has established an extensive tracking system to prevent this from happening , there will always be tourists trying to take home a pot infused souvenir Beyond diversion , there s the menace of crime not just the threat of burglaries and organized crime in a largely cash based industry , but also the distant possibility of banks or other financial institutions getting slapped with federal money laundering charges if they accept any of that free flowing marijuana cash Finally , there s the prospective collateral damage , such as kids accidentally eating pot brownies something that s already in the news or a violent pot related car crash If any of these calamities do occur , Colorado s red hot dabbing scene could in fact be the source of the problem Dabbing certainly appears on the surface to be dangerous Kids are freebasing marijuana ! It looks like they re smoking crack ! But it s important to remember that there s no evidence that it s possible to overdose on pot \( Compared to say , acetaminophen , overdoses of which killed more than 1 , 500 Americans during the past decade \) So you can smoke the strongest dab imaginable or even , if you re a showboat , smoke 50 dabs in a row and science says it won t kill you It will just get you really , really high Mars OG ISO dab , an isopropyl alcohol extraction made by Pink House Labs in Denver Courtesy of Ry Prichard CannabisEncyclopedia comAdvertisementBut just because something won t poison you the way alcohol can doesn t mean it can t lead you to do something stupid enough that will kill you And there seem to be enough disconcerting variables associated with dabbing culture a production process laden with volatile chemicals a highly concentrated , easily transportable final product and incredibly stoned kids with blowtorches it seems only a matter of time until somebody in the scene does something very stupid and possibly fatal Yes , dabbing might not be as inherently dangerous as , say , a bar full of binge drinkers But it s important to remember that recreational marijuana isn t necessarily replacing alcohol use it s just adding a new legal vice to the options people already have While some researchers predict legalized marijuana will decrease alcohol use , others predict it could lead to heavy drinking and carnage on our highways So will folks really reach for a dabbing pipe instead of a shot glass or will they reach for both \? Top CommentNobody tell these fellows about vaporizers They 're going to worry about them detonating the atmosphere , or causing glaciers to melt , or something More J P McMahonJoin InQuestions like this have led California and Washington to outlaw the production of smokeable marijuana concentrates Colorado , however , has gone the opposite route In November it released a draft of proposed concentrate production rules , positioning itself to become the only place in the world where marijuana concentrate production is both legal and regulated The idea is to police the blooming subculture , to stay on top of it , so it ends up more akin to tattooing than meth If we outlaw concentrates , people will make them in their basements and blow themselves up , says Norton Arbelaez , co owner of the Denver dispensary RiverRock Wellness , which operates a concentrate production facility But just because a concentrate extraction system is certified by a third party industrial hygienist , as will likely be required by Colorado s concentrate rules , doesn t mean that system can t still accidentally blow up It makes sense that Colorado is at the vanguard of legalized dabbing It s made a habit of taking risks when it comes to marijuana Colorado can t regulate away the chance that dabbing or some other marijuana related endeavor will lead to a spectacular accident , either industrial or personal But so far its legalization effort has taken pains to thoughtfully minimize such risks and so far , it s working",false

"43rd Governor of the State of Florida Jeb2016 comFeb 5 , 2016I Will Preserve and Protect Social Security and MedicareAfter seven years of failed leadership from President Obama , our nation is now more than 19 trillion in debt Even after increasing taxes by nearly 2 trillion , Barack Obama will somehow manage to add more than 8 trillion to the national debt , which is more debt than the 43 presidents who held office before him compiled together As a result of the reckless spending in Washington , a child born today like my new grandson , Jack , comes into the world with nearly 60 , 000 of debt on his or her back The next president of the United States must tackle the spending and debt crisis , and leadership starts with being honest with the American people In 1965 , health care programs and Social Security spending consumed less than a sixth of Washington s budget Today , they consume almost half of federal spending and are crowding out investments in national defense , roads and bridges , law enforcement and other national priorities The retirement of the baby boom generation and the aging of America is exacerbating the problem Consider that in 1950 , there were 16 workers paying taxes into Social Security for every senior collecting benefits Today the ratio is 3 to 1 and it will fall to 2 to 1 in a few short years The status quo isn t sustainable , and unless the next president and Congress , honestly address entitlement reform , today s seniors and future retirees could face massive benefit cuts of as much as 25 percent I believe we should act now rather than inflict this level of pain on seniors Of all the candidates running for president , I have put forward the most detailed plans to preserve and protect Social Security and Medicare As the former governor of Florida , the state with one of the largest senior populations in the country , I understand and respect how important Social Security and Medicare are to ensuring a comfortable retirement for the American people I would never do anything to weaken these programs or break the promise that has been made to workers who pay into Social Security and Medicare The reform plan I have released would extend the solvency of the Social Security trust fund for 75 years , ensuring that today s seniors and the next generation of retirees are protected Given the fact that we are living longer and healthier lives , it is only prudent that we increase the retirement age in a responsible way Today s seniors and those close to retiring would receive no change in the eligibility age for Social Security But for younger people , we need to gradually increase the retirement age from 67 to 70 I also believe that we should make it easier for seniors who want to continue to work to do so My plan would eliminate the payroll tax on seniors at age 67 to encourage more people to continue participating in the workforce I would also reform the benefit structure to ensure that the minimum Social Security benefit is set at 150 percent of the poverty line Today , the minimum benefit falls below the poverty threshold This is wrong and I am committed to providing low income seniors with a level of benefits that ensures they can live a life of dignity in retirement I would pay for this reform and extend the solvency of the Social Security trust fund by means testing benefits for wealthy seniors who have ample personal retirement savings Regarding Medicare , I believe the best way to reform the system is to open it up to more competition If seniors want to continue participating in traditional Medicare that option should be preserved for them , but we should also give seniors the right to choose from a menu of high quality private plans that may offer benefit packages that are more attractive As a conservative , I believe deeply in the power of competition to deliver positive change I have seen it time and again in my 32 years in the private sector , and I know it will work for Medicare as well Finally , to better shore up Medicare s finances , I would also apply greater means testing for wealthier seniors Liberals like Hillary Clinton are not being honest with the American people about the impending crisis in Social Security and Medicare They want the American people to believe that doing nothing is a viable option To ensure that seniors and future retirees can receive Social Security and Medicare benefits that provide them with peace of mind during their retirement years , we must be bold and courageous and tell the truth to the American people My plan does that and when I am president of the United States I will work to bring Republicans and Democrats together around solutions that preserve and protect Social Security and Medicare",true
"Smallville star Allison Mack has confessed that she sold children to the Rothschilds and Clintons during her time in the child sex cult According to police , Allison Mack worked in a senior management position for the Hollywood pedophile cult NXIVM As second in command , it was her job to lure children into the cult in order to sell them to elite Hollywood pedophiles and powerful politicians Thefreethoughtproject com reports As alleged in the indictment , Allison Mack recruited women to join what was purported to be a female mentorship group that was , in fact , created and led by Keith Raniere The victims were then exploited , both sexually and for their labor , to the defendants benefit , U S Attorney Richard P Donoghue said in a statement The cult was finally exposed when the daughter of former Dynasty actress Catherine Oxenberg became a member Oxenberg told the New York Times that she became concerned after she saw that her 26 year old daughter India was extremely emaciated from dieting , and was suffering from serious health problems Some people have said this is a voluntary sorority The women I have spoken to tell a far different story , Oxenberg said Coercion is not voluntary Extortion is not voluntary Blackmail is not voluntary When these accusations hit the news , other women , including actress Sarah Edmondson , came forward to all to tell the same story , of the blackmail , the branding , as well as the forced labor and forced sexual activity Raniere is also accused of having a history of pedophilia , with accusations that stretch back over 20 years , involving girls as young as 12 In 2012 , several women were interviewed by the Albany Times Union about the coercive sexual experiences that they had with Raniere when they were young girls One of the women in the case was found dead of a gunshot wound before she was able to give the interview Her death was ruled a suicide The U S attorney s office requested to have Raniere held without bail in a letter to the court stating that he was a known child predator Although this extremely important detail is being left out of most mainstream reports , one of the main charges in the criminal indictment against Raniere and Mack is sex trafficking of children A quick search for Allison Mack s arrest report or charges as reported by the mainstream media will not yield any mention of children Most mainstream reports only mention sex trafficking and ominously omit that the charges were for sex trafficking of children Exactly why the media is refusing to report this remains a mystery Another important aspect of this case that has been largely overlooked , is the connections that this organization has to high level figures in politics and finance The organization worked much like a pyramid scheme , collecting regular fees from its members But the majority of the funding , over 150 million , came from the trust funds of Seagram heiresses , Sara and Clare Bronfman Their involvement with Raniere began in 2002 and has been very public and controversial , with other members of the Bronfman family distancing themselves from the sisters in the press The Bronfman family has very close ties to the Rothschild banking dynasty , with members of both families belonging to many of the same companies , including their joint financial firm , Bronfman Rothschild Additionally , at least three high ranking members of the organization , including Nancy Salzman and the Bronfman sisters , are members of Bill Clinton s foundation , the Clinton Global Initiative , which requires an annual 15 , 000 membership fee Now that Raniere is in jail and Mack is on bail and ordered not to have any contact with other cult members , Clare Bronfman has taken on the role of leader within the organization In response to the recent controversy surrounding NXIVM , Bronfman made a statement on her website denying the accusations against Raniere She praised Raniere and the NXIVM programs , insisting that she is doing work that is truly helping people , and that no one has ever been coerced as a part of their workshops Frank Parlato , a former NXIVM publicist turned whistleblower told the New York Post that Bronfman is among the harshest leaders in the organization She s the enforcer the brutal one Clare s running the operation now , and she s the most ruthless of them I m issuing an absolute warning now Clare Bronfman is a true fanatic , and if there s a Jim Jones situation , everyone will commit suicide but her Parlato said Of Allison Mack , Parlato said that she was a troubled woman , who was both a victim and an abuser Mack was both a victim and a victimizer She was both a mastermind and Raniere s useful idiot She started as a slave and she became a slave master Her nickname among defectors is Pimp Mack , Parlato said It is highly possible that this is a position that Mack was groomed for since she was a child , as many childhood stars turn from victims to predators as a result of what they often experience behind the scenes in the industry Oddly enough , one of Mack s very first roles was in a softcore porn movie called Night Eyes Three She was just 11 years old at the time",false
"May 21 , 2017 Laura Keeling Gun Violence , News , Op Ed , Politics , Racism 0Sheriff Clarke , self declared Trump appointee , brings more plagiarism and less valorTrump advocate , controversial Milwaukee County Sheriff , David Clarke , announced on Wednesday that he has been appointed as an Assistant Secretary of the Department of Homeland Security Though , there has been no corroboration of his appointment , as of yet , from the White House As we ve observed from previous appointments , Trump requires neither qualifications , experience nor training in the specific field , only undying loyalty to him In the area of undying loyalty , Clarke excels In the arena of qualifications and experience , he leaves much to be desired In fact , CNN reported today that the sheriff had plagiarized portions of his Master s thesis on US security In fact , there were 47 incidents in his thesis of direct quotes from sources being included in his text without quotation marks Clarke had been awarded the degree from the Naval Postgraduate School in Monterey , California He is not the first of Trump s cabinet picks to have had plagiarism troubles , either , but the fourth In his short tenure , Betsy DeVos , Neil Gorsuch , Monica Crowley and even Trump s wife have all been accused of plagiarism The specific position for which Clarke is reportedly being considered is Assistant Secretary in the Office of Partnership and Engagement where his primary function will be to serve as liaison with state , local and tribal law enforcement and governments This is a position for which Clarke is uniquely unqualified He s a staunch conservative who s made no bones about his intense dislike of Liberals Democrats saying The only time I d only reach across the aisle to a Democrat is to grab them by the throat This is not the attitude of a person who will be open to listening and considering different or opposing ideas or positions What type of relationship does Trump think Clarke will have with Democrats or even moderate Republicans with this hard line stance \? Or does Trump even know what the position requirements are \? Knowing Trump , probably not Trump apparently thinks he s diversifying his cabinet It s the diversity of ideas that s important , not diversity in skin color Clarke , like his hero Trump , is also impulsive He , too , shoots from the hip spewing fact free rhetoric from questionable sources or making claims that have already been debunked His attacks on Black Lives Matter have been copious , vitriolic and unrelenting , but rarely based on facts Following the shooting of two police officers in Dallas and Baton Rouge , he claimed that America was at war and that BLM was the enemy However , the police chiefs in both cities had , after conducting a thorough investigation , publicly stated that neither perpetrator had been associated with Black Lives Matter What the shooters did have in common was that both were ex military , Afghan war veterans It s much more like likely that both were suffering from untreated PTSD than anything else But , that doesn t fit Sheriff Clarke s hate filled rhetoric , so he ignored it Or , perhaps he never even considered PTSD as an option since he , like Trump , has never served in the military Which brings me to my final point Stolen Valor 2 Look at this fucking guy 's uniform You see all that shit pinned all over his dress uniform jacket \? That 's not supposed to be there pic twitter com 0QZlBxQjI8 Charles Clymer \( cmclymer \) May 17 , 2017Clarke loves posing with his chest full of medals except they re neither military nor law enforcement They have more in common with Army Navy Store designer decorations for the chicken hawk out to impress the gullible than any sort of service Several veterans have called him on this blatant attempt at passing himself off as a military hero Just as he s not a military hero , he s not a law enforcement hero either if deaths within the jails you oversee is a measure Four inmates died in the Milwaukee county jails in 2016 One from being denied water for 7 days Clarke is also the subject of several lawsuits , as covered by Snopes com , many stemming from unnecessary deaths under his watch He also favors attacking the press if they dare report the truth about him You can see why Trump would want him in his cabinet , though the White House does seem to be casting doubt on the appointment that Clarke is claiming DHS has not confirmed that Clarke has been offered a position with the department On 17 May 2017 , the department s official Twitter account posted Senior positions are announced when made official by the Secretary No such announcement w regard to the Office of Public Engagement has been made Clarke is an uncaring , unfeeling , unyielding , uncompromising , old fashioned misogynist who embarrasses himself with his inability to adapt to changing times , situations or updated facts Put it all together , a perfect fit for the Trump administration",false
"President Trump Announces Plans To Build A Monument Commemorating the War on ChristmasFri , 03 30 2018 09 49Washington , DC Today , the Trump Administration unveiled plans to construct a monument hailing the end of the War on Christmas The new memorial will make good on President Trump 's promise to bring about a peaceful resolution to the nearly 20 year contrived conflict President Trump is proud to declare victory in the War on Christmas , said a White House spokesman , who repeatedly asked that their name not be used No longer will the celebration of Christmas be restricted to private homes , multiple 24 7 radio stations , non stop television specials , Christmas themed commercials interrupting those television specials , decorations in every major retail outlet , proclamations from elected officials , and a federal holiday Now that the War on Christmas is over , this cherished religious holiday can finally get the recognition it deserves The President believes his victory in the War on Christmas will be among the greatest achievements of his presidency At the consecration ceremony for the new monument , President Trump is expected to issue an official proclamation establishing that Christmas will now refer to the entire period of time between Thanksgiving and New Year 's Day The proposed monument is expected to feature several installation pieces , each highlighting a different aspect of the War on Christmas So far , the proposed monument includes A memorial to everyone who was wished Happy Holidays by a department store cashier An exhibition of anti Christian Starbucks cups A statue commemorating the Faceless Fox News Staffer , which will honor the unsung Fox News staff and interns who were forced to scour the internet for any story that could be plausibly spun to look like an attack on Christmas andA life size Nativity Scene Following the announcement , the White House has been forced to respond to a litany of criticisms , including accusations that the monument constitutes religious favoritism and is wildly unnecessary If you analyze this decision in the context of how the President and his cabinet view religious freedom , ' it makes a lot more sense , said the anonymous White House staffer before letting out a loud and heavy sigh Like many of the President 's policy decisions , this announcement comes following a meeting with the nation 's leading religious right groups The President shares their conviction that this monument will help reassert the principle of religious freedom , which is the inalienable right of every American to believe in conservative evangelical Christianity This monument is as unnecessary as it is unsurprising , said Larry T Decker , Executive Director of the Secular Coalition for America This is a monument to religious privilege and a message that Christian supremacists should feel emboldened What 's next \? Are we going to display the Ten Commandments in public schools \? Or entomb a leader of the religious right in our nation 's capital \?

"6th Graders Taught How to Use Strap On DildoExplicit 11 12 year olds given sex toy lesson in Jacksonvilleby Paul Joseph Watson September 15 , 20149 , 23530931Shocking images out of a classroom in Jacksonville , Florida illustrate how 11 12 year olds in 6th grade are being taught how to use strap on dildos amidst a debate about sexual content finding its way into other Common Core subjects , material which has been attacked by some as pornographic The pictures were taken by a student with a cellphone camera They show a teacher demonstrating how to use a strap on sex toy in a number of different positions In one image , the teacher even shows how to insert the strap on while her buttocks are in the air and her legs up over her head In another image , the woman shows the children how to wear a harness to which the strap on is attached Clinton Middle School in Duval County hired 39 year old Sharon Mercer to teach the sex education class but after the photos emerged she was suspended and the school refused further comment Mercer claimed her suspension was an act of bigotry because she was a proud member of the LGBTQ community Newly implemented Common Core educational standards have been assailed for their attempt to create a lowest common denominator form of teaching which many assert only works to dumb down lessons and prevent smart students from excelling The teaching of so called alternative sexual lifestyles is being practiced in many states under Common Core as a result of sexual content finding its way into other subjects A school district in Arizona banned a Common Core approved book last year after it was found to contain sexually explicit passages that described scenes of bondage Common Core , which is being federally imposed on states across the nation , is a huge shift in teaching which opponents assert will eviscerate critical thinking and generally lower standards in the name of inclusiveness and political correctness Numerous examples have emerged of Common Core style exam questions which only serve to cause more confusion and frustration Perhaps the most infamous example of how Common Core will manifest itself in America s schooling system was illustrated by a bizarre video in which a Common Core curriculum director said that 3 x 4 11 could be considered a correct answer so long as students could explain how they reached that number Common Core s sex education content has also faced fierce criticism , with one group even claiming that it represents pornography which serves to desensitize children to sexual contact and could lead to an increased chance of molestation within the schooling system Common Core approved book aimed at 11th graders contains sexually explicit scenes of bondage What is taught includes teaching inappropriate sexuality skills , that shouldn t even be taught in college , writes Joseph R John According to child psychologists , the children are not mentally equipped to understand the detailed sexual indoctrination starting in kindergarten , they are indoctrinated in sexual practices that they should never be exposed to There is a heavy socio political content of sex throughout Common Core curriculum being taught in every grade and in every subject , the student is taught that there is a sameness of gender , there is no longer simply boys and girls according to Common Core , notes John The sexual content of Common Core crosses into every curriculum taught , from teaching sexuality skills in sex education courses by specially skilled and trained sex education teachers Sexual activities and content in included in every subject taught Sex is taught in the English curriculum , is included in the language curriculum , sex is woven into the science curriculum , in the math curriculum , in the social studies curriculum , and of course in biology As the backlash grows , more and more states are considering abolishing Common Core altogether , with Indiana s decision earlier this year to ditch the program seen as a victory for conservatives FOLLOW Paul Joseph Watson https twitter com PrisonPlanet Paul Joseph Watson is the editor at large of Infowars com and Prison Planet com Print this page",false

introduced legislation to require the registration of all handguns The Handgun Safety and Registration Act is meant to reduce illegal gun trafficking by providing for more efficient tracing of handguns used in crimes and tougher penalties for those who sell guns to illegal purchasers The law will create an on line database of all registered handguns which can be easily accessed by federal , state and local law enforcement agencies Reed 's goal is to reduce the number of handguns that end up in the possession of criminals The bill would require registration of all handguns , including those currently in private possession , and would make it a felony for any person to transfer a handgun to another individual without prior law enforcement approval Background checks would be performed on all primary and secondary transfers of handguns , including retail sales , gun shows , Internet sales and all private sales Reed stated , This bill will limit criminals' access to guns Background checks will finally be performed on all handgun sales Before a handgun owner sells a gun without registering it , they will be forced to think hard about the crime they are about to commit and the ten years they may spend in prison Reed 's legislation has been endorsed by Handgun Control , Inc , the Violence Policy Center , the NAACP , the Coalition to Stop Gun Violence and Physicians for Social Responsibility The legislation was introduced in response to law enforcement officials' complaints that the methods available for tracing handguns used in crimes are extremely inefficient and provide criminals an advantage over the police Currently when a gun is recovered after a crime , a state or local law enforcement agency must contact the Bureau of Alcohol Tobacco and Firearms \( ATF \) with the name of the manufacturer and the serial number of the handgun The ATF in turn contacts the manufacturer , which provides the name of the wholesale or retail dealer to whom the handgun was sold ATF then contacts the dealer to obtain the name of the individual or another retail dealer who purchased the handgun This often leads to a dead end If the individual handgun owner has sold the gun to another person in a private sale , there is no way for law enforcement to follow the path of the handgun Reed 's legislation would make the process more efficient for local law enforcement officials by providing access to a national on line database of registered weapons Reed stated , Without restricting in any way the possession or sale of hunting rifles or shotguns used by law abiding sportsmen , this legislation will give law enforcement officials the tools to conduct faster and more reliable tracing of handguns used in crime , and prevent handguns from falling into criminal hands in the first place The legislation will add handguns to the successful federal weapons registration system already in place under the 1934 National Firearms Act \( NFA \) The NFA requires registration of all machine guns , short barrel shotguns and short barrel rifles , silencers , bombs , grenades , and other specialized weapons The NFA is administered by the Department of the Treasury 's Bureau of Alcohol , Tobacco and Firearms \( ATF \) The legislation will face significant opposition from gun control opponents I am under no illusion , Reed stated , that this legislation will be approved by this Congress or next Congress Movement on gun control always has been a long and labored process It was not until 1968 , five years after the assassination of John F Kennedy with a mail order rifle , that Congress limited that type of gun sale and set up a dealer licensing system By then , Robert F Kennedy and Martin Luther King Jr had been assassinated by gunmen The 1968 Gun Control Act was the first major gun control legislation in 30 years But we must begin the process to create a law that Americans overwhelmingly believe is necessary A Time CNN poll in July of 1999 found that 76 percent of Americans support having the federal government require that each handgun be registered A summary of the legislation is attached End Groups Supporting Senator Reed 's Handgun Safety and Registration Act Back to the Top Mary Leigh Bleck , President , Million Mom March This will help stem the flood of handguns into the illegal market , where kids and criminals have easy access to them We thank you for your courage and leadership in helping to reform America 's guns laws , and we look forward tow orking with you on this historic effort Mrs Sarah Brady , Chair , Handgun Control , Inc It 's about time Congress considers legislation like the Handgun Safety and Registration Act of 2000 to require the registration of handguns in this country For far too long in America , too many gun crimes have gone unsolved and murderers are getting away with murder because law enforcement does n't have a clear paper trail to follow Requiring handguns to be registered like we register cars would help law enforcement officers do their jobs , solving crimes I commend Senator Reed for sponsoring the Handgun Safety and Registration Act and hope that Congress will listen to what the majority of law enforcement groups and Americans are saying and quickly pass this important legislation Mark Pertschuk , Legislative Director of the Coalition to Stop Gun Violence Firearms registration and licensing is the single most important thing Congress can do to protect children from gun violence Senator Reed should be congratulated for his courage and his vision on this critical issue Kristen Rand , Director of Federal Policy at the Violence Policy Center Senator Reed 's legislation brings a complicated and cumbersome handgun tracing system out of the dark ages and into the 21st Century with instant on line access By utilizing an existing registration system , this proposal would prove to be the most cost effective and efficient system to register America 's arsenal of 60 million handguns We must match the level of sophistication of crimes in this country with a modernized tracking system Arinn Dixon , Associate Director , Physicians for Social Responsibility Physicians for Social Responsibility applauds Senator Reed 's critical efforts toward preventing gun violence in this country and emphatically endorses the provisions outlined in the Handgun Safety and Registration Act His actions show the American public that lawmakers are concerned enough about our nation 's epidemic of gun violence to take significant , preventative action Back to the Top Summary of the Handgun Safety and Registration Act of 2000 Back to the Top Adds handguns to the list of weapons registered by the Secretary of the Treasury , Bureau of Alcohol , Tobacco , and Firearms \( ATF \) , under the National Firearms Act \( NFA \) , which currently covers machine guns , short barrel shotguns , short barrel rifles , silencers , bombs , grenades , and other specialized weapons Subsection 2 \( a \) Requires all handguns , including those currently in private possession , to be registered with ATF within one year of enactment If a handgun is transferred to another individual during the one year transition period , the bill requires the handgun to be registered prior to the transfer Subsection 2 \( f \) Imposes federal law enforcement background checks on all handgun transfers , including both primary and secondary transfers For all NFA weapons , ATF conducts background checks through the National Crime Information Center \( NCIC \) , the Treasury Enforcement Communications System \( TECS \) , and the National Law Enforcement Tracking System \( NLETS \) To ensure compliance with the Handgun Safety and Registration Act , the bill requires the Secretary to take measures to inform the public of the requirements of the Act , such as public service announcements Subsection 2 \( h \) Requires ATF to share handgun registration data with local , state , and federal law enforcement officials to enhance tracing capabilities \( exempts handgun registration information from the disclosure restrictions of the Internal Revenue Code of 1986 , of which the NFA is a part \) Subsection 2 \( e \) Imposes a tax of 5 on handgun registration and transfers , rather than the 200 tax imposed on most NFA weapons Subsections 2 \( b \) and 2 \( f \) \( 1 \) Imposes a 50 tax on the making of a handgun , rather than the 200 tax imposed on the making of most NFA weapons Subsection 2 \( c \) Permits the continued importation of handguns by excluding handguns from the general prohibition on importation of NFA firearms under section 5844 of the NFA Subsection 2 \( d \) Only required participation by state and local law enforcement is the Chief Law Enforcement Officer 's completion of the Law Enforcement Certification portion of ATF registration or transfer form \( as currently required for all NFA weapons \) State and local law enforcement agencies are not required to administer the registration program or send forms to ATF On a voluntary basis , they may choose to provide ATF registration documents to the public To further ensure that registration and transfer forms are readily available to the public , the bill requires ATF to post forms on the Internet in a downloadable format , and to make forms available to state and local law enforcement agencies , the U S Postal Service , and regional offices of ATF and other Treasury Department bureaus Subsection 2 \( g \) Authorizes such appropriations as may be necessary to enable ATF to administer the new handgun registration and background check provisions in the bill Subsection 2 \( i \) Back to the Top How would it work \? Back to the Top The handgun owner \( the registrant \) obtains an ATF registration form and FBI fingerprint form FD 258 , either from his or her local Chief Law Enforcement Officer , by mail from ATF , at a U S Post Office , or from a regional ATF Treasury Department facility The registrant fills out the registration form and affixes a 2x2 inch photograph of himself taken within the past year The registrant takes the form to his or her Chief Law Enforcement Officer , who completes the Law Enforcement Certification portion of the form The registrant completes FBI fingerprint card Form FD 258 Fingerprints must be taken by a person qualified to do so and must be clear , unsmudged and classifiable A check or money order for 5 is made payable to ATF by the registrant The registrant sends all completed forms , accompanying materials , and tax payment to Bureau of Alcohol , Tobacco and Firearms P O Box 73201 Chicago , IL 60673 If application is approved , the original of the form with the canceled stamp affixed , showing approval , will be returned to the applicant Otherwise , the tax will be refunded and ATF will contact the registrant regarding abandonment of the handgun Transferring a handgun Transfer procedures are similar to the registration process described above , except that the transferee completes the reverse of the transfer form , has the Chief Law Enforcement Officer complete the Law Enforcement Certification , and attaches photos and fingerprint data",false

"The Satanic Temple Rolls Out Bigger , Better Satanic After School Club for 2017 The Satanic Temple s After School Satan Club Returns With a Nationwide Volunteer Network SALEM , Mass In 2016 , The Satanic Temple \( TST \) generated nationwide controversy with the roll out of its After School Satan Club \( ASSC \) campaign , placing openly Satanic clubs in public schools to counterbalance what TST sees as a coercive presence of Evangelical extracurricular clubs in public schools After a successful first year , ASSC is back , and it promises to be much bigger than before Last year , the After School Satan Club curriculum was only offered in school districts where local chapters of The Satanic Temple could manage and maintain them , explains Chalice Blythe , National Director for The Satanic Temple s ASSC campaign In that time , we received a flood of emails from parents , educators , and other qualified parties who were interested in operating After School Satan Clubs in schools near them This year , we have made our curriculum available to this volunteer network , and we expect to see a much larger After School Satan Club presence in 2017 Our curriculum has also been revised by qualified experts in education to provide a reason based , fun alternative to the evangelical indoctrination clubs already present in the schools This year s After School Satan Club is going to be even better and much bigger The ASSC campaign was created specifically to offer an alternative to other religious clubs that seek to indoctrinate children after school , particularly the Good News Club , an Evangelical Fundamentalist club run by the Child Evangelism Fellowship According to the ASSC website , Proselytization is not our goal , and we re not interested in converting children to Satanism However , we feel that our presence in schools that are burdened with the loathsome stink of the Good News Clubs serves an anti indoctrination function , illustrating to children that opposing religious perspectives can be held by moral and responsible people who don t live in fear of divine retribution We think it s a positive and strong character developing lesson that we are happy to deliver Those interested in volunteering to operate an ASSC should contact The Satanic Temple at info afterschoolsatan com To help support The Satanic Temple efforts to expand the ASSC program , please visit www afterschoolsatan com Judicial Watch Creates Bizarre Fabricated News Story Claiming IRS Gave After School Satan Club Fast Track Tax Exemption Chalice Blythe After School Satan Club Director Stu De Haan The Satanic Temple Legal Counsel FOR IMMEDIATE RELEASE On March 16 , 2017 the website Judicial Watch published an article entitled IRS Gives After School Satan Club Tax Exempt Status in 10 Days which claimed that the Internal Revenue Service \( IRS \) fast tracked a deranged Satanic cult to operate as a nonprofit in taxpayer funded elementary schools While this claim has been repeated by several news organizations , including Fox and The Washington Times , it is utter fiction The Satanic Temple \( TST \) does , in fact , run After School Satan Clubs \( ASSC \) as a reason based science centered counterbalance to fundamentalist evangelical after school programs , but the IRS played absolutely no role in the approval of these clubs The After School Satan Clubs are sponsored by the non profit 501 \( c \) \( 3 \) , Reason Alliance , Ltd however , Reason Alliance earned its tax exempt status long before ASSC existed and did not , despite claims , receive its exemption in 10 days Further , nothing in the filings for Reason Alliance make reference to Satan or Satanism Clearly , any insinuations that Obama s IRS struck a secret alliance with Satanists are nothing more than an absurd fabrication Not only is Judicial Watch s story demonstrably false , it is a clear example of gross journalistic negligence across the reporting spectrum and an inability to comprehend not only what the After School Satan Club is , but also what procedures ASSC underwent to get approval for operation in public schools Procedures , it should be noted , that are very clearly laid out in the documentation they themselves obtained and released Reason Alliance , Ltd , was formed in 2014 by the founders of The Satanic Temple \( TST \) The non profit was set up to encourage reason and empathy , reject tyrannical authority , promote justice , and advocate pragmatic common sense Reason Alliance also supports activities that advance these core values When the After School Satan Club was formed in July 2016 , Reason Alliance was used to sponsor this program as ASSC operations are consistent with its mission statement This sponsorship supports The Satanic Temple s After School Satan Club by way of covering the rental fees and liability insurance coverage required by law The assertion by Judicial Watch and all other news outlets that ASSC is somehow itself a tax exempt entity or operated by Reason Alliance Ltd has no grounding in reality nor does the documentation they ve obtained support this claim Additionally , multiple news outlets have and continue to refer to The Satanic Temple as a cult This slanderous categorization of our organization is precisely the type of irresponsible , lazy , and sensational journalism that Americans have come to expect This expectation , however , does not absolve the media from propagating such falsehoods By any definition of the term , The Satanic Temple does not fall into this category and any accusation of such is not only a bald face lie , it s libelous due to the heinous connotations implied Any cursory research of this organization would debunk this allegation , calling into question the actual efforts these journalists put into verifying the facts prior to publishing This , in essence , is why the After School Satan Club is so necessary in schools to teach critical thought and rational inquiry so this type of vitriol can be avoided in the future We hope that news outlets exercise more skepticism toward Judicial Watch press releases in the future The Satanic Temple leverages Religious Freedom laws to put After School Clubs in elementary schools nationwide This school year The Satanic Temple will have After School Clubs in public elementary schools across the nation leveraging Religious Freedom laws established by decades of Evangelical litigation The Satanic Temple \( TST \) has announced that this coming school year \( 2016 \) will find their organization operating in elementary schools across the nation where they will be offering their new After School Satan Club program to students While the presence of a religious organization in public schools will no doubt be shocking to some , evangelical litigants primarily the Child Evangelism Fellowship \( CEF \) represented by lawyers from the Liberty Counsel have solidly established the legal rights of religious organizations to operate clubs in public schools According to the CEF website , the United States Supreme Court ruled that a public school which allows use of its facilities to secular groups may not discriminate against religious groups And now that the CEF has established its Bible based Good News Clubs across the nation , TST are eager to offer their own after school clubs , which will focus upon critical reasoning , independent thinking , fun , and freethought According to TST spokesperson , Lucien Greaves , School districts across the nation have received letters from The Satanic Temple explaining that we will be offering our clubs in their schools this coming school year , and parents in those schools can expect to be presented with a permission slip from their children in the first weeks of the Fall semester All of the districts we ve approached are nearby to local chapters of The Satanic Temple , and each school district has hosted , or is now hosting , Good News Clubs in their schools This being the case , we are sure that the school districts we ve approached are well aware that they are not at liberty to deny us use of their facilities , nor are they at liberty to deny us any level of representation in the schools that they afford to other school clubs such as fliers , tables , brochures , and school wide announcements We would like to thank the Liberty Counsel , specifically , for opening the doors of public schools to the After School Satan Club through their dedication to religious liberty Elaborating the mission of the After School Satan Clubs , Greaves states , It s important that children be given an opportunity to realize that the evangelical materials now creeping into their schools are representative of but one religious opinion amongst many While the Good News Clubs focus on indoctrination , instilling them with a fear of Hell and God s wrath , After School Satan Clubs will focus on free inquiry and rationalism , the scientific basis for which we know what we know about the world around us We prefer to give children an appreciation of the natural wonders surrounding them , not a fear of everlasting other worldly horrors",false

"BY MIKE RYAN As a Mayor of a town with 90 , 000 residents , thousands of businesses , 11 public schools , and millions of visitors a year , I have a very keen interest in preventing gun violence where possible As a former PTA president and father of two in our Broward County Public Schools , I have a very personal interest in protecting our children and schools Sunrise is also home to the only public recreational shooting range in Broward County We welcome , and have enjoyed a positive relationship with , responsible gun owners those who are interested in recreational and competitive shooting are friends , neighbors , visitors and residents Last Friday , Sheriff Scott Israel hosted a Roundtable convened by Congresswoman Debbie Wasserman Schultz regarding gun violence Attending were predominantly law enforcement chiefs , but also School Boards of Miami Dade County and Broward , a judge handling mental health issues , a prosecutor handling exclusively gang violence and gun crimes , a former ATF agent , a current FDLE agent , and the Mayors of Miami Dade County and Broward County In talking to responsible gun owners , law enforcement and residents , there is an evolving consensus We must take whatever reasonable steps we can to prevent guns being placed in the hands of the irresponsible , derangedand criminals This is not simply a reaction to a single event or a series of sensational events In America , each day , there are 33 murders committed with guns There is no single solution That does not mean we should do nothing We should have School Resource Officers to play an important role in protecting our children and teachers not as armed guards , but as part of the community policing model meant to understand the dynamics of students and families and how they interact in and out of our schools In addition to deterrence , they help address problems of drugs , gangs , and issues facing our neighborhoods and at risk youth In Sunrise , SROs have been or are active members of SWAT , Field Force , Hostage Negotiators and other specialized units while still being able to open the milk carton for a frustrated 1stgrader or help a parent navigate the car loop Universal background checks on ALL sales , with meaningful enforcement and real penalties for violators Background checks that are meaningful Full prosecution of anyone breaking existing laws Severely increase penalties for crimes committed with guns Ways to address the mentally ill and those with mental health issues Now someone committed involuntarily for 72 hours under the Baker Act \( as a danger to themselves or others \) will have their guns returned to them by the police automatically and immediately upon discharge after 72 hours AND their commitment is never entered into a background check database As a result , there is also no impediment or second thought given to someone being released and purchasing a gun Penalties for the possession of a firearm obtained without a background check If you shouldn t have the gun , responsible gun owners say throw away the key How we get there is part of the discussion Roughly 6 6 million guns a year are transferred without background checks , many through the internet Right now , private sellers exclusively decide whether or not they should seek a background check That is unworkable and an illogical step to curb the flow of guns into the hands of the irresponsible , deranged and criminals A March shooting rampage in New Mexico occurred after someone who would never have been able to pass a background check purchased guns privately , through an ad in the paper The seller later admitted how badly he felt The same scenario happened in a Wisconsin mass shooting last year involving an act of domestic violence How many other times a day does this happen \? We must make sure databases are populated with the right information on domestic violence history , convictions , mental health issues AND the state databases are linked to federal databases Databases do prevent bad guys from getting guns In 2009 , over 150 , 000 were prohibited from purchasing Since 1999 , 1 7 million have been prohibited from buying guns from federally licensed dealers But , gaps have let felons , those with domestic violence convictions and restraining orders and the mentally ill to actually obtain guns and permits to carry a concealed firearm At Virginia Tech , the mass shooting was committed by someone who passed a background check even though a judge had found him mentally ill and ordered he not be permitted to purchase or possess a gun The information was never linked to the necessary databases How many times a day does this happen \? All this means increased resources for enforcement and prosecutions , as well as a change in law to make the penalties severe enough that criminals , unscrupulous dealers , law enforcement and federal prosecutors take this seriously The raging national debate over bans and restrictions on the character of guns and magazines are more difficult Licensed dealers and law enforcement tell me since the Sandy Hook mass shooting , you cannot even find certain military style weapons to purchase or the prices have skyrocketed It is true so many of the murders committed each day involve weapons not even contemplated by any proposed ban or not involving high capacity magazines So , some solutions should be implemented without even tackling the thorny issues presented However , many in law enforcement said limiting high capacity magazines would make a difference over time regarding dangers they face and in many of these shootings Mark Kelly emphasized this point last week in an interview his wife Gabrielle Giffords was shot when the killer was stopped as he attempted to reload after emptying 30 rounds from a magazine Sure , they can just reload But , for the untrained particularly , reloading is a point where intervention can occur or where mechanical failure can impede Some question why any civilian needs 30 round or more capacity We must take the steps we all agree will make a difference Doing nothing is not an option Becoming paralyzed by politics will cost lives Mike Ryan , the mayor of Sunrise , is also Chair of the Broward League of Cities Public Safety Committee and the Co Chair of the Joint SRO Taskforce of the Broward League of Cities",true

"Tidal deformations of the Earth due to motions of the Sun and Moon cause changes in the stress state , which may trigger earthquakes The possibility of tidal triggering of earthquakes has been investigated since the 19th century1 , and numerous studies have examined this topic2 , 3 , 4 , 5 , 6 , 7 , 8 Statistically significant correlations between seismicity and tidal stress have been discovered using large data sets , but the correlations are generally limited to special regions or circumstances For example , seismicity was correlated with tidal stress changes before three large earthquakes in Sumatra7 and before the 2011 Tohoku Oki earthquake in Japan8 While such observations are of interest in the field of probabilistic earthquake forecasting , the governing mechanism that underlies the correlations is unknown In more general cases , tidal stress changes on the order of several kPa are considered too small to control the dynamic rupture processes of earthquakes , which are characterized by stress changes on the order of MPa The recent discovery of deep tectonic tremors in plate boundary regions has slightly modified our view of the relationship between tidal stresses and earthquakes , as these tremors are sometimes highly sensitive to tidal stress changes9 , 10 , 11 , 12 , 13 , with tremor rates showing an exponential increase in proportion to the applied encouraging stress11 , 12 , 13 Thus , even stress changes of only a few kPa can amplify the tremor rate by several orders As tremors reflect slow slip on the plate interface , tidal stresses also accelerate the slow slip on the plate interface The slow slip may not be restricted in deep plate boundary regions , rather it can be ubiquitous in seismic regions Therefore , such accelerated slow deformation can change the stress state on the entire seismic region , and hence increase the probability of earthquakes While such slow deformation is dependent on the amplitude of the tidal stress , most previous studies on this topic have investigated only the phase of the tidal stress rather than its amplitude The amplitude of the tidal stress increases at times of syzygies \( new moon or full moon \) and spring tides in the ocean , which occur at periodicities of 14 8 days Several studies have investigated the relationship between syzygies and earthquakes Kennedy et al noted that large \( M7 0 \) earthquakes appear to occur more frequently near times of syzygies , but they could not confirm the relationship statistically5 In fact , the relationship tends to weaken and disappear as smaller events are considered To investigate the possible effects of the tidal stress amplitude on earthquake occurrence , we calculated temporal changes in tidal stress components on a known earthquake fault plane , as described in the Methods 21 , 22 , 23 , 24 , 25 Figure 1 shows tidal shear stresses before and after the three most recent large earthquakes The 2004 Sumatra and 2010 Maule earthquakes both occurred near the time of a full moon , close to the peak of the tidal shear stress The 2011 Tohoku Oki earthquake , on the other hand , occurred near the time of a neap tide \( Fig 1b \) Nevertheless , the tidal shear stress showed consistently large amplitude around the time of the Tohoku Oki earthquake Many very large earthquakes have occurred close to the time of large shear stresses caused by syzygies , as shown in Supplementary Fig 1 However , the correlation between the tidal shear stress and earthquake occurrence is not always clear , as at least three events \( 15 11 2006 , 13 01 2007 , and 12 09 2007 \) in Supplementary Fig 1 did not correlate with large tidal stress , and a deterministic relationship has not been demonstrated Figure 1 Tidal shear stress for the period 30 days before and after three large earthquakes a , The 2004 Sumatra earthquake b , The 2011 Tohoku Oki earthquake c , The 2010 Chile Maule earthquake Left Location maps and focal mechanism Right shear stress changes resolved on the fault plane in the direction of slip Stars represent the timing of the earthquakes and the stress levels at that time Full size image Because the amplitude variations of the tidal stress are not always regular \( Fig 1 and Supplementary Fig 1 \) , a simple phase analysis that assumes a constant period may not be effective in examining the effect of tidal stress on seismicity Therefore , as an alternative , the relationship between the maximum tidal shear stress during the one day preceding an earthquake \( the coseismic maximum \) and the daily maxima during the 15 days before the event \( the preseismic period \) were examined , and the ranking \( 1 for the lowest , 15 for the highest \) of the coseismic maximum was recorded \( Supplementary Fig 2 \) The coseismic maximum rankings for the Sumatra , Tohoku Oki , and Maule earthquakes are 11 , 13 , and 15 , respectively The choice of a one day period was based on the assumption that slow deformation due to tidal stresses has a certain duration , and also because some preparation processes might occur before an earthquake The assumption of a one day period is convenient for also capturing the potential effects of the normal stress4 , which is often correlated \( positively or negatively \) with the shear stress , and the timing of both the positive and negative peaks of the normal and Coulomb stresses typically falls within the one day period Nevertheless , since the period measuring the coseismic maximum \( coseismic period \) is arbitrary , we also test two cases , by recording the ranking of the coseismic maximum in half day or two days in 15 or 14 days of the preseismic period , respectively The calculations of rankings were made for all events in the Global Central Moment Tensor \( CMT \) catalogue14 exceeding M w 5 5 Figure 2 shows histograms of rankings for shallow \( depth 100 km \) events in the Global CMT catalogue , with different thresholds for the minimum magnitude Figure 2a , b shows the dominance of large rankings \( 75 or 40 in the five large rankings \) for the largest 12 and 123 events , respectively The differences between bins diminish as the number of events increases , and the difference is small for earthquakes exceeding M w 5 5 \( 10 , 000 events \) \( Fig 2d \) The distribution in Fig 2d is indistinguishable from the distribution made by random sampling of event timing Thus , if only the frequency of medium and large earthquakes is examined , a correlation between earthquake occurrence and the amplitude of the tidal stress would be rejected , as concluded by Kennedy and colleagues5 Figure 2 Histograms of stress level ranking for different magnitude thresholds a d , Ranking of the maximum shear stress on the day of an earthquake , as compared with the daily maxima during the 15 days before the event , for earthquakes larger than magnitude thresholds of M w 8 2 \( a \) , M w 7 5 \( b \) , M w 6 5 \( c \) and M w 5 5 \( d \) Results are based on the Global CMT Full size image A more complex but better fitting interpretation of the data in Fig 2 , however , is that for more than 10 , 000 events of M w 5 5 in the catalogue , an event that occurred under a large tidal stress had a greater likelihood of growing to an M w 8 event Such an interpretation would indicate that the slope of the power law size frequency statistic \( that is , the b value of the Gutenberg Richter relationship \) is different for each ranking of the tidal stress Figure 3a shows size frequency statistics and b values \( with standard deviations \) estimated using the maximum likelihood method26 As expected from Fig 2 , the b value decreases as the stress ranking increases For the bottom five stress rankings , the b value is 1 15 , but the b value decreases to 0 93 for the top five stress rankings The difference is statistically significant , as confirmed by Utsu s test27 \( see Methods \) Similar results are obtained for different coseismic periods \( Supplementary Figs 3 and 4 \) Figure 3 Estimated b values and size frequency statistics a , Global shallow earthquakes larger than M w 6 5 b , Low angle thrust type earthquakes in northeastern Japan , larger than M w 4 5 c , Strike slip type earthquakes in southern California , larger than M 2 5 Top open circles show the b values independently estimated for 15

Bottom magnitude frequency statistics Each line represents the statistics for a shear stress level shown in the corresponding colour in the top panel Three dashed lines show distributions corresponding to b 0 9 , 1 0 , and 1 1 Full size image In the global catalogue , differences in b values are less clear for events of M w 6 5 , possibly because the catalogue includes events with various focal mechanisms in diverse tectonic environments , and hence mixes events with a wide range of b values17 , 18 To consider more homogeneous tectonic environments and less variable focal mechanisms , we also separately analysed earthquakes occurring in Japan and California \( see Methods \) Figure 3b shows results using the F net MT catalogue15 for a relatively homogeneous region in northeastern Japan , including the Hokkaido and Tohoku regions Only low angle thrust type earthquakes are considered because they have fairly uniform b value , although similar results are obtained for all events Since thrust type earthquakes have a relatively small b value18 , b values are generally small Moreover , the b values decrease with increasing stress levels , and very small b values \( 0 7 \) are observed in cases of large tidal stress levels Figure 3c presents another example of strike slip type earthquakes from The Refined Earthquake Focal Mechanism Catalog for Southern California 16 The b values are generally large , with slightly smaller values for higher tidal stress levels , although the significance is weaker than other two cases Similar results are obtained for longer coseismic periods \( Supplementary Fig 3 \) , but the trend is relatively weak for half day coseismic period \( Supplementary Fig 4 \) , suggesting the importance of diurnal tides In northeastern Japan , the separation of size frequency statistic curves is visible even for events of M w 5 \( Fig 3b \) , indicating that tidal controls are apparent for smaller earthquakes in some environments In Fig 3b , among the 237 and 263 events of M w 4 5 , 116 and 98 grew into events larger than M w 5 , for higher \( 11 15 \) and lower \( 1 5 \) rankings , respectively Assuming that the earthquake growth process between two sizes is governed by a binomial distribution with probability p 98 263 for low stress rankings , the chance that we have 116 events over M w 5 from 237 events of M w 4 5 is smaller than 10 4 The correspondence of small b values and earthquakes with large shear stresses is consistent with evidence from previous studies on acoustic emissions in rock experiments , showing decreasing b values with increasing differential stresses19 , 20 , variations in b values with the type of earthquake focal mechanism18 , and positive correlations between b values and the ages of subducting plates worldwide17 Although the growth processes of dynamic rupture are not fully understood , one hypothesis is that growth occurs via a cascading process in a hierarchical system , from a tiny rock failure to a giant earthquake28 , 29 Rupture is accelerated and decelerated controlled by energy balance , and small changes of stress distribution may determine growth and arrest of rupture29 , 30 Based on this type of model , it is possible to interpret the observation that large tidal stresses correspond to a high probability of cascading rupture growth , which is the probability of an event progressing from small to large scales Small tidal stress can enhance slow deformation in various scales , and resultant stress redistribution is likely to increase the cascading probability of nearly critical dynamic rupture",false

"NewsPopulation Control UPDATE \( Nov 12 \) Kenya 's government has launched an investigation into the Catholic Church 's allegations See follow up article here Kenya s Catholic bishops are charging two United Nations organizations with sterilizing millions of girls and women under cover of an anti tetanus inoculation program sponsored by the Kenyan government According to a statement released Tuesday by the Kenya Catholic Doctors Association , the organization has found an antigen that causes miscarriages in a vaccine being administered to 2 3 million girls and women by the World Health Organization and UNICEF Priests throughout Kenya reportedly are advising their congregations to refuse the vaccine We sent six samples from around Kenya to laboratories in South Africa They tested positive for the HCG antigen , Dr Muhame Ngare of the Mercy Medical Centre in Nairobi told LifeSiteNews They were all laced with HCG Dr Ngare , spokesman for the Kenya Catholic Doctors Association , stated in a bulletin released November 4 , This proved right our worst fears that this WHO campaign is not about eradicating neonatal tetanus but a well coordinated forceful population control mass sterilization exercise using a proven fertility regulating vaccine This evidence was presented to the Ministry of Health before the third round of immunization but was ignored But the government says the vaccine is safe Health Minister James Macharia even told the BBC , I would recommend my own daughter and wife to take it because I entirely 100 agree with it and have confidence it has no adverse health effects And Dr Collins Tabu , head of the Health Ministry s immunization branch , told the Kenyan Nation , that there is no other additive in the vaccine other than the tetanus antigen Tabu said the same vaccine has been used for 30 years in Kenya Moreover , there are women who were vaccinated in October 2013 and March this year who are expectant Therefore we deny that the vaccines are laced with contraceptives Newspaper stories also report women getting pregnant after being vaccinated Responds Dr Ngare Either we are lying or the government is lying But ask yourself , What reason do the Catholic doctors have for lying \? Dr Ngare added The Catholic Church has been here in Kenya providing health care and vaccinating for 100 years for longer than Kenya has existed as a country Dr Ngare told LifeSiteNews that several things alerted doctors in the Church s far flung medical system of 54 hospitals , 83 health centres , and 17 medical and nursing schools to the possibility the anti tetanus campaign was secretly an anti fertility campaign Why , they ask does it involve an unprecedented five shots \( or jabs as they are known , in Kenya \) over more than two years and why is it applied only to women of child bearing years , and why is it not being conducted without the usual fanfare of government publicity \? Usually we give a series three shots over two to three years , we give it anyone who comes into the clinic with an open wound , men , women or children said Dr Ngare If this is intended to inoculate children in the womb , why give it to girls starting at 15 years \? You cannot get married till you are 18 The usual way to vaccinate children is to wait till they are six weeks old But it is the five vaccination regime that is most alarming The only time tetanus vaccine has been given in five doses is when it is used as a carrier in fertility regulating vaccines laced with the pregnancy hormone , Human Chorionic Gonadotropin \( HCG \) developed by WHO in 1992 It is HCG that has been found in all six samples sent to the University of Nairobi medical laboratory and another in South Africa The bishops and doctors warn that injecting women with HCG , which mimics a natural hormone produced by pregnant women , causes them to develop antibodies against it When they do get pregnant , and produce their own version of HCG , it triggers the production of antibodies that cause a miscarriage We knew that the last time this vaccination with five injections has been used was in Mexico in 1993 and Nicaragua and the Philippines in 1994 , said Dr Ngare It didn t cause miscarriages till three years later , which is why , he added , the counterclaims that women who got the vaccination recently and then got pregnant are meaningless Ngare said WHO tried to bring the same anti fertility program into Kenya in the 1990s We alerted the government and it stopped the vaccination But this time they haven t done so Ngare also contrasted the secrecy of this campaign with the usual fanfare accompanying national vaccination efforts They usually bring all the stakeholders together three months before the campaign , like they did with polio a little while ago And they use staff in all the centres to give out the vaccine But with this anti tetanus campaign , only a few operatives from the government are allowed to give it out They come with a police escort They take it away with them when they are finished Why not leave it with the local medical staff to administer \? Brian Clowes of Human Life International in Virginia told LifeSite News that WHO was not involved in the Nicaragua , Mexican and Philippines campaigns They try to maintain a spotless record They let organizations like United Nations Population Fund and USAID do the dirty work In the previous cases , said Clowes , the vaccinators insisted their product was pure until it was shown not to be Then they claimed the positive tests for HCG were isolated , accidental contaminations in the manufacturing process LifeSiteNews has obtained a UN report on an August 1992 meeting at its world headquarters in Geneva of 10 scientists from Australia , Europe , India and the U S A and 10 women s health advocates from around the world , to discuss the use of fertility regulating vaccines It describes the anti Human Chorionic Gonadotropin vaccine as the most advanced One million Kenyan women and girls have been vaccinated so far with another 1 3 million to go The vaccination is targeting women , according to the government , in order to inoculate their children in the womb against tetanus as well The government says 550 children die of tetanus yearly In covering the contest of words the pro government Nation found plenty of women who had been vaccinated and were now pregnant , even one who was the wife of a former Catholic priest who left the Church to marry The paper ignored Kenya s reliance on the Catholic medical system , while setting the bishops stand in a questionable historical context of irrational responses largely based on religious beliefs , the more recent murder of vaccination teams in Nigeria , and even of CIA conspiracy theories Why would the UN want to suppress the population in developing countries \? Racism , is Brian Clowes first explanation Also , the developed countries want to get hold of their natural resources And lately , there is the whole bogus global warming thing Dr Ngare said it was the Catholic Church s hope that the government could have resolved the matter quietly by testing the vaccine But the government has chosen to be combative , forcing Kenya s bishops and Catholic doctors to go public WHO s Kenyan office and several WHO media contacts in Washington , D C failed to respond to LifeSiteNews enquiries over a 24 hour period",false

Internet to Manipulate , Deceive , and Destroy Reputations October 9 , 2016 Maryland Doctor Who Treated Hillary Clinton For Blood Clot On Brain Mysteriously Dies By Sorcha Faal , and as reported to her Western Subscribers A shocking new report circulating in the Kremlin today prepared by the Foreign Intelligence Service \( SVR \) says that the infamously named Clinton Body Count has now increased after a Maryland \( US \) based doctor was discovered dead this past week under mysterious circumstances and who had , this past June , been part of a specialized medical team that removed a blood clot from the brain of Hillary Clinton Note Some words and or phrases appearing in quotes in this report are English language approximations of Russian words phrases having no exact counterpart According to this report , Hillary Clinton has long been known to have grave health issues since she collapsed in December , 2012 , and that led to her first operation to remove a blood clot from her brain and that her husband , former President Bill Clinton , recently stated took her 6 months to recover from This past summer , however , this report continues , on 30 June , SVR analysts state that Hillary Clinton collapsed on her private plan while in route to her Washington D C home and was unconscious when it landed at Joint Base Andrews which is the home base of the 89th Airlift Wing that manages the flights of all top American officials , including the President Once landed , this report notes , Hillary Clinton was rushed by ambulance to the US Air Forces Malcolm Grow Medical Facility located on this base and put under the urgent immediate care of doctors assigned to the 79th Medical Wing Though many aspects details of this SVR report relating to what exactly happened when the unconscious Hillary Clinton reached the Malcolm Grow Medical Facility remain to highly classified to write about here , what is important to note is that her security guards refused to allow her to be treated , and when US Air Force doctors objected to removing her from their care , they had numerous weapons pointed at them after which Hillary Clinton was taken from this medical facility by her just arrived motorcade With this potentially deadly situation being observed by many people , this report says , a number of them alerted Joint Base Andrews security police who put the entire base on lockdown but was later whitewashed covered up by US Air Force Colonel Brad Hoagland who told the media that the reports of a real world active shooter situation at the Malcolm Grow Medical Facility were miscommunicated Malcolm Grow Medical Facility at Joint Base Andrews \( photo credit Airman 1st Class Aaron Stout U S Air Force \) Upon leaving Joint Base Andrews with the still unconscious Hillary Clinton , SVR intelligence analysts in this report say , her motorcade rushed to a nearby \( 57 kilometers 36 miles \) private MedStar Montgomery Medical Center hospital in Olney , Maryland , where she was rushed into emergency surgery The reason for Hillary Clinton s security detail rushing her to the MedStar Montgomery Medical Center , this report explains , is due to this hospital having advanced non invasive technology able to find blood clots in the brain like an instrument surgeons their use to pick up light emissions from a digitized instrument , while a camera is placed above a patient 's head Performing the emergency brain surgery on Hillary Clinton at the MedStar Montgomery Medical Center on 30 June , this report continues , was the Islamic neurosurgeon Amjad Anaizi who is her private brain doctor whom she frequently visits at the MedStar Georgetown University Hospital near her home in Washington D C and who , also , is the cousin of Hillary Clinton s top aid Huma Abedin who is linked to the Muslim Brotherhood terror organization Attending Doctor Anaizi in his operating on Hillary Clinton s brain to remove the blood clot that had rendered her unconscious , this report says , was Doctor Sandeep Sherlekar who was the on call anesthesiologist at MedStar Montgomery Medical Center but who , exactly 3 months later , on 30 September , was discovered dead Latest Clinton Body Count victim Dr Sandeep Sherlekar \( 1965 2016 \) Doctor Sandeep Sherlekar , SVR analysts in this report explain , was a deeply loved doctor by his patients who been in practice for more than 20 years before his death , spoke multiple languages , and had previously served as the chief resident in anesthesiology at Hahnemann University Hospital in Philadelphia Doctor Sandeep Sherlekar , also , this report continues , was by all accounts deeply religious and that led him , in 2012 , to file a lawsuit against the Chief Executive Officer , Muhammad Ahmad Khan , and Chief Financial Officer , Vic Wadhwa , accusing them of financial crimes at the medical practice where he worked called the American Spine Center Working closely with agents of the US Federal Bureau Investigation \( FBI \) , this report notes , Doctor Sandeep Sherlekar was able to aid in them , in 2014 , in their securing a guilty plea against CFO Vic Wadhwa for receiving 459 , 000 in kickbacks bribes SVR analysts in this report , though , note a severe abnormality in the events since CFO Vic Wadhwa pled guilty , due to Doctor Sandeep Sherlekar aiding the FBI , stating that as of yet he has not been sentenced for his crimes over two year later And in an even greater strangulation choking to death of American justice , and immediately after Doctor Sandeep Sherlekar assisted Doctor Anaizi in his operating on Hillary Clinton s brain , the same FBI agents he had helped in conviction CFO Vic Wadhwa turned on him and on 22 September filed charges against him accusing him of the same crimes he had reported to them in 2012 Eight days later , at about 7 15 a m Friday on 30 September , Doctor Sandeep Sherlekar was found dead at the entrance to the American Spine Center with local police stating that no obvious signs of trauma were evident when police arrived , and foul play was not suspected or in intelligence speak , he was suicided With Doctor Sandeep Sherlekar being a devout adherent to the Hindu religion that considers suicide a murder and against the code of ahimsa \( non violence \) , SVR analysts in this report say , the local police reports suggesting this is why he died can be quickly discounted with the more logical explanation of his death being simply that he knew more about Hillary Clinton then she was ever going to chance his telling anyone else These SVR intelligence analysts , also , note that Doctor Sandeep Sherlekar s death fits exactly the profile of all of the other deaths associated with the Clinton Crime Family with the victim fist knowing to much , then having their personal and professional reputations destroyed , with the final act being their mysterious death as a message for others to not dare cross these most dangerous of criminals To the American people knowing of these events this report doesn t say but from the past knowledge of these American s known by just about everyone else in the world , even if they did ,

"Last night , my family and I saw Disney Pixar s Incredibles 2 , a movie we had all been looking forward to seeing for months We were excited to see the characters again and wondered how the sequel would compare to the original film , which was shown shortly before in a double feature After last night , I can say that the movie is unlike anything I have ever seen before , in that the villain s weapon of choice can hurt not only characters on screen , but can also hurt the people in the audience as well The weapon \? Continuous sequences of rapidly flashing strobing lights Scene description \( NO SPOILERS \) There are at least five scenes throughout the movie , all of which feature the villain , that use bright white flashing strobe lights for more than fifteen seconds , with at least one scene going over 90 seconds in continuous strobing lights These lights stay at their rapidly flashing speed in the entirety of these scenes , which are scattered throughout the movie My brother estimated the light flashes being as fast as 3 flashes per second Why is this an issue \? Many different populations can be sensitive to flashing and strobing lights , not just people with photosensitive epilepsy Here is a small sampling of conditions that can be affected Migraines Vision impairment Seizure conditions Vertigo \( specifically flicker vertigo \) Autism ADHD PTSD Even people who do not have these conditions or have a history of them can still have an adverse reaction to strobe lights This risk is increased for children and young adults Signs of adverse strobe reactions Some common signs of adverse strobe reactions include Seizure Blank staring Fumbling Chewing Wandering Shaking Garbled speech Muscle twitching Loss of consciousness Migraine Large amount of pain centralized in head Light sensitivity Temporary visual auras \( blindness , double vision , floaters \) Nausea vomiting This post is not a replacement for medical advice If you begin experiencing any of these symptoms please seek appropriate medical attention How descriptive audio helped Since I am visually impaired , I use descriptive audio devices provided by my theater to get descriptions of visual information on screen One of the hidden benefits is that I had a warning about scenes involving strobe lights ahead of time , so I could close my eyes and avoid them While the descriptive audio did not warn me about all of the flashing lights used in the film , I know that had I not had descriptive audio , I would have had to leave the movie early Related links Isn t there a flashing light warning in place \? As of publishing time , there is no warning in place about the intense flashing strobing light effects in Incredibles 2 There are warnings attached to many other media types when strobe and flashing lights are present for long periods of time , such as video games , live concerts , music videos , and even certain theme park attractions , but there are typically no formal or informal warnings in place for movies , and none for Incredibles 2 In addition , I do not know of any apps that provide information about flashing lights in movies What can be done about this \? I am not asking for Disney and or Pixar to remove the movie from theaters , nor am I asking them to change the movie to get rid of the strobing lights \( though they certainly can if they want to ! \) I would like for these companies as well as movie theaters to issue a warning to guests purchasing tickets that this movie has a significant amount of strobing lights that can cause adverse health effects , especially in young children Families have the right to be able to make informed decisions about movies and to determine if this is safe for their children to watch Update June 19 After this post went viral , Disney Pixar sent a notice to theaters asking them to put up a sign warning guests about the flashing light scenes !

"As the flood of refugees fleeing jihadist filled war zones in the Middle East and North Africa have As the flood of refugees fleeing jihadist filled war zones in the Middle East and North Africa have poured into Europe over the past few years , Germany has served as the final destination for a substantial number of them According to According to Reuters , Germany witnessed an 8 5 percent increase in their migrant population in 2016 , placing the total number of residents in the country with an immigrant background at approximately 18 6 million people The Federal Statistics Office noted that roughly one fifth of the German population about 22 5 percent were either first or second generation migrants with one or less parents of Germanic heritage Advertisement story continues below To be sure , the majority of those To be sure , the majority of those migrants to Germany actually originated in other European nations and are descended from European heritage , but a significant minority of them particularly those who have come in the past few years have originated from the Middle East or Africa It is estimated that around 2 3 million people in Germany have familial links to the Middle East , a 51 percent increase since 2011 Similarly , the population of those whose families came from Africa stands at around 750 , 000 , a 46 percent increase since 2011 About 1 million of those migrants from the Middle East or Africa arrived in Germany as part of the wave of refugees in 2015 and 2016 Meanwhile , and potentially entirely unrelated the Meanwhile , and potentially entirely unrelated the U K Daily Mail just reported on a substantial rise in cases of bestiality within Germany over the same time period , so much so that animal brothels have actually become a thing Advertisement story continues below Yes , you read that correctly Yes , you read that correctly bestiality , also known as zoophilia , the practice of humans having sexual relations with animals , is a growing trend and lifestyle choice in the prominent central European nation A livestock protection and animal welfare officer named Madeleine Martin is now warning government officials that laws must be put in place to stop the rapid spread of these brothels that allow and encourage people to have sex with animals As an example of the growing trend , Martin pointed to a particular farmer with a flock of sheep who noticed that his animals had become increasingly skittish around people The farmer had surveillance cameras installed on his property , and lo and behold , caught several men entering his barn at night to engage sexually with his flock Advertisement story continues below Martin stressed that this was but one example of many similar cases she has compiled all across the country , and she wants the government to do something about it It is worth noting that bestiality was once illegal in Germany , but the law banning it was dropped from the books in 1969 There had been talk in 2016 of reinstating the ban , but Martin is done with mere talking and is demanding that changes be made to the national Animal Protection Code to do just that protect the animals from abuse by sexually deviant people The chairman of the agricultural committee , Hans Michael Goldman , said changes could be made in the laws to forbid the use of animals for individual sexual acts and to outlaw people pimping creatures to others for sexual use , which would effectively ban the animal brothels or erotic zoos , as some call them Advertisement story continues below Violation of the newly proposed ban would likely result in a fine equivalent to more than 30 , 000 for a first offense , increasing thereafter Of course , proponents of bestiality have vowed to fight any ban with legal challenges of their own , so we will have see how that plays out in court Please share this story on Facebook and Twitter to spread the word about the significant increase in bestiality and animal brothels in Germany occurring at the same time the country has seen a vast influx of migrants and refugees",false
"In response to a record breaking premiere weekend , the FBI has added the cast of Black Panther to its domestic terror organizations watch list It is our understanding that the cast of this film has raised over 235 million for their efforts to spread their black extremist message , said FBI director Christopher Wray That is not something that we can tolerate Sources report that A list celebrities Chadwick Boseman , Michael B Jordan and Lupita Nyong o have been added to the watch list , with little justification other than seeming suspicious It s an imperfect process , says one source within the FBI But if anything uses the words black and panther we re all over it Both members of the cast and members of the actual Black Panthers have expressed confusion at the maneuver I don t understand why I ve been put on a watch list , said Lupita Nyong o , who played Nakia It has nothing to do with the Black Panther Party Has anyone at the FBI even seen it \?

"I became a Republican sooner in my life than Ronald Reagan did in his Rick Perry on Tuesday , August 30th , 2011 in a radio interviewRick Perry says he switched to GOP at a younger age than Reagan didBy Meghan Ashford Grooms on Tuesday , September 6th , 2011 at 6 00 a m On his Aug 30 radio program , conservative commentator Sean Hannity noted that Texas Gov Rick Perry s years ago switch from the Democratic to the Republican party Puts him in the same company as the nation s 40th president You re sort of like Ronald Reagan , you feel the Democratic Party left you \? Hannity asked Perry replied that he d had a conversation with Reagan s son Michael , a political consultant and former radio host I told Michael Reagan the other day You know , I love your dad , and he was part of the reason I became a Republican , but I said , I became a Republican sooner in my life than your dad did Perry and Hannity shared a laugh over that But that light moment left unresolved how old each leader was when he made his D to R leap Did Perry beat Reagan to the flip point \? We ll take a look at Reagan first In March 2010 , PolitiFact Florida rated True the claim that Reagan was a Democrat before he was a Republican Historian Edward Yager , author of the 2006 biography Ronald Reagan s Journey Democrat to Republican , told PolitiFact Florida that Reagan , who was born Feb 6 , 1911 , was registered Democrat from the time that he voted for \( Democrat Franklin Roosevelt \) in 1932 , when he was 21 Yager said that he hadn t seen copies of Reagan s voter registration cards but that virtually all the sources that refer to Reagan s party affiliation indicate that he was registered as a Democrat Yager also noted that Reagan has two autobiographies in which he refers to his voting for \( Roosevelt \) four times and then for President Harry Truman , a Democrat , in 1948 Later , while still a Democrat , Reagan began supporting Republican presidential candidates Melissa Giller , director of communications and programs at Reagan s presidential library , told PolitiFact Florida that Reagan endorsed the presidential candidacies of Republican Dwight Eisenhower in 1952 and 1956 at ages 41 and 45 , respectively and Republican Richard Nixon in 1960 while remaining a Democrat Perry and other Republican presidential candidates are scheduled to debate at the Reagan library , in Simi Valley , Calif , on Sept 7 The library s website says Reagan registered as a Republican in the fall of 1962 , when he was 51 According to the site , a woman interrupted Reagan while he was speaking in favor of Nixon s unsuccessful gubernatorial bid in California to ask him whether he had yet to register as a Republican When he said , Well , no , I haven t yet , but I intend to , down the center aisle through the audience came a woman who declared , I m a registrar , and placed a registration card in front of him , the site says In front of his audience , Ronald Reagan officially joined the Republican Party In her 2010 email to PolitiFact Florida , Giller pointed to the famous Reagan quip that Hannity echoed on his show I did n't leave the Democratic Party The party left me ''Other studies of Reagan also trace his party switch to 1962 , including Yager s book and a 1982 Reagan biography by Lou Cannon , which says Reagan was an active Democrat in 1952 , when he married Nancy Davis , and would remain a registered Democrat for another decade In 1962 , Cannon writes , when Reagan was approached by California Republicans to help campaign on their behalf , he told them that he didn t want to be a professional Democrat campaigning for the Republicans and would re register as a Republican He did so , at a subsequent political meeting where he spoke on behalf of the ill fated Nixon campaign against Governor Edmund G \( Pat \) Brown , Cannon writes So , by several accounts , Reagan was 51 when he became a Republican , although he began backing GOP presidential candidates a decade earlier How old was Perry , born March 4 , 1950 , when he made his move \? We ve looked at Perry s political past in previous fact checks , reporting that Perry won his first election as a Democrat , taking a West Texas House district seat in 1984 , when Democrats controlled the Legislature and the state had had just one Republican governor since Reconstruction He won re election in 1986 and 1988 before switching parties in 1989 to challenge Democratic Agricultural Commissioner Jim Hightower in 1990 a race that Perry won in an upset The biography on Perry s presidential campaign website agrees with that account A July 14 Texas Tribune story says that during his years in the Texas House , Perry was far from liberal Perry , a young rancher and cotton farmer , gained an early reputation as a fiscal conservative , the story says He was one of a handful of freshman pit bulls , so named because they sat in the lower pit of the House Appropriations Committee , where they fought to keep spending low The Tribune story says Perry announced he was changing parties on Sept 29 , 1989 , during a press conference outside the Texas Capitol I intend to vote the same convictions , Perry said then , according to the Tribune The only difference is there will be an R beside my name On the day of the press conference , Perry was 39 years old We rate his statement as True Advertisement",true

"At some point , perhaps as early as next week , federal agents will sit down with Donald Trump and tell him classified information about the government and our foreign policy efforts For Democrats , this is a point of both anguish and political calculation Senate Minority Leader Harry M Reid has suggested that Trump 's murky ties to foreign interests and general inability to not speak his mind should be reason enough for the people briefing him to simply make things up On the Republican side , there are similar calls to ban Hillary Clinton from being briefed , including by Trump , pointing to her use of a personal email server while she served as secretary of state And here 's the thing If he wanted to , President Obama could deny either or both of them the now traditional briefings The process does n't work the way you might think For one thing , the briefings are not legally mandated They are a courtesy provided by the sitting president , nothing more In an email , historian Michael Beschloss explained that the process began with President Harry Truman In 1952 , as Truman was preparing to leave the White House , he ordered that the CIA brief Dwight Eisenhower and Adlai Stevenson so that they would campaign with greater insight and also know key national security players once elected \( A bigger problem , he notes , for Stevenson , a governor , than Eisenhower , who 'd commanded the Allied invasion of Normandy \) No president has to do it presidents a century ago did n't For another , the briefings are not an ongoing series of updates about everything affecting our foreign policy They are n't as regular or as detailed as the Presidential Daily Brief , for example It 's at most a couple of in person meetings between the candidate , a staffer and representatives of the American intelligence community Lanhee Chen , who worked as the chief policy adviser to Mitt Romney 's 2012 presidential campaign , spoke with The Washington Post by phone on Thursday Chen was the one staffer that attended Mitt Romney 's two briefings four years ago The former secretary of state , senator and first lady is the Democratic nominee for president Wait 1 second to continue The nominee has access to one , maybe two or three briefings upon request , but that 's it , Chen said Because it 's not like you have a ton of time to sit there and get briefed every day anyway The briefings have to take place in SCIFs sensitive compartmented information facilities or secure conferencing facilities that the government has , so it 's not like you can just get the briefing on the campaign bus , he said We had two briefings One was at the federal building in Los Angeles in September , and the second was a few weeks later at a secure facility in the Washington , D C , metro area That was it The number and content of those briefings are negotiated between the campaign and the White House A memorandum of understanding is drafted between the two parties to formalize the agreement , but Chen notes that the process was remarkably easy and cordial particularly given that the administration that was briefing Romney was also in the process of trying to defeat him electorally The briefings themselves Chen described as a sort of presentation followed by a question and answer period It is , as I understand it , the same team of briefers from the intelligence community that prepare the briefing for the candidate as those who do the president 's daily briefing , Chen said But the level of detail as well as the amount of information covered is not the same It is meant to be a background briefing more than anything else The information that 's presented is tailored to what the candidate would like to know as you might expect , there are no handouts It 's worth noting that , while these are the only formal briefings , there was information shared by the federal government with the Romney campaign outside of the scope of national security As Hurricane Sandy approached that fall , Chen said , the campaign was given emergency response information from the Federal Emergency Management Administration and the Department of Homeland Security Businessman Donald Trump officially became the Republican nominee at the party s convention in Cleveland Wait 1 second to continue In order to participate in the briefings , Chen had to complete paperwork to grant him top secret security clearance , which he held through the end of the campaign Romney did n't , Chen said The assumption is that a certain amount of sensitive information can be shared with the nominee because the nominee has been publicly vetted , Chen said Both GOP vice presidential nominee Rep Paul D Ryan and Romney had held or did hold security clearance \( Romney 's stemming from his time managing the 2002 Winter Olympics \) , but if they had n't like Trump they would not have had to submit the same documentation The information we received was obviously classified , he said , but I do n't believe that that information was of the same scope and specificity that the president or vice president or other national security leaders get once they 're actually in office He also indicated that the people conducting the briefing were more than capable of understanding what sorts of boundaries to information sharing should n't and would n't be crossed For those worried about a candidate getting access to information and then using it in the campaign , it has happened or so Richard Nixon believed Beschloss related a story about the 1960 election , pitting John F Kennedy against Nixon , who was then serving as vice president to Eisenhower , known colloquially as Ike In 1960 , Ike had JFK briefed by CIA Director Allen Dulles That fall , JFK publicly called for US backed freedom fighters to invade Castro s Cuba Nixon was furious , presuming that Dulles had told JFK about the CIA backed invasion then being planned \( the record is unclear about what exactly Dulles told JFK about this \) , and that JFK had gone ahead and publicly called for something he knew the CIA was secretly planning Nixon said in his book Six Crises that , to protect the operation s secrecy , he felt compelled in his TV debates against JFK to denounce the idea of such an invasion , which he did handing JFK the potent Cuba issue , so he felt Also Nixon was angry at Dulles for not using his briefing of JFK to definitively knock down the idea of a Missile Gap notion that USSR was soaring ahead of US in missiles leaving JFK free to use this important issue in the campaign Nixon felt that Dulles did so deliberately in order to cultivate JFK and get reappointed to the CIA , which he was It left Nixon forever suspicious of the CIA and its ability to foil him politically \( a refrain you can hear on the Nixon tapes when he was President \) Chen does n't figure that concerns about either of the current nominees potentially using information to their advantage \( or letting something slip \) will cause the Obama administration to avoid briefing a candidate or skip the briefings entirely He notes that what is disclosed is up to the administration , and how it is disclosed is up to people briefing the candidates who are well aware of the risks of sharing information and how to nuance what 's said But he also notes that the process of national security briefings is a small part of what makes presidential transitions smooth and conflict free There is a lot of discretion , comity and professional courtesy involved in how it all works But it did all work , he said It sort of gave me even more faith in the nature of our democratic system , Chen said , that there could be this kind of information sharing and civil dialogue , even in the heat of a very , very difficult campaign Or put another way The briefings are a well controlled feature to our democracy , not a bug",false
"4 13 18 , Maine First Media Staff Report , It was a feel good vote that I suppose will make it appear that they voted to ban FGM they did not Those are the words of Republican Rep Karen Gerrish of Lebanon Rep Gerrish was reacting to news out of the Coliseum on the Kennebec that the Maine State House passed a ban Thursday on Female Genital Mutilation in the Pine Tree State However , the bill passed in the House was nothing more than political theater a show bill On Wednesday , the State Senate unanimously passed LD 1904 , the strict FGM ban holding the mutilator , consenting parents guardians and the transporters accountable for this barbaric form of child abuse That is not the bill the House passed First , the House brought forward one of the two minority reports from the Criminal Justice and Public Safety Committee that the bill ought not to pass And the motion almost prevailed In fact , 65 swamp creatures entirely made up of Democrats and independents voted AGAINST banning FGM Unfortunately , I am not surprised at all , said Rep Gerrish , the ranking Republican on the CJPS Committee What did surprise me was the unanimous support in the Senate , and I thank them for understanding the seriousness of the issue I did find it remarkable that 65 House members , primarily Democrats , supported the ought not to pass motion I expected some to back that motion , but much less I expected maybe 25 or so of the far Left liberal Democrats to support killing the bill outright But 65 , wow Failing to kill the bill outright , Democrat leadership next brought forward the second of the minority report from the CJPS Committee This one being the controversial amended bill , removing penalties for all accomplices to the crime In addition , the bill was further amended to remove the word mutilation , from the definition of this so called Female Genital Mutilation ban The watered down , feckless ban passed with mostly party line support , in a 73 68 tally Not a single Republican voted for the toothless version of the ban Now the bill heads back to the Senate , where Senators will decide if they want to stick to the bill they passed unanimously , or accept the toothless House version Multiple sources at the Capitol tell Maine First Media they expect the Senate to insist on their own version of the bill The proposed ban would then go back to the House for one last chance to come to an agreement However , there is little optimism that will happen Ultimately , I believe it will die between the two bodies in non concurrence , Rep Gerrish said It s a very sad state of affairs for young immigrant girls in Maine Votes like this have consequences November should be interesting Republican Rep Heather Sirocki who has been the leading champion fighting for a ban on Female Genital Mutilation was the first to bring to Maine First Media s attention Thursday morning that our neighbors in New Hampshire had joined the ranks of states banning this brutal form of ritual child abuse New Hampshire passed strong anti FGM legislation this morning , Rep Sirocki said This is a huge victory as it s the 27th state to step forward Unfortunately , it s not looking like Maine will be the 28th To fully understand why the ban is next to meaningless without holding accomplices accountable , we recommend you read Rep Sirocki s explanation in this previous Maine First Media article If you re having a difficult time comprehending how any legislators could be against banning Female Genital Mutilation , the opposition has made their reasoning very clear They fear offending the immigrant community and being labeled racist Female Genital Mutilation is the ritual cutting or removal of some or all of the external female genitalia In some cultures , the vulva is sewn shut , only to be ripped open on the woman s wedding night The practice is designed to curb sexual desire in women Along with significant health risk to the young girls , women who suffer Female Genital Mutilation are left with life long physical and emotional scarring To learn more about the horrific abuse , listen to FGM survivor , F A Cole s testimony in front of the CJPS Committee Cole fights through a panic attack to share her story with Maine Legislators in the hope it would save young daughters of Maine immigrants from suffering through the same terrifying experience",false

"Flickr dallashabitatphotos \( CC BY NC ND 2 0 \) The nation is mourning the loss of five Dallas police officers after a shooting Thursday night Police departments across the country , and especially across Texas , have been reeling from last week s police shooting in Dallas mourning officers lost , but also operating on a heightened sense of alert For many departments , this sense of alert means more officers on the streets , more tactical units on standby , and new questions about how police interact with the public Charley Wilkison , executive director of the Combined Law Enforcement Associations of Texas , says that officers are feeling the effects of recent events Of course , there s an acknowledgement and sorrow , and the realization of what s occurred , Wilkison says , and then this grim determination and commitment to soldier on to do what they ve been called to do He says that officers have to face a reality check in the wake of events like last week s shooting There s a heightened sense of reality Because the fear part , of course , officers are trained to deal with that , Wilkison says Texas has lost the most law enforcement officers in the line of duty in each state in America , and so that s absolutely something they aware of coming into the job Texas will be sending 150 officers to assist with security at the upcoming Republican National Convention in Cleveland , Ohio Wilkinson says that he s concerned for the safety of those officers , given the climate surrounding Donald Trump s campaign I m fearful that something will happen to them , especially with some of the political circumstances surrounding Donald Trump s candidacy , Wilkison says It seems to be very heated , and in very heated moments where people are clashing , and physical confrontations that we ve all seen , I m worried about those officers Listen to the full interview in the audio player above Post by Alexandra Hart Cancel replyNO MATTER WHERE YOU ARE , YOU RE ON TEXAS STANDARD TIME 2014 Texas Standard A service of the Moody College of Communication at the University of Texas at Austin",true
"Kuwaiti newspaper A Jarida reported Friday that US President Barack Obama seeks to be appointed UN secretary general after his second term as US president ends The newspaper claimed that Obama has been discussing the idea with senior Democrats and Republicans , some of whom are Jewish The report , which admittedly appears somewhat far fetched , has not been confirmed by any other news outlets and does not name any of its sources It adds that Prime Minister Binyamin Netanyahu has learned of Obama 's aspirations and that he is opposing them , supposedly telling people he spoke to Is it not enough that we have had to live through eight years of Obama 's rule , in which he ignored Israel \? Now he wants to be in a position to cause us difficulty in the international arenas \? The newspaper cites what it says are sources close to Netanyahu as allegedly saying that Obama is the worst president for Israel , the Middle East and Israel 's allies the moderate Arab states A Netanyahu confidant reportedly said that Netanyahu intends to scuttle the Obama project of being appointed UN Secretary General , and noted that Obama 's term in office has been characterized by a closeness to the Muslim Brotherhood , the toppling of Hosni Mubarak 's regime in Egypt , and attempts to forge alliances with political Islam A Jarida further quoted the Israeli source as saying that Obama 's term is ending with an alliance being struck with Iran , and an agreement about its nuclear program that will eventually lead to a scenario similar to what is going on in North Korea Israel will not allow this , he added , and will take the required steps to prevent Iran from manufacturing nuclear weapons , secretly or in public",false
"Morgan Freeman 'Jailing Hillary Clinton Only Way to Take Down the Elite' Hollywood actor speaks out urging President Trump to 'restore public faith in justice' NeonNettle By Jay Greenberg on 30th October 2017 10 26am press Morgan Freeman says Trump must jail Hillary Clinton to restore justice in the US Hollywood actor Morgan Freeman has spoken out urging Donald Trump to jail Hillary Clinton , saying it 's the only way to end corruption amongst the American elites and restore the public 's faith in real justice The movie star warned that the people are losing faith in government when they see the former First Lady 's crimes going unpunished , saying It 's clear to most people that there are laws for those with money and power and other laws for the rest of us If President Trump wants to restore public faith in government institutions and true justice , then he needs to start by jailing Hillary Clinton and anyone else who thinks the US Constitution is nothing more than list of suggestions While in New York promoting National Geographic s new documentary series The Story of Us Morgan Freeman said Hillary Clinton belongs in prison for the crimes she has committed She has abused her position for too long to make millions for herself and her cronies , all at the expense of the American people President Trump needs to act now to send out a clear message that no one , and I mean no one , is above the law in the United States of America , and he needs to do that by sending her to jail for her unlawful deeds When asked why he thinks Donald Trump has n't fulfilled his campaign promise to lock her up , Freeman tipped his head back to look up to the sky , with his hands held out , palms facing upward , and after a short pause said Goddamnit man ! The woman 's committed high treason ! Lock her up ! A reporter pointed out to Mr Freeman that high treason carries the death penalty in the US , to which he replied , so be it , in his trademark calming tone Responding to an accusation that his comments could be considered politically incorrect , the Shawshank Redemption star casually quipped I like to think of it as 'perfectly incorrect' He then laughed and said , it 's all caring and being too afraid to speak your mind these days , is n't it \? Even when it comes to the bad guys We as a society need to start loving and caring for each other so we can unite and put that woman behind bars where she belongs The veteran actor , who remains as professionally active as at any point in his long career , cannot be accused of partisan bullying It appears the 80 year old star is merely a straight shooter who would prefer politicians and public figures to be held to the same standards as everybody else In September the Deep Impact star appeared in a viral video demanding Donald Trump address the American people to speak directly about the extent of Russia s interference in the 2016 presidential election While insisting that the Kremlin s election meddling is no movie script , and that he did n't know whether those allegations were true or not , Freeman said , we need our president to speak directly to us and tell us the truth We need him to sit behind the desk in the Oval Office and say , My fellow Americans During this past election , we came under attack by the Russian government , 'I ve called on Congress and our intelligence community to use every resource available to conduct a thorough investigation to determine exactly how this happened '",false

"1 5kSHARESSHARE THIS STORY President Donald Trumps policies mark a new era of human rights regression , the head of Amnesty International announced in Washington , D C this morning , where the non profit group that tracks the state of human rights in the world released its annual report Salil Sheety , who has been the groups Secretary General since 2010 , accused Trump of hateful politics and being a threat to human rights across the globe President Trump takes actions that violate human rights at home and abroad , the group reports He put Trump in the same group as the barbaric leaders of Egypt , the Philippines , Venezuela , Russia and China who Sheety said , are callously undermining the rights of millions Donald Trumps politics may have marked a new era of human rights regression but they are not unique , said Shetty The specters of hatred and fear now loom large in world affairs , he continued , and we have few governments standing up for human rights in these disturbing times Add your name to millions demanding Congress take action on the Presidents crimes IMPEACH TRUMP PENCE ! Along with Trumps treatment of womens rights , LGBTQ rights and his politics that were discriminatory or otherwise contradicted international human rights principles , Shetty singled out Trumps travel bans aimed at Muslim majority countries as a transparently hateful move Shetty added that the bans , some which have survived court challenges , set the scene for a year in which leaders took the politics of hate to its most dangerous conclusion The report also cites Trumps views on immigration and immigrants as examples of these hateful new policies Those include his plan to build a wall along the US Mexico border , increased detention of asylum seekers and their families , increased immigration and customs enforcement , penalties against sanctuary cities and prioritized deportation of migrants The report also sheds light on human rights abuses such as the termination of the Central American Minors program last August , which had allowed those under 21 to flee violence in Central America if their parents already had achieved legal status in the U S It notes that more than 17 , 000 unaccompanied children and 26 , 000 people who were caught illegally enting the U S at the Mexican border between January and August were detained for months , many without proper access to medical care and legal counsel The report notes that since September the Trump administration has worked to end the Deferred Action for Childhood Arrivals \( DACA \) program , placing 800 , 000 individuals brought to the U S as children at risk of being deported Trump then worked to stop the passage of the Dream Act to allow those who had DACA status to meet requirements to maintain their eligibility and get full legal status The report also cites Trumps efforts against womens rights which it reports were broad and multi faceted President Trumps administration , continues the report , overturned politics that required universities to investigate sexual violence as gender discrimination and suspended equal pay initiatives that had helped women identify whether they were being paid less than male colleagues Attacks on womens reproductive rights were particularly virulent , states the report That includes attacks on funding for Planned Parenthood , a government issued rules exempting employers from promotion health insurance coverage for contraception , and the introduction of the global gag rule which prohibits financial assistance to any hospital or organization that provides information about safe , legal abortions The rights of gay people were also reduced , marginalized or eliminated in many cases under Trump The report , in particular , cites the marginalization of transgender people , including the elimination of guidelines that protected them in school , gave them access to public facilities and Trumps effort to ban them from the military The group also raises a red flag about Trumps treatment of both domestic and foreign nationals accused of terrorism crimes , charging that the president flouted the presumption of innocence in a series of posts on Twitter in which he called for the death penalty Trump also ended impunity for the systematic human rights violations of detainees at the prison in Guantanamo and elsewhere , and opened the door to a renewal of torture methods that had been banned under President Obama and the renewal of secret detention programs by the CIA The report also points out that programs to stop mistreatment of minorities in the U S were rolled back , as the number of killings by law enforcement rose African Americans who comprised 13 percent of the population represented nearly 23 percent of victims in 2017 , states the report The mistreatment of the mentally ill , the use of non lethal weapons by police that turns out to actually be very lethal and the rise in gun violence and mass murders are all detailed in the new report , while funding for government studies of how to deal with gun violence was lowed or killed off The use of the death penalty also rose in the U S under Trump , with more states executing prisoners than had happened in years During the year , notes the report , four inmates were exonerated of the crimes for which they were originally sentenced to death in the states of Delaware , Florida , Arkansas , and Louisiana , bringing to 160 the number of such cases since 1973 , The report criticizes what it termed the feeble response by world leaders like Trump to human rights issues , and what it called the willingness to tout fake news in order to manipulate public opinion This was also the year that Trump changed Americas foreign policy to eliminate human rights as a factor in relationships with other countries In fact , we saw Trump embrace , meet with and praise many dictators and authoritarians who abused the democratic system to stay in power while damaging relationships with longtime allies who are true democracies and do work to provide human rights to all Through changes in trade politics , refusal to keep commitments to address the global climate crisis and in other ways , Trump embraced big business at the expense of individual citizens This 400 page report from Amnesty International details much of this horror story , which unfortunately continues to grow worse by the day , week , month and year under Trump Add your name to millions

"Oakland University using hockey pucks to protect against active shooters To prepare for an active shooter , faculty and students at Oakland University are arming themselves with hockey pucks The idea of using the quirky self defense tool grew out of a training session Police Chief Mark Gordon led in March for faculty members on what they should do if a gunman enters their classroom A participant asked what people could bring to campus to be better prepared in case they need to fight back The university has a no weapons policy Gordon 's advice \? Be ready to throw something anything that could distract a shooter , even a hockey puck , as a last resort if fleeing or hiding are n't an option It was just kind of a spur of the moment idea that seemed to have some merit to it and it kind of caught on , Gordon said Following up on the suggestion , Tom Discenna , a professor of communication and president of the faculty union , spearheaded an effort by the union to purchase 2 , 500 , 94 cent hockey pucks 800 for union members and another 1 , 700 for students Distribution of the pucks on campus began earlier this month It s just the idea of having something , a reminder that you re not powerless and you re not helpless in the classroom , Discenna said The little black discs have a dual purpose They are also part of a campaign to raise funds to install interior locks on classroom doors Some doors are only lockable from the hallway The pucks are imprinted with a number that people can enter on the university 's website to donate money toward the new locks We know locking the classroom , in and of itself , is a big deterrent to a shooter being able to enter the room , Gordon said The American Association of University Professors union has donated 5 , 000 toward new inside locks for the 37 classrooms in South Foundation Hall The student government , Oakland University Student Congress , has made a donation in the same amount for new locks in an as yet to be determined building The student congress also recently ordered 1 , 000 hockey pucks that it intends to distribute to students Gordon said the 2007 shootings at Virginia Tech inspired Oakland University 's efforts to help students , faculty and staff prepare for a possible active shooter and how to defend themselves At Virginia Tech , a 23 year old student went on a shooting spree that left 32 people dead before he killed himself Gordon said his experience as a youth hockey coach he once got hit in the head with a puck gave him the idea that pucks could be a possible self defense tool He said there are no studies or research on using pucks in active shooter situations They are simply part of a defense posture , he said , such as throwing a stapler , a laptop , or anything that has weight and could hurt and distract a shooter so he or she could be disarmed Anything that you can throw that s heavy and will cause damage , cause injury is the bottom line of what you re trying to do , he said \( A hockey puck \) was just a thing that was suggested that could possibly work , especially when you have 20 or 30 people in a classroom and they all throw hockey pucks at the same time , it would be quite the distraction Gordon stressed that the university 's active shooter training sessions , which are held several times a year , focus on fleeing first and then , if that 's not possible , hiding Fighting back by throwing a hockey puck or through other means should be an absolute last strategy Student body vice president Brittany Kleinschmidt , a junior , said the pucks are raising awareness about the need for the new door locks and generating a lot of buzz on campus It gets people talking , she said More Divers in Lake Huron find 1927 Chevrolet Coupe in ship wreckage More 100M lawsuit dismissed in death of Marine recruit Raheel Siddiqui Contact staff writer Ann Zaniewski at 313 222 6594 or azaniewski freepress com Follow her on Twitter AnnZaniewski",true

One has to wonder Who among them bullied Nikolas Cruz \? Gonz lez admits to it What about David Hogg \? Or Cameron Kasky \? Or the rest on that Time magazine cover that blares the caption Enough Kasky has played an important role in the protest , Kasky has played an important role in the protest , writing this at CNN We can t ignore the issues of gun control that this tragedy raises And so , I m asking no , demanding we take action now Why \? Because at the end of the day , the students at my school felt one shared experience our politicians abandoned us by failing to keep guns out of schools But this time , my classmates and I are going to hold them to account This time we are going to pressure them to take action This time we are going to force them to spend more energy protecting human lives than unborn fetuses Well aside from the appalling notion part of the left wing canon that unborn babies are not human lives , note that Kamsky and doubtless his friends are intent on holding other people to account Politicians But nowhere are they saying that maybe , just maybe , they need to have a good long look in the nearest mirror and ask themselves what 11th grader Alvarez is asking Which is could they have done more \? Were any of them as Emma Gonz lez admits participating in the ostracizing of Nikolas Cruz \? Were any of these kids in any way bullying Cruz \? All too often Americans see stories where some bullied kid feels so set upon by his or her peers that they commit suicide Nikolas Cruz effectively committed suicide , by killing seventeen people , most of them students peers He will face the death penalty and one would think he will get it But the problem undiscussed at this rally the other day was the responsibility of Cruz s peers themselves in not taking the STOMP Out Bullying message into their own hearts and practice Instead , as Emma Gonz lez freely admits , they did exactly what so many celebrities like Debra Messing and others say they are so passionate about They bullied a kid , taunted him Because , like , you know , he deserved it He was so weird The really sad part is that this was just another day in high school , where since forever the popular kids sneer at the geeks , the nerds , and the weirdos But in this case , when something terrible happened , the kids blamed the politicians for their troubles And no adult blinked",false

Plant Shocks World By Sorcha Faal , and as reported to her Western Subscribers An ominous edict issued from the Office of the President of Russia today to all Ministries of the Russian Government ordering that all past , present and future information relating to Japan s Fukushima Daiichi nuclear disaster now be rated at the highest classification level Of Special Importance states that this condition is immediately and urgently needed due to a series of underground nuclear explosions occurring at this crippled atomic plant on 31 December as confirmed by the Ministry of Defense \( MoD \) Of Special Importance is Russia s highest classification level and refers to information which , if released , would cause damage to the entire Russian Federation The Fukushima Daiichi nuclear disaster was a catastrophic failure at the Fukushima I Nuclear Power Plant on 11 March 2011 The failure occurred when the plant was hit by a tsunami triggered by the 9 0 magnitude T hoku earthquake The plant began releasing substantial amounts of radioactive materials beginning on 12 March 2011 becoming the largest nuclear incident since the 1986 Chernobyl disaster and the second \( with Chernobyl \) to measure at the highest Level 7 on the International Nuclear Event Scale \( INES \) According to this report , MoD assests associated with the Red Banner Pacific Fleet detected two low level underground atomic explosions occurring in the Fukushima disaster zone on 31 December , the first measuring 5 1 magnitude in intensity , followed by a smaller 3 6 magnitude explosion moments later The MoD further reports that the 5 1 magnitude event corresponds to the energy equivalent in megatons of TNT of 0 0005 , while the 3 6 magnitude event equals 0 0000005 As a comparison , the MoD states that the atomic bomb dropped on Hiroshima in 1945 by the United States released the equivalent of 16 Kilotons 0 016 megatons of TNT , about the energy equivalent of a magnitude 6 earthquake , and the largest hydrogen bomb ever detonated was the Tsar bomb , a device exploded by the Soviet Union on 30 October 1961 , with an energy equivalent of about 50 megatons of TNT Important to note , this report continues , was that the architect of Fukushima Daiichi Reactor 3 , Uehara Haruo , warned on 17 November 2011 warned that a China Syndrome \( aka Hydrovolcanic Explosion \) was inevitable due to the melted atomic fuel that had escaped the container vessel and was now burning through the earth The MoD further reports that evidence that these underground nuclear explosions were about to occur began after mysterious steam plumes were first spotted on 19 December for a short period of time , then again on 24 , 25 , 27 December , and confirmed by a report Tokyo Electric Power Company \( TEPCO \) published on its website Most curious to note , this report continues , is that the United States appears to have had a more advanced notice of these underground nuclear explosions as evidenced by their purchase earlier this month \( 6 December \) of 14 million doses of potassium iodide , the compound that protects the body from radioactive poisoning in the aftermath of severe nuclear accidents , to be delivered before the beginning of February 2014 With experts now estimating that the wave of radiation from Fukushima will be 10 times bigger than all of the radiation from the entire world s nuclear tests throughout history combined , and with new reports stating that dangerous radiation levels have been detected in snows found in Texas , Colorado and Missouri , this MoD report warns the US , indeed , is going to face the severest consequences of this historic , and seemingly unstoppable , nuclear disaster And not just to human beings either is this nuclear disaster unfolding either , this report grimly warns , but also to all biological systems as new reports coming from the United States western coastal areas are now detailing the mass deaths of seals , sea lions , polar bears , bald eagles , sea stars , turtles , king and sockeye salmon , herring , anchovies , and sardines due to Fukishima radiation As to the American people being allowed to know the full and horrific mass death event now unfolding around them , this report warns , is not be as the Obama regime has , in effect , ordered all of their mainstream news media organs not to report it , and as recently confirmed by former MSNBC host Cenk Uygur who was told not to warn the public about the danger posed by the meltdown at the Fukushima nuclear plant during his time as a host on the cable network And with Russian experts now warning that as Fukushima pollution spreads all over Earth \( as large amounts of fish , seaweeds , and everything in ocean has been already been polluted , and these products are the main danger for mankind as they can end up being eaten by people on a massive scale \) this report warns that Putin s order to classify all information relating to this nuclear mass death event Of Special Importance is vital to protect the economic and social stability interests of the Russian Federation as this global catastrophe continues to worsen by the

Virginia Gov Terry McAuliffe will no longer have to answer questions about his potential role in a Clinton administration And U S Rep Robert C Bobby Scott and a handful of Republican hopefuls can shelve their battle plans for a special election to fill Kaines seat As Donald Trumps stunning victory over Hillary Clinton rocks national politics , few states are feeling the consequences as swiftly as Virginia Kaines failure to ascend to the vice presidency simplifies Virginias electoral calendar , but Trumps win shook up the 2017 governors race thats already underway Corey Stewart , a 2017 GOP gubernatorial hopeful who served as chairman of Trumps Virginia campaign for almost a year but was fired last month for aggressively protesting the Republican National Committee , declared in an interview that Trumps victory propels him to frontrunner status for the GOP nomination He attacked Republican rival Ed Gillespie , an early leader in gubernatorial fundraising and endorsements , as being insufficiently loyal to the president elect Ed Gillespie treated Donald Trump like he had typhoid , Stewart said He would not appear with him on stage He would not mention his name unless he was condemning him A former Republican National Committee chairman , Gillespie has kept his distance from Trump while voicing support for the GOP ticket He introduced Indiana Gov Mike Pence , Trumps running mate , at two rallies , but was noticeably absent from the Trump campaigns Virginia leadership committee that included the other two Republican gubernatorial candidates , Rep Robert J Wittman , R 1st , and state Sen Frank W Wagner , R Virginia Beach In a statement , Chris Leavitt , executive director of Gillespies political action committee , said Gillespies support for the Trump Pence ticket was clear from the beginning Nows the time to bring our country and party together , but once again Corey is putting his personal political ambitions first , Leavitt said And if he wants to anoint himself , thats fine We see how well Hillary Clintons coronation went With no U S Senate vacancy for McAuliffe to fill , the governors race will unfold without the added drama of a special election for Kaines seat McAuliffes pick would have had to defend the seat in a special election next year and again in 2018 when it comes up for its regularly scheduled election Scott , D 3rd , was widely seen as the favorite to get the nod from McAuliffe , who declined to publicly discuss Senate prospects until after Election Day Wittman was rumored to be considering switching to run for Kaines Senate seat if it came open A spokesman said Wednesday that his plans for 2017 remain the same , adding that Wittman is thrilled to be a part of the chance that Republican victories in the House , Senate and White House represent Wittman was easily re elected to his congressional seat Tuesday With the Senate seat now a moot point for next year , all eyes will be on the governors race Virginias race is expected to draw national interest as one of only two gubernatorial races along with New Jerseys scheduled for what will be Trumps first year as president Though Clinton lost nationally , she won Virginia by roughly 5 points , continuing the streak of statewide wins for Democrats She ran up large margins in the key counties of Fairfax , Loudoun , Prince William and Henrico , a sign that Democrats hold demographic advantages that Republicans have struggled to overcome in state races The Republican candidate for governor who is selected in a June primary will face Democratic Lt Gov Ralph S Northam Democrats have sought to link the four Republican candidates to Trump The Democratic Party of Virginia launched a website late last month intended to hold Republican gubernatorial candidates accountable for supporting and enabling the most dangerous candidate to ever be nominated by a major party But instead of Trump serving as a past embarrassment for Republicans looking to move on , Trump will have taken up residence across the Potomac as Virginians choose a new leader In a statement , Northam congratulated Trump and said he was disappointed in the result but proud of Clinton and Kaine We will continue to advocate for our values like defending womens access to reproductive health care and equality while building on our economic progress by focusing on workforce development , attracting new industries and promoting our quality of life , Northam said Stewart , a Prince William supervisor , said he hopes to implement the Trump agenda on a state level by cracking down on illegal immigration , replacing the Affordable Care Act and scrapping regulations on businesses But Stewarts decision to take part in a protest outside the RNCs headquarters in Washington seems to have burned bridges with the Trump campaign Mike Rubino , the Trump campaigns Virginia state director , said Stewart acted like a petulant child and hurt Trumps chances by dividing the party He constantly pitted people against each other , Rubino said He was actively running for governor on my bosss coattails while my boss was seeking the highest office in the land That , to me , is disloyalty Stewart called his alliance with Trump a Hail Mary pass thats now paying off Ive embraced Trump and defended him when other people wouldnt , Stewart said And I believe that loyalty

"reddit Upvote Downvotesubmit 0 0 Like The Patheos blog recently published an item titled Mike Pence Condoms Are Too Modern reporting that the Indiana governor and Republican vice presidential nominee had dismissed the prophylactic devices as too modern and too liberal Donald Trump s running mate is a dangerous Christian extremist who wants creationism taught in public schools and believes the government should pay for gay conversion therapy In addition , in 2015 , as Governor of Indiana , Pence allowed an HIV outbreak to spread , choosing prayer over a clean needle exchange But perhaps one of the most idiotic claims made by Pence is that condoms are too modern , too liberal , and offer a poor defense against sexually transmitted infections and diseases , the item reads Asking him to comment on his alleged statement , Pence was interviewed by The Huffington Post He initially invoked the old my words were twisted by the evil members of the media excuse , but subsequently succumbed to being honest He ultimately argued that he might have used the said terminology , but that it wasn t intentional You know how it is , you re interviewed about a topic that s close to your heart , and you become emotional and then you slightly start to lose control over what you say and the words somehow come out of your mouth before you actually think them through I can t recall what words I used exactly , but I do remember I was aggravated , he said The aggravation he referred to and the comments Pence \( then a Congressman \) actually made in this regard stemmed from a February 2002 CNN panel discussion about abstinence education Anchor Wolf Blitzer opened the segment by explaining a current controversy over remarks made by Secretary of State Colin Powell , who had just appeared on MTV and was asked about the Pope s stance on condom usage by Catholics You know , the thing that got me riled up back then , and even does right now , Pence recalled , is the fact that Christian youth gets so easily accustomed to using condoms at a very young age And you know , statistics show , even the manufacturers agree , that they re just not 100 safe , they re something like 97 or 98 That s not what we want for our kids , is it \? I mean , at the end of the day , what condoms actually do is they give our kids a false sense of security , they re actually tricking them into thinking they re having safe sex , when in fact , very often , those intercourses result in unwanted teen pregnancies And the reason why that s happening is because condoms are designed to be hip , to be modern , to be practical and what not , and the truth is that that s a lie The only way to stay safe from premature pregnancy and sexually transmitted diseases is to practice abstinence and pray to God , that s the only real way to stay safe , Pence argued At the end of the day , it s the unjustified trust in condoms that plays a huge part in abortion rates going through the roof He continued , Because , let s look at it this way the teenagers of today are nothing like teenagers back in my day Today everything seems to be revolving around sex And if they re having sex at least 100 times a month , for example , that means that two or three times out of those 100 could potentially result in an STD or pregnancy , which is to say , abortion If you want to risk ruining your life before it s even started , go ahead , gamble with condoms But I say we need to ban them and make the right decision for those who clearly aren t capable of making it themselves What we don t need are condoms that are unsafe what we DO need are smarter kids , apparently , he concluded",false

"After breaking the story of the Portsmouth school district Smartie snorting memo , harddeadlines reached out to the doctor who was quoted , Dr Oren Friedman , Associate Professor , Otorhinolaryngology at the University of Pennsylvania We asked if he had specifically studied Smartie snorting and if he could comment on the incidence and prevalence of Smarties related maggot infestation Here 's his unedited reply We did not do a study on this in particular however we often see patients with foreign materials in their noses which can cause a variety of problems even years after the insult occurs I recently removed an oyster shell from a 27 year old woman who had no idea it had been there when I showed her what was in her nose , she said I'm going to kill them she remembered that when she was 5 or 6 years old , her older brothers were playing with these shells when they were at the beach , and she believed they inserted it into her nose when she was asleep Just a funny anecdote that relates to the fact that things placed in the nose can remain there for years and cause problems over the long term The sugar in smarties can irritate the nose acutely and over the long term In addition to the local irritation from the foreign material and powder , over time , the smarties can lead to various overgrowth of bugs including viruses fungi bacteria The quote regarding the maggots relates to the fact that when a foreign material , and especially a food , resides in the nose for a long period of time , infections may occur , worms may reside in the nose , even maggots may flourish in this environment and we have encountered such a problem in the past Hopefully the thought of possible maggots in the nose will help dissuade children from snorting the smarties When asked in a followup if he had actually ever seen Smarties cause maggots , he replied , just a possibility i have seen maggots in the nose from other food products in general So , the one actual quoted source in the memo sent to parents describes the threat as only a possibility There 's no way to verify the claims about respiratory arrest , laryngospasm , or leading to drugs I m not questioning that this may be something that kids have tried one source told me kids had been seen doing it on Tuesday But I m shocked at the sloppy , loopy , cut and paste content of the message that PMS sent home Parents deserve better communication from those responsible for their children For pickup in other media , see Portsmouth Patch , EastBayRI , The Newport Buzz , TurnTo10 com , ABC6 com Update And BoingBoing Updates , 1 21 More pickup BoingBoing again , Gawker , Washington Post , Daily Mail \( UK \) , HuffPo \( UK \) , CBS News",false
"Editor Note The legal argument for the removal of Pelosi is about halfway into the article The petition can be found at the end Make sure to pass this around if it hits home with you America , we have a problem There is someone who needs to be impeached , fired , and removed from office There is a very particular leader in our country that is refusing to do the job that she was elected by the American people to do Not only is she refusing to do her job , her policies are dangerous for LEO s and treasonous to America We can no longer sit idly by and be abused by this woman and her selfish ideas of how she thinks America should be Friday President Trump announced that he would be signing a temporary deal that would fund our federal government until February 15 , 2019 in order to make sure federal government employees would get paid The big surprise was that this temporary deal came without any money funding the border wall , which has been the catalyst in the stand off between Trump and the Nancy Pelosi led Democrats After President Trump s announcement came a fury of feelings from both sides of the aisle What ensued was based off of President Trump declaring that if there is no deal reached by February 15th , he would be declaring a national emergency to fund the wall and Nancy Pelosi leading a braggadocious celebration that she had defeated Trump Social media exploded with reactions to the surprising move But many people that were most impacted by this temporary deal were Law Enforcement Officers The real issue at hand is which side , Trump or Pelosi , really has LEO s best interest at heart , and American s best interest at heart \? Who was willing to give in on what they were demanding in order to re open the government so that the 800 , 000 federal workers who were not getting paid could receive their paychecks \? I m going to argue in favor of President Trump and explain why Nancy Pelosi is not only a traitor to LEO s , she is a traitor to the American people Let s look at the numbers These are the estimates from the Senate Appropriations Committee on the number of LEO s that were not getting paid while the government was shut down Law enforcement More than 41 , 000 federal law enforcement and correctional officers were not getting paid , including 2 , 614 Bureau of Alcohol , Tobacco , Firearms and Explosives \( ATF \) agents 16 , 742 Bureau of Prisons correctional officers 13 , 709 FBI agents 3 , 600 Deputy U S Marshals 4 , 399 Drug Enforcement Administration \( DEA \) agents Homeland security Up to 88 percent of Department of Homeland Security employees were not getting paid , including 53 , 000 TSA employees 54 , 000 Customs and Border Protection agents and customs officers 42 , 000 Coast Guard employees President Trump s decision to sign a temporary deal to re open the government , without the funding for the border wall , shows how much compassion he feels towards these federal employees Nancy Pelosi , Chuck Schumer , and the Democrats complete unwillingness to negotiate over the past 35 days shows they don t care at all about people not getting paid to do their jobs while they work After all , Pelosi , Schumer and all of Congress received their paychecks the entire time the government was shut down Remember President Trump works for free because he donates every one of his Presidential paychecks , so his motivation was not related to money Worse than not caring about LEO s getting paid , Nancy Pelosi also votes and passes laws that are dangerous to our security and dangerous to the lives of LEO s Nancy Pelosi s Sanctuary Policies that provide aid , comfort , and protection to illegal aliens make it extremely difficult for LEO s to preform their jobs , which they took an oath and swore to uphold and enforce the laws of this land For example , in March , Nancy Pelosi , who accused the Trump administration and ICE agents of carrying out cowardly attacks on illegal immigrants , issued the statement after the Justice Department filed a lawsuit against California , claiming three recently passed state laws are deliberately interfering with federal immigration enforcement Nancy Pelosi s disdain for ICE is obvious from her statement The people of California will not be bowed by the Trump administration s brazen aggression and intimidation tactics , the California Democrat said Californians will continue to proudly keep our doors open to the immigrants who make America more American We will fight this sham lawsuit and will fight all cowardly attacks on our immigrant communities Nancy Pelosi clearly chooses illegals over ICE agents Her support of sanctuary and protection for illegal criminals is truly unreal for an elected representative of the American people , and treasonous behavior puts ICE agents in danger and makes their ability to do their jobs extremely difficult Perhaps one of the most infuriating recent examples of how Nancy Pelosi and her sanctuary policies hurt LEO s is the murder of Corporal Singh Singh was a legalized immigrant to the US and was living his American dream of being a police officer in the state of California Corporal Singh was murdered by illegal alien , Gustavo Perez Arraiga , who was a dangerous gang member California s sanctuary law includes more than 800 exceptions for violent crimes and felonies and bars police from asking people about their citizenship status These are laws that Nancy Pelosi supports because she cares more about illegal aliens than she cares about legal citizens and LEO s being able to perform their jobs safely Do you know what Nancy Pelosi s response to the murder of Corporal Singh was \? Nothing Not a peep No response to the murder of a legal immigrant who was serving the people of California as a police officer Zero However , Nancy Pelosi did issue comments that day She decried the deaths of two illegal immigrant children that died the same day , bashed the government shut down , and on New Year s Eve she promoted her upcoming MSNBC special Corporal Singh worked for Newman Police Department which was not far from her district in San Francisco President Trump called the family of Corporal Singh expressing his condolences and again cried out for the need for a border wall and the dangers of illegals At this point , can we just say that Nancy Pelosi seems to care less about LEO s lives \? To her Blue Lives don t matter Only Illegal Lives do or should we say illegal votes I will go further Nancy Pelosi needs to be arrested for treason ! This House Majority Leader , Nancy Pelosi , was first elected to the House of Representatives in 1987 , some 32 years ago , and is now 78 years old The average age of retirement in the US is 62 years old Americans can start collecting Social Security at age 62 Yet Nancy Pelosi refuses to retire and pry her fingers off of her powerful seat , California s 12th Congressional District At this point , it would be easy for me to make a case for term limits for all elected Congressional Representatives However in this case , I m actually going to argue for a case of treason First and foremost , our elected Representatives take an oath to office swearing to support and defend the Constitution of the United States against all enemies , foreign and domestic 5 U S Code 3331 Oath of office states An individual , except the President , elected or appointed to an office of honor or profit in the civil service or uniformed services , shall take the following oath I , AB , do solemnly swear \( or affirm \) that I will support and defend the Constitution of the United States against all enemies , foreign and domestic that I will bear true faith and allegiance to the same that I take this obligation freely , without any mental reservation or purpose of evasion and that I will well and faithfully discharge the duties of the office on which I am about to enter So help me God This section does not affect other oaths required by law According to Article 1 , Section 6 of the United States Constitution states this about why Senators and Representatives can be arrested The Senators and Representatives shall receive a Compensation for their Services , to be ascertained by Law , and paid out of the Treasury of the United States They shall in all Cases , except Treason , Felony and Breach of the Peace , be privileged from Arrest during their Attendance at the Session of their respective Houses , and in going to and returning from the same and for any Speech or Debate in either House , they shall not be questioned in any other Place According to 18 U S Code 2381 Treason is defined as follows Whoever , owing allegiance to the United States , levies war against them or adheres to their enemies , giving them aid and comfort within the United States or elsewhere , is guilty of treason and shall suffer death , or shall be imprisoned not less than five years and fined under this title but not less than 10 , 000 and shall be incapable of holding any office under the United States Our U S Constitution and U S Code of Law tells us that treason is a serious crime , even punishable by death There are only three crimes that United States elected Representatives of the House or the Senate can be arrested for treason , felony , and breach of peace Given that Nancy Pelosi , upon taking her oath of office , swore to support and defend the U S against all enemies , why has she engaged in passing laws that provide Sanctuary to illegals , continue to oppose funding to a border wall to protect our national security , and obstruct any negotiations to fund the border wall ending the government shut down \? Let s break this down Nancy Pelosi is worth hundreds of millions of dollars and is elected to SERVE America and Americans , yet every decision she makes using American s tax dollars , is about making sure our southern border is open to drug cartels , human trafficking , and a full on illegal invasion In the state of California , she is a major ring leader of the political organized crime ring that is destroying the beautiful state of California with their traitorous Sanctuary policies These anti American policies are designed to destroy the state and our country financially , guarantee illegal Democrat votes , and ruin beyond repair the sovereignty of the United States of America ! Not only that , but Nancy Pelosi voted Nay on HR 3004 Kate s Law , which was a bill that increases criminal penalties of undocumented immigrants reentering the United States after being deported once already Kate Steinle , an American citizen , was murdered in San Francisco in Nancy Pelosi s very own district , by an illegal alien who was a seven time felon and deported five times Again Nancy Pelosi voted NO to Kate s Law ! Voted NO to protecting her own citizens ! Voted NO against Americans over illegals ! This clearly provides aid and and comfort to enemies to Americans Nancy Pelosi is a criminal , guilty of treason by refusing to lead her political party to fund the wall and border security measures that would protect our national security Nancy Pelosi is a criminal guilty of treason by being a key member of a tyrannical government that has enslaved the American people into 21 trillion dollars in debt , which China owns most of our debt Nancy Pelosi is a traitor to the American people who pay her paycheck and expenses for her service , security , staff , and travel , while she takes our hard earned tax dollars to send billions of our hard earned tax dollars to foreign governments , yet refuses to fund our border wall of 5 7 billion for our national security Particularly she wants to send 10 billion to Mexico this year , yet refuses to meet with our president for lunch to work out a deal for our safety and government budget Nancy Pelosi is a traitor to America because while she refuses to fund our border wall for our national security , she uses our hard earned tax dollars to pay her travel expenses to fly to Hawaii and vacation , then turning right around to fly and party in Puerto Rico with lobbyist , PACS , and celebrities , while simultaneously forcing a government shut down causing 800 , 000 federal workers to not get paid Thanks to President Trump , they will get paid at least until Feb 15th Nancy Pelosi is a traitor to the American people because she refuses to meet with Angel families yet boast continually about her Christianity and uses pious words to talk down anyone who stands in her path Never forget she voted NO against Kate s Law ! The bottom line is America has a crisis It is real Walls work Nancy Pelosi knows walls work and that is why she and other Democrats voted yes to fund 500 million of U S tax payer s dollars in 2018 to fund a 287 mile border wall in Jordan to protect it against terrorist along it s border with Syria and Iraq We have drugs , human trafficking , and terrorist coming across our border daily and Nancy Pelosi refuses to fund OUR border wall Nancy Pelosi refuses to protect America from enemies attacking us through our unprotected wide open border Nancy Pelosi is breaking her oath of office to protect and defend the U S against enemies Nancy Pelosi is giving aid and comfort to the millions of illegals who invade the U S by providing them with sanctuary and by refusing to fund the wall to protect our southern border from enemies who invade our lands Nancy Pelosi will again refuse to fund the wall when February 15th arrives to shut down the government again Nancy Pelosi will continue in her obstinance in order to continue her war with Trump Nancy Pelosi is proving over and over she could care less about our nation s laws , those who enforce our laws , and our national security Nancy Pelosi is guilty of treason Nancy Pelosi must be impeached , fired , and removed from office , for committing treason Once upon a time in this country , The People gave a damn Once upon a time The People stood for something Once upon a time The People would stand up against wrongs and would take action to right them Do something Sign the petition to Impeach Nancy Pelosi We need 100 , 000 signatures in 30 days in order for this petition to get a response from the White House We need The People to take a stand and send a message that we will not tolerate this type of political corruption any longer With everyone s support , we can then move to the next level It s time Sign , verify , and make a difference by clicking here Marjorie Taylor Greene is a proud Whiskey Patriot , entrepreneur , business owner , writer , commentator , speaker , defender of the Second Amendment , shooting enthusiast , CrossFit athlete , wife , and mother redeemed through grace She states Our life is a sum total of our decisions Every day I have the gift to choose to make it an amazing life",false

"The Trump administration has a penchant for its dismal optics and an almost impressive ability to continue lowering the bar to previously unknown depths This week , Trump and his tribalistic cohorts opted to punish those seeking asylum along the southern border by implementing a zero tolerance policy that would call for the separation of parents and their children , an act so inhumane that it is inviting comparisons to Japanese internment camps of World War 2 and even the Holocaust Trump attempted to staunch the bleeding by signing an Executive Order rescinding his own policy , but the damage was already done , especially given that it discredited his own claim that the policy was the result of a Democratic law and that he was powerless to change it Even within the United States , many on both sides of the aisle have spoken out , including Even within the United States , many on both sides of the aisle have spoken out , including all five First Ladies \( Hillary Clinton , Michelle Obama , Rosalynn Carter , Laura Bush and even Melania Trump \) , former Fox News host Bill O Reilly , and Republican Senator John McCain But the international community has been especially outspoken in its opposition to this administration s visibly inhumane agenda , including the purported account of Willem Alexander Claus George Ferdinand , the King of the Netherlands , who posted a less than subtle threat to a president vying for his spot as one of the cruelest world leaders of this century Trump may continue to blame everyone but himself for his own policies , but from Washington , D C to the farthest corners of the planet , his crimes against humanity are both evident and roundly condemned And whether at the ballot box or in front of a judge or even fingers crossed at The Hague , he will , at some point , have to answer for his crimes Follow Brian Tyler Cohen on Follow Brian Tyler Cohen on Facebook and Twitter",false

"Here come the autonomous robot security guards What could possibly go wrong \? Here come the autonomous robot security guards What could possibly go wrong \? By Sebastian Anthony on November 17 , 2014 at 8 58 amCommentThis site may earn affiliate commissions from the links on this page Terms of use Showing a rather shocking disregard for the long term safety of human civilization , Microsoft has become one of the first companies to deploy autonomous robot security guards Dubbed the K5 , Microsoft s Silicon Valley campus was being policed last week by five of these roughly human sized 300 pound \( 136 kg \) robots , each equipped with enough cameras , sensors , artificial intelligence , and alarms that they can replace most human security patrols Fortunately , despite looking like uncomfortably like a Dalek from the Doctor Who universe , the K5 is not \( yet \) equipped with a ray gun or any other method for harming or detaining humans Updated Microsoft contacted ExtremeTech to tell us that the robots were only temporarily deployed at its Silicon Valley campus , as part of a demonstration put on by Knightscope Microsoft PR says it isn t aware of any future plans to deploy such robots The K5 , built by the Californian company Knightscope , is billed rather euphemistically as an autonomous data machine that provides a commanding but friendly physical presence Basically , it s a security guard on wheels Inside that rather large casing \( it s 5 foot tall ! \) there are four high def cameras facing in each direction , another camera that can do car license plate recognition , four microphones , gentle alarms , blaring sirens , weather sensors , and WiFi connectivity so that each robot can contact HQ if there s some kind of security breach situation For navigating the environment , there s GPS and laser scanning \( LIDAR I guess \) And of course , at the heart of each K5 is a computer running artificial intelligence software that integrates all of that data and tries to make intelligent inferences like , should I tell HQ about that large gathering of teenagers , or should that man be climbing in through that window \? K5 security robot The lights can change color \( red for trouble , orange for caution , etc \) If a K5 decides that there s a situation , it can use one of its built in sirens to try and diffuse things or it can message HQ to summon a human If you step in front of the K5 , or otherwise interfere with it , it will gently warn you with some chimes but if you don t move , an ear piercing alarm is triggered Other than its sirens and its rather imposing design , the K5 isn t equipped with any weapons or other tools for resolving situations \( Does anyone else think it looks like the lovechild of a Dalek and EVE from WALL E \? \) A slightly odd photo of a US sheriff holding a gun to the head of a K5 robotK5 isn t just for catching criminals , either If you find yourself in trouble danger , there s also a button on the top of the robot that summons help from HQ Read Microsoft wants to be part of Judgment Day , tooThe purpose of the K5 , like most robots , is straightforward To replace expensive human workers The K5 can run for around 24 hours on a single battery charge , automatically navigates back to the charging point when it s running low , and only takes 15 20 minutes to recharge Obviously , in the long run , this is cheaper and more efficient than a human security guard plus , as technology improves , the K5 will probably be more vigilant and capable of spotting smaller discrepancies than a human In theory , because of the lower cost , you could also field lots of K5 robots , reducing the number of potential holes in security coverage It goes without saying , though , that deploying a fleet of roughly human sized , autonomous robots is just a little bit scary At the very least , a 300 pound robot would cause a lot of damage if it ran into something a car , a shop window , a child In all likelihood , though , if these robotic security guards are popular , they ll eventually be equipped with weapons perhaps a taser for subduing a suspect , and a tear gas launcher for clearing groups of people At that point , you need to be really sure that the AI is free of bugs",false
"American alligator 8 million years first protected Endangered Species Preservation Act in 66 Thehas remained nearly untouched by evolution for the last It has hunted in the Southeastern wetlands as an apex predator , unaffected by sea levels or fluctuating temperatures Nearly hunted to extinction by 1950 , alligators were one of thespecies in 1962 They helped usher in the creation of theand by 1987 , the alligator had become a rousing success story , pronounced fully recovered With healthy levels returned , they demonstrated the program s effectiveness and future promise Today , the American alligator s story is experiencing another plot twist Cavan The American alligator has been so protected , it s now over populated , said Nathan Richard , the executive chef ofin New Orleans He s both passionate and creative when it comes to cooking alligator he s done nose to tail preparations and hosted a vanishing wetlands supper series For Richard , normalizing this protein on menus again is essential to protecting the Louisiana wetlands Too many alligators means too many fish and turtles being killed , he said , as we tucked into a bowl of his incredible curry piquant Fried alligator tenderloin was slathered in a coconut sauce , made from hot red curry , fish sauce , soy , sliced ginger and gochujang paste It was fragrant and spicy , bringing both moments of classic Louisiana flavor with intense notes of Southeast Asian cuisine A perfectly crackled exterior resembled fried chicken , but the meat within was more akin in consistency to a super tender octopus The interior at Cavan Sara Essex Bradley This overpopulation also means a physical destruction of the marshes and the destruction of fishing traps and bait , said Richard That s a problem for the commercial fishermen Our wetlands and marshes are our first line of defense against hurricanes , and without them , the flooding will become even more extreme While Richard is not the only man cooking gator in New Orleans , he s likely one of the few chefs of his caliber with such a hands on approach to the animal in the wild Boating through the bayou in Louisiana Jenny Adams Mic I ve been hunting alligator since I was a kid growing up in Thibodaux , Louisiana , he said Alligator is not only high protein and low fat , it s also able to be sustainably sourced The way we trap them , there s no pain or stress until the moment it s killed If you do it right , it s very , very fast And if you do it wrong \? I asked If you hunt alligator wrong , you re in big trouble , he said with a laugh The sound fits his massive frame when he s not hunting gator , Richards is a volunteer fireman His exploration of new ways to cook alligator continues to excite guests who ve come to love the meat It s far beyond fried alligator bites in a basket a common sight in the city I learned from Australian crocodile recipes that you can do a baby back ribs , he said When I worked at Kingfish , I hosted nose to tail dinners For those , I broke down an entire alligator and prepared each part differently The cheek is delicious , but the liver is totally inedible His grits and alligator grillades arrived on the Cavan menu this winter , with pan fried cutlets cooked in bacon fat and braised in a reduction of celery , onions , bell pepper and garlic served over stone ground , mascarpone and edam cheese grits Chef Nathan Richard at Cavan Cavan I was eager to get a more up close and personal look at the wetlands , and , admittedly , at the alligators It turns out , a lot of people are similarly inclined and hunting \( with professionals \) is now a tourism activity Cypress Point Richard has become friends with a biologist and conservationist , Dr Ray J Matherne , the owner of a 1 , 700 acre wetland preserve about 30 minutes from New Orleans in Bayou Des Allemands Matherne has spent a lifetime studying this ecosystem and today takes guests on tours , crawfish harvests In September the only month alligator hunting is legal he ll even take guests on two day alligator hunts There s no place to stay directly on his property , but the drive isn t too long from New Orleans 40 of all the wetlands in the U S United States Geological Survey Louisiana s 3 million acres of wetlands represent According to the , they are being lost at a rate of 75 square kilometers annually In Des Allemands and other bayous like it , you add in the overpopulation of an apex predator into the equation and the effects are deeply felt The wetlands at Cypress Point Jenny Adams Mic Thirty years ago , the demand for hides was tremendous , Matherne said , as we set out in a duo of small , battered outboards , not quite as long as a fully grown gator But with the anti fur movement , it has dropped considerably Now , we hunt for population control and we hunt to save the wetlands There s no doubt hunting also benefits these bayou communities in other ways from the processors to locals who have their own , day to day issues with this overpopulation He s an expert on the area You can see egrets , heron , ibis and even bald eagles nesting , he said And we do a private alligator harvest , a crawfish harvest , fishing , duck hunting and bass fishing Matherne s preserve has Spanish moss dripping dreamily off cypress , gum , and oak trees It s easy to forget we are here for a hunt the first of a two day hunt is rather relaxing We set traps using 12 foot long willow poles with a long , nylon rope tied to both ends The poles are planted at a 45 degree angle deep into the mud On the top of each pole , a piece of raw chicken hangs from a massive , metal hook dangling about a foot off the water The alligators begin their own hunt at dusk Sniffing the rotten meat , they burst from the water to swallow the it whole , settling on the mud below to digest without noticing that they ve swallowed a hook and line , too The alligators from the hunt before they are processed Jenny Adams Mic Let s say we never came back , said Matherne on the second day of our hunt It would do them no harm An alligator s digestive system is so acidic , it s strong enough to dissolve a hubcap In a matter of days , it would all dissolve , and the alligator would swim away A missing chicken alerts us we might have a gator Richard stands in the boat , hauling the pole and line upwards Another hunter stands alongside him with a rifle pointed at the water It s mere seconds before an 11 foot alligator rises to the surface , suddenly furious and thrashing The water is boiling and the boats are rocking with considerable force Birds go screaming from the tree canopy If you need anything to hunt an alligator , I realize , it s an incredible trifecta of balance , bravery and marksmanship falling in would likely mean death A quick bullet is fired into the center of alligator s the head , and just like that , the swamp goes quiet again",false

"PORTLAND , Ore \( \) A Portland art gallery has taken down a controversial image depicting the beheading of President Donald Trump One Grand Gallery on East Burnside Street had the image up in its window , but has since removed it after the gallery says it received threats of violence Gallery organizers said proceeds from the exhibition are going to nonprofit groups that have lost funding under the Trump administration The artist who created the piece says the intention was to provoke thought It should provoke your mind even if it makes you uncomfortable it should be thought provoking , artist Compton Creep said The image of the president with a knife to his throat , bleeding , with the words \( expletive \) Trump became the centerpiece for an exhibition It 's just art , man If you do n't like it , do n't look at it If you dig it , cool , Creep said The gallery put the image on its front window , facing the busy intersection of Northeast 10th Avenue and East Burnside Street Since then , it has sparked a firestorm It 's silly , Creep said of the response to his piece Just like , you should be paying more attention to everything else in your existence not someone 's art The owner of the building tells KATU News that as soon as he found out about the image , he told the gallery it had 12 hours to remove the image , or it was in breach of its lease Dozens have made their way to the gallery to see the art for themselves This , to me , was just too much I'm tired of the hate This is all I seem to see from people who disagree with Trump , who I think is doing the best he can , one woman , who did not want to be identified , said An apology , I think , would be nice , she continued Understanding that there are two parts of Portland and that not everyone agrees with that mentality By Tuesday morning , the image was gone and the gallery was empty It 's a move Creep says goes against the point of art I think it was a weak move and I do n't think they should have done that It shows that just by complaining , you can have your way , Creep said According to its website , the gallery features works relevant to the central discussion of urban and contemporary artwork",true
"reddit Upvote Downvotesubmit 0 1K Like Right wing televangelist and prosperity gospel preacher Kenneth Copeland recently hosted a television program featuring right wing pseudo historian David Barton , Pastor George Pearsons and Bishop Keith Butler aimed at mobilizing conservative Christians to vote in the upcoming election After failed prayers regarding one time GOP presidential hopeful Ted Cruz s call and anointing to be the next president of the United States , Copeland has turned to warning Christians that they will be guilty of murder if they don t vote for Donald Trump I kid you not when I say that the future of us all lies in your hands , Copeland told his viewers And I m talking now to the conservative Christians , to the traditional Americans and all those who feel that way we must not allow the liberal scum to corrupt what little God fearing purity , pride and freedom we have left Donald Trump is the only choice for president and you all know it don t make the mistake of thinking that Hillary Clinton is anything else than a wolf in sheep s clothing The only way for this country to survive is to stick to what it knows , not try to evolve and attempt new things He continued , And in order to prove that what I m saying is true , I am going to reveal something I m not supposed to There is a new Civil War looming over America , one that our conservative forces have organized and prepared It is a war designed to right the wrongs that have been done to the people of America by the Democrats for decades Copeland added that the war depends on whether or not Donald Trump wins in November In the unlikely event that the serpent Hillary Clinton should triumph over Donald Trump , we will unleash a fury upon this land the likes of which has never before been seen Therefore , I hereby send this message to all those who plan to vote for anyone other than Donald Trump , including those who aren t planning on voting at all We will find out who you are , we will hunt you down and we will punish you for the casualties of the war I speak of , the televangelist proclaimed Do not think for a second that you can hide or run away from us The deaths of thousands of innocents will be on your hands You have plenty of time Think about what you re doing and question every decision you ve made so far Is it worth being responsible for so many deaths compared to one short trip to the election booth \?

"ago 10According to reports from World Net Daily , a New Jersey township that was sued by a group of Muslims for refusing to approve a massive mosque project is now returning to court because of a settlement agreement that restricts anyone from commenting on Islam or Muslims It s important to note that a key tenet of Shariah bans any negative comments about the religion According to the Thomas More Law Center who sued the township on behalf of two residents whose home is within 200 feet of the proposed mega mosque , the settlement reads more like an instrument of surrender The Islamic Society of Basking Ridge won a decision in federal court after its mosque proposal was rejected based on traffic and other concerns The Township agreed on a 3 5 million payment and a public hearing to approve the settlement Residents Christopher and Loretta Quick challenged the agreement , arguing it restricts speech and violates the Establishment Clause The Quicks reside within 200 feet of the proposed mosque construction in a zoned residential area , Thomas More explained Yet , the settlement agreement prohibits them from describing the many unique features of Islamic worship which will impact the design of the building , traffic density , water and sewage , traffic control problems , road construction , and parking arrangements According to the settlement agreement , ISBR is permitted to make statements concerning Christians and Jews and their places of worship , but in contrast , the agreement prohibits commentary relating to Islam or Muslims In fact , ISBR has previously discussed the Christian and Jewish religions and their places of worship Richard Thompson , chief counsel for Thomas More , said the Islamic center has taken the extraordinary step of concealing significant links on their website to a radical group named by the federal government as an unindicted co conspirator in the largest terrorism financing trial in America history , the Islamic Society of North America \( ISNA \) Thompson said that while claiming that the township had a religious animus against Muslims , ISBR hid from the public view its animus toward Christians and Jews , by not only hiding anti Christian and anti Semitic verses published on its website but also hiding its significant ties to ISNA Instead of standing up to defend its citizens against ISBR s hate filled anti Semitic and anti Christian bias , the township colluded with ISBR s Civilization Jihad by capitulating to payment of millions of dollars to ISBR , allowing the construction of the new mosque and Islamic center in violation ISBR is setting a dangerous unconstitutional precedent by abusing a court process to chill and trample on the First Amendment rights of private citizens whose only involvement was to speak out against the mosque at public hearings , Thompson said earlier this year He asked for the subpoenas to be thrown out because the U S Supreme Court has held that speech at a public place on a matter of public concern is entitled to special protection 0",false

"St Louis , MO Monsanto , the multi billion agribusiness giant , has announced today it has patented the first genetically modified strain of marijuana The news that has been welcomed by scientists and leaders of the agriculture business alike as a move forward towards the industrial use of marijuana and hemp products could bring a major shift towards marijuana policies in the U S A and ultimately , to the world Under present US federal law , it is illegal to possess , use , buy , sell , or cultivate marijuana , since the Controlled Substances Act of 1970 classifies marijuana as a Schedule I drug , although it has been decriminalized to some extent in certain states , Monsanto s interest in the field has been interpreted by experts as the precursor to a major shift in marijuana policy in the US as it is believed the company would not have invested so much time and energy if it had not had previous knowledge of the Federal government s openness towards the future legalization of marijuana Lawyer and marijuana law specialist , Edmund Groensch , of the Drug Policy Alliance , admits Monsanto s involvement in marijuana projects could definitely help the pro legalization activists Currently , Federal law criminalizes marijuana and hemp derivatives because public opinion is still against it and legal commercial production in the U S is currently handled by a patchwork of small farmers whom are not trusted by investors A major player as Monsanto could bring confidence within government and towards investors in the market if it were to own a large part of the exploitable lands and commercial products There is presently no way to control the production of marijuana and the quality of the strains A GM strain produced by a company with the credentials and prestige of Monsanto would definitely lend a massive hand to pro legalization activists within certain spheres of government and within the business world he explains Although Monsanto s testing on cannabis is only at an experimental stage , no plan has yet been released by the agriculture business firm as to what purposes the patented strain would be used for , although specialists believe answers should come this fall as rumors of a controversial new bill which could loosen up laws around medical marijuana is reportedly scheduled to pass before congress coming this fall Critics fear genetically modified cannabis will mix with other strains and could destroy the diversity of DNA , a reality dismissed by most studies claim experts",false
"WH press secretary says WWII veterans should get over their bitterness about Pearl Harbor attackDec 6 , 2016 12 26 pmWhite House spokesman Josh Earnest \( Nicholas Kamm AFP Getty Images \) TweetWhite House press secretary Josh Earnest said Monday that it s natural for World War II veterans to feel personally embittered by Japanese Prime Minister Shinzo Abe s impending visit to Pearl Harbor , but they should get over it Abe announced Monday that he would become the first Japanese leader to visit the Hawaiian naval station since it was bombed by Imperial Japan on Dec 7 , 1941 , leading to the deaths of more than 2 , 400 Americans The visit is in response to President Barack Obama s visit to Hiroshima , Japan , earlier this year , which was the site of the first atomic bomb drop The bomb killed 70 , 000 80 , 000 people and injured another 70 , 000 But during the daily White House press briefing Monday , Earnest was asked about Abe s decision to visit Pearl Harbor which will come shortly after the 75th anniversary of the attack and how veterans should feel about it , namely because Japan has refused to apologize for the attack If I were a World War II veteran who was drafted by the United States military to go and fight for our country overseas in the aftermath of the Pearl Harbor attack , I might feel quite embittered , Earnest said And I think it would be a perfectly natural and understandable human reaction to not be particularly satisfied with the words of the Japanese Prime Minister But , Earnest said those people who feel personal bitterness should set aside their feelings for the greater good of the U S And so , yes , there may be some who feel personally embittered , he added But I m confident that many will set aside their own personal bitterness , not because they re personally satisfied by the words of the Prime Minister , but because they recognize how important this moment is for the United States For what it s worth , Abe said that he would mourn the souls of the victims of Japan s surprise attack with Obama during his visit later this month",false

"Alice Springs A team of archaeologists working for the Australian National University , who were proceeding to an excavation near the sandstone rock formation of Uluru , has unearthed the ruins of a large pre colonial city dating back to more than 1500 years ago The important number of tombs and artifacts already discovered on the site suggests that it could have been the capital of an ancient empire , completely unknown to historians until now The site which was first noticed on satellite pictures taken in October 2013 , using a newly developed ground penetrating radar The images revealed many 90 angles and various common geographic figures over a 16 km2 area , leading the team of scientists to direct some archaeological excavations on the spot , starting in May 2014 Over the last few months , many structures have been unearthed including what looks like a royal palace , a few temples , large rainwater reservoirs , workshops and dozens of houses Professor Walter Reese , in charge of the site , claims that the extent of the site and the superposition of various layers of constructions , suggests that it was occupied for 400 to 500 years , from approximately 470 80 AD , up until the 9th Century He believes that the city could have held between 20000 and 30000 inhabitants , making it the most important center of civilization in the Southern Pacific at the time This was certainly the capital of a vast empire , that practised some sort of international trade says Mr Reese The fact that we have discovered some bodies of various origins suggests that this state could have been a very influential throughout the Pacific islands and Southeast Asia We have found many objects on the site that were obviously imported from other regions , like rice , flax or lacquer The various artifacts gathered from the site suggest that the city flourished thanks to some form of control over various gold mining operations in Southern Australia The precious metal was purified and transformed by the hundreds of goldsmiths of the city before being traded for various other goods through an extensive network reaching as far as New Zealand , Indonesia , Malaysia , and even China and India Professor Reese believes that the city could have been abandoned after some climatic changes in the 9th Century brought a dramatic decrease in the level of rainfall , making the city unsustainable",false

"Lindsey Graham is running a half hour late when he arrives back at his Senate office at 6 00 p m for an interview , but that s understandable There was rush hour traffic on Constitution Avenue , and he s had more important places to be Graham has just finished a meeting at the White House with a group of 15 Republican senators and President Donald Trump They d been discussing tariffs in the wake of Trump s increasingly bellicose trade moves and Tennessee Republican senator Bob Corker s announcement the day before , June 5 , that he d introduce a bill to take back some of the authority Congress had given the executive branch to raise tariffs He asked me to call the meeting , Graham says of Trump We talked yesterday and I said , Well , let me get a group together , and we ll see what happens Within days , it s clear that the meeting has been a success for Trump Bob Corker is on the Senate floor berating his fellow Republicans for blocking a vote on his amendment despite the fact , he says , that 95 percent of the people on this Republican side of the aisle support intellectually this amendment but are afraid we might poke the bear i e , President Trump There s a lot of concern that this tariff thing is going to get out of hand , Graham tells me in his office on June 6 We have to realize this is one of the centerpieces of the campaign it s not traditional Republican policy , but we need to respect the fact that he won Maybe we need to change Section 232 tariffs one day , but now is not the time to do that , because it will undercut his negotiating position Graham s role in protecting Trump s protectionist policies isn t entirely out of character The senator from South Carolina , a textile manufacturing state , has a mixed record on free trade He voted against the Central American Free Trade Agreement in 2005 , for example , but backed the Trans Pacific Partnership in recent years What is surprising is the very existence of Graham s close relationship with Donald Trump Trump is the world s biggest jackass , Graham said a month after Trump launched his presidential campaign , in response to Trump s trashing his friend John McCain and other American prisoners of war \( I like people who weren t captured \) Trump responded by calling Graham an idiot who is probably not as bright , honestly , as Rick Perry and by reading off Graham s cell phone number at one of his televised rallies Graham had to get a new number While most Republicans fell in line before the 2016 election , Lindsey Graham along with fellow senators Mike Lee , Ben Sasse , John McCain , and Rob Portman was a high profile NeverTrumper on Election Day My party has gone batshit crazy , Graham said in a February 2016 speech about Trump Graham told Fox News that Trump is a kook I think he s crazy I think he s unfit to be president But sometime after the election , Graham became a neo Trumper You know what concerns me about the American press is this endless , endless attempt to label the president some kind of kook , Graham said in November 2017 I intend to support him in 2020 without equivocation , Graham tells me now What changed since 2016 \? A neoconservative , in Irving Kristol s famous formulation , was a liberal who d been mugged by reality Neo Trumpers like Graham , then , are NeverTrumpers who were mugged by what , exactly \? Necessity \? Expediency \? Sean Hannity \? To hear Graham tell it , policy is what changed his mind He s on track to do big things , Graham says of the president He built up the military I campaigned on it He got out of the Iran deal I campaigned on it He s destroying ISIL I campaigned on it He s restructuring the tax code and the way we do business I campaigned on it He s doing much of what I campaigned on , and I m pleased Graham now speaks regularly with Trump and has become a close ally on matters ranging from North Korea to health care What about the issues of temperament that in 2016 made Trump , in Graham s view , unfit to be president \? Is there anything specific , I ask , that has convinced the senator that Trump isn t the kook Graham called him back then \? One , I got to know him , Graham says I ve played golf with him You know , play golf with somebody for three or four hours , you get to know them better He s funny as hell He s got a great sense of humor There s a method to the madness He s nobody s fool , Graham adds Very smart And he asks a lot of good questions In 2016 , Graham also suggested Trump s character made him unfit Name one sports team , university , publicly held company , etc that would accept a person like this as their standard bearer \? Graham tweeted in October 2016 after the release of the Access Hollywood video , in which Trump bragged about groping women by the genitals If that behavior disqualified Trump in 2016 , why doesn t it disqualify him in 2020 \? The American people listened to all that , and they said I want him to be president Okay I believe the elections have consequences , Graham says I ve always been of an opinion when the election s over , you try to help the guy that won In his efforts to help Trump , Graham hasn t just been running interference on trade policy He took the lead on a last ditch attempt to partially repeal and replace Obama care by block granting money to the states , a bill that conservative health care expert Yuval Levin called the most coherent plan considered by Republicans Graham says Trump loves the idea , and it s almost a certainty it would pass in the \( unlikely \) event Republicans pick up a seat or two in the Senate and hold the House Graham has also been the most enthusiastic congressional supporter of Trump s North Korea diplomacy Graham says that Trump s credible threat of military force has brought North Korea to the negotiating table , and he believes Trump agrees with him that a war with North Korea is better than letting North Korea develop an arsenal of nuclear tipped missiles that could strike the United States The prospect of war with a regime that already has nuclear weapons might seem crazy to many , but Graham at least doesn t downplay how apocalyptic a war would be If President Trump has to pick between millions of people dying in America and millions of people dying over there , he s going to pick millions of people dying over there if he has to , Graham says There s no hint in his rhetoric that military action against North Korea would stop at giving them a bloody nose Graham says that he still calls it like he sees it , supporting the president when he s right and opposing him when he s wrong I m really worried about what he s talking about in Syria We pull out of Syria , ISIS will come back , and the Kurds will get eaten alive by Turkey , Graham says That d be the biggest mistake he could make It will undo all of his achievements when it comes to ISIS It d be an Obama on steroids decision I told him that Graham has also warned Trump against firing special counsel Robert Mueller and refuses to call the investigation into Russian interference in the 2016 election a witch hunt But he thinks it s unlikely Mueller will uncover evidence Trump has committed any impeachable offenses You could fire former FBI director James Comey for any reason except a corrupt reason The May 2017 memo by deputy attorney general Rod Rosenstein , critical of Comey s handling of the investigation of Hillary Clinton s emails , suggests there were valid reasons Democrats wanted Comey fired I think it s going to be tough to prove that the president committed obstruction of justice in firing a guy that most people wanted to fire Back in August 2017 , after a neo Nazi killed counter protester Heather Heyer in a vehicular terrorist attack at a white nationalist rally in Charlottesville , Trump blamed many sides for the violence , failing to forcefully single out the side that committed murder , the side that claimed to have Trump s support The president made matters worse by saying some very fine people had participated in a torchlit white nationalist march where protesters chanted Jews will not replace us ! Graham issued a scathing statement Through his statements yesterday , President Trump took a step backward by again suggesting there is moral equivalency between the white supremacist neo Nazis and KKK members who attended the Charlottesville rally and people like Ms Heyer I , along with many others , do not endorse this moral equivalency Many Republicans do not agree with and will fight back against the idea that the Party of Lincoln has a welcome mat out for the David Dukes of the world Trump responded with a pair of tweets Publicity seeking Lindsey Graham falsely stated that I said there is moral equivalency between the KKK , neo Nazis white supremacists and people like Ms Heyer Such a disgusting lie He just can t forget his election trouncing The people of South Carolina will remember ! It was only a few months after Trump warned Graham the people of South Carolina will remember ! that Graham publicly did a 180 on whether Trump is a kook Graham s criticism of the president has been more tempered since Trump s threatening August 2017 tweets , but he hasn t gone completely in the tank for Trump In January 2018 , Graham was at the Oval Office meeting where Trump said he opposed letting in more immigrants from certain shithole or shithouse countries Georgia GOP senator David Perdue , who was also in the room , called the reported quotation a total misrepresentation But Graham couldn t bring himself to lie for Trump My memory hasn t evolved , Graham told reporters I know what was said , and I know what I said Following comments by the president , I said my piece directly to him yesterday , Graham said The president and all those attending the meeting know what I said and how I feel I ve always believed that America is an idea , not defined by its people but by its ideals But there has been perhaps no greater rhetorical desecration of American ideals by President Trump than his recent gratuitous praise that Kim Jong un , the tyrant of the North Korean gulag state , loves his people and that the North Korean people love him with great fervor In Graham s media tour following the Trump Kim summit , he left no illusions about the brutality of Kim , but he didn t call on Trump to stop sanitizing the Stalinist dictator Trump demands an unusual level of loyalty from his supporters , and there is some price to be paid for being his ally While President Trump was initially arguing last week that he was forced to impose a policy of separating children from parents who had illegally crossed the border because a law passed by Democrats tied his hands , Graham said on CNN that it simply wasn t true President Trump could stop this policy with a phone call But Graham didn t call on Trump to actually make that call When Graham was asked on CNN on June 15 whether his newfound support for Trump was two faced , he had a simple answer If you don t like me working with President Trump to make the world a better place , I don t give a shit While Graham argues he s been motivated by policy and principle , it would be na ve not to consider the possibility that political necessity played some role in his evolving view of Trump Texas senator Ted Cruz , for example , withheld his support from Trump through the Republican convention , relenting coincidentally at a time when the presidential polls tightened and he faced mounting pressure from his donors to back Trump Cruz was thus able to avoid a serious primary challenge in 2018 Graham was always certain to face a primary challenger in 2020 , and the fact that he hasn t previously been defeated is somewhat surprising Frequently derided on talk radio for his stance on immigration as Lindsey Grahamnesty , he won a seven way 2014 primary in conservative South Carolina with 56 percent of the vote \( his closest challenger lost by 41 points \) , just a year after participating as an author of the Gang of 8 comprehensive immigration reform bill But while voters were willing to tolerate Graham s heresy on immigration , there s reason to think they wouldn t be as ready to tolerate opposition to the incumbent president in 2020 On June 12 , South Carolina Republican congressman and staunch Trump critic Mark Sanford was defeated in a primary In the 2013 House primary , voters were willing to overlook Sanford s extramarital affair But harsh criticism of Trump was apparently a bridge too far On June 5 , Alabama congresswoman Martha Roby , who had said she couldn t vote for Trump after the Access Hollywood tape came out , came in first in her primary \( 39 percent to 28 percent \) but , having failed to win a majority , was forced to a July runoff Even in suburban Northern Virginia , Rep Barbara Comstock , a Republican who didn t vote for Trump , lost 39 percent of the vote to a primary challenger It s no coincidence that two of Trump s most outspoken Republican critics in the Senate , Jeff Flake of Arizona and Bob Corker of Tennessee , are not seeking reelection in 2018 Mitt Romney will very likely win the Utah Senate nomination this month without having committed to backing Trump in 2020 , but Utah Republicans were a national outlier in their opposition to Trump Among the dozens of current and former prominent Republican officials who didn t vote for Trump in 2016 , Lindsey Graham may be the first neo Trumper But he likely won t be the last Correction This article originally stated that Mark Sanford resigned as governor of South Carolina Sanford finished his term as governor but did resign as chairman of the Republican Governors Association",true

Trump s inaugural address signaled an ambitious nationalist reimagining of the post World War II international order Trump s foreign policy team , in contrast , seems to spring from that order The resulting uncertainty is global and dangerous Vacuums of leadership are not generally filled by the good guys The administration s policy shift is most evident so far in the areas of trade and refugees Trump prefers less of both Given a narrowed conception of national interest and the president s discomfort with the idea of nation building , foreign assistance would seem a natural next target Persistent rumors that the administration is mulling major cuts at the U S Agency for International Development \( USAID \) have heightened this speculation Although Trump hasn t spoken much on this topic , some of his comments have reflected an inclination to pull back It is necessary that we invest in our infrastructure , stop sending foreign aid to countries that hate us and use that money to rebuild our tunnels , roads , bridges and schools , he said when he announced his candidacy And in a March 2016 interview with the Washington Post editorial board , he said I watched as we built schools in Iraq and they d be blown up And we d build another one , and it would get blown up And yet we can t build a school in Brooklyn We have no money for education , because we can t build in our own country And at what point do you say , hey , we have to take care of ourselves Yet Trump has also added notes of ambiguity In August , he told the Miami Herald that Congress should increase funding to fight the Zika virus abroad In September , he underlined the importance of ensuring clean water for everyone in the world In October , he stated that we re going to lead the way on AIDS relief In this case , Trump s better angels would do more to serve the country than his budget cutters Putting foreign assistance on the chopping block would be a serious mistake , by any definition of the national interest Let s begin by getting the facts straight Surveys have shown that many Americans assume the country spends upwards of 20 percent of the federal budget on foreign aid In reality , nonmilitary foreign assistance including all of America s work on international development and global health represents less than 1 percent of the federal budget Slashing this tiny category of discretionary spending for the sake of budget control would be a form of deception a sideshow to avoid truly important \( and unpopular \) budgetary choices For less than 1 percent of the federal budget , the United States led a global coalition to fight HIV AIDS when the disease threatened to devastate and destabilize much of the African continent Battling another of the world s most lethal killers , malaria , U S led global programs have saved more than 6 million lives , mainly children under 5 years old America also led a global effort to support agriculture when the food , fuel and financial crisis of 2008 pushed nearly 100 million people back into a state of chronic hunger and extreme poverty As of 2015 , that effort had directly benefited nearly 19 million rural households and reached more than 12 million children with nutrition programs And America led a global partnership to bring power to half a billion people in Africa who have too often lived , worked , studied and given birth in the dark This established impact runs up against a durable stereotype that foreign assistance is routinely bundled in large bills and thrown down rat holes of waste and corruption The charge is not entirely without historical root During the Cold War , foreign assistance had some remarkable successes , including the Marshall Plan and the Green Revolution , but also notable failures such as aid to Vietnam and to dictators in Central America In Africa , assistance sometimes went to strongmen such as Mobutu Sese Seko of Zaire , mainly because of a strategic chess game against the Soviet Union , not because he was spurring development But over the past two decades and past two presidential administrations , health and development spending has evolved into a rigorous , innovative and professional enterprise dedicated to measured outcomes Aid and development practitioners know how to set smart targets , engage private sector partners , adapt to changing circumstances and make sure taxpayers get the most value for their investments And they have evidence that what they are doing works Most U S foreign assistance no longer even goes to foreign governments It is given to U S companies and nonprofits in the form of contracts and grants these organizations then implement projects in other countries , employing a combination of American and foreign staff members and often partnering with institutions of civil society But why does this emphasis on rigor and outcomes matter to U S foreign policy \? How does foreign assistance serve definable American interests \? Many of our most dangerous global challenges such as terrorism , the drug trade and pandemic diseases gather strength in countries , or regions within countries , that are poorly governed , often corrupt , and marked by high levels of poverty , hunger and disease These places are incubators of risks to the United States Consider Ebola , which took root in the weak health systems of West Africa and threatened our nation and the world with death and panic Or the poverty and conflict in the Northern Triangle of Central America , which led to tens of thousands of child migrants trying to make their way to the United States on the tops of trains Or the collapse of sovereignty in Syria , which helped produce the Islamic State and a radiating , destabilizing flood of refugees into Jordan , Lebanon , Turkey and beyond Or the weak governments of South America , which are often unable to halt the flow of drugs that enter our country These are all very real consequences of poverty , instability and poor governance But gains in hope , health and stability reduce these threats and better protect Americans A forward leaning Ebola response , employing America s full epidemiological and humanitarian capacity , helped save lives in Africa and prevented the outbreak from spreading around the globe In the Northern Triangle , our partnerships have helped reduce gang violence and stem the flow of unaccompanied minors to the United States The Syrian crisis continues apace , but our massive humanitarian support for those displaced and in dire need reduces the pressure of refugee migrations to many nations , including our own One of the best examples of the strategic role of aid has been in Colombia , where criminal gangs , violent conflict and the world s largest production of cocaine threatened to destabilize the region and the world for decades In the late 1990s and early 2000s , the United States had a large security budget in Colombia and a small budget for development assistance Then the Colombians embraced a greater focus on long term development , which they integrated into their stabilization plans when territory was taken back from rebels U S development assistance was increased , then integrated and properly sequenced with defense activities As soon as landmines were cleared and local officials could safely return to liberated towns , USAID poured in assistance , which was crucial to consolidate gains Those long term investments are now paying off , supporting peace negotiations and helping to reintegrate former rebels and displaced civilians , in addition to improving business opportunities for U S firms U S foreign assistance in Colombia gave stability and peace a fighting chance , and helped remedy a serious security problem for the United States and its allies This type of foreign assistance is essential to preventing the kind of uncontainable strategic threats that might eventually require military intervention \( We are not talking here about humanitarian assistance , which should be driven entirely by the nature and scale of the need , or about direct military aid \) Defense Secretary Jim Mattis made a compelling case for conflict prevention when he was head of U S Central Command If you don t fund the State Department fully , then I need to buy more ammunition A small investment in foreign assistance today saves big on defense later An America first approach to foreign assistance could mean deploying foreign aid even more rigorously to help keep America safe , rather than a simple retreat How do we create an aid system that uses big data to identify areas of weak governance that may produce global threats \? One that systematically employs the full spectrum of assistance \? One that uses information on measured outcomes to adjust policies and practices in real time \? And one that ultimately builds local capacity to confront problems \? There are specific actions the new administration can take to deliver on this vision It should designate a coordinator for development who is empowered to ensure results from U S foreign assistance programs This coordinator could be the new USAID administrator or the secretary of state himself but it must be someone who sits at the principals table at the National Security Council and has the clear backing of the White House He or she would need to review existing efforts and determine how they match rising threats To avoid being just another layer of bureaucracy , such an official should be authorized to move budget resources between the State Department , USAID and the Defense Department as necessary to effectively prevent conflicts Under these circumstances , aid should be categorized in the budget as national security spending , not non defense discretionary spending And the Trump national security team should make sure American leadership on these issues remains the bipartisan priority it has been for decades , starting with proposing and defending a strong budget commitment to these efforts right now The next few months could mark a turning point for foreign assistance , and it matters greatly what kind We could see the erosion of support for a cost effective instrument of foreign policy and national influence and we would see the consequences of such negligence later , probably in the form of military commitments or we could see a reform that makes foreign assistance a reflection of American ideals and a rigorous instrument of American interests The latter is a worthy and necessary goal for a great nation Michael Gerson is a nationally syndicated columnist who appears twice weekly in The Post",true

"President Trump is set to sign legislation which will make medical marijuana federally legal for terminally ill patients The bill , known as the Right to Try Act , will prohibit the FDA from banning natural cures , and allow patients to try medications that have not been approved by the FDA , but are currently under clinical trial Right to Try was passed unanimously by the Senate last summer and by the House of Representatives on Tuesday in a vote of 250 to 169 , after Trump personally lobbied for its passage While the bill s provisions are targeted at a wide range of medications , they also apply to medical marijuana thanks to a clinical trial being conducted by the Multidisciplinary Association of Psychedelic Sciences \( MAPS \) Big legislation will be signed by me shortly After many years , RIGHT TO TRY and big changes to DODD FRANK Donald J Trump \( realDonaldTrump \) May 23 , 2018 Herb reports The MAPS trial , currently in the second phase of the FDA approval process , is testing the effectiveness of smoked cannabis in veterans with PTSD and meets all of the criteria set out by the Right to Try The majority of states already have their own form of Right to Try legislation , with one notable exception being New York In Utah , a recently passed law specifically addresses the right of terminally ill patients to try cannabis However , because cannabis remains federally prohibited , even if a terminally ill patient has the Right to Try cannabis on the state level , they re still in violation of federal law The Right to Try bill , recently passed by Congress , would change that In addition to cannabis , MDMA and psilocybin could also potentially be used by eligible patients since FDA trials of both substances meet the requirements set out in the federal bill What s not clear is what illnesses qualify as life threatening Post traumatic stress disorder , for example , could be argued to be life threatening given the high rates of suicide among those who are diagnosed , but it s up for debate It s likely that those details will be hammered out on a state by state basis in jurisdictions that have already passed their own version of Right to Try The full title of the bill suggests as much stating , in accordance with State law However , in states that lack their own local provisions , the new bill appears to leave plenty of room for interpretation and a potential conflict with local drug laws Under the broad wording of the federal bill , no specific illnesses are mentioned Instead , an eligible patient is defined as , Diseases or conditions where the likelihood of death is high unless the course of the disease is interrupted and Diseases or conditions with potentially fatal outcomes , where the endpoint of clinical trial analysis is survival Patients must also have exhausted all existing treatment options and must be unable to participate in the ongoing trials investigating the drug they want access to Additionally , they must provide written consent from a qualified physician who does not stand to gain from the trial The bill passed on Tuesday after receiving some opposition from Democrats on Capitol Hill who believe that the law will undermine the FDA s processes It s likely that President Trump will sign the bill in the coming days since he has personally lobbied Congress for its passage In January , Trump even mentioned the bill in his State of the Union Address saying , People who are terminally ill should not have to go from country to country to seek a cure I want to give them a chance right here at home It is time for the Congress to give these wonderful , incredible Americans the right to try Early Wednesday morning , Trump reiterated his support for the bill tweeting his intention to sign it into law",false

"The nomination of Gina Haspel to be the next director of the CIA faces trouble amid accusations that she personally supervised the torture of suspected terrorists and destroyed the evidence of the interrogations Haspel supervised a U S black site in Thailand in 2002 where Abu Zubeidah and Abdul Rahim Nashiri were tortured by CIA personnel In 2005 , she helped destroy 92 videotapes showing their torture She faced no consequences for those actions , and , assuming senators ask about them at her upcoming confirmation hearing , it s likely that her answers will be given in a closed , secret session But Haspel s actions may well have violated international law , specifically the U N Convention Against Torture Could she face prosecution \? Legally speaking , yes But politically , almost certainly not There are two legal avenues for a case against Haspel The first is the International Criminal Court \( ICC \) , and the second is a domestic court of a European nation The ICC is a better fit conceptually Its entire purpose is to prosecute people for genocide , war crimes , crimes against humanity , and aggression And despite legal counsel provided to the Bush administration at the time , the kinds of torture which Haspel supervised when she oversaw a CIA black site in Thailand are almost certainly violations of the U N Convention Against Torture Mary Ellen O Connell , professor of international law at Notre Dame Law School , told The Daily Beast that Haspel clearly broke the law Every member of the CIA is aware that the U S is a party to the Convention Against Torture Even members of the military would have had the duty to disobey a manifestly unlawful order from superiors to use torture Not only did Haspel not disobey orders , some experts believe that she gave them herself , while supervising the interrogation of Zubaydah and Nashiri , and subsequently destroyed the tapes The answers may be in the 6 , 000 page Senate intelligence committee report on torture during the Bush administration that remains classified \( only the 524 page executive summary is authorized for release \) Every member of the CIA is aware that the U S is a party to the Convention against Torture Even members of the military would have had the duty to disobey a manifestly unlawful order from superiors to use torture Mary Ellen O Connell , professor of International Law at Notre Dame Moreover , O Connell noted , the ICC itself is under pressure , with developing world countries leaving , for the court to look even handed Nearly all ICC prosecutions have thus far been of Africans a high profile investigation of a sitting CIA director would help dispel concerns that the ICC is biased in favor of first world defendants The problem with the ICC is jurisdiction Under the Rome Statute of the International Criminal Court , which established the body in 1998 , the court can only hear of abuses that were either committed by an ICC member nation or took place within an ICC member nation The United States is not a member It signed the Rome Statute , but the Senate didn t ratify it Thailand , where Haspel s black site was located at the international airport outside Bangkok is in the same situation It s a signatory , but not a member The only way that Haspel could be prosecuted at the ICC , then , is if she had responsibility for war crimes that took place in another country that , unlike Thailand , is an ICC member nation The most likely candidate is Poland , where the CIA operated another black site , but it is not known whether Haspel had responsibility for that site , or exactly what took place there In other words , the ICC may not have jurisdiction at all , and absent additional leaks , it s hard to see them gaining any information about what did or didn t happen in Poland Even Haspel s testimony to the Senate may be of little use It is common practice for intelligence officers to request a closed hearing for matters related to national security , and until the Russia Investigation , it was unheard of for members of Congress to divulge the records of such hearings At Haspel s public hearing , you can expect her to refuse to answer any question that has to do with torture , black sites , extraordinary rendition , on the grounds it could compromise national security to say nothing of her own prosecution So much , then , for the ICC What about the second option domestic courts in other countries \? Andrew Novak , professor of international law at George Mason University , told The Daily Beast that many countries have universal jurisdiction laws when the law of nations has been violated , as in cases of torture , slavery , or genocide They would have jurisdiction if someone s not being prosecuted elsewhere Moreover , after Rwanda and Yugoslavia , there are very broad laws to prosecute war crimes , Novak said This has happened before According to O Connell , cases against Americans implicated in torture have proceeded in Spain , Italy , and Belgium For example , O Connell said , Italy issued arrest warrants for CIA agents involved in the kidnapping and rendition of a Muslim cleric One of the agents was arrested on the warrant and held for a time in Panama Another woman was arrested in Portugal a few months ago A similar process is already underway in Haspel s case In Germany , the European Center for Constitutional and Human Rights \( ECCHR \) , has filed a series of complaints with the country s federal prosecutor , urging him to investigate Andreas Sch ller , director of ECCHR s International Crimes and Accountability Program , told The Daily Beast that this campaign has been going on for years In 2014 , when the Senate report on the CIA came out , we filed a brief criminal complaint They opened a preliminary examination not yet an investigation , but a file that establishes the initial suspicion to open a case In 2015 and 2016 , ECCHR filed two more extended complaints , one regarding the Army s alleged torture of inmates at Guantanamo Bay and Abu Ghraib , and a second on the CIA s alleged torture at black sites In 2016 , Gina Haspel s name was not known , Sch ller said , but when she was nominated as vice director of the CIA last year , we had a name to connect to other facts we had presented already Now , the ECCHR says , Gina Haspel must face arrest on traveling to Europe But would the German federal prosecutor really go after the the CIA director , when such a move would gravely damage U S German relations \? Sch ller agreed it was unlikely We don t expect to see that move , he said What we want to achieve is to say look , there was torture , there is the UN Convention Against Torture , and you the government know who this person is If you allow her to come here , you are making a clear political decision that you prioritize that over your obligations under the Convention Against Torture They can t say they didn t know who was coming here Moreover , Sch ller added , the legal accountability debate continues and makes life at least a little bit harder for the people making those decisions to conduct torture It s something they have to take into account In sum , while the actions documented in the Senate s report would be strong grounds for a war crimes prosecution of Gina Haspel , it s very unlikely that anyone will make use of them International law often takes a back seat to international relations , and realpolitik often dictates results Even when the law , and its violation , are clear",false

but ended up in a coma after she developed the flesh eating infection , necrotising fasciitis \( pictured now , using a crutch to walk despite being told she may never be able to use her legs again \) Mrs Sedgewick said 'Like a lot of women , I tried to keep a tidy bikini line So I had a quick trim with a new razor 'But over the weekend , I felt unwell and noticed a little pimple on my groin which kept bleeding I did n't think anything of it as I often got a rash from shaving 'Little did I know that this tiny pimple would almost cost me my life ' Mrs Sedgewick 's ordeal began in May 2012 Two days after she 'd shaved , she began experiencing dizziness and nausea She visited her GP , who took swabs of the area and prescribed her antibiotics to combat a suspected infection Later that day , her eldest daughter Megan discovered her lying in bed , with her legs covered in a bloody red rash Her body almost immediately went into shock , causing a red rash on her legs before they turned black from the rotting flesh \( pictured in September 2012 after a couple of skin graft procedures to repair some of the damage on her legs \) Afterwards , her GP called to say that the swabs had revealed it was serious and that she needed to go in for another examination But when her husband dropped her off at the surgery , she collapsed Like a lot of women , I tried to keep a tidy bikini line So I had a quick trim with a new razor Dana Sedgewick , 44 An ambulance was called and she was rushed to the trauma unit at the Northern General Hospital in Sheffield , where doctors diagnosed her with necrotising fasciitis The condition causes bacteria to release toxins that attack the surrounding soft tissue , and can be caused by a minor cut or scratch Mrs Sedgewick said 'By the time I got to the hospital , my legs were covered in black , rotting flesh It was touch and go as to whether I 'd make it ' Over the next ten hours , surgeons battled to save her legs Cutting through seven inches of infected skin , they removed the diseased flesh and reapplied skin from her back Rushed to intensive care , doctors placed her in a coma as her family were told she had just a 30 per cent chance of

Mrs Sedgewick that she had been very lucky to survive her terrifying ordeal with necrotising fasciitis \( pictured in hospital in June 2012 \) During surgery , she developed sepsis and was given a slim chance of survival after going into septic shock The silent killer strikes when an infection such as blood poisoning sparks a violent immune response in which the body attacks its own organs To increase her chances of survival , doctors decided to put her into an induced coma for nine days She said 'When I woke up , my legs were covered in bandages and I had no idea what had happened I thought I 'd been in a car accident 'But when the surgeon asked me if I remembered shaving , I suddenly recalled trimming my bikini line 'He told me that the spot on my groin had become infected , and I 'd been very lucky to survive ' Mrs Sedgewick was transferred to the hospital 's burns unit for specialist treatment , and was able to see her legs for the first time She said 'It was horrific All of my muscle had rotted away , and I had a crater of skin near my groin I felt like I was going to throw up 'But I knew that it could have been much , much worse I could easily have lost my legs or worse , died ' Mrs Sedgewick was transferred to the hospital 's burns unit for specialist treatment , and was able to see her legs for the first time \( pictured in hospital in June 2012 \) But with

ordeal on a day out to Endcliffe Park , Sheffield , on Christmas Day 2016 \) WHAT IS NECROTISING FASCIITIS \? Necrotising fasciitis is most commonly caused by an infection with group A Streptococcus Those infections normally last just a few days they are mild and typically clear themselves up But in some unusual cases it can develop into necrotising fasciitis They infect flat layers of a membrane known as the fascia , which are connective bands of tissue that surround muscles , nerves , fat , and blood vessels The infection also damages the tissues next to the fascia Sometimes toxins made by these bacteria destroy the tissue they infect , causing it to die When this happens , the infection is very serious and can result in loss of limbs or death Doctors warned that she 'd never walk again but she defied them and managed to walk on crutches , after intense physiotherapy Six weeks later , she was discharged from hospital Over the next four years , she underwent 21 operations to improve the appearance of her skin Mrs Sedgewick , who has been left with extensive scarring , said 'It did n't feel like my own body any more 'But with Mat 's support , I grew to see the scars as a reminder of how brave I 'd been , and how lucky I was to survive 'It 's incredible to think a tiny shaving spot could have killed me I had a very close shave indeed ' Dr Ron Daniels BEM , chief executive of the UK Sepsis Trust , said 'Stories like Dana 's illustrate the serious damage sepsis can do Every day in the UK , individuals and families have their lives torn apart by the condition 'But through better awareness , thousands of lives could be saved each year 'While necrotising fasciitis is a rare cause of sepsis , it 's crucial that members of the public and healthcare professionals consider it when presented with an unwell patient 'Anyone with flu like symptoms and one or more of the key signs of sepsis must call an ambulance immediately With every hour that passes before the correct antibiotics are administered , the risk of death increases ' Mrs Sedgewick , who has been left with extensive scarring , said 'It did n't feel like my own body any more But with Mat 's support , I grew to see the scars as a reminder of how brave I 'd been' \( pictured with her 47 year old husband Mathew after the ordeal \)",true

They know it happens , but haven t told anyone Told me they can t purge it from their system When I wondered how many times this has happened to me before they seemed to not care How many times has it happened to others \?

"By Theodore Shoebat New York City , the most pro abortion city of America , just placed a giant image of Satan on the Empire State Building , in order to convince people to worship and revere Mother Nature , which is really just a deceptive way of getting people to worship the devil The image is specifically that of the Hindu goddess Kali , who is no different than Satan , for the things which the Gentiles sacrifice , they sacrifice to devils , and not to God \( 1 Corinthians 10 20 \) Here is the image According to one report Artist Android Jones designed the fierce portrait of Kali , who is the Goddess of Time , Change , Power and Destruction , to make the point that Mother Nature now more than ever needs a fierce avatar to fight the dangers of pollution and extinction Kali is a demonic demon , who compels her followers to commit mass murder Just to demonstrate this to you \( especially for those who think that Hinduism is a religion of peace \) , in 19th century India there was a cult dedicated to the worship of Kali , called the Thugees The film , Indiana Jones and the Temple of Doom , portrays the Thugee cult as a murderous group that commits human sacrifice The reality is that there was indeed a Thugee cult in India and they did commit mass human sacrifice by the millions , but not by putting people in lava , rather they would strangle their victims to death According to the Guinness Book of Records the Thuggee cult was responsible for approximately 2 , 000 , 000 deaths Two million people ! This is a major holocaust and it was done by Hindus for the cause of Kali , the very satanic demon whose face is on the Empire State Building America is making itself as an offering to the devil , and do not think for a second that God is not angry For The foolish shall not stand in thy sight thou hatest all workers of iniquity \( Psalm 5 5 \) Now lets compare now to 1950s America Here is a photo \( thank you Fabio Emozione \) of Christian crosses upon the buildings , including the Empire State Building , of New York City We have to prepare our minds and intellect for this spiritual war that we are in This is why I made a 2 disk DVD series on teaching the warring spirit of the Christian Faith For too long Christianity has been watered down in our modern day as a pacifist faith with no inclination of fighting evil But is the Church here to be weak and useless \? This shocking and riveting two disk DVD set lecture series , passionately shows how Christianity is not here to be feeble , but for warfare , to be militant against tyranny and the forces of darkness You will not be dissatisfied after watching this lecture , and Bible studies will forevermore never be the same again CLICK HERE TO GET OUR 2 DISK DVD SERIES ON CHRISTIAN MILITANCY AND CHRISTIAN WARFARE AND JOIN THE FIGHT TODAY !

people killed inside the high school , two other people were found deceased outside the building , one victim was dead in the street , and two people made it to the hospital but died there Some of those who knew Cruz told the news media that they were aware of his fascination with weaponry an obsession he amply displayed in public through the social media platform One student told WSVN He s been a troubled kid , and he s always had a certain amount of issues going on He shot guns because he felt it gave him , I guess , an exhilarating feeling Cruz was open about his intentions to amass an arsenal For example , in 2016 , Cruz s page posted a photo of a shotgun and the caption said he wanted to buy it I plan on getting this but I need more information on it so if someone could give advice on how much I m spending and background cheeks please to god let me know Here s that photo The latest school shooting to horrify the United States has ignited the gun control debate once again , and Nikolas Cruz social media posts are likely to add fuel to that discussion because they are filled with weaponry Some people argued on social media that Cruz was actually a registered Democrat based on the voter registration of a Nicolas Cruz in Florida whose birthday is in May 1998 However , the Broward sheriff said in a press conference that the Nikolas Cruz accused of being the school shooter was born in September 1998 , not in May \( you can watch that comment here \) The accused school shooter s name is spelled Nikolas , not Nicolas , although many in the news media initially went with the latter The New York Times also verified Cruz s Instagram page The sheriff told the news media that the suspect s disturbing social media posts are under review A youth named Oli wrote on Twitter I knew the kid who shot up the school he had a ton of mental health issues that just got ignored by all the adults He literally had an Instagram where he posted pictures of animals he killed gruesomely and he physically assaulted one of my friends once One page was more recent On the second , the photos of weapons were posted in 2015 and 2016 to the Instagram page , including comments about wanting to purchase guns The page has since been taken down , although Heavy has verified that it belonged to the school shooting suspect Here is another one of the other troubling photos that were posted on the suspect s Instagram page He showed an interest in knives as well as guns The suspect posted about a Google search for the phrase Allahu Akbar in 2015 but the caption said , Well at least we now know what it means when a sand durka says allahu Akbar \? \? \? \? \? \? He also posted a graphic of a bull s eye with bullet holes in it , that contains the phrase Group therapy , sometimes it works He wrote in a caption It really does f cking work give it a try \) According to The Washington Times , Nikolas Cruz has been identified as a former Army JROTC member wielding an assault rifle , although authorities have not yet confirmed that account Here is the Instagram post that mentions Allahu Akbar Some people have been using that post to argue the suspect supported ISIS or Islamic terrorism but the post showed he was joking about terrorism and wanted to kill terrorists He wrote Durka durka Mohamed jihad how do I work this oh oh I mess up cooo booom ! ! durka durka bam boom explosions , and included a series of bomb smilies The Sheriff said it s too early to say whether there was a terrorism motive but authorities haven t found anything pointing to that They have not yet released a motive The suspect also showed anger in some of his Instagram posts For example , he posted a photo of himself giving the middle finger to the world , writing , F ck youuuuuuuuuuuu allllll A horrific scene unfolded at the school on the afternoon of February 14 , 2018 as students hid under desks , ran for their lives and waited for the SWAT team to clear their classrooms Football coach Aaron Feis is being hailed as a hero for trying to protect students his condition is not known According to The Miami Herald , Cruz was a known threat A teacher at the school told the Miami Herald that Cruz , 19 , had been identified as a potential threat to fellow students in the past , reported the newspaper , saying that Cruz was accused in the past of making threats The eyewitness accounts were terrifying Sarah Crescitelli hid in a bathroom and texted her parents If I don t make it I love you and I appreciated everything you did for me , according to The Herald Student Daniel Huerfano told Fox News that Nikolas Cruz was that weird kid that you see like a loner Another girl told Fox that Cruz was allegedly expelled last year after fighting with his ex girlfriend s new boyfriend She said Cruz was abusive to the girl There were allegations that the suspect held extremist views Jordan Jereb told the Associated Press that Cruz was a member of the white supremacist militia group Republic of Florida and participated in paramilitary drills in Tallahassee Jordan , a leader in the militia that has been described as similar to the Ku Klux Klan , told the AP that Cruz had previous trouble with a female and might have chosen Valentine s Day for the massacre for that reason According to Daily Beast , Jereb says a member of the group may have given Cruz a rifle However , local authorities in Tallahassee , where the group is based now say they can find no link between Nikolas Cruz and the ROF militia group , according to Tallahassee com Authorities conducted a gun trace and say that Cruz bought the gun he used The Sun Sentinel reported that Cruz was adopted by a loving older couple , but his father had died years before and his mother died just over three months before the school shooting His parents were named Lynda and Roger Cruz , and they also adopted his brother , the newspaper reported She was a homemaker , and he worked in advertising , according to The Sun Sentinel Trevor Hart , 16 , told The Sun Sentinel that Cruz participated in Army ROTC at the high school , had a bunch of weapons and Cruz had talked about shooting lizards , squirrels and frogs Other posts being circulated on social media are not Cruz s According to Buzzfeed , A fake antifa account is also spreading a hoax about the suspect wearing an antifa T shirt However , the man in the picture is a 24 year old named Marcel Fontaine , not the suspect You can read more about Nikolas Cruz here",true

"NewsThe latest updates from our PartyResponse to Mitt Romney s Claim That We Don t Need More Firemen , More Policemen , More Teachers PostedJune 11 , 2012Comments Show Romney Has No Idea What s Going On With Wisconsin s Middle Class FamiliesDemocratic National Committee Communications Director Brad Woodhouse and President of the Professional Fire Fighters of Wisconsin Mahlon Mitchell held a press call earlier today responding to Mitt Romney s statement that we don t need more firemen , more policemen , more teachers Listen to the Woodhouse Mitchell call here Wisconsinites know that firefighters , police officers , and teachers are the backbone of a successful community , and Romney suggesting they aren t vital to our well being is shocking These are hard working Americans who want to make their cities and towns a better place and ensure that every American has a shot at the American Dream and the opportunity to live in a safe , prosperous community To say anything otherwise is further proof that Mitt Romney is detached from the reality of Wisconsinites But this comes as no surprise coming from a candidate who has joked about being unemployed himself , said he likes firing people and claimed that corporations are people Obviously , Romney doesn t get it Mitt Romney saying we don t benefit from more firefighters , police officers and teachers is further proof of his philosophy of Romney Economics tax cuts for the wealthy over investments in our community the same formula that benefitted a few , but crashed our economy and punished the middle class In Massachusetts , firefighters were among the many victims of Romney Economics As Romney made clear on Friday , he doesn t care about these jobs but as governor , he didn t seem to care about their safety either , vetoing millions of dollars for fire safety equipment and targeting that equipment with a line item veto From that earlier call , these remarks prepared for delivery DNC Communications Director Brad WoodhouseThank you for joining the call today As you know , last week Mitt Romney showed just how out of touch he is with middle class Wisconsinites In addition to joking that he is unemployed , that he thinks corporations are people too , and telling us that he likes firing people , in a moment of candor Mitt Romney said we don t need more firefighters , policemen , and teachers These types of statements and this type of sentiment is absolutely shocking Listening to that , hardworking Americans have to wonder just how much more disconnected from the concerns of middle class Americans could Mitt Romney be \? These are hard working folks who want to make their cities and towns a better place To say anything otherwise is further proof that Mitt Romney is detached from the reality of hardworking Wisconsinites and the concerns of their everyday lives President Obama knows that firefighters , policemen , and teachers are the backbone of a successful community and that they have been hit hard by the recession On top of creating 4 3 million private sector jobs over the past 27 months , President Obama has given Congress a clear plan that would create as many as one million new jobs and put firefighters , policemen , and teachers back to work But Republicans in Congress are doing nothing to pass that plan and is leaving a million jobs on the table President Obama is the only one with a plan to move this country forward and strengthen our economy Among the first things he did in office , President Obama saved more than 300 , 000 educators jobs and helped states prevent massive layoffs And he s making sure they have the resources they need to do their jobs He supported projects to modernize our children s schools and smart reforms that give schools and school districts the flexibility they need to best serve students He also supported hiring programs , provided safety equipment and modernized firehouses and police stations that have helped thousands of police , firefighters and first responders keep their jobs and keep them safe President Obama understands that when these folks work , it not only helps our children in the classroom and keep our streets safe , but it also gives them more money to spend in their communities at the local shop or corner store President Obama is working hard to provide solutions And what is Mitt Romney s solution to strengthen the economy \? Fire more people Even Scott Walker in Wisconsin said that Mitt Romney learned the wrong lessons from Wisconsin in promising he will make cuts to these jobs Mitt Romney saying that we don t benefit from more firefighters , police officers , and teachers is further proof of his philosophy of Romney Economics more budget busting tax cuts for the wealthy and fewer rules for Wall Street the same formula that benefitted a few , but crashed our economy and punished the middle class And this is the same troubling formula that Mitt Romney put in place as governor of Massachusetts where he asked the middle class to continue to sacrifice more Romney made drastic cuts in funding to education and first responders , and Massachusetts fell to 47th out of 50 in job creation Middle class Americans can t afford Romney Economics tax cuts for the wealthy over investments in our community is not the formula for a successful community He s promising the same solutions now Make no mistake , though , the American people and the people of Wisconsin are going to continue to see through Mitt Romney s devastating economic plan It didn t work in Massachusetts , it won t work in Wisconsin , and it won t work for America President of the Professional Fire Fighters of Wisconsin Mahlon MitchellThank you , Brad I m Mahlon Mitchell , the President of the Professional Fire Fighters of Wisconsin , which proudly represents thousands of professional firefighters across Wisconsin and this country First responders and teachers were among the many victims of Romney Economics in Massachusetts Romney has made it absolutely crystal clear he doesn t care about our jobs And apparently , he doesn t care about Wisconsinites safety , either In his first year as governor of Massachusetts , Romney slashed investments in local aid , costing about 14 , 500 Massachusetts teachers , cops , librarians and others their jobs Romney also vetoed millions of dollars for fire safety equipment And it wasn t funding in all encompassing bill that Romney vetoed He specifically targeted this safety equipment by vetoing it with a line item veto Mitt Romney first cut funding for our coats , pants , helmets and boots equipment that is essential to do the job and that protects firefighters when they run into a burning building He went a step further when he cut funding for handheld lights that help firefighters see through the smoke , and the devices that help them communicate with other firefighters This type of funding would ve saved more lives by giving firefighters the tools they need to find the victims in a fire , and to track their fellow firefighters to make sure they make it out okay Even personal alert safety systems , air packs , tanks and compressors were on Romney s chopping block That s the equipment that literally keeps firefighters alive and breathing while they re surrounded by flames Firefighters simply cannot do their jobs without that lifesaving equipment Mitt Romney made it clear that equipment our first responders needed to keep themselves and our communities safe was not a priority to him And these cuts were so contrary to the values of the Massachusetts people , that both parties in the State House and Senate overrode these vetoes unanimously But that didn t stop Romney Economics Governor Romney even had the gall to put a stop to building a fire station that would have been a living memorial for six local firefighters who died in a warehouse fire This would have been important to both the families and the community , but it wasn t important enough to Mitt Romney Regardless of what Mitt Romney might think , more cops and firefighters keep our streets safe and our communities protected It s a fact , and anyone who says otherwise is completely disconnected from reality The truth is Romney simply didn t advocate for the folks who would ve risked their lives to save him if his house was on fire and his comments on Friday prove that nothing s changed I don t know a single person other than Mitt Romney who thinks we have too many teachers , too many police officers and too many firefighters in our communities Our first responders look out for us in tough times , and it s our turn to do the same for them Mitt Romney just doesn t understand that",true

"Human flesh is the finest meat in the world , according to Katy Perry , who puts the exquisite flavor of the meat down to the taboo nature of the product and the fact that forbidden pleasures are always the most delicious Going as far as to claim that cannibalism is way more popular than you might think , Katy Perry also claimed that so many people in Hollywood tell you that human meat is the best , the absolute best , meat in the world Speaking on French radio , the Bon Appetit singer also claimed cannibalism has gotten a bad rap due to squeamish Christians and their hypocritical virtues and morals , but consuming the flesh of humans is actually super healthy and good for you There are life enhancing vitamins and minerals in human flesh that you can t get from animal meat , Perry claimed When asked which vitamins and minerals are available in human flesh , but not animal meat , the singer hesitated and then said , I m telling you , these people live way longer than the average , and their health is way better too , believe me , Katy Perry said I m telling you this because I thought you guys really appreciated good food , the best food It s in your culture I thought you guys would understand Eating human meat is not that shocking if you get over your bullshit bourgeouis moral code for a minute The singer also described her first experience with cannibalism in Hollywood There is a group of old Hollywood guys who have an annual dinner party where the main dish is human Every guest is allowed to bring a plus one A few years ago , when I was new in town , I got invited by a good friend , I shouldn t say his name I guess , said Perry , who also explained that each year a new host is selected for the following year by drawing straws , you know \? It is the new host s responsibility to provide the main course , and it has to be human If he can t find a suitable person to serve as the meal Well the joke , I think it s a joke , is that the host will be eaten instead !

' Asked what happened at the dinner party , Perry explained , It was a huge , lavish feast Oh my god The featured dish was what they called Foie Humaine You guys should appreciate that , being French It s a pun on foie gras , get it \?

"For those of you that are evacuating from the coast , I just heard a great tip It 's called the one cup tip You put a cup of water in your freezer Freeze it solid and then put a quarter on top of it and leave it in your freezer That way when you come back after you 've been evacuated you can tell if your food went completely bad and just refroze or if it stayed Frozen while you were gone If the quarter has fallen to the bottom of the cup that means all the food defrosted and you should throw it out But if the quarter is either on the top or in the middle of the cup then your food may still be ok It would also be a great idea to leave this in your freezer all the time and if you lose power for any reason you will have this tip to fall back on If you do n't feel good about your food , just throw it out The main thing is for all to be safe Please SHARE this on your page",false

"By Christopher Ingraham By Christopher Ingraham Email the author October 14 , 2015 Email the author Follow cingrahamThis week a 2 year old in South Carolina found a gun in the back seat of the car he was riding in and accidentally shot his grandmother , who was sitting in the passenger seat This type of thing happens from time to time A little kid finds a gun , fires it , and hurts or kills himself or someone else These cases rarely bubble up to the national level except when someone , like a parent , ends up dead But cases like this happen a lot more frequently than you might think After spending a few hours sifting through news reports , I 've found at least 43 instances this year of somebody being shot by a toddler 3 or younger In 31 of those 43 cases , a toddler found a gun and shot himself or herself In August , for instance , a 21 month old in the St Louis area found a loaded handgun at his grandmother 's house and shot himself in the torso His mother took him to a local hospital , where he was pronounced dead Earlier in the year a Michigan 3 year old found a loaded 40 caliber handgun in a closet while his dad and brother were outside He shot himself in the head and died before rescue workers arrived This is what one year of gun deaths in America looks like The stories go on and on like this Roughly once a week this year , on average , a small child has found a gun , pointed it at himself or someone else , and pulled the trigger Boys are disproportionately likely to do this I could find only three cases where a girl under the age of 4 wounded someone with a gun In 13 of the 43 total incidents , a child 's self inflicted injuries were fatal In two other cases , another person died after being shot by a toddler a father in Alabama , and a 1 year old in Ohio In one instance , a 3 year old managed to wound both of his parents with a single gunshot at an Albuquerque motel Shootings by toddlers have happened in 24 states so far this year Missouri has seen the most , with five separate incidents Florida has had four Texas , three Due to the low number of total cases and the isolated nature of these incidents I 'd caution against drawing broad conclusions from the map above But it is worth noting that the shootings do n't necessarily follow broader population trends California , the most populous state in the nation , has n't had any Nobody has been shot by a toddler in New England or the Upper Midwest These numbers are probably an undercount There are likely instances of toddlers shooting people that result in minor injuries and no media coverage And there are probably many more cases where a little kid inadvertently shoots a gun and does n't hit anyone , resulting in little more than a scared kid and \( hopefully \) chastened parents Notably , these numbers do n't include cases where toddlers are shot , intentionally or otherwise , by older children or adults Dozens of preschoolers are killed in acts of homicide each year , according to the Centers for Disease Control and Prevention But I have n't included those figures here How often do children in the U S unintentionally shoot and kill people \? We don t know These cases are invariably referred to as accidents in media reports But as Everytown for Gun Safety , a group that advocates for stricter gun laws , argues , many incidents like this are preventable In a study of accidental shootings by children of all ages \( not just toddlers \) , they estimate that more than two thirds of these tragedies could be avoided if gun owners stored their guns responsibly and prevented children from accessing them There are policy and technical responses to preventable childhood gun deaths as well States and localities could require guns to be locked up at home , a policy supported by 67 percent of Americans Various types of smart gun technology , which prevent anyone other than their owners from firing a given gun , exist as well But gun lock requirements and smart guns have been vehemently opposed by the National Rifle Association and its allies Instead , the NRA continues to promote a response that seeks to solve gun problems with more guns , and aims to broaden the saturation of firearms in nearly every sphere of public and private life , from homes to schools to churches to bars to airports and beyond In a country with more guns than people , it 's only natural that a certain number of small children are going get their hands on an unsecured firearm , with tragic consequences Guns in America For every criminal killed in self defense , 34 innocent people die Depending on where you stand on gun policy , you may feel that 13 dead toddlers in 10 months is too many Or , you might reason that stuff happens , and that this is part of the price we must pay to protect our gun rights I 've included my tally of toddler shootings below News sources are linked in the City column Know of any this year that I missed \?

"b Curiously , the cancer rate is 10 percent higher in the left breast than in the right This left side bias holds true for both men and women and it also applies to the skin cancer melanoma Researchers Orjan Hallberg of Hallberg Independent Research in Sweden and Ollie Johansson of The Karolinska Institute in Sweden , writing in the June issue of the journal Pathophysiology , suggest a surprising explanation that not only points to a common cause for both cancers , it may change your sleeping habits For unknown reasons the rates of breast cancer and melanoma have both increased steadily in the last 30 years Exposure to the sun elevates the risk of melanoma , but the sun 's intensity has not changed in the last three decades Stranger still , melanoma most commonly affects the hip , thighs and trunk , which are areas of the body protected from the sun What is responsible for the left side dominance and increasing incidence of these cancers \? An intriguing clue comes from the Far East In Japan there is no correlation between the rates of melanoma and breast cancer as there is in the West , and there is no left side prevalence for either disease Moreover , the rate of breast cancer in Japan is significantly lower than in the West only 3 percent of what is seen in Sweden , for example The rate of prostate cancer in Japan is only 10 percent of that in the U K and U S The researchers suggest an explanation based on differences in sleeping habits in Japan and Western countries Previous research has shown that both men and women prefer to sleep on their right sides The reasons for this general preference are unclear , but sleeping on the right side may reduce the weight stress on the heart , and the heartbeat is not as loud as when sleeping on the left Still , there is no reason to suspect that people in Japan sleep in positions that are any different from those in the West The beds in Japan , however , are different The futons used for sleeping in Japan are mattresses placed directly on the bedroom floor , in contrast to the elevated box springs and mattress of beds used in the West A link between bedroom furniture and cancer seems absurd , but this , the researchers conclude , is the answer The first line of evidence they cite comes from a 2007 study in Sweden conducted between 1989 and 1993 that revealed a strong link between the incidence of melanoma and the number of FM and TV transmission towers covering the area where the individuals lived Despite epidemiological correlations like this one suggesting the possibility that electromagnetic radiation from FM and TV broadcasts stations could suppress the immune system and promote cancer , the strength of these electromagnetic fields is so feeble it has been difficult to imagine any biological basis for the correlation Consider , however , that even a TV set cannot respond to broadcast transmissions unless the weak electromagnetic waves are captured and amplified by an appropriately designed antenna Antennas are simply metal objects of appropriate length sized to match the wavelength of a specific frequency of electromagnetic radiation Just as saxophones are made in different sizes to resonate with and amplify particular wavelengths of sound , electromagnetic waves are selectively amplified by metal objects that are the same , half or one quarter of the wavelength of an electromagnetic wave of a specific frequency Electromagnetic waves resonate on a half wavelength antenna to create a standing wave with a peak at the middle of the antenna and a node at each end , just as when a string stretched between two points is plucked at the center In the U S bed frames and box springs are made of metal , and the length of a bed is exactly half the wavelength of FM and TV transmissions that have been broadcasting since the late 1940s In Japan most beds are not made of metal , and the TV broadcast system does not use the 87 to 108 megahertz frequency used in Western countries Thus , as we sleep on our coil spring mattresses , we are in effect sleeping on an antenna that amplifies the intensity of the broadcast FM TV radiation Asleep on these antennas , our bodies are exposed to the amplified electromagnetic radiation for a third of our life spans As we slumber on a metal coil spring mattress , a wave of electromagnetic radiation envelops our bodies so that the maximum strength of the field develops 75 centimeters above the mattress in the middle of our bodies When sleeping on the right side , the body 's left side will thereby be exposed to field strength about twice as strong as what the right side absorbs If this study is correct , the solution is simple Replace the metal in our beds with a nonmetallic mattress or orient your bed , like an antenna , away from the direction of the local FM TV transmission tower Call it high tech feng shui if you like , but if this new study has not identified the cause of left side cancer , it will , for some , be the cause of insomnia ABOUT THE AUTHOR R Douglas Fields , Ph D is the Chief of the Nervous System Development and Plasticity Section at the National Institute of Child Health and Human Development and Adjunct Professor at the University of Maryland , College Park Fields , who conducted postdoctoral research at Stanford University , Yale University , and the NIH , is Editor in Chief of the journal Neuron Glia Biology and member of the editorial board of several other journals in the field of neuroscience He is the author of the new book The Other Brain \( Simon and Schuster \) , about cells in the brain \( glia \) that do not communicate using electricity His hobbies include building guitars , mountain climbing , and scuba diving He lives in Silver Spring , Md The views expressed are those of the author and are not necessarily those of Scientific American Image credit iStockphoto",false
"The four words that would help propel Donald Trump to the White House were an inspiration born years before , when hardly anyone but Trump himself could imagine him taking the oath of office as the 45th president of the United States It happened on Nov 7 , 2012 , the day after Mitt Romney lost what had been presumed to be a winnable race against President Obama Republicans were spiraling into an identity crisis , one that had some wondering whether a GOP president would ever sit in the Oval Office again But on the 26th floor of a golden Manhattan tower that bears his name , Trump was coming to the conclusion that his own moment was at hand And in typical fashion , the first thing he thought about was how to brand it One after another , phrases popped into his head We Will Make America Great That one did not have the right ring Then , Make America Great But that sounded like a slight to the country I said , That is so good I wrote it down , Trump recalled in an interview I went to my lawyers I have a lot of lawyers in house We have many lawyers I have got guys that handle this stuff Five days later , Trump signed an application with the U S Patent and Trademark Office , in which he asked for exclusive rights to use Make America Great Again for political action committee services , namely , promoting public awareness of political issues and fundraising in the field of politics He enclosed a 325 registration fee His was a vision that ran against the conventional wisdom of the time in fact , it was much the opposite , Trump said To save itself , the Republican establishment was convinced , the GOP would have to sand off its edges , become kinder and more inclusive Make America Great Again was divisive and backward looking It made no nod to diversity or civility or progress It sounded like a death wish But Trump had seen something different in the country , and in the daily lives of its struggling citizens I felt that jobs were hurting , he said I looked at the many types of illness our country had , and whether it s at the border , whether it s security , whether it s law and order or lack of law and order Democrats slammed it If you re looking for someone to say what is wrong with America , I m not your candidate I think there is more right than wrong , Democratic nominee Hillary Clinton said I don t think we have to make America great Her husband , former president Bill Clinton , went so far as to declare it a racist dog whistle I m actually old enough to remember the good old days , and they weren t all that good in many ways , he said at a rally in Orlando The slogan itself was not entirely original Ronald Reagan and George H W Bush had used Let s Make America Great Again in their 1980 campaign a fact that Trump maintained he did not know until about a year ago But he didn t trademark it , Trump said of Reagan His decision to claim legal ownership reflected a businessman s mind set I think I m somebody that understands marketing , Trump said Trump Organization lawyer Alan Garten said Trump holds upward of 800 trademarks in more than 80 countries The trademark became effective on July 14 , 2015 , a month after Trump formally announced his campaign and met the legal requirement that he was actually using it for the purposes spelled out in his application Having won the trademark , Trump was aggressive in protecting his idea When his GOP primary rivals Sen Ted Cruz \( Tex \) and Wisconsin Gov Scott Walker began tucking make America great again into their own speeches , Trump s lawyers fired off cease and desist letters Trump was an impulsive and erratic candidate who ran a chaotic campaign I didn t know it was going to catch on like it did It s been amazing , Trump said There were plenty of snickers when his Federal Election Commission filings showed that his campaign was spending more on Make America Great Again trucker caps than on polling , political consultants , staff or television ads An appropriate icon for his failing campaign , the Washington Examiner s Philip Wegmann wrote in late October Trump saw the hats as a fundraising and advertising vehicle He was thrilled when his campaign headgear landed in the New York Times Style section during Fashion Week , no less In the Style section , it was the ornament what do you call that \? an accessory They said the accessory of the year You know the hat You d see people going to the fanciest balls at the Waldorf Astoria wearing red hats , he exulted As is often the case , Trump s description is more than a little hyperbolic None of which fazed the celebrity billionaire who had debuted the hats by wearing one during a July 2015 trip to the Mexican border or the legions of supporters who raced to snap them up Trump had designed them himself , he said The basic models sold through his campaign website were priced at 25 How many did we sell \? Does anyone know \? Millions ! Trump said in the interview It was copied , unfortunately It was knocked off by 10 to one It was knocked off by others However many hats he sold , what cannot be disputed is that Make America Great Again caught on It was the most effective kind of political message , bite sized and visceral It actually inspired me , Trump said , because to me , it meant jobs It meant industry , and meant military strength It meant taking care of our veterans That kind of mission statement was something that Clinton s campaign for all its poll testing and high priced advice from Madison Avenue struggled to articulate Her strategists considered 85 possibilities for a general election campaign slogan before settling on Stronger Together , according to an email from the account of campaign chairman John Podesta that was published by WikiLeaks What they were up against was nothing short of a marketing genius , said David Axelrod , who had been Obama s chief political strategist Trump understood the market that he was trying to reach You can t deny him that While Clinton carried the popular vote , Trump lined up the states he needed to win what mattered the electoral college Halfway through his interview with The Washington Post , Trump shared a bit of news He already has decided on his slogan for a reelection bid in 2020 Are you ready \? he said Get me my lawyer ! the president elect shouted Two minutes later , one arrived Will you trademark and register , if you would , if you like it I think I like it , right \? Do this Keep America Great , with an exclamation point With and without an exclamation Keep America Great , Trump said Got it , the lawyer replied That bit of business out of the way , Trump returned to the interview I never thought I d be giving you my expression for four years from now , he said But I am so confident that we are going to be , it is going to be so amazing It s the only reason I give it to you All of which raises the questions How can greatness be measured and sensed \? What does it even mean \? Being a great president has to do with a lot of things , but one of them is being a great cheerleader for the country , Trump said And we re going to show the people as we build up our military , we re going to display our military That military may come marching down Pennsylvania Avenue That military may be flying over New York City and Washington , D C , for parades I mean , we re going to be showing our military , he added The president elect has an ambitious to do list for the next four years building stronger borders , keeping the country safe against terrorism , producing more jobs , repealing the Affordable Care Act , replacing it with something better , promoting excellence in engineering and science , investing in modern infrastructure Ultimately , it will be up to the people for whom Make America Great Again was a covenant , not a slogan , to decide whether the 45th president has lived up to his promise I think they have to feel it , Trump acknowledged Honestly , you haven t seen anything yet Wait till you see what happens , starting next Monday , he said A lot of things are going to happen He has been holding interviews and meetings as he prepares to enter the White House Wait 1 second to continue Alice Crites contributed to this report",true

"Flashback Hillary Clinton s Longtime Support for Sanctuary CitiesAP Photo Frank Franklin IIby Caroline May 8 Jul 2015 08 Jul , 20158 Jul , 2015While Democratic presidential candidate Hillary Clinton now says cities should comply with federal immigration requests , she has been a supporter of sanctuary city policies in the past In 2007 at a Democratic debate in New Hampshire Clinton expressed support for sanctuary city policies NBC S Tim Russert Senator Clinton , would you allow the sanctuary cities to exist \? Clinton Well , in addition to the general points that have been made , that I agree with , why do they have sanctuary cities \? In large measure because if local law enforcement begins to act like immigration enforcement officers , what that means is that you will have people not reporting crimes You will have people hiding from the police And I think that is a real direct threat to the personal safety and security of all the citizens So this is a result of the failure of the federal government , and that s where it needs to be fixed Russert But you would allow the sanctuary cities to disobey the federal law Clinton Well , I don t think there is any choice The ICE groups go in and raid individuals , but if you re a local police chief and you re trying to solve a crime that you know people from the immigrant community have information about , they may not talk to you if they think you re also going to be enforcing the immigration laws Local law enforcement has a different job than federal immigration enforcement The problem is the federal government has totally abdicated its responsibility During an interview with Bill O Reilly in 2008 , highlighted this week by MRCTV , Clinton was equally on board with the idea of sanctuary policies O Reilly Are you going to crack down on the sanctuary cities \? Clinton No , I m not And I ll tell you why O Reilly Whoa Clinton I m not , I m not because the reason why a lot of those folks do it in New York , why do police officers turn a blind eye \? O Reilly Because they want them to report crimes Clinton They want them to report crimes Because O Reilly Doesn t override Clinton the well , sometimes you have two competing values You want to report crime , you want to protect people and the violence spills way beyond whatever community In the wake of the murder of Kate Steinle at the hands of a multiple deportee , multiple felon Clinton is now saying cities should cooperate with federal officials CNN s Brianna Keilar Last week , an undocumented immigrant who had been deported five times , killed a 32 year old woman , Kate Steinle , in San Francisco , a sanctuary city where local law enforcement does not enforce federal immigration laws When you last ran for President you supported sanctuary cities In light of this terrible incident , does that change anything about your view on this \? Clinton Well what should be done is any city should listen to the Department of Homeland Security , which as I understand it , urged them to deport this man again after he got out of prison another time Here s a case where we ve deported , we ve deported , we ve deported , he ends back up in our country and I think the city made a mistake The city made a mistake not to deport someone that the federal government strongly felt should be deported So I have absolutely no support for a city that ignores the strong evidence that should be acted on However , there are , like if it were the first time traffic citation , if it were something minor , a misdemeanor , that s entirely different This man had already been deported five times , and he should have been deported at the request of the federal government Read More Stories About Comment count on this article reflects comments made on Breitbart com and Facebook Visit Breitbart 's Facebook Page BREITBART CONNECT",true
"Last Update December 3 , 2016Trump spokeswoman defends candidate after he called 'Mexican' judge a 'hater'EmailRepublican presidential candidate Donald Trump gives a foreign policy speech at the Mayflower Hotel in Washington , Wednesday , April 27 , 2016 Trump 's highly anticipated foreign policy speech Wednesday will test whether the Republican presidential front runner , known for his raucous rallies and eyebrow raising statements , can present a more presidential persona as he works to unite the GOP establishment behind him \( AP Photo Evan Vucci \) The Donald Trump campaign continued railing against the judge who is presiding over the fraud case against the mogul s university , linking his past membership in a Latino lawyers group as a reason to doubt his objectivity Trump spokeswoman Katrina Pierson on Monday said that Judge Gonzalo Curiel had been member of a group that has been overtly against her candidate I think what 's really interesting about this particular judge as Mr Trump refers to him as a 'Trump hater' is he even mentions on his judicial questionnaire that he was a La Raza Lawyers Association member , Pierson said in an interview on CNN Trump has been trying to get Curiel off the fraud case against Trump University since 2014 At a campaign rally on Friday in San Diego , Trump denounced Curiel s handling of the case , which involves two class action suits that accuse Trump University of deceptive practices against customers who were promised insight into the mogul s strategies for succeeding in real estate The lawsuit overseen by Curiel states that Trump University 's nationwide seminars and classes were like infomercials and pressured students to buy more but did n't deliver as promised in spite of students paying as much as 35 , 000 for seminars The Washington Post reported that Curiel 's order to release an estimated 1 , 000 pages of Trump University related documents cites heightened public interest in Trump and that he had placed the integrity of these court proceedings at issue The judge appeared to reject the argument by Trump attorneys that the information had commercial value , saying that there was no support for the assertion that Trump University may resume operations Trump assailed the judge s scheduling for a trial to begin in November The candidate already was displeased with Curiel 's decision last year to accept the court complaints against Trump University as class action suits The trial is going to take place sometime in November , Trump said at the rally There should be no trial This should have been dismissed on summary judgment easily , everybody says it But I have a judge who is a hater of Donald Trump , a hater He 's a hater The judge , who happens to be , we believe , Mexican , which is great I think that 's fine It was the second time this year Trump tried to link the judge 's ethnicity to his ability to be impartial in the case In February , Trump said in an interview on Meet the Press that Curiel 's Hispanic heritage was a reason the judge was not ruling in his favor in the case The judge was born and raised in Indiana His parents came from Mexico , according to various published reports Pierson defended Trump s comments , which many later criticized as unfair and bigoted , saying the judge s ethnicity was irrelevant and should not have been singled out She also questioned the judge s involvement with the National Council of La Raza , a national civil rights group This is an organization that has been out there organizing anti Trump protesters with the Mexican flags , Pierson said , they are pushing it The signs have been very apparent And so Mr Trump is just stating the obvious Trump has attacked Mexico as a country that dumps drug dealers and other criminals along the U S Mexico border A cornerstone of his campaign has been that he will crack down on illegal immigration He has vowed to build a huge wall that he says he will force Mexico to fund , and also has vowed to have a mass deportation to expel the estimated 11 million undocumented immigrants living in the United States The CNN interviewer told Pierson that the judge is American born Pierson said she was not sure of his ethnic origin , but argued that it was relevant Well , it 's because of what we see outside of these rallies , these anti Trump rallies , these criminal rallies , these criminal protesters out there defacing property and attacking police officers , Pierson said They 're doing so under the guise of an anti Trump protest , with their Mexican flags , and La Raza and this judge is connected to that Curiel is not permitted to address Trump s attacks He has said only that during the civil case against Trump University , the mogul has become a leading presidential candidate who placed the integrity of these court proceedings at issue Earlier in his career , Curiel prosecuted drug smugglers and cartel leaders , a mission that made him a target of assassination attempts and required him to live under tight security In 1997 , for example , a gunman for a Tijuana drug cartel spoke in a bugged conversation of being willing and able to arranged Curiel s murder , according a Los Angeles Times story from that year A 2002 New York Times story credited Curiel with being one of the key figures in one of the U S s most important victories in the fight against drug smuggling across the border As a chief drug prosecutor in the late 1990 s , Curiel and other law enforcement officials in California of Mexican descent were able to use their Spanish language skills and knowledge of the culture to win the trust of their police counterparts in Mexico and identify the corrupt officials who were sabotaging U S Mexico efforts to crack down on the drug cartels According to participants on both sides , the Mexicans looked across the table at Mr Chavez , Mr Vega and Mr Curiel , all born of Mexican parents , and the spark of recognition lit a fire , the Times story said ''It could n't but help , '' Mr Curiel said to the Times in 2002 ''We were working without the disconnect of interpreters and barriers of culture When it comes down to it , this involves the country of our parents ''The Associated Press contributed to this report Like us on FacebookFollow us on Twitter InstagramTrending in Politics",false
"WASHINGTON The Justice Department announced today that there is insufficient evidence to pursue federal criminal civil rights charges against the Wilmington Police Department \( WPD \) Corporals involved in the fatal shooting of 28 year old paraplegic Jeremy McDole on Sept 23 , 2015 Officials from the U S Attorney s Office of the District of Delaware , the Justice Department s Civil Rights Division and the FBI met today with representatives of the McDole family to inform them of this determination The department makes this decision based on the determination that the evidence does not indicate that the corporals willfully used excessive force in shooting McDole Federal authorities devoted significant time and resources to reviewing the events surrounding McDole s death This involved reviewing detailed and lengthy analysis of voluminous materials , including police reports , law enforcement accounts , witness statements , dispatch logs , physical evidence reports , the autopsy report and an enhanced cell phone video of the incident The team of experienced federal prosecutors from the Civil Rights Division Criminal Section and the U S Attorney s Office reviewed thousands of pages of documents and other evidence to determine whether the subject corporals violated federal law Under the applicable federal criminal civil rights statute , prosecutors must establish , beyond a reasonable doubt , that a law enforcement officer willfully deprived an individual of a Constitutional right To establish willfulness , federal authorities must show that the officer acted with the deliberate and specific intent to do something the law forbids This is the highest standard of intent imposed by law Mistake , misperception , negligence or poor judgment are not sufficient to establish a federal criminal civil rights violation The evidence developed during the investigation revealed that corporals Thomas Silva , James MacColl , Thomas Lynch and Joseph Dellose were dispatched pursuant to a 911 call reporting that a male suspect in a wheelchair , later identified as McDole , was armed with a handgun and may have sustained self inflicted gunshot wounds Silva arrived first at the scene , and the 911 caller pointed out McDole and said McDole was still in possession of a gun Silva commanded McDole to show his hands and drop the gun , but McDole instead rolled his wheelchair into the street and reached into his waistband MacColl arrived next and saw that McDole was not responding to Silva s commands Dellose arrived and immediately approached McDole from the opposite direction of Silva and MacColl Dellose also ordered McDole to show his hands however , McDole continued to reach into his waistband Dellose stated that he observed the handle of a gun , so he fired a round at McDole from his shotgun Lynch arrived immediately after Dellose fired After the shotgun blast , McDole continued moving his hands around his lap and waistband McDole then reached into the right side of his waistband as if to grab something and began withdrawing his right hand , in which he held what the corporals believed to be a handgun Silva , MacColl and Lynch each fired four shots at McDole from their service pistols McDole fell to the ground and a responding officer approached him and removed from his waistband a handgun The incident was recorded in a cell phone video , which was enhanced at the FBI Laboratory The video shows McDole continuously moving his hands around his waistband as WPD officers yell for him to show his hands and drop the gun The camera pans away from McDole the instant before the shotgun blast Toward the end of the video , McDole reaches into his waistband with his right hand , then begins pulling his right hand upward A volley of shots is heard , but the camera pans away from McDole for a moment while the shots are being fired Several law enforcement officers and civilians witnessed the shooting and the events leading up to it These witnesses corroborated the claim of the corporals who fired at McDole that McDole failed to respond to law enforcement commands and continued moving his hands around his waistband when the shots were fired The investigation also revealed that McDole s DNA was located on the grip of the handgun recovered from his waistband and that there was gunshot residue was on McDole s right palm and shirt sleeve There is insufficient evidence to disprove the corporals claims that they shot McDole in self defense and in defense of nearby civilians and fellow officers Other witnesses also corroborate Dellose s claim that McDole was reaching into his side immediately before Dellose fired his shotgun , even though the video does not capture that precise moment Accordingly , the government cannot disprove that Dellose saw a handgun or believed he saw a handgun When Silva , MacColl and Lynch fired their weapons a few moments later , they had reason to believe that McDole had a gun that he had recently fired They also knew that McDole had not responded to repeated commands to show his hands and drop the gun , was reaching into his waistband and was at that moment pulling his hand upward The testimonial , video and physical evidence corroborates the corporals version of the events Accordingly , after extensive investigation into this incident , the federal review of this incident has been closed without prosecution This decision is limited strictly to an application of the high legal standard required to prosecute the case under the federal civil rights statute it does not reflect an assessment of any other aspect of the incident that led to McDole s death The U S Attorney s Office of the District of Delaware and the Civil Rights Division are committed to investigating allegations of civil rights violations by law enforcement officers and will continue to devote the resources required to ensure that all allegations of serious civil rights violations are fully and completely investigated The department will aggressively prosecute criminal civil rights violations whenever there is sufficient evidence to do so",true
"The new health care law will cut 500 billion from Medicare That will hurt the quality of our care 60 Plus Association on Wednesday , September 8th , 2010 in a campaign adMedicare 'cuts' in the health care law will hurt seniors , says 60 Plus AssociationBy Angie Drobnic Holan on Monday , September 20th , 2010 at 3 23 p m The conservative 60 Plus Association has run similar ads against Democratic members of Congress Guess which member of Congress betrayed seniors by voting in favor of the 2010 health care law , a vote for Nancy Pelosi 's health care bill which will cut 500 billion from Medicare and hurt the quality of our care Which member is it \? Well , lots of them , according to the 60 Plus Association The advocacy group bills itself as a conservative alternative to the American Association of Retired Persons \( AARP \) and supports a free enterprise , less government , less taxes approach to seniors issues It has created substantially similar ads to run against Democratic members of Congress in districts around the country In Florida , the group is targeting Rep Allen Boyd , who represents the Panhandle area , and Reps Alan Grayson and Suzanne Kosmas , both from central Florida It is also running ads against Wisconsin members Steve Kagen , representing Green Bay and Appleton , and Ron Kind of western Wisconsin Another target is John Boccieri of Canton , Ohio Still other ads target House members from Arizona , New York , Indiana and Pennsylvania It 's true that all of these members of Congress voted in favor of the new health care law when it came up for a vote on March 21 , 2010 But the ad gives a highly misleading impression about funding for Medicare Here 's the text of the ad running against Boyd , the Florida congressman who represents the northwest Panhandle area Alan Boyd has betrayed Florida 's seniors Instead of voting to protect us , he supported Nancy Pelosi 's liberal agenda Boyd voted for Nancy Pelosi 's health care bill which will cut 500 billion from Medicare That will hurt the quality of our care Florida 's seniors can send Alan Boyd a message He betrayed us , and this November , we 'll remember Because of our previous fact checks on the health care law , we knew this ad was leaving out important details on how the health care law , formally known as the Patient Protection and Affordable Care Act , changed Medicare Medicare , a government run health insurance program , provides health care coverage for the vast majority of Americans over age 65 It accounts for about 12 percent of the federal budget It 's important to note that the law does not take 500 billion out of the current Medicare budget Rather , the bill attempts to slow the program 's future growth , curtailing just over 500 billion in future spending over the next 10 years Medicare spending will still increase the nonpartisan Congressional Budget Office projects Medicare spending will reach 929 billion in 2020 , up from 499 billion in actual spending in 2009 Next , we wanted to address how those reductions are expected to affect the quality of care Some \( changes \) increase Medicare spending to improve benefits and coverage , said Tricia Neuman , director of the Medicare Policy Project at the nonprofit Kaiser Family Foundation Other provisions reduce the growth in Medicare spending to help the program operate more efficiently and help fund coverage expansions to the uninsured in the underlying health reform legislation Other provisions are designed to improve the delivery of care and quality of care Neuman walked through the changes in an easily digestible tutorial on the Kaiser Family Foundation 's website , a good non ideological explanation for people interested in changes to Medicare under health care reform Some of the savings are for relatively minor programs , such as 36 billion for increases in premiums for higher income beneficiaries and 12 billion for administrative changes The law directs a new national board to identify 15 5 billion in savings , but the board the Independent Payment Advisory Board is prohibited from proposing anything that would ration care or reduce or modify benefits More significantly , there 's also 136 billion in projected savings that would come from changes to the Medicare Advantage program About 25 percent of Medicare beneficiaries are enrolled in a Medicare Advantage plan Let 's back up for a minute and explain Medicare Advantage There are two basic ways most people get Medicare coverage They enroll in traditional Medicare and a prescription drug plan through the government and maybe buy a supplemental policy to cover most out of pocket costs Or they enroll in Medicare Advantage programs \( they include drug plans \) , which are run by private insurers Medicare Advantage programs typically have more generous benefits such as dental and vision coverage Some plans even pay the patient s monthly Medicare premium , which can amount to about 100 The Medicare Advantage program was intended to bring more efficiency from the private sector to the Medicare program , but it has n't worked as planned A June 2009 analysis from the Medicare Payment Advisory Commission said that the Advantage programs costs taxpayers on average of 14 percent more than the traditional Medicare plan President Barack Obama has said repeatedly that the Medicare Advantage plan wastes public money that could be put to better use The health care law that President Obama signed in March phases out extra payments for Medicare Advantage programs over the next three to six years to bring their costs in line with traditional Medicare and institutes other rules for the program How these payment changes will affect beneficiaries remains to be seen but is expected to vary across the country , Neuman said The Congressional Budget Office projects the law will result in fewer enrollees in Medicare Advantage plans , and fewer extra benefits for Medicare Advantage enrollees , on average It is also possible that the number of plans available to beneficiaries will decline which may or may not be a concern On average , Medicare beneficiaries have 30 plans available to them in 2010 PolitiFact has waded into this argument about whether the adjustments to the Medicare Advantage option constitute a cut before Most experts we talked to had the same answer yes and no On one hand , they might not be considered cuts because nowhere in the bill are benefits actually eliminated , experts said And other parts of the bill expand coverage for seniors and ultimately make some components of Medicare less expensive for patients \( More on this in a bit \) Still , changes could be in store for Medicare Advantage participants , especially the extra benefits that people receive under Advantage , experts said But basic benefits that mirror regular Medicare will stay the same Finally , there 's 220 billion in Medicare savings achieved by reducing annual increases in payments health care providers would otherwise receive from Medicare The reductions are part of programs intended to improve care and make it more efficient , such as reducing payments for preventable hospital re admissions These adjustments are aimed at hospitals , skilled nursing facilities , and home health agencies The Office of the Actuary for Medicare and Medicaid Services questioned in an April 2010 report whether these levels of savings are realistic , saying that some health care providers would become unprofitable if payments were reduced \( The 60 Plus ad cites this report in its fine print \) The actuary 's report suggests that Congress will intervene to change the payment formula to avoid health care providers dropping out of Medicare The report also includes this caveat about how difficult it is to project the effects of the health care law The legislation would result in numerous changes in the way that health care insurance is provided and paid for in the U S , and the scope and magnitude of these changes are such that few precedents exist for use in estimation Consequently , the estimates presented here are subject to a substantially greater degree of uncertainty than is usually the case with more routine health care legislation Finally , the 60 Plus ad also fails to mention new benefits for seniors under the health care law , such as a 250 rebate for prescription drugs purchased through Medicare Part D \( A statement on the 60 Plus website calls the drug rebate the senior suckup \) Currently , after an initial benefit period , enrollees are required to pay 100 percent of their prescription drug costs until they reach a level of catastrophic coverage The rebate is meant to begin to close what is often called the doughnut hole in prescription drug coverage for beneficiaries By 2020 , Medicare will pay 75 percent of the total cost of generic prescription drug coverage in the gap , a marked improvement to the current program Getting back to the Truth O Meter , the 60 Plus ad says that the new health care law will cut 500 billion from Medicare That will hurt the quality of our care The ad loses points for accuracy because the 500 billion are n't actual cuts but reductions to future spending for a program that will still grow significantly in the next 10 years The ad also says those cuts will hurt the quality of seniors' care But we find that to be a highly contentious subject , and the 60 Plus ad does n't hint at any of the ways that the reductions are ways to make Medicare more efficient Finally , the ad does n't mention any of the benefits to seniors , such as improved prescription drug coverage The ad seems more intent on attacking the health care law than accurately describing this complicated piece of legislation Because it leaves critical facts out of its description in a way that gives a misleading impression , we rate the statement Barely True Editor 's note This statement was rated Barely True when it was published On July 27 , 2011 , we changed the name for the rating to Mostly False Advertisement",false

"California elementary school students could soon be the targets of progressive sexual indoctrination if new health guidelines are approved The guidelines , listed under the California Department of Education s proposed Health Education Framework , include educational resources that teach children to reject gender stereotypes and embrace a rainbow of possible gender options One recommended book called Who Are You \? teaches that there are at least 15 genders , and that it s impossible to determine whether a baby is a boy , a girl or something else Babies can t talk , so grown ups make a guess by looking at their bodies , an excerpt reads Advertisement One chapter in the proposed guidelines offers suggestions on how to explain sexuality with kindergartners Discuss gender with kindergarteners by exploring gender stereotypes and asking open ended questions , such as what are preferred colors , toys , and activities for boys girls , and then challenging stereotypes if presented , chapter three reads Throughout this discussion , show images of children around the same age who do not conform to typical gender stereotypes Examples do not have to be exaggerated or overt Simple differences , such as colors or toy preferences , can demonstrate acceptance of gender non conformity What about parents who would prefer that their children not be exposed to errant gender ideology \? Unfortunately , there would be no opt out option Brenda Lebsack , a writer for EdSource org , first called attention to the proposed guidelines back in December Lebsack , who has been a public educator for 20 years , is also a member of the Orange Unified School District board of education in Orange County Advertisement Since few people will read the nearly 1 , 000 page draft , which unfortunately is only available in English , I am sharing below some examples that parents and educators may be especially interested in , she wrote Because the California Department of Education is inviting public comment on the draft , I urge all California residents to review the framework and provide input Lebsack highlights several problematic chapters in the new guidelines Chapter five , for example , includes this tip for discuss sexuality with seventh and eighth graders Some students may be non monogamous and the term partner \( s \) may be used to be more inclusive , it reads Polyamory , defined as the practice of , desire to , or orientation toward having consensual non monogamous relationships \( i e relationships that may include multiple partners \) and polyfidelity \( which involves more than two people being in romantic and or sexual relationships which is not open to additional partners \) , amongst many other set ups are discussed as just two of many acceptable options for young people Advertisement Lebsack notes that many of the terms described in the middle and high school resources will be unfamiliar to parents , adding that many of them are not in the English dictionary Despite this , parents won t be able to choose whether or not their children receive these questionable teachings While parents may assume they can opt out of this instruction , as they can with sexual health education and HIV prevention , this simply is not true , she writes Instruction about gender or sexual orientations that is implemented through the adoption of the framework is exempted from parent notification and opt out requirements \( California Education Code 51932b \) According to The California Safe School Coalition , state law provides that instruction or materials that discuss gender , sexual orientation , or family life and do not discuss human reproductive organs and their functions are not subject to parental notice and opt out laws Lebsack noted that if passed , the guidelines could be disastrous for school districts like Orange , which is already facing declining enrollment and teacher layoffs She noted the real possibility that parents could remove their children from the public school system , or even leave the state The State Board of Education will vote on the 2019 guidelines in May",false

Adding insult to injury , Louia even took photos of her grandpa as he lay on the bed , gasping for breath He was turning blue from lack of oxygen and that should have rang warning bells but Louia thought the color change she saw was just due to the Instagram filter she used to take his photo Yep You read that right she also took photos ! She argued later that she had only taken photos because her mother had asked how her grandpa was doing and the best thing she could do was to take snapshots to really show her his actual condition She blames her friends and Instagram followers for not giving her a warning People could have also warned me , instead of just tapping Like , she whined The old man couldn t talk but , thankfully , he was able to reach the control to call for help from the nurse s station The medical staff were quite shocked to see the old man gasping for breath because his respirator was off They were even more shocked to find the reason why the respirator wasn t working They freaked out when they realized that the respirator was turned off I asked them if there was another socket in the room but they didn t answer I think it s unfair that there was only one socket , Louia complained Needless to say , her family was outraged But she didn t think she did anything wrong She hopes the incident will make her family buy her a new phone or at least some external batteries so the incident won t happen again",false

"There is an alarming number of people who suffer from Crohn s disease Crohn s disease is defined as an inflammatory bowel disease \( IBD \) It affects the body by causing inflammation in the digestive tract This leads to severe diarrhea , abdominal pain , weight loss , and severe fatigue According to statistics , as of August 2017 , about three million adults in the United States suffer from IBD Scientists believe that cannabis can be used to treat Crohn s disease There is a lot of speculation in regards to the medical use of cannabis Its social use has overshadowed its medical use over the years But with laws being passed that will eventually legalize it it s now starting to get recognition The root causes of Crohn s disease are still debated While there are many treatments available for the disease , scientists are now hoping that cannabis can be used as yet another viable option for patients Before I get into the study that illustrates how cannabis can treat Crohn s disease , let me give you some background on the actual disease As I mentioned , the cause is unknown But research shows that the immune system is what triggers the disease It attacks good bacteria and food in the gut , which causes it to become inflamed Crohn s disease severely impacts the everyday lives of people who suffer from it People take numerous trips to the doctor s office If someone is extremely active , that will change if they are diagnosed with Crohn s Working will also be extremely difficult , especially if the Crohn s is triggered during work hours The signs and symptoms of Crohn s disease can range from mild to severe In some cases , the symptoms will develop gradually In other cases , the symptoms will suddenly appear When Crohn s is active , you may experience fatigue , fever , blood in the stool , sores on your mouth , loss of appetite and weight loss , and pain around the anus In more severe cases , you may experience inflammation of the eyes , joints , and skin You may also experience inflammation in your bile ducts or liver Researchers , scientists , and doctors have different ways of treating Crohn s disease Different treatments work for different people The reason is that an IBD affects people in different ways because it attacks different parts of the body So patients are taking all sorts of anti inflammatory drugs to try and reduce the symptoms Researchers published a study in the journal Clinical Gastroenterology and Hepatology The study illustrates the effects cannabis has on patients suffering from Crohn s disease The study included 21 patients suffering from Crohn s disease There were 13 men and 8 women The average age of the patients was 40 Each patient had previously tried treating their disease with anti tumor agents , steroidal therapy , and immunomodulators No one was successful with any of these treatments Researchers split the patients into two groups They began a 10 week study which included eight weeks of treatment and a follow up two weeks later One group was given rolled up cannabis containing 115mg of THC and they were instructed to smoke it twice a day The placebo group was given the same instructions , but their cannabis contained no THC The results of the study are astonishing In the THC group , 5 of 11 patients saw complete remission In the THC group , 10 of 11 patients saw their Crohn s Disease Activity Index drop from 200 to 100 Each patient from the THC group reported that they were sleeping better and they regained their appetite The main reason researchers believe cannabis may help is because of the THC Our bodies naturally produce THC , its called endocannabinoids People suffering from Crohn s have low levels of endocannabinoids But cannabis seems to provide cannabinoids which help reduce inflammation which triggers any one of the Crohn s disease symptoms This is only one study done on the effects of cannabis on people with Chron s disease , and although the data is small , this study provides some very interesting results that should be taken into consideration",false

"Home Health Fitness Meteorologists Predict Record Shattering Snowfall Coming SoonMeteorologists Predict Record Shattering Snowfall Coming SoonBread Milk Prices Expected To SoarPosted on September 6 , 2014 by Raoul Stockton in Health Fitness , Science TechSILVER SPRING , Maryland Chances are you will hear a lot about El Ni o in the next month or two Meteorologists and weather science experts at the National Weather Service \( NWS \) say that there is a 99 chance that the we will start to see a massive cold front sooner in the year than has ever happened , which will produce not just record breaking snowfall , but according to Dr Boris Scvediok , a doctor of global weather sciences , record shattering snow storms across the board , affecting the entire United States For the sake of comparison to the past winter , lets say that your area received a total of twenty inches of accumulative snow for the season Because this year the snowfall is predicted to start by the end of September or the beginning of October , you can expect to multiply that number by up to five , ten , maybe even twenty times in some areas In the worst zones , you could see 50 times the amount of snow you ve had in the past This is the type of winter the American public needs to prepare for Several meteorologists are saying not to buy into what the models are showing I can tell you from forty years of scientific weather research , they are doing you a disservice , Dr Scvediok told the Associated Press on Friday The Northeast , Ohio Valley , and Midwestern states will definitely get hit the hardest Edward F Blankenbaker , Senior Administrator of Meteorologists , also told the media that this will be a once in a lifetime kind of snowy winter Pretty much everyone will see snow like they never have in their lives Most younger people don t even know what an actual blizzard looks like , but by the end of March , they will be seasoned survivalists , Blankenbaker said Everyone needs to make sure they have their weather emergency kits prepared and ready to go There will undoubtably be mass power outages , which along with freezing temperatures and enough snowfall to immobilize entire cities , will most likely , and unfortunately , be a very dangerous recipe Safety always comes first and the time to prepare is right now Thanks for the feedback !

"The Guggenheim is gearing up for a special exhibit to air for three months beginning Oct 6 , 2017 called Art and China after 1989 If the Guggenheim 's plans stay as they are , the exhibit will feature several distinct instances of unmistakable cruelty against animals in the name of art In one example , artists Peng Yu and Sun Yuan tether four pairs of American pit bulls to eight wooden treadmills for a live exhibit The dogs are faced off against one another , running at each other but prevented from touching one another , which is a stressful and frustrating experience for animals trained to fight The dogs get wearier and wearier , their muscles more and more prominent , and their mouths increasingly salivate At this live 2003 performance in China , a video was recorded , complete with close up shots of the dogs' frantic , foaming faces This 7 minute video will be on display at the Guggenheim exhibit \( information from NY Times article Where the Wild Things Are China s Art Dreamers at the Guggenheim \) In another example , artist Xu Bing stamped meaningless characters all over the bodies of two pigs , a boar and a sow , who were put on display , mating , in a museum exhibit in Beijing in 1994 The Guggenheim will feature the video of that performance as well Finally , this exhibit will feature live animals \( reptiles , amphibians , insects \) that are trapped in a glass enclosure for attendee viewing According to the NY Times article , During the three month exhibition some creatures will be devoured others may die of fatigue The big ones will survive From time to time , a New York City pet shop will replenish the menagerie with new bugs Help us send a message to the Guggenheim by signing this petition Let them know that animal cruelty holds no place in art in the United States , nor should it anywhere in the world This assault on animals in the name of art will not be tolerated or supported Guggenheim please do what you know in your heart is right Take a stand with our animal cohabitants of this planet , and pull the pieces employing these cruel methods from your upcoming show Guggenheim tell the world what you stand for bold , controversial art that breaks barriers and challenges social norms , which does NOT include the promotion of cruelty against innocent beings",true

"The motive for the Florida school shooting remains unclear , but some of the social media posts of accused school shooter Nikolas Cruz are getting attention , in particular a profile picture with a MAGA hat on Instagram The slogan stands for Make America Great Again , which is President Donald Trump s signature campaign motto The posts on the two Instagram pages attributed to Cruz appear fixated on weaponry , not politics , though However , CNN gained access to an Instagram group in which the network claims Cruz wrote racist posts Cruz allegedly repeatedly espoused racist , homophobic and anti Semitic views and displayed an obsession with violence and guns , reported CNN , including writing that he hated jews , ni ers , immigrants and talking about killing Mexicans , keeping black people in chains and cutting their necks According to CNN , he also wrote that he had written a letter to Trump and wrote I think I am going to kill people The MAGA hat makes an appearance in a profile picture on one of the Instagram pages that Heavy has verified belonged to Cruz , 19 , an expelled student who is accused of going on a rampage with an AR 15 weapon On the page with the MAGA hat , the accused school shooter went by the handle nikolascruzmakarov MAGA stands for the slogan Make America Great Again and is President Donald Trump s campaign motto Makarov is the name of a Russian made pistol \( You can read tributes to the victims here \) CNN obtained a video the network said was of the shooter undertaking target practice while wearing a MAGA hat Instagram released a statement on the account with the MAGA hat , writing , This is a terrible tragedy and our hearts go out to the people who have been affected There is absolutely no place on our platforms for people who commit such horrendous acts We have found and immediately deleted the shooter s accounts on Facebook and Instagram Instagram implicitly confirming that an account with a MAGA Trump hat avatar belonged to gunman Nikolas Cruz Asked why the account was removed , spokesperson says pic twitter com LdXb73iCj8 Jon Swaine \( jonswaine \) February 15 , 2018 President Trump expressed prayers for the victims My prayers and condolences to the families of the victims of the terrible Florida shooting No child , teacher or anyone else should ever feel unsafe in an American school , Trump wrote on Twitter Just spoke to Governor Rick Scott We are working closely with law enforcement on the terrible Florida school shooting Trump held a press conference on February 15 , in which he said the shooter had opened fire on defenseless students and teachers The president added , Our entire nation with one heavy heart is praying for the victims and their families He pledged that the government was here for you to the victims families We are all joined together as one American family , Trump said No child , no teacher should ever be in danger in an American school The president said that we hold onto God s word in scripture He said he wanted to speak directly to America s children , adding , I want you to know that you are never alone , and you never will be This photo of the suspect was

be clear , authorities have not said that politics played any role in the shootings They have indicated that they are not certain of the motive , and those who knew Cruz described him to various Florida and national media outlets as an odd loner obsessed with guns His social media pages focus on weaponry , both guns and knives However , the MAGA hat is one detail in the fuller biography of the accused shooter , and the social posts , in totality , help give a picture of the man There are unconfirmed allegations that the suspect held extremist views Jordan Jereb told the Associated Press that Cruz was a member of the white supremacist militia group Republic of Florida and participated in paramilitary drills in Tallahassee Jordan , a leader in the militia that has been described as similar to the Ku Klux Klan , told the AP that Cruz had previous trouble with a female and might have chosen Valentine s Day for the massacre for that reason According to Daily Beast , Jereb says a member of the group may have given Cruz a rifle However , local authorities in Tallahassee , where the group is based now say they can find no link between Nikolas Cruz and the ROF militia group , according to Tallahassee com Authorities conducted a gun trace and say that Cruz bought the gun he used The ROF leader Jordan Jereb told the Associated Press that Cruz was a member of the ROF and participated in paramilitary drills in Tallahassee He told AP that Cruz had previous trouble with a female and might have chosen Valentine s Day for the massacre for that reason He acted on his own behalf of what he just did and he s solely responsible for what he just did , Jordan Jereb told the AP ROF has its own YouTube channel Jereb is a convicted felon According to the Southern Poverty Law Center , Jereb once professed his love for Molotov cocktails and shared a video that details an argument for when it s okay to shoot a police officer His Twitter page has now been suspended Some people argued on social media that Cruz was actually a registered Democrat based on the voter registration of a Nicolas Cruz in Florida whose birthday is in May 1998 However , the Broward sheriff said

"Red Bull GmbH agreed on Thursday to pay more than 13 million to settle a proposed class action lawsuit that alleges false advertising of its energy drinks , according to Law360 If the proposed settlement is passed by the court , Red Bull would be required to pay 6 5 million into a settlement fund within seven days The settlement could include millions of individuals who purchased at least one Red Bull can over the past 10 years , offering class members the option of a 10 cash reimbursement or two free Red Bull products with an approximate retail value of 15 \( Red Bull would cover shipping costs \) Red Bull sent BevNET an email with the following statement Red Bull settled the lawsuit to avoid the cost and distraction of litigation However , Red Bull maintains that its marketing and labeling have always been truthful and accurate , and denies any and all wrongdoing or liability The plaintiff representing the class , Benjamin Careathers , said he had been drinking Red Bull since 2002 as part of the lawsuit he filed on Jan 16 , 2013 in U S District Court of the Southern District of New York The suit argues that Red Bull misleads consumers about the superiority of its products with its slogan Red Bull gives you wings and its claims of increased performance , concentration and reaction speed , to name a few This deception is proliferated through the company s advertising on television , the Internet , social media and events , athlete endorsers , glossy print brochures , marketing campaigns and its slogan promoting Red Bull Flugtag series , according to the suit Such deceptive conduct and practices mean that Red Bull s advertising and marketing is not just puffery , but is instead deceptive and fraudulent and is therefore actionable , the suit says The class action cites articles by The New York Times , Nutrition Reviews and the European Food Safety Authority Journal , which indicate that energy drinks provide their boost through caffeine alone , not guarana or any other ingredient The suit says that a 7 oz cup of drip coffee contains approximately 115 to 175 milligrams of caffeine , depending on the blend , and a 12 oz serving of Starbucks coffee costs 1 85 and would contain far more caffeine than a regular serving of Red Bull An 8 4 oz can of Red Bull contains 80 milligrams of caffeine Even though there is a lack of genuine scientific support for a claim that Red Bull branded energy drinks provide any more benefit to a consumer than a cup of coffee , the Red Bull defendants persistently and pervasively market their product as a superior source of energy worthy of a premium price over a cup of coffee or other sources of caffeine , the suit says Despite Red Bull s denial of wrongdoing , the company has voluntarily withdrawn and revised marketing claims challenged in court , according to the plaintiff s motion Plaintiffs David Wolf and Miguel Almaraz made similar allegations in a lawsuit filed in California federal and later transferred to New York , Law360 writes BevNET spoke with August T Horvath , a partner with the law firm Kelley Drye , who focuses his practice on advertising law and antitrust matters While Horvath didn t offer an opinion on the potential settlement , he said the case features difficult claims from the plaintiff He posed the following questions about the complaint Did Red Bull really make the alleged claims \?

"SANDPOINT , ID Recent decisions by President Bush to sequester vaccination injury files and appoint Henry Kissinger to lead a 9 11 inquiry may seem unrelated In fact , they have much in common according to an award winning author who decrypted a centuries old alphanumeric code currently used by British and American intelligence agencies Dr Leonard Horowitz , a Harvard trained researcher , discovered a foreboding fact while analyzing the code the words Kissinger and Vaccination both decipher to 666 , the infamous mark of the beast President Bush and alleged war criminal Henry Kissinger The name Kissinger codes for 666 \( Rev 13 18 \) In a prophetically titled book , released three months before 9 11 , Death in the Air Globalism , Terrorism and Toxic Warfare \( Tetrahedron Publishing Group 1 888 508 4787 \) , Dr Horowitz explained that several of the largest multi national corporations , and Anglo American intelligence agencies \( i e , MI6 and U S Special Services \) often use letters such as S , as Hitler did with his SS , to signify the number 6 The researcher determined this designation reflects an alphanumeric code where multiples of six are assigned to each letter in the English alphabet from A to Z \( e g , A 6 , B 12 , C 18 , S 114 , Z 156 \) When these numbers are added , the words Kissinger and Vaccination both decipher to 666 the biblical mark of the beast Many argue this association reflects mere chance , but Dr Horowitz , who has been studying these codes and associations since 1998 , and Kissinger 's links to the vaccine industry since 1993 , says serendipity cannot logically account for this shared infamous identity The likelihood that these related numerological identities reflect a simple coincidence is close to impossible given Kissinger 's political history and financial ties to vaccination industrialists , says Dr Horowitz His evidence becomes more convincing while reflecting on Kissinger 's political career Many historians have likened Kissinger to a war criminal As Nelson Rockefeller 's protg , Kissinger began his early service to the old money global elite by recruiting Nazi scientists and SS officials to America through a secret Counter Intelligence Corps \( CIC \) project that evolved into the Central Intelligence Agency 's \( CIA \) infamous Project Paperclip Throughout World War II , the Rockefellers partnered with German industrialists as arranged by their lawyers and business managers John Foster and Allen Dulles These men clearly directed American intelligence agencies to serve the financial interests of the Rockefeller 's Standard Oil Company that partnered with Germany 's leading industrial organization I G Farben At the close of WWII , the I G Farben building in Frankfort , protected from allied bombings from the highest levels of military command , became CIA headquarters Rockefeller then dispatched another lawyer and banking official , John J McCloy , to disperse their German assets to form the modern day petrochemical pharmaceutical combine known as the Bayer corporation \( maker of CIPRO for anthrax \) , the Hoechst company \( owner of Aventis and the smallpox vaccine \) and BASF , the global chemical giant The Merck pharmaceutical company also received a major share of Hitler 's flight capital , according to historians such as CBS News war correspondent Paul Manning In Martin Bormann Nazi in Exile \( Lyle Stuart , Inc , 1981 \) , Manning also traced Hitler 's money trail to German steel industrialist Fritz Thyssen Thyssen , according to official U S war crimes investigator and attorney John Loftus , principally laundered his fortunes through American banks under the direction of Prescott Bush , the current president 's grandfather The Union Bank and Harriman Brown Bank , the two principle money laundering institutions , were largely directed by the elder Bush It should also be noted , Dr Horowitz said , that beginning in the 1920s , Prescott Bush joined banking , energy , and medical industrialist John D Rockefeller , and the British Royal Family , in financing the earliest racial hygiene experiments These genocidal efforts predated Hitler 's The early eugenicists sought to sterilize mostly Black populations deemed genetically inferior At the same time , and for most of the twentieth century , they promoted sterilizing mentally retarded children for the same reason Allied banking industrialists are known to have funded Hitler 's rise to power As the war was ending , Manning wrote , these investments and the Nazi flight capital , were redirected to actualize what Hitler termed a rising Fourth Reich based on the previous vision of a thousand year Third Reich and world empire This was outlined with clarity in a document called Neuordnung , or New Order , that was accompanied by a letter of transmittal to the Ministry of Economics It declared that a new order for the petro chemical pharmaceutical industry of the world should supplement Hitler 's New World Order a phrase also used by President George H W Bush during his 1991 State of the Union Address More recently , Kissinger 's alleged war criminality has been the subject of numerous articles , some even appearing in mainstream periodicals such as Harper 's According to his biographers , besides helping many of Hitler 's leading scientists and SS officials to escape Nuremberg trials , Kissinger has been implicated in several other genocides including ones in Cambodia and Chili This is best reconciled , Dr Horowitz says , because Kissinger 's closest business associates are linked to the old money cryptocracy that has historically funded warring factions , terrorist organizations , and now directs the military 'defense' establishment running America 's 'War on Terrorism ' Additional evidence is offered by the decrypted code Using the alphanumerics of the multiples of six , wherein S 114 , this number is reduced to a single digit as practiced in numerology and ancient Pythagorean mathematics to yield 6 \( i e , S 114 1 1 4 6 \) Thus , the Gestapo 's SS , as well as Her Majesty 's 'Secret Service , ' Britain 's MI6 , and the American military 's Special Services , all code for 66 as in Phillips 66 and Route 66 America 's highway Historic accounts link all of these to Rockefeller and or Royal Family involvements Lending further credence to Dr Horowitz 's global conspiracy theory , historians reveal that Nelson Rockefeller appointed his protg , Kissinger , to become the nuclear weapons special studies director at the Council on Foreign Relations \( CFR \) in 1955 , resulting in the deployment of tactical and strategic nuclear weapons around the world that heavily spirited the Cold War 's rush to arms and today 's continuing nuclear threats The CFR has been largely influenced through Rockefeller involvements from its inception according to numerous authors and MI6 insiders The council 's higher direction has been reported to come from the British German war making oligarchy working through their Committee of 300 on which George H W Bush , Henry Kissinger , and David Rockefeller are prominent members David Rockefeller has chaired the CFR since the 1950s The rush to develop weapons of mass destruction , including biologicals and chemicals , was also instituted through Rockefeller and Kissinger directed federal policies according to the author of Kissinger \( Simon Schuster , 1992 \) , Walter Isaacson In 1955 , while impacting NATO policy advances through the CFR , Kissinger advanced the defense theory that later became known as flexible response This called for the flexible use of a spectrum of weapons of mass destruction , primarily nuclear Later , in 1969 , as National Security Advisor under Richard Nixon , Kissinger , on behalf of his benefactors' business interests , demanded the U S Navy 's Admiral Zumwalt reevaluate America 's biological weapons capabilities From this , Kissinger selected the option to develop synthetic biological agents for germ warfare Their illegal development then proceeded under the guise of military defense , preventive vaccinations , and cancer research , according to Dr Horowitz , who drew his evidence from the Congressional Record In his national bestseller Emerging Viruses AIDS Ebola Nature , Accident or Intentional \? \( Tetrahedron Press , 1998 \) , Dr Horowitz documented Kissinger 's oversight of the CIA 's top secret biological weapons program called MK NAOMI While professing a moratorium on the development of such weapons , urging President Nixon to sign the Geneva Accord outlawing such practices , Kissinger , through his chain of command , directed members of the National Academy of Sciences National Research Council to advise U S Army officials to develop immune suppressive synthetic biological agents descriptively and functionally identical to HIV AIDS and the Ebola virus How did HIV and Ebola viruses break out of their military medical labs \? Dr Horowitz posits the following controversial , yet well documented theory Through the Merck pharmaceutical company , a major U S biological weapons contractor whose president , George W Merck , directed America 's entire biological weapons industry , contaminated chimpanzees were used during the early 1970s to develop the earliest experimental hepatitis B vaccines given to gay men in New York City and Blacks in central Africa This , according to Dr Horowitz 's published scientific papers , was the precise vaccination that triggered the AIDS pandemic No doubt Merck 's chief advisor , Dr Kissinger , would have approved of this AIDS outcome given his enthusiasm for his National Special Security Memorandum 200 , ordered just before these vaccinations began , that called for massive Third World depopulation especially targeting Black Africans Given this knowledge , and the rapidly advancing science in this field that proves the accuracy of Dr Horowitz 's theory of HIV AIDS origination , the vaccination liability indemnity clause in President Bush 's recently passed Homeland Security Bill , and subsequent Bush administration efforts to close mercury toxicity vaccine injury case files leaving autistic victims and their families in the lurch , provides multiple benefits to the Rockefeller Kissinger linked drug companies , especially to Merck Dr Horowitz sees these moves as a precaution against accumulating scientific evidence linking modern cancer and autoimmune epidemics , as well as AIDS , to contaminations in Merck 's vaccines , including their cancer virus tainted polio and hepatitis B vaccines Moreover , Dr Horowitz has documented similar manipulations in the fields of genetics and cancer research , both heavily controlled by these same political powers and global energy industrialists Government contracts reprinted in Emerging Viruses AIDS Ebola , prove the Atomic Energy Commission became heavily involved in the National Cancer Institute 's Special Virus Cancer Program \( SVCP \) which Dr Horowitz claims is largely responsible for the emergence of HIV and AIDS His official testimony , which heavily implicates Merck , was whitewashed recently during a U S General Accounting Office investigation into this matter ordered by Congressman James Traficant The Ohio democrat was subsequently imprisoned on racketeering charges His indictment , he insists , stemmed from conspirators at the highest levels of government and industry \( See U S GAO Commits Scientific Fraud In AIDS Inquiry at http www healingcelebrations com gao htm \) It is clear from the contracts that the U S Navy 's Biological Research Laboratory also played an important role in the SVCP developing new types of airborne cancer viruses and other infectious agents In his latest book , Death in the Air Globalism , Terrorism and Toxic Warfare , Dr Horowitz draws additional attention to the 666 logo used by the U S Department of Energy managed Nuclear Engineering and Environmental Laboratory in his home state of Idaho This is where Navy and nuclear submarine personnel go to train The three backwards upside down Ss , supposedly energy symbols , match those of a weathervane adorning Dr Horowitz 's neighbor 's lakefront estate situated at the center of the U S Navy 's Cutthroat unmanned nuclear submarine testing area on lake Pend Orielle near Sandpoint The neighbor , Klaus Groenke , a wealthy German industrialist on the Board of Trustees of the German American Academy in Berlin , which was co founded and chaired by Henry Kissinger , watches his three inverted lightning bolts , or backwards upside down Ss , pivot in the wind to overlap forming two Nazi swastikas According to the earliest Pythagorean mystery school alphanumeric code upon which more modern intelligence agency codes are based , according to Dr Horowitz , the Nazi swastika , like the letter X , also codes for the number 6 \( or sometimes 9 upside down \) Thus , the adjacent swastikas on Mr Groenke 's estate code for 66 , much like the double XX in the Rockefeller directed EXXON corporation , and the 66 code depicted by the twelve stars in the Global Integration Services logo of the Battelle Memorial Institute the CIA contractor whose scientists manufactured the silica cut hyperweaponized Ames strain of electromagnetized anthrax that was mailed in October , 2001 , to create the public fright and impetus for the U S Government to stockpile nearly a billion dollars in preventive vaccines for anthrax and smallpox as well as other costly prescription drugs like Bayer 's CIPRO \( For Dr Horowitz 's complete anthrax mailings special report link to http www tetrahedron org articles anthrax anthrax espionage html \) Given all of the incriminating evidence linking President Bush 's War on Terrorism to global industrialists like the Rockefellers , Henry Kissinger , the Mercks of Europe , and the British oligarchy , Dr Horowitz concludes it is not likely an accident that the names Merck and Bush both decipher to 300 using the same code This is consistent with the Committee of 300 and its powerful influence over global politics and governmental policies It is , likewise , no coincidence that Kissinger , the only modern day political leader whose name deciphers to 666 , with his special services record at the CFR , became a top advisor to the Merck pharmaceutical company the world 's leading vaccine maker with the word 'vaccination' also resolving to 666 Now that we have some of their secret codes , Dr Horowitz concludes , it is possible to perform statistical analyses , the scientific method of determining correlation \( coefficients \) for testing associations in this case co conspirators in a global conspiracy When this is done , the outcome proves a genocidal theory beyond our worst nightmares NOTE TO JOURNALISTS For an interview with Dr Horowitz on this topic please call Elaine Zacky at 1 800

Oklahoma \? Mississippi \? Walker said , his point being such information isn t on the web page Walker and Ramiro Martinez , Jr , a Northeastern University professor , each suggested it s highly unlikely unauthorized residents committed that many homicides in the years mentioned by Perry Drawing on FBI Uniform Crime Statistics for Texas posted online by the DPS , Walker calculated that from 2008 through 2012 , there were 3 , 903 persons arrested on homicide charges in the state Walker said it s not logical that residents in the state without legal permission accounted for most of the same deaths He conceded , too , he wasn t able to roll in homicide charges from 2013 and 2014 he didn t see that data online nor were we successful in eliciting figures from DPS Martinez offered up his own analysis , which started by averaging the FBI s tally of a little more than 1 , 100 homicides in Texas in 2011 and 2012 and extrapolating that over six years to reach an estimated total of nearly 6 , 700 homicides over most of the period analyzed by DPS By email , Martinez said Perry s statement to Beck potentially would suggest 3 , 070 , or 46 percent , of the estimated homicides were committed by illegal aliens But , he said , that makes no sense He said in a follow up email It just boggles the imagination that level of aliens were involved to that extent over time and nobody noticed The criminologists noted another weakness the DPS presentation mixes together recent homicide charges with those that might have been leveled decades ago Also , they noted , the agency tallied arrests only , not homicide convictions Martinez also raised an eyebrow at the mingling of criminal charges against legally authorized U S residents and individuals in the country without permission , risking conclusions irrelevant to border security today By the state 's approach , he said , it s possible a homicide charge in the tally involves someone who reached the U S from Cuba in 1962 who was later charged with and or committed a homicide If so , he said , that charge would bear no relevance to criminal actions by people lately crossing the Rio Grande Neither the DPS or Perry s office offered more information Our rulingPerry told Beck over 3 , 000 homicides were committed by illegal aliens over the last six years This claim is unsupported by the presentation he relied on , which indicates that since 2008 in Texas , more than 200 , 000 arrested immigrants foreign nationals living here with or without legal permission had among them accumulated 3 , 070 homicide charges \( not convictions \) in their lives Put another way , for this declaration to hold water , one would have to assume illegal immigrants committed nearly half of the state s homicides since 2008 we found no such data This statement is both incorrect and ridiculous Pants on Fire !

"New research has found electronic cigarettes to contain even 10 times more cancer causing ingredients than the tobacco products they are supposed to save us from Quite an astonishing revelation given E cigarettes are meant to replace a dangerous and life destroying habit E cigarettes are used by millions of people worldwide , all with the belief that they are a safer alternative to tobacco products However , according to research conducted by Japanese scientists , e cigarettes contain 10 times the level of cancer causing carcinogens than regular cigarettes In the research commissioned by the Japanese Ministry of Health , it was found that formaldehyde and acetaldehyde carcinogens are present , and prevalent , in the liquid produced by many e cigarette products Furthermore , it was determined that e cigarettes can fuel potentially life threatening drug resistant pathogens This discovery comes from a lab study that tested the vapor from e cigarettes on live methicillin resistant Staphylococcus aureus \( MRSA \) and human cells According to a Japanese Ministry of Health official , the formaldehyde carcinogen is much more present in the e cigarette liquids than in the chemicals used in regular cigarettes In one brand of e cigarette the team found more than 10 times the level of carcinogens contained in one regular cigarette Especially when the wire \( which vaporizes the liquid \) gets overheated , higher amounts of those harmful substances seemed to be produced , said researcher Naoki Kunugita Kunugita also added that the levels of the formaldehyde carcinogen varied in the final results You call them e cigarettes , but they are products totally different from regular tobacco The government is now studying the possible risks associated with them , with view to looking at how they should be regulated In 2015 , the World Health Organization \( WHO \) advised governments to ban the sale of e cigarettes to underage people because they posed potentially serious health risks The UN health agency said that although there s a lack of evidence regarding the damage caused by e cigarettes , there s still enough evidence to caution children and adolescents , pregnant women , and women of reproductive age about their use According to the US Center for Disease Control and Prevention \( CDC \) more than a quarter of a million youth who had never smoked a cigarette used electronic cigarettes in 2013 This number reflects a three fold increase , from about 79 , 000 in 2011 , to more than 263 , 000 in 2013 What do you think of these findings \?

No one seems to know for sure Suffice it to say , however , that Kushner is suddenly acting more than a bit suspiciously In fact , Kushner just boarded a commercial jet and secretly left the country and Trump s White House is refusing to answer any questions about what s going on Kushner flew to Saudi Arabia , in what was clearly supposed to be a secret trip , as the White House refuses to say why he went there or what he did once he got there He supposedly returned to the United States on Saturday night , according to a Politico report \( link \) but considering the suspicious circumstances , that too could be a cover story there s no known proof that he actually did return to the U S There are scattered reports that Kushner may have had dinner with Ivanka Trump in Washington on DC on Saturday night , which we re still working to track down This raises a number of questions Kushner was accompanied by a deputy national security adviser , so this doesn t appear to have been some harebrained attempt at fleeing the country That would have been a phenomenally stupid idea anyway Although Saudi Arabia does not have an extradition treaty with the United States , it s far too close of an ally to want to provide such controversial refuge But this may have been a \( perhaps mis timed \) attempt at conveniently being out of the country as Robert Mueller begins making arrests In any case , Donald Trump s White House s refusal to answer any questions about Jared Kushner s trip makes it all the more suspicious If this were a legitimate diplomatic mission , it would be easy for the White House to provide a plausible explanation for the trip Instead the obfuscation strongly suggests that Kushner staged the trip as some kind of bizarre response to the impending arrests Help fund Palmer Report Thanks for reading Palmer Report Check out this great content Keep up to date with the latest Palmer Report articles via email Get the latest content first Email AddressAs new articles are addedDaily",false

Missouri state Sen Maria Chappelle Nadal , D University City , wrote during a morning Facebook exchange , referring to Republican President Donald Trump She quickly deleted her post , but not quickly enough By midafternoon , the political verdicts of her own party were rolling in U S Sen Claire McCaskill , D Mo I condemn it Its outrageous And she should resign U S Rep William Lacy Clay , D St Louis \( C \) alling for the assassination of the President is a federal crime \( She is \) an embarrassment to our state She should resign immediately Missouri Democratic Party Chair Stephen Webber The Party will absolutely not tolerate calls for the assassination of the President I believe she should resign Missouri Senate Democratic Caucus leader Sen Gina Walsh \( She \) should be ashamed of herself for adding her voice to this toxic environment Republican Gov Eric Greitens said in a statement We can have differences in our country , but no one should encourage political violence The senator should resign Lt Gov Mike Parson , a Republican , and state Auditor Nicole Galloway , a Democrat , also called for Chappelle Nadals resignation In an interview , Chappelle Nadal acknowledged she wrote the offending line on her personal Facebook page in response to another commenter before deleting it I didnt mean what I put up Absolutely not I was very frustrated Things have got to change , Chappelle Nadal told the Post Dispatch It was in response to the concerns that I am hearing from residents of St Louis I have deleted it , and it should have been deleted , but there is something way more important that we should be talking about She added later I am not resigning What I said was wrong , but I am not going to stop talking about what led to that , which is the frustration and anger that many people across America are feeling right now Chappelle Nadal said her comment stemmed from frustration over the events in Charlottesville over the weekend , in which a white supremacist protester allegedly rammed his car into a group of counterprotesters , killing a 32 year old woman 1 Trumps reaction to the tragedy , which included the assertion that both sides of the protests were to blame for the violence , has drawn criticism across the political spectrum There are people who are afraid of white supremacists in the aftermath of Charlottesville , she said There are people who are having nightmares There are people who are afraid of going out in the streets Its worse than even Ferguson According to a screenshot of the now deleted conversation obtained by the Post Dispatch , another commenter named Christopher Gagne was writing about a cousin of his who he said was on Trumps Secret Service detail But , what I posted earlier , I truly believe will happen , sooner not later , he wrote In a subsequent interview with the Post Dispatch , Gagne said that wasnt a reference to assassination , but to his earlier stated belief that Vice President Mike Pence will use the 25th Amendment of the Constitution to have Trump removed from office Damn , Gagne then wrote , now Ill probably get a visit from the Secret Service He followed that comment with smdh , an abbreviation for shaking my damn head Chappelle Nadal responded No I will I hope Trump is assassinated ! The U S Secret Services St Louis field office is looking into this , the office confirmed Thursday Kristina Schmidt , special agent in charge , told the Post Dispatch that hypothetically in such investigations , agents try to determine intent , to determine if there was a violation of federal law If there is , then we refer it to the U S attorney Our primary goal is to determine if there is intent and meaning behind it , Schmidt said Richard Callahan , former U S attorney in St Louis , said that generally in cases involving such threats , we try to distinguish between stupid and \( actual \) intent He said the bottom line is the question of whether the person was serious about making the threatened action happen Another factor , he said , is whether its a person of influence You look at the persons station in life , whether they might have influence over others In addition to partywide condemnation of Chappelle Nadals post , state Rep Joshua Peters , D St Louis , issued a formal request Thursday to the Missouri Senate committee that deals with member ethics asking for Chappelle Nadals removal from office , calling her an embarrassment nationally for the Missouri General Assembly The furious responses from Chappelle Nadals own party might at least partly reflect her history of internal political strife as an outspoken critic of people on both sides of the aisle First elected to the House in 2004 , she served three terms before winning a four way primary for the Senates 14th District in 2010 In January 2015 , she filed a proposal in the Senate seeking the ouster of former Gov Jay Nixon , a Democrat , for his actions in relation to the August 2014 death of a black teenager in Ferguson by a white police officer In her proposal , she said Nixon seems only to acknowledge the existence of the African American community on or about election day The measure went nowhere But her attacks on Nixon never dimmed In a tweet at the time of the protests in Ferguson , Chappelle Nadal wrote You dont know s because you never communicate F you , governor ! Shes also tried to exert political payback against her foes She spent nearly 20 , 000 on negative ads against Rep Joe Adams , whom she had defeated in her race for the Senate five years previously She got into a fight with Sen Jamilah Nasheed , D St Louis , at a Lil Wayne concert at Scottrade Center in 2011 over legislation regarding local control of the city police department Last year , she unsuccessfully challenged Clay , the St Louis based congressman , in the Democratic primary During the most recent legislative session , Chappelle Nadal focused her efforts on a controversial buyout program for homeowners in the Spanish Village neighborhood of Bridgeton who have been impacted by pollution in the nearby Westlake Landfill Initially , she wanted her colleagues to approve a 12 million program and threatened to shut down the Senate with a filibuster if it didnt move forward She backed off when the Senate endorsed a 1 million pilot program But the House didnt agree and she left the Capitol in May with nothing Kurt Erickson and Joe Holleman of the Post Dispatch contributed to this report ndn video player 3 ndn embedded ndn floatContainer margin top 10px margin bottom 20px",true
"It was the cream of insider Hollywood scoops of 1996 the cast and crew of Titanic had been poisoned with PCP spiked clam chowder Even Bill Paxton and James Cameron But Leonardo DiCaprio and Kate Winslet were spared , as neither had any scenes on the Canadian set It all went down on the last night of filming in Nova Scotia Five weeks of working up north was nearly over and the whole crew was about to decamp to the larger set down in Mexico Everyone was in high spirits the mood festive Then at around midnight , which was lunch hour for a filming schedule that started at dusk and went until dawn , the crew was called together for one last meal Even James Cameron descended from his office to toast a successful wrap The catering team turned out an impressive spread , crowned by a big batch of creamy clam chowder People were lining up for seconds and thirds And then it was back to work Marilyn McAvoy was one such crew member A standby painter on the set , she used her background in fine art to paint forgeries , illustrate Jack 's sketchbook , and age props Now an artist in her own right , she talks to VICE about what it was like to get extremely and accidentally high on the night of the PCP chowder incident All images by Ben Thomson VICE Hey Marilyn , so tell me , what was that chowder like \? Marilyn McAvoy The chowder was unbelievable People were going back for second bowls I really thought about going back because it was so good And I think that was part of the problem People ate a lot more than usual because it was so delicious What else do you remember about that night \? There was no indication that there was anything strange happening until the meal By the time we got back from eating , after about 30 minutes , that 's when I started noticing something was wrong Everyone seemed confused Everyone was having trouble getting their work done What were you doing at the time \? I needed some stuff upstairs as well as some other equipment down in another area And I remember just walking around trying to figure out the best way to get my supplies Things just seemed fuzzy How did the rest of the crew react \? While I was trying to figure out what was going on , everyone else seemed to be going outside They were all gathering outside of the giant doors of the building we were working in I also heard later on that as soon as James Cameron realized something had been put in the chowder , he ran up to his room and forced himself to throw up When did everyone realize what had happened \? It was actually kind of comical It was like that game kids play , Red Rover There were the people who were ok , who had n't gotten any effects yet , and the people who were getting high And there were these two lines apart from each other , with some people in the good line slowly trickling into the bad line It was at about this point that people realized that everyone who had eaten the chowder was experiencing the effects of some sort of hallucinogen So what happened next \? The crew vans came and picked everybody up and took us to the Dartmouth General Hospital En masse , we went through these hospital doors at 1 AM in the morning They did not know what to do with us It became pretty chaotic Some people were having a really hard time I think maybe the people who had more experience with drugs were having flashbacks and bad trips How did it affect you \? For me , the whole situation was pretty surreal But in terms of effects , it was kind of like a combination of being high on marijuana and being drunk I was functioning , I was reading magazines It was like a dream What was your experience with hallucinogens before this \? None So when it started happening , I was pretty scared because I had no experience to base this high on We did n't know then what it had been spiked with But because it was such an unexpected thing to have happened , I did n't have time at the moment to fully take in how dangerous something like this could have been How did the hospital deal with all of you \? Well , we were there all night Eventually , we all got put in these cubicles with the curtains around us , but no one wanted to stay in their cubicles Everyone was out in the aisles and jumping into other people 's cubicles People had a lot of energy Some were in wheelchairs , flying down the hallways I mean , everyone was high ! So they gave us this drink that had charcoal in it , to remove the toxins By sunup , we had started to come down People were playing hacky sack Everyone just wanted to get home What was the aftermath like \? Well , we had to go home and get right to sleep and then back to work that night to finish the shooting that had been interrupted It was very strange In terms of what had happened , there were some investigations Nothing was ever officially determined , as far as I know Among the crew , there were rumors that it had been a disgruntled chef that had been let go , but nothing ever came of that It seems like since it happened at the end of the shoot , there was n't much time for paranoia to brew among the crew Yeah , that 's true I never thought about that I probably would have started bringing my own lunch Because it was , while funny , pretty traumatic So , you 're right , it would have led to a very mistrustful situation Did this whole thing affect your attitude towards drug taking , illegal or otherwise \? No , not really Although it made me realize how fragile , and how delicate , these things can be Had I gone back for that second bowl , I might have had an entirely different kind of experience Follow Sami Emory on Twitter",true

As I covered 11 days ago , below , no one has been able to get in contact with the former Clinton Foundation CEO since October 22nd That s when Wikileaks released an email in which John Podesta named him as a possible mole within the Clinton Foundation The mainstream media continues to ignore the story And is he really missing \? I just spoke with his father , Stanley Braverman , who told me , It s nonsense , ma am , it s not true , before hanging up on me Note how easy it would be for his dad to disprove it Instead , he just denied it and hung up Snopes reports , New Haven , New York City and Washington D C police have no record of a missing person with his name , nor is Braverman listed on NamUs , a national database of missing persons maintained by the Justice Department Emails from The Stream to Braverman , Yale University , where he teaches one course , the FBI , and his husband Neil Brown received no substantive response The Free Thought Project had no luck getting information from the university In Custody \? Laying Low \? Seeking Asylum \? Braverman had been hired by Chelsea Clinton to clean up corruption within the foundation , but was forced out by longtime Clinton insiders The right wing blogosphere has speculated that the FBI has him in protective FBI custody to protect him from the Clintons or that he s lying low at the Clintons request , in order to avoid being subpoenaed to testify against the organization Others speculate that he has sought asylum in the Russian embassy While the rightwing blogosphere is boiling over with theories , the mainstream media isn t covering the story While the rightwing blogosphere is boiling over with theories , the mainstream media isn t covering the story CNN is running around the clock coverage of the congressional investigation into Russia allegedly hacking into Podesta s emails and the DNC s emails , but has not mentioned the possibility Braverman might have leaked Podesta s emails to Wikileaks Wikileaks founder Julian Assange said a disgruntled Democratic insider gave him the emails , not the Russians Braverman isn t the only one at the Clinton Foundation who Podesta thought could be a mole In an email exchange with an ally , Podesta said , could be doug or ira , referring to Doug Bales and Ira Magaziner Still Missing Since my previous article came out , the only mention of Braverman s disappearance by the mainstream media has been Politico s derisive reference to the story as fake news At least Snopes revised their entry on the story , changing the status from fake to unknown , with a link to my article The date to watch is Thursday , January 19th That s the Yale class Braverman teaches , Innovation in Government and Society , begins We ll know whether he is missing or not depending on whether he shows up to teach But don t expect to see a New

Clinton Foundation CEO from 2013 until 2015 , has apparently been missing since October His absence has fueled speculations in the blogosphere but so far has been ignored by the media Some speculate , with good reason , that Braverman may have gone into hiding after an email mentioning his name was released by Wikileaks on October 22 of this year In the March 2015 email exchange , Center for American Progress President Neera Tanden told Clinton campaign manager and confidant John Podesta there was a mole within the Clinton Foundation Podesta in his reply told Tanden the mole was Braverman Braverman had abruptly resigned from the Clinton Foundation shortly before this email exchange took place And then , after the email exchange was made public by Wikileaks , Braverman vanished from the public eye This seems like a story that someone might want to report The last evidence of Braverman s public activity was October 12 , when he posted his last tweet on Twitter \( Usually he tweets about once a month His husband , Neil Brown , hasn t tweeted since August , although he rarely tweets \) I left a voicemail on Braverman s personal phone and sent him an email , but received no response He is still listed as a lecturer at Yale University and , contrary to some reports , there is a record of his lectures going back several years I contacted the press office and Braverman s department at Yale and received no response Braverman , the Podesta Leaks and the Clinton Foundation Craig Murray , a former British ambassador to Uzbekistan and a close associate of WikiLeaks founder Julian Assange , told The Daily Mail that Podesta s emails were leaked to the organization by a disgruntled insider , not the Russians Consequently , there are suspicions it may have been Braverman \(

So far Braverman s apparent disappearance has only been discussed by bloggers and fringe websites , which often mix the fact that he has gone silent with other unconfirmed claims For instance , the site WhatDoesItMean com reported that Braverman requested asylum in Russia on October 23 The information apparently came from a Russian blogger , who reported it in a rambling blog post on LiveLeak That s pretty thin evidence Moreover , WhatDoesItMean com is known for posting questionable news stories The left leaning , myth debunking site Snopes labeled the news site s account of Braverman as false , but based its judgment on the fact that website publishes false stories Aside from this circular argument , Snopes provides no independent evidence for its judgment I contacted the Russian embassy and received no response So at the moment , the claim that Braverman requested asylum from the Russians is an unconfirmed rumor Where sEric Could Braverman be in FBI Protective Custody \? There are also rumors that Braverman is in FBI protective custody , perhaps in exchange for testifying against the Clintons Sources within the FBI have said it is likely there will be indictments handed down over the Clinton Foundation s pay to play schemes Senior FBI officials told CNN that the investigation into the Clinton Foundation had never ended and is still ongoing According to The Daily Caller News Foundation , that probe now involves as many as five FBI bureaus across the country New York , Little Rock , Washington , D C , Los Angeles and Miami Would the FBI have hustled Braverman to safety once it was known Podesta had pegged him as a mole \? This theory seems plausible , given what we know But there is still no independent evidence of it All Questions , No Answers If Braverman is in hiding to protect his life , is it because he leaked the Podesta emails to Wikileaks , and or is he preparing to testify against the Clintons \? The one thing we know is that Braverman has disappeared from the public eye , and that neither he , his husband Neil Brown , nor his family , nor his Yale employers , has made a single public statement to dispel the speculations The hashtag WheresEric has been started on Twitter Follow Rachel on Twitter at Rach IC",false

"1 33KUT 's Syeda Hasan reports What I find is that leaders of the other party are against efforts to crack down on voter fraud , Abbott said The fact is that voter fraud is rampant In Texas , unlike some other states and unlike some other leaders , we are committed to cracking down on voter fraud In an interview with the Texas Tribune CEO and Editor in Chief Evan Smith on Friday , Obama said that leaders in Texas are partly to blame for low voter turnout in the state The folks who are governing the good state of Texas are n't interested in having more people participate , Obama said Obama has been previously critical of Voter ID laws like the one Texas passed in 2011 A federal judge ruled last year that the Texas law had a discriminatory effect by restricting access to the polls for black and Hispanic Texans Last week the full U S 5th Circuit Court of Appeals announced that it would hear arguments over whether the law violates the Voting Rights Act The law requires most citizens to show one of a handful of forms of allowable photo identification before their election ballots can be counted One specific policy that Obama suggested the state should adopt to increase turnout would be online voter registration But Abbott appeared uninterested in the proposal when asked about it at a press conference following the announcement that California based Pegasus Foods is building a new , 80 , 000 square foot manufacturing facility in Rockwall , Texas We don t want to open the system up to methodologies or ways of voting that would promote or allow voter fraud , Abbott said To the contrary to the president s comment , the fact is despite our voter registration laws we had the highest level of turnout than ever before in the primary that occurred just a few weeks before he made that comment While Texas did witness historic voter turnout in the 2016 primaries , the state still had one of the lowest voting age participation rates of the states that have held primaries so far at 21 5 percent , besting only Louisiana as of last week But Abbott did not attribute those figures to the state s election laws , instead pointing to the lack of faith in government among voters Voters and citizens repeatedly say , Why go vote if we re going to have corrupt leaders in office \? Abbott said So we need to root out and eliminate corrupt leaders and root out and eliminate corruption in the voting process , and that means greater ballot security , not less ballot security Abbott noted that he personally prosecuted voter fraud cases across the entire state of Texas while he was the state 's attorney general from 2002 to 2015 As U S Sen Cory Booker , D New Jersey , pointed out last year in light of the 50th anniversary of the Voting Rights Act , Voter fraud remains by many accounts a rare phenomenon in Texas You 're more likely to get struck by lightning in Texas than to find any kind of voter fraud , U S Sen Cory Booker , D New Jersey , said last year , an assertion that PolitiFact found to be true As of last year , there had been a total of 85 election fraud prosecutions resolved in Texas , including 51 guilty or no contest pleas and 9 convictions , according to PolitiFact Lorraine Minnite , a Rutgers professor and author of the book The Myth of Voter Fraud , determined that four cases in Texas from 2000 to 2014 involved in person voter fraud Tags",true

"He sat at the conference table next to Frederick Douglass as they tried to convince President Abraham Lincoln that African Americans should be allowed to fight for their own freedom He served five terms in Congress He ran a newspaper and helped found a state Republican Party But first , he had to win his freedom To do that , he conceived a plan that struck a blow against the Confederacy so significant that he was heralded across the nation Carrying out his mission required bravery , intelligence and precision timing attributes that many whites at that time thought blacks didn t possess Robert Smalls proved them wrong and changed history in the doing Smalls was born in Beaufort , S C , on April 5 , 1839 , the son of Lydia Polite , a slave who was a housekeeper in the city home of John McKee , owner of the Ashdale Plantation on Lady s Island , one of the Sea Islands Though he never knew the identity of his father , it was widely believed that Smalls was the progeny of McKee s son , Henry There was a distinctly fatherly relationship between Henry McKee and my great grandfather , said Helen Boulware Moore of Lakewood Ranch , Fla , who grew up hearing stories about Smalls from her grandmother , Elizabeth Lydia Smalls Bampfield , his daughter Growing up at the McKees place , Smalls played with both black and white children , ate food cooked in the kitchen where his mother worked and slept in a bed in a small house that was provided for her Polite had been taken from her family on the island plantation at age 9 to work as a companion to the McKee children in Beaufort Because of his connection to Henry McKee , Smalls was allowed to go places and do things others couldn t do That could cause problems with blacks and could be a dangerous thing with whites , as well , said Michael Allen of the National Park Service s Gullah Geechee Cultural Heritage Corridor , which runs through South Carolina The town of Beaufort maintained a 7 p m daily curfew for blacks , but on many occasions young Smalls ignored the bell and continued to play with white children Several times , he was taken into custody Henry McKee paid a fine to retrieve him , Moore said When he was 10 , his mother sent him to the plantation to learn the reality of slave life He came back defiant , not willing to comply , as she had hoped He acted as if he could do what the white children did , and that frightened her , Moore said Worried that her son would suffer consequences for his bold behavior , Polite asked McKee to rent out Smalls at age 12 to work in nearby Charleston Each week , he was given 1 of his wages the rest went to the McKees He supplemented his income by purchasing cheap candy and tobacco and reselling them At age 18 , Smalls met Hannah Jones , an enslaved hotel worker who had two daughters He sought permission to marry and live with her in an apartment in Charleston , Moore said He was smart enough to know that at any moment , she and any children they had might be sold , so he asked her enslaver , who agreed , Moore said Smalls became skilled at working on ships , eventually advancing to the position of pilot In 1861 , he was hired to work on a steamer called the Planter , which was used to transport cotton to ships headed to Europe But once the Civil War started , the Confederates seized it for use as an armed transport vessel Smalls knew how to navigate He knew that the white crew trusted him He had his eye on freedom , and all he needed was an opportunity They were going to seize the ship , said Lawrence Guyot , a black history expert in Washington It was dangerous It was daring It was unprecedented And when they accomplished it , it was used to demonstrate that blacks could be brave and strategic in pulling off military maneuvers Moore , a retired professor , pointed out that a lot is said about Smalls s patriotism , but it was not simply patriotism that led him to act Smalls had sought to purchase his wife , his two young children and his wife s daughters , but the price of 800 was too steep In the early hours of May 13 , 1862 , the Planter s crew took an unapproved furlough into town , leaving Smalls , 23 , and several other black crew members aboard Wearing a captain s coat and hat and taking care to hide his black face , Smalls steered the ship toward a rendezvous spot to pick up the men s families It was really dangerous because they were flying the Confederate flag , Moore said They made a decision that they wouldn t be taken alive Through Charleston Harbor and past several Confederate lookouts , the ship steamed Smalls signaled at the appropriate points , as he d seen the captain do By dawn , the Planter had reached the federal blockade of the harbor The crew lowered the Confederate flag and hoisted a white sheet that Hannah had brought from the hotel where she worked , Moore said One of the most heroic and daring adventures since the war commenced was undertaken and successfully accomplished by a party of negroes in Charleston , trumpeted the June 14 , 1862 , edition of Harper s Weekly Commodore S F DuPont , the commander of the federal fleet barricading Fort Sumter , in Charleston Harbor , wrote to the Department of the Army that Smalls provided information of the utmost importance to the Union , such as the location of mines he had helped lay in the harbor while working for the Confederacy , news accounts show This May marks the 150th anniversary of the seizure of the Planter A commemoration is scheduled for May 12 13 in Charleston Somebody should make a movie about this guy , said Frank Smith , founding director of the District s African American Civil War Memorial Museum , which includes an exhibit about Smalls Smalls became a ship pilot for the Union , serving as a volunteer until he was commissioned as a second lieutenant in Company B of the 33rd Regiment , U S Colored Troops He fought in 17 battles and is credited with recruiting 5 , 000 blacks He was later designated a major general in the South Carolina militia In April 1865 , Smalls returned to Beaufort and the McKee house , which he had purchased in a tax sale , using part of a 1 , 500 appropriation he received for taking the Planter Back home , he was reunited with his mother and one of his former owners Mrs McKee , after the war was over , came wandering to the house one day , Moore said Because of her dementia , she didn t realize the house was no longer hers Smalls , who had learned to read and write while serving in the military , went into business and then politics He served in both houses of the South Carolina Legislature and in 1874 was elected to the U S House of Representatives , beating a white Democrat in a district that was almost 70 percent black But his later years were plagued by racism as white supremacist Democrats stepped up efforts to unseat Reconstruction legislators He was accused of bribery but later cleared , historical accounts show In his personal life , Smalls lost a son in infancy and Hannah in 1883 Seven years later , at the age of 51 , he married Annie Wigg , who bore him a second son , William Robert Annie died a few years later Smalls himself died in 1915 at what is now called the the Robert Smalls House , at 511 Prince Street in Beaufort It is listed on the National Register of Historic Places and is currently for sale for 1 2 million Other structures and streets have been named for Smalls The African American Museum in Philadelphia is currently displaying The Life and Times of Congressman Robert Smalls A Traveling Exhibition The highest honor , though , was the commissioning in 2007 of the Maj Gen Robert Smalls , an Army logistics support vessel , in a ceremony at Baltimore s Inner Harbor attended by several of his descendants It is the only Army ship named for an African American Moore said Smalls s direct descendants number about 75 , the youngest of whom is her 3 month old granddaughter , Maya Helen Jenkins Moore s son , Michael , 49 , the chairman of Glory Foods , which sells Southern style dishes , said his great great grandfather s story is an inspiration for his four young sons , as it was for him As a child , he said , he would search bookstores for books about Smalls I didn t think about Robert Smalls as history , he said I thought of him as family The thing that I m proudest of is his mind set that he was going to be free , when he had no rational or logical reason to think that he would be It was all or nothing",true
"On Friday , my colleagues Tara Golshan , Dylan Scott , and Jeff Stein published a remarkable piece collecting interviews with eight congressional Republicans about their health care bill They asked the simplest question possible What problems do you think this bill will solve , and how do you think it will solve them \? Not a single Republican has a clear answer The exchange with Sen John McCain is particularly bizarre Tara Golshan Generally , what are the big problems this bill is trying to solve \? John McCain Almost all of them They re trying to get to 51 votes Tara Golshan Policy wise What are the problems in the American health care system this is trying to solve and is the bill doing that right now \? John McCain Well , it 's whether you have full repeal , whether you have partial repeal , whether you have the basis of it It 's spread all over Tara Golshan But based on the specifics of the bill you have heard so far , is it solving the problems in the health care system \? John McCain What I hear is that we have not reached consensus That s what everybody knows But McCain s reply , while incoherent , isn t as offensive as Health and Human Services Secretary Tom Price s straight lie that Americans will absolutely not lose Medicaid coverage under the House bill It s worth asking why Republicans are lying about this , why they can t give a clear explanation as to what their bill does , why they re jamming the legislation through a secretive , rushed process that even their own members are criticizing Because there is a reason And it is damning In 2009 , Democrats had an easy answer to what the Affordable Care Act was meant to do They wanted to cover more people and cut costs They could give that answer because it was a basically popular position , and because it s what their bill actually did , or at least tried to do In 2017 , Republicans have a similarly easy answer for their bill They want to cover fewer people and use the savings to fund tax cuts for the wealthy That is what their legislation does But they can t give that answer because it s a horribly unpopular position What if , just work with me here , instead of passing a hugely unpopular HC bill in the dead of night , the GOP tried to do something popular \? Ross Douthat \( DouthatNYT \) June 13 , 2017 That is why they are trying to write a bill in secret and pass it before the public has a chance to mobilize against it That s why , when asked to describe the bill s provisions , Republicans offer baldfaced lies or word salad The difference between Obamacare and Trumpcare Democrats always believed the Affordable Care Act would be popular They believed that even when polls said it wasn t popular They were certain that when Americans understood what was in the law when they saw it would cover tens of millions of people , and regulate away the worst abuses of the insurance industry , and let children stay on their parents plans , and use Medicare to pilot a host of cost control experiments they would come around This basic belief carried through the more than year long process behind the bill It s why Democrats held dozens of hearings , and released draft after draft of their legislation It s why , when the bill was in danger , President Obama invited congressional leadership to the Blair House for a multi hour televised debate over the bill He was certain he had the better of the argument , and that if the American people could just hear it , Democrats would win By contrast , Republicans have concluded the public will hate their bill if they know what s in it , and so they are doing everything in their power to keep it a secret and move on from it as fast as possible The process that produced the House health bill was shocking The law was rushed to its first vote , with barely any public hearings , in less than a month It was passed before the Congressional Budget Office had even scored the final version It wasn t just that House Republicans didn t want the public to know what their bill did They didn t want to know what their bill did ! The Senate process has been less chaotic but even more cynical The legislation is being written by 13 Republican senators all of them men in secret No one has seen a draft of it No public hearings have happened , and none are scheduled Republicans briefly considered banning cameras from the halls of the Senate so they couldn t be asked about the bill on television Various Senate Republicans have condemned the process The process is better if you do it in public , and that people get buy in along the way and understand what s going on , Sen Bob Corker \( R TN \) told the New York Times but they re not forcing any changes to it Though no bill exists for public viewing today , Mitch McConnell s plan is to pass the legislation before July Fourth The extreme secrecy is a situation without precedent , at least in creating health care law , writes Julie Rovner , one of Washington s most respected health reporters My colleague Sarah Kliff , in a searing piece , recalls the hours she spent covering hearings during the drafting of the Affordable Care Act , and notes C SPAN is empty of similar hearings today I ve covered Obamacare since day one , she writes I ve never seen lying and obstruction like this A bill you can t defend is a bill that won t survive The strategy Republicans have chosen may work to pass a bill , but it won t work to defend the chaos that bill creates Democrats thought the Affordable Care Act would become more popular as it began delivering insurance to people , and so the world they were creating was a world they would be able to defend Do Republicans really believe their health plan will become more popular when it begins taking insurance away from people \? And if they don t , then what do they think will come next \? I ve written my prediction They re paving the way to Medicare for all , as the next Democratic majority will respond to Obamacare s destruction by passing the law liberals wanted to pass in the first place I assume Republicans have a different view than that But what is it \? If their plan is so unpopular they can t defend it in theory , how will they defend it in practice \? Each day this goes on , it seems less like a legislative process and more like a form of madness The only plausible explanation I ve heard for the persistent progress of this bill no one likes is that Republicans feel they need to keep their promise to repeal and replace Obamacare , and this is a version of keeping that promise But this isn t what they promised Donald Trump swore everyone would be covered under his plan Mitch McConnell promised lower deductibles and copays , and criticized Obamacare for leaving 25 million people uninsured Read the clarity of McConnell s critique of Obamacare , and compare it with how he and his colleagues are talking about health care now Well , what you need to understand is that there are 25 million Americans who aren t covered now If the idea behind Obamacare was to get everyone covered , that s one of the many failures In addition to premiums going up , copayments going up , deductibles going up And many Americans who actually did get insurance when they did not have it before have really bad insurance that they have to pay for , and the deductibles are so high that it s really not worth much to them So it is chaotic The status quo is simply unacceptable Republican voters thought the GOP would replace Obamacare with something better , something that would help them They thought that because that s what Republican politicians told them That was what they were promised This bill breaks the GOP s health care promises",false

"San Bernardino , CA In a recent bill presented to the Senate , law enforcement officers would be required to request permission from their shift supervisor before utilizing their service weapon The bill , titled A Second Chance , is geared towards preventing police atrocities As part of the bill , officers finding themselves in a life threatening situation would first need to call their supervisor and ask before introducing their service weapon into the scenario Further , the supervisor would then in turn have to call a local civilian committee to discuss the matter so that a community backed decision can be made These steps would be taken prior to drawing not only their firearm but any other weapon , including tasers , OC spray and batons In addition to this , officers approved for use of force will be informed of the number of rounds available for use in their particular situation and they will be required to yell fire in between each allotted round BNN was able to speak to Senator \( and presidential hopeful \) Kamala Harris , the bill s proud sponsor who stated , This is just a great idea all the way around Not only will the decreased amount of gun shots help with greenhouse gas emissions , but it will force officers to check their privilege A person shouldn t be shot at just because they are trying to kill a police officer Proponents of the new bill say it should be viewed as a type of Community Policing , aimed at improving public relations , particularly in cities with increased amounts of police violence A local group that identifies as Antifa is tossing their support into the ring and celebrated the bill s introduction by smashing local parking meters with bats while wearing masks and chanting Parking is a right so let s make its left Predictably , many police unions weren t as ecstatic about the proposed bill One Chicago area union representative had this to say Our officers would be required to take shots , and then ask permission to return fire \? Is this Chicago or a UN peacekeeping mission \? Groups of officers were seen carrying in gaming consoles at the start of their shift as they are now only responding to situations where a notarized letter is received in dispatch requesting the police to a location or mitigate circumstances that may touch on requiring to enforce the law The Chicago Chief of Police could not be reached for a statement BNN did reach out to his handler , Mayor Rahm Emanuel , but his office declined to comment",false
"Purple Eyes and Other Interesting Anomalies If you have read any of the statistics of my Daria based fan fiction characters or any of my stories about those characters , you will have noticed that three of my characters \( Raven , Rebecca , and Zia \) have deep purple eyes It 's not because they wear contacts in order to hide their real eye colors It 's because of a genetic mutation called Alexandria 's Genesis The Origins of the Genesis Alexandria 's Genesis , as it has been called since the 1960s , is a genetic mutation generally found in women of Euro American \( a k a , Caucasian \) descent This mutation can be traced as far as the Middle Ages in Northern Europe The first known record of Alexandria 's Genesis was written in the year CE 1330 \( Common Era \) A woman named Alexandria Augustine came into the world on April 29 , CE 1329 in London , England At the time , she appeared to be normal , but her parents soon noticed that her eyes were changing from the blue eyes Alexandria had at birth to the purple eyes she would have by her first birthday The parents were startled by this dramatic change They took her to their priest , thinking that a witch did this to their child , and that the priest might be able to ask God to change the eye color back The priest told the parents that it was not the work of the devil , but a myth come true This particular priest had heard a story about a race of people who had purple eyes These humans were thought to have come from Egypt after a mysterious light flashed in the sky during a moonless night thousands of years ago The purple eyed humans also had very fair skin , and were thought to be spirits because of their appearance The so called spirit people eventually went north and vanished without a trace The priest told her parents not to worry , for they had a special child in their hands and they should take good care of her Eventually , Alexandria grew up to be a very beautiful woman , got married , had four children \( all four were girls , and all four also had the mutation \) , never got sick , and died at the age of 150 of natural causes It is this discovery that helped to name the genetic mutation when the gene was discovered in 1968 The Characteristics of Alexandria 's Genesis The first characteristic of people with Alexandria 's Genesis is their eye color When someone is born with this genetic mutation , the eyes are either blue or gray at birth At six months , the eyes begin their transformation from the original color to purple This process is completed by the person 's first birthday A second process , where the eye color deepens , starts as soon as the first is completed This slow process continues until the onset of puberty By then , the eye will have become a dark purple , a deep purple , a royal purple , or a violet blue color , and will be that color for the rest of their time These changes do not affect the person 's eyesight , though If anything , the eyesight is , and remains until death , 20 20 Speaking of puberty , those who have the mutation will never grow any facial , body , pubic , or anal hair during this stage of growth In fact , the only hair they will ever have is what is on their heads , in their ears and nose , their eyebrows , and their eyelashes Women also have an added bonus beyond never having to shave never buying tampons or pads It turns out that females born with Alexandria 's Genesis never menstruate in their lives They are fertile , however , and can go through the same things that women without the mutation can go through every month Beyond these differences , those with the mutation go through puberty as normally as everyone else does Below are all of the characteristics of Alexandria 's Genesis Clear , silver like purple eyes \( after 1st birthday deepen in color until onset of puberty \) No facial or body hair growth beyond what was already there at birth Dark brown or black hair Shimmering white skin that resist tanning and burning Lack of menstruation cycle \( in women \) Highly evolved immune system \( has been known to resist every disease known to man so far \) Appear 5 20 years younger \( after the age of 21 , the aging process slows down greatly it stops completely between the ages of 40 50 \) Long life span \( ranges from 130 170 years \) Perfect vision Never overweight \( their metabolism prevents the gaining of too much fat a k a , partial lipodystophy \) Well developed and proportioned bodies Found mainly in women of Euro American descent Women are the primary carriers of the mutation Children born from mothers with the mutation are also carriers Mutation remains active generation after generation Mutation grows stronger generation after generation Interracial Children of the Genesis An interesting aspect of this mutation is that if it passed on to a child whose mother or father is not of Euro American descent , the child will receive all of the qualities of those who have the gene The only quality that changes is the skin color it is lighter than those without the gene are , but it is not as light as the parent with the mutation is So far , this gene has shown up in children whose mother or father was Hispanic , Asian , or Arabic If these children were to marry someone within their own race , their offspring would also develop the same characteristics The most startling aspect of the biracial Genesis children is that they take on a more Euro American appearance Not much more is known about these children beyond these initial findings Another Interesting Development In ten percent of the population that has Alexandria 's Genesis , there is another characteristic of this mutation that is increasing on a yearly basis the processing of human waste or lack thereof As it turns out , in some of these people , the mutation is actually causing the digestive system to produce no waste No one has found out how this is possible , but most scientists have a theory that may explain this increasing phenomenon The digestion process goes through its normal procedure until the digested product enters the large intestine It is there , scientists suggest , that the large intestine absorbs everything and uses the product to keep the body in top shape This makes the bladder completely useless , and leaves the small intestine and rectum as just an opening It is not much of a theory , since very little is still known about Alexandria 's Genesis Conclusion There are questions about this genetic mutation that remain unanswered The biggest question left unanswered is where Alexandria 's Genesis actually first appeared Many researchers are looking into the myth of the spirit people of Egypt in order to find out if this mutation really did exist several thousands of years ago If that is indeed the case , the next question to be answered is if this mutation is of Earth origin or of a different place",false
"It 's a fact the election of Donald Trump is an incredibly scary prospect for many Americans for all sorts of reasons Hate crimes are up dramatically , people are afraid for their basic safety Trump does n't seem to have even the most basic understanding of the job he 's now got on his hands He 's still tweeting In the event of a total emergency , there is a Constitutional loophole that could remove him from office Could Donald Trump be removed with the 25th Amendment \? Yes , Mike Pence could fire the president , but it would be a very dangerous thing for democracy Here 's how the 25th amendment works Once Trump assumes office , Mike Pence , along with either a majority of Trump 's cabinet or Congressional Republicans , can invoke the 25th amendment because the president is unfit or lacks the capacity to serve , according to Cornell University Law School Legal Institute And in the event a President Trump is endangering national security or is deemed completely unable to do the job , that 's a solid option It 's been invoked six times since it was ratified in 1967 , most notably by President Richard Nixon , according to Politico But if the 25th amendment is used for political purposes , that becomes a dangerous threat to democracy itself Vice President Pence deciding with a handful of presidential advisers or Congressional GOPs to wrestle control away from a democratically elected sitting president sounds a lot like a coup Trump was elected , whether you agree with it or not , because Americans wanted a president who would break from the Washington D C political establishment If Trump uses his presidency to challenge the Republican establishment in Congress , the idea of getting rid of Trump and replacing him with a party faithful like Pence might seem like a good idea And that 's the scenario that should concern all Americans Consider the fact that many right wing news outlets called for the 25th amendment to be invoked against President Obama for mental illness , among other perceived incapacities , like this December 2015 article from the Washington Times that asked , Is it now time to invoke Section 4 of the 25th Amendment \? Has our president officially lost his ability to discharge the powers and duties of his office \? Anyone who listened to President Obama speak to reporters in Paris on Tuesday would reasonably conclude it is high time to start drawing up the papers to transmit to Congress for his removal The 25th amendment is , if you 'll forgive the metaphor , the nuclear option the emergency glass we can break in the event of a catastrophe And if President Trump turns out to be a danger to national security then it will be up to those around him to make the decision of whether to strip him of the powers of his office But if Trump can be elected by the American people and simply discarded once he 's no longer useful to the political machine , then maybe the folks who elected him to demolish the establishment are onto something after all",true
"The Mexican border was closed for hours Sunday at the San Ysidro Port of Entry after a group of migrants in Tijuana stormed the area , prompting the U S Border Patrol to fire tear gas at the group The incident marks a serious escalation in the tensions that have roiled Tijuana in recent weeks as thousands of migrants from Central America have amassed there with hopes for entering the United States President Trump has vowed to seal off the Mexican border in recent days and pushed to keep any migrants in Mexico as they await the immigration process Border Patrol officials said they used the tear gas after migrants threw objects at them The gas was used to dispel the group because of the risk to agents safety Several agents were hit by the projectiles , the agency said in a statement The dramatic images of the clash were already being used by the various sides of the immigration debate Backers of Trump s crackdown said the events showed the need to secure the border , while some critics said they were disturbed to see tear gas used on the group , which included some children As Mexican authorities tried to move the migrants away from the border , gridlock was occurring at what is one of the world s busiest international crossings U S Customs and Border Protection closed northbound and southbound access , as well as pedestrian access , to the port of entry around 11 30 a m Sunday At 3 45 p m , authorities reopened pedestrian access By 6 p m , all northbound and southbound vehicle crossings were opened Extra Border Patrol personnel were deployed to the San Ysidro port on Sunday in preparation for multiple planned demonstrations on both side of the border , according to a statement from U S Customs and Border Protection on Sunday afternoon As the demonstrations on the Mexican side reached the border area , some members of the demonstration split off to head toward multiple locations along the border , the statement read Some attempted to illegally enter the U S through both the northbound and southbound vehicles lanes at the port of entry itself Those persons were stopped and turned back to Mexico The port was closed to prepare for the possibility that additional groups would also break off from demonstrations for a possible attempt or attempts to rush illegally through the port of entry , according to the statement The move came as hundreds of Central American migrants who have been gathering in Tijuana pushed past a blockade of Mexican police standing guard and rushed toward the border The migrants carried hand painted American and Honduran flags and chanted We are not criminals ! We are international workers ! A small clash occurred late in the morning when migrants tried to run around Mexican federal police , leaving one officer with a cut on his lip A helicopter circled overhead when a small group of men and teenage boys ran past Mexican police to a small hole in the border fence U S authorities appeared to deploy tear gas and a flash bang , which makes a loud noise but does not fire a projectile , at a group of people who were trying to get through a section of the border fence Some at the fence could be seen throwing rocks At one point before noon , Border Patrol authorities fired what appeared to be a flash bang and launched tear gas at a group of people trying to make their way through a fence Some mothers ran under a train , clutching their crying children Photos from the scene showed children in the area where the tear gas landed Shortly after noon , the skirmishes appeared to be calming down A woman used a bullhorn to spoke through the fence to U S Border Patrol agents , trying to persuade them to let in migrants We don t want war , we don t want killing , she said across the line In response , Mexican federal police in riot gear pushed people away from the fence At least three helicopters circled the area Traffic was backed up along Interstate 805 into National City and Bonita Around 1 30 p m , a large Homeland Security bus was ushered past the border barricade The additional personnel at the border included Customs and Border Protection officers , U S Border Patrol agents and Air and Marine agents recently sent to the region San Diego police also readied on duty officers Sunday afternoon to respond to the border division if needed None of the migrants managed to cross the border into the U S More than 4 , 700 Central Americans have been living crammed together in a Tijuana sports complex State authorities say by the time it is over , as many as 9 , 000 Central Americans will have arrived in Tijuana with the hope of crossing to the United States Many of them are from Honduras , a country beset by violence and poverty , and came with the intention of seeking asylum in the United States U S Secretary of Homeland Security Kirstjen Nielsen said in a statement the department will not tolerate this type of lawlessness and will not hesitate to shut down ports of entry for security and public safety reasons We will also seek to prosecute to the fullest extent of the law anyone who destroys federal property , endangers our front line operators , or violates our nation s sovereignty Homeland security will maintain a robust presence along the border and continued close contact with Mexican authorities , according to the statement The Coalition for Humane Immigrant Rights , CHIRLA , an immigrant rights organization in California , condemned the use of tear gas against immigrants at the border It is a despicable act on the part of the Trump administration and CBP officials to attack defenseless women and children firing tear gas , a chemical agent , at them , Angelica Salas , executive director for the organization , said in a statement These are human beings who are reaching a point of desperation because their asylum claims are being processed at a snail s pace or not at all On Sunday morning , before the border closed , President Trump used his presidential Twitter account to blame Democrats for allowing border crossings , and suggested that Mexico and originating countries should prevent caravans from reaching the border , or forming at all Such caravans , he wrote , are a way they get certain people out of their country and dump in U S No longer Less than 24 hours earlier , Trump had reiterated threats on Twitter to close the southern border threats that have alarmed many in Mexico , since cross border trade is a mainstay of the Mexican economy In his tweet , Trump also said migrants would not be allowed into the United States until their claims are individually approved in court Others would stay in Mexico , he added , without elaboration Would be very SMART if Mexico would stop the Caravans long before they get to our Southern Border , or if originating countries would not let them form \( it is a way they get certain people out of their country and dump in U S No longer \) Dems created this problem No crossings !

"ESPN Suspends Curt Schilling for Comparing Islamists to NazisJared Wickerham Getty Imagesby Ben Shapiro 25 Aug 2015 025 Aug , 201525 Aug , 2015On Tuesday , ESPN suspended former Red Sox pitcher Curt Schilling for tweeting a meme comparing radical Muslims to Nazis Here was the offending tweet Schilling deleted the tweet after blowback ESPN released a statement upon suspending Schilling Curt s tweet was completely unacceptable , and in no way represents our company s perspective We made that point very strongly to Curt and have removed him from his current Little League assignment pending further consideration The tweet was offensive to radical Muslims Factually speaking , there were approximately 6 5 million formal members of the Nazi Party in 1940 , out of a total German population of well over 80 million a little over 8 percent That number of members did not fully represent the level of support for the Nazi regime in Germany in 1940 , of course The same is true in the radicalized Muslim community A very small percentage of Muslims globally are formal members of terror groups it is difficult to estimate precise numbers due to secrecy , although their total membership runs into the hundreds of thousands \( the Iranian Revolutionary Guard alone has 120 , 000 members , and some estimates have placed the ISIS membership at above 200 , 00 \) That terrorist membership is the tip of the iceberg as I have written before , a huge percentage of worldwide Muslims are radicalized If you calculate the number of Muslims globally who \( 1 \) believe that 9 11 was not committed by Muslims \( 2 \) think that shariah law ought to be implemented \( 3 \) support terrorist attacks or \( 4 \) have a positive or neutral attitude toward ISIS , Hamas , Hezbollah , Osama Bin Laden or any other terrorist group or terrorist , the number calculates out to well above 800 million radicalized Muslims PolitiFact s ridiculous attempts to counter these calculations cherry picking their own , far narrower standard of radicalization led them to the awkward position that 19 percent of Muslims in various countries , including the West , are radicalized \( some 182 million Muslims worldwide \) As Schilling wrote , the math is staggering when you get to true numbers But ESPN has no interest in true numbers , because true numbers are awkward Unsurprisingly , ESPN refused to explain why Schilling s tweet was unacceptable Is it because radicalized Muslims are somehow better than Germans who weren t formal Nazi Party members \? Is it because the genocidal Iranian regime or the barbarians of ISIS are somehow less objectionable than the Nazis themselves \? It is worth noting that Schiling did not say that all Muslims should be tarred with the terrorist brush , any more than all Germans should have been tarred with the Nazi brush The point of his tweet , to anyone with a functioning prefrontal cortex , is obvious a small , brutal percentage of a larger , partially supportive population can do tremendous harm That s inarguable Fortunately , ESPN doesn t have to argue with Schilling or anyone else They simply suspended Schilling , without any real rationale \( by way of comparison , they did not suspend frequent ESPN guest Kevin Blackistone for calling the Star Spangled Banner a war anthem on their airwaves \) And the compliant media breath a sigh of relief , having made the world safer for those offended by tweets and more ignorant of the threat of radical Islam Ben Shapiro is Senior Editor At Large of Breitbart News and The New York Times bestselling author , most recently , of the book , The People vs Barack Obama The Criminal Case Against The Obama Administration \( Threshold Editions , June 10 , 2014 \) Follow Ben Shapiro on Twitter benshapiro Read More Stories About Comment count on this article reflects comments made on Breitbart com and Facebook Visit Breitbart 's Facebook Page BREITBART CONNECT",false

bombs on U S backed rebels U S and Russian fighter jets bloodlessly tangled in the air over Syria on June 16 as the American pilots tried and failed to stop the Russians from bombing U S backed rebels in southern Syria near the border with Jordan The aerial close encounter underscores just how chaotic Syria s skies have become as Russia and the U S led coalition work at cross purposes , each dropping bombs in support of separate factions in the five year old civil war The near clash also highlights the escalating risk of American and Russian forces actually coming to blows over Syria , potentially sparking a The incident began when at least two twin engine Su 34 bombers , some of Moscow s most advanced warplanes , struck The rebels had been conducting counter ISIL operations in the area , the Pentagon stated on June 18 , using an alternative acronym for ISIS The United States and its allies in Syria clearly did not expect the air strike The rebels in At Tanf are party to a shaky

wider conflict between the world s leading nuclear powers The incident began when at least two twin engine Su 34 bombers , some of Moscow s most advanced warplanes , struck what the Pentagon described as a border garrison housing around 200 U S supported rebels in At Tanf on the Syrian side of the Syria Jordan border The rebels had been conducting counter ISIL operations in the area , the Pentagon stated on June 18 , using an alternative acronym for ISIS The United States and its allies in Syria clearly did not expect the air strike The rebels in At Tanf are party to a shaky ceasefire agreement

active over At Tanf The Su 34s initial strike wounded , and perhaps killed , some of the rebels in At Tanf The U S Navy scrambled F A 18 fighters to intercept the Russians , the Los Angeles Times reported The Navy has deployed two aircraft carriers to the region for strikes on ISIS As the F A 18s approached the Su 34s , officials with U S Central Command which oversees America s wars in the Middle East and Afghanistan used a special hotline to contact their Russian counterparts directing Russia s own intervention in Syria Arriving over At Tanf , the American pilots apparently spoke directly to the Russian aviators Pilots CAN communicate with one another on a communications channel set up to avoid air accidents , Central Command confirmed in a statement to The Daily Beast Washington and Moscow had established the hotline as part of a so called Safety of Flight Memorandum of Understanding that the two governments signed in October specifically in order to avoid the kind of aerial confrontation that occurred over Syria last week With the American jets flying close enough to visually identify the Su 34s , the Russians departed the air space over At Tanf Some time shortly thereafter , the F A 18s ran low on fuel and left the area in order to link up with an aerial tanker That s when the Su 34s reportedly returned to At Tanf and bombed the rebels again According to the Los Angeles Times , the second strike killed first responders assisting survivors of the first bombing run The next day , senior U S Defense Department officials organized an extraordinary video conference with Russian counterparts to discuss the incident The meeting included Acting Assistant Secretary for International Security Affairs Elissa Slotkin and U S Marine Corps Lt Gen Kenneth McKenzie , a strategic planner on the Pentagon s joint staff , plus unspecified Russian Ministry of Defense officials Department officials expressed strong concerns about the attack on the coalition supported counter ISIL forces at the At Tanf garrison , which included forces that are participants in the cessation of hostilities in Syria , and emphasized that those concerns would be addressed through ongoing diplomatic discussions on the cessation of hostilities , Defense Department spokesman Peter Cook explained in a statement Regarding safety , department officials conveyed that Russia s continued strikes at At Tanf , even after U S attempts to inform Russian forces through proper channels of on going coalition air support to the counter ISIL forces , created safety concerns for U S and coalition forces , Cook continued Department officials requested Russian responses to address those concerns Russian Defense Ministry spokesman Igor Konashenkov confirmed , via the country s state owned media , that the teleconference took place but he did not specify the results of the extraordinary meeting Russian warplanes had Russian warplanes had previously shadowed planes belonging to the U S led coalition over Syria , but the coalition always described the Russians behavior as professional By contrast , in April Russian Su 24 bombers repeatedly buzzed the U S Navy warship USS Donald Cook while the vessel sailed in international waters in the Black Sea A Pentagon spokesman called the Russians actions in that incident provocative and unprofessional The Kremlin should be keenly

flier died when Syrian rebels on the ground opened fire on his parachute Russian , Syrian and Iranian forces launched a complex rescue mission that ultimately retrieved the surviving pilot One Russian marine died and a helicopter was destroyed during that operation The fallout from the November incident continues , with Russia and Turkey exchanging threats and Moscow imposing economic sanctions on Ankarra including limits on some food imports to Russia from Turkey It s not clear how close the U S fighters came to attacking and potentially shooting down the Su 34s over At Tanf Central Command declined to say what the rules of engagement are for American pilots flying over Syria ROE are actually specifics that we don t get into , Central Command said in a statement The last time a U S military warplane shot down a Russian actually , Soviet plane was in 1953 , over Korea or China , depending on which historians you believe The last time a Russian or Soviet warplane shot down an

"Ned StaffordTransformed child psychiatry by advocating research into developmental problemsEarly in his medical career , in the mid 1950s , Leon Eisenberg became fascinated with the childhood mind Wanting to know more , he broke free from the shackles of the Freudian psychoanalytic dogma that dominated child psychiatry at the time to conduct groundbreaking biologically based research of childhood developmental problems This research included the first randomised clinical drug trials in child psychiatry I think what Leon brought to the field was a different way of thinking thinking out of the box , said David DeMaso , chairman of psychiatry at Boston Children s Hospital and professor of psychiatry and pediatrics at Harvard Medical School He was thinking in terms of biology , of evidence based treatment , way before anybody else His was a bio psycho social model at a time when psychoanalytical thinking was the norm Eisenberg s direct involvement as a child psychiatry researcher was over by 1967 , when he moved to Harvard Medical School as chief of psychiatry at Massachusetts General Hospital But in a dozen years he had helped transform the discipline Beginning in 1952 at Johns Hopkins University in Baltimore , Eisenberg began a fellowship under Leo Kanner , the Austrian born child psychiatrist , who , in the early 1940s , first described autism In a study of autistic adolescents published in 1956 , Eisenberg recognised patterns of language use as the best predictor of prognosis At the time , many patients who are now are diagnosed as having autism were thought to have mental retardation He followed that paper with a barrage of papers on attention deficit disorder , learning delays , and other childhood problems In a study of children otherwise developing normally , Eisenberg found that early reading difficulties increased the chances of later bad behaviour His most revolutionary study came in 1962 , when he launched the first randomised clinical drug trial in child psychiatry In subsequent drug trials he showed that tranquillising drugs were inferior to placebo in the treatment of anxiety disorders and that stimulant drugs could be effective in controlling hyperactivity Those studies were the first steps towards ever increasing use of drugs to treat child and adolescent disorders , a development that in recent years concerned Eisenberg Drug companiesDeMaso , who in the late 1970s became one of Eisenberg s many prot g s , said that Eisenberg thought that many psychiatrists were being influenced by drug companies , adding , He thought children are now being overdiagnosed with bipolar illness and then overmedicated Leon Eisenberg was born in Philadelphia on 8 August 1922 , the oldest child of Russian immigrants His father steered him from the beginning towards medical school But despite near straight As in college , he was turned down by several medical schools because of his Jewish background Finally , with help from a Pennsylvania state legislator who his father knew , he was admitted to the University of Pennsylvania School of Medicine After graduating in 1946 as valedictorian of his class , he took a rotating intern position at Mount Sinai Hospital in New York city , where he became interested in psychiatry He served two years as a captain in the US Army Medical Corps and in 1952 moved to Johns Hopkins , becoming chief of child psychiatry in 1961 He held the position until becoming chief of psychiatry in 1967 at Harvard , where his focus shifted to training new generations of researchers Although Eisenberg has been widely recognised for his childhood research , the Harvard psychiatrist and anthropologist Arthur Kleinman thinks that his contributions from the 1970s onward are as important Kleinman , a psychiatry resident in the 1970s under Eisenberg , said that he converted the department from a small group of mostly psychoanalysts to a diverse and vibrant national powerhouse that helped shape modern psychiatry He made that department , Kleinman says He set the intellectual tone to be highly academic In 1968 Eisenberg also became a leading proponent of affirmative action for African Americans and other minorities at Harvard Medical School , guided by his own experiences of discrimination as a Jew in the 1940s Social sciencesDuring the 1970s , Eisenberg advocated a closer relationship between medicine and the social sciences , which he thought would improve medical care by , as Kleinman put it , bringing biology together with the social world In 1980 Eisenberg became founding chairman of Harvard s department of social medicine , a position he held until 1991 Eisenberg was the ideal choice to guide the new department , said Kleinman , adding , He had an omnivorous hunger for knowledge that went across the fields Eisenberg was honoured with numerous awards , including the distinguished service award and special presidential commendation from the American Psychiatric Association He served from 1964 as mental health consultant to the World Health Organization in multiple capacities and was an honorary fellow of the UK Royal College of Psychiatrists On 1 July this year , the Leon Eisenberg chair in child psychiatry at the Children s Hospital Boston was officially launched , with DeMaso named as the first holder Decades after his groundbreaking studies , he still yearned to better understand the childhood mind I was eating lunch with him about a year ago , and he told me that more child psychiatry research was needed , said DeMaso He asked me , What are you doing about encouraging your psychiatrists to do more research \? They need to do more research We need more research And DeMaso dutifully followed the advice of his mentor We are going to do more research in child psychiatry , he says We are planning to focus on training the next generation of child psychiatry researchers Eisenberg leaves his wife , Carola , former dean of students at Harvard Medical School and a cofounder of Physicians for Human Rights , two children from a previous marriage , and two stepsons NotesCite this as BMJ 2009 339 b4615Footnotes",true
"Special to the NJJNFebruary 28 , 2008John Hudson is a man with a mission Seven years ago , the 54 year old social theorist embarked on a literary adventure , following a long nursed hunch about Shakespeare s true identity Hudson had spent most of his adult life grappling with complex questions that straddled the fields of social theory and cognitive science , creating high level strategic redesign for the energy , telecommunications , Internet , and public sectors Most of my work involved helping media companies rethink their industries , says Hudson Now I ve moved on to rethinking the Shakespearean industry With his life and plays comprising a billion dollar global industry , says Hudson , the Bard has managed to secure a sublime place in literary history as well as an omnipresence in pop culture and media But , like all industries , it rests on certain assumptions , says Hudson It is these very assumptions primarily about who the author of the plays really was that Hudson set about to reinvent Hudson had an uneasy feeling that there was more beneath the plays surface than was brought to light by scholars and historians His search began in earnest after he enrolled in a postgraduate program at the Shakespeare Institute at the University of Birmingham in Stratford upon Avon , naturally where he spent four years delving into the texts He gradually devised the latest approach to Shakespearean authorship , the Amelia Bassano Theory recently recognized by the Shakespearean Authorship Trust as one of the top eight authorship theories The figure of Amelia Bassano Lanyer had turned up before in Shakespearean scholarship In 1973 , celebrated historian A L Rowse identified her as the actual Dark Lady of Shakespeare s famed sonnets Bassano known as the first woman in England to have published a book of original poetry \( Salve Deus Rex Judaeorum , 1611 \) , which has been interpreted as an early feminist critique of the Christian Gospels was part of a family of Italian court musicians of Moroccan Semitic ancestry who lived as clandestine Jews Hudson explains that the unusual circumstances of Amelia s upbringing accounted for her extraordinary education and literary sensitivity By age seven , she was adopted by the Countess of Kent , who provided her with a well rounded education , including studies in Greek , Latin , and the Bible By 13 , she became mistress to Lord Henry Hunsdon , the man in charge of the English theater and patron of the Lord Chamberlain s Men the company that performed Shakespeare s works The plays certainly suggest that their author had access to scholarly training as well as exposure to certain specific environments all of which coincide with Amelia s biography The 2 , 000 musical references , for example , were her birthright the hundreds of references to plants , law , military life , and falconry could likely be the result of her involvement with Hunsdon Other subject matter in the plays echoes her childhood experiences But most important , Hudson discovered her key literary signatures in which Amelia left her name spread across various plays Her married name Lanier meaning falcon in French is spread across the two different versions of The Taming of the Shrew It is in the form of the central figure who is tamed like a falcon , together with her name Emila her father s name , Baptista , and her husband s name , Alphonso An Emillius and a Bassianus appear in Titus Andronicus as well But the most important signatures are those created after her husband s death , between 1622 23 , when her full maiden name Aemilia Johnson Willough \( by \) Bassanio was spread across three Shakespearean plays , associated in each case with the standard image of the Renaissance poet Such a circumstance had little chance of being a mere coincidence She so badly wanted us to notice them , says Hudson , but nobody ever did Something revolutionaryThe next step for Hudson was to bring his case to the theater going public The first play he selected as a vehicle for his theory was A Midsummer Night s Dream with its staging he intended to present the allegorical plot revealing the key subtextual layers indicative of Bassano s Jewish authorship The challenge was to find the right people to do the job and convince them that he was on to something revolutionary Hudson is British , married to an American , and the couple often shuttles between London and New York It was there , in the fall of 2006 , that he set out to put together a theater group that had both the dramatic training and mental muscle to actualize his theories After a few months , Hudson had on board Mahayana Landowne , a Yale Drama School educated director Next he enrolled in a Shakespeare Boot Camp workshop at the New Perspectives Theatre Company , where he befriended Jenny Greeman , an experienced actress and theater educator who was to become his assistant director I found his theory compelling , said Greeman , and the figure of Amelia Bassano is absolutely fascinating She is someone who needs to be spoken about much more I am thoroughly ready to believe that she could have written these plays Translating Hudson s esoteric theory into concepts and then into practice involved hours of improvisation between actors , directors , and dramaturge \( Hudson s official title \) I was happy to adopt a hands off management style when it came to staging the plays and leave it to those who truly understood the physicality of the theater , he said Yet , when it came to selecting actors for his new troupe , The Dark Lady Players , he made a point of meeting extensively with each actor to ensure that they were willing to think about the plays allegorically and took a proactive role at the dramatic workshops Lila Dupree , who played Theseus , feels that the DLP achieved a group dynamic unlike any she had experienced before It is definitely a struggle at times to condense things so that they will be visually clear and clean With something this high concept , you risk alienating the audience , so a lot of our process involves finding ways to break down that fourth wall , so to speak Dupree is one of about 15 actors in the troupe , representing an eclectic melting pot of theatrical backgrounds What they all share is Shakespearean training buttressed by a voracious appetite for intellectually rigorous work The DLP is now testing its version of As You Like It in workshops Also in the pipeline is Hudson s biography of Amelia Bassano , as well as a documentary film deal With all the exciting attention on the horizon , the troupe feels wholly committed to its mission of presenting new and thought provoking interpretations of Shakespeare s \( or Bassano s \) plays We ve learned a lot from our experience with Midsummer , says Dupree , and with As You Like It , we are ready to take it to the next level To order a DVD of the Dark Lady Players Midsummer Night s Dream , e mail Dark Lady Players Daniela Amini is a New York based freelance writer specializing in theater , opera , dance , and local news Comedy as revengeIn staging Midsummer Night s Dream , John Hudson s objective was , first and foremost , to reveal the play as a Jewish satire rife with pointed references to Christian idolatry In other words , comedy as revenge John Hudson carried out a literary adventure and brought it to the stage In his findings , each character is revealed to have a connection with a character in religious allegory , i e , a double in the Roman Christian world Stanford University professor Patricia Parker had already shown that Puck carries the name of two devils , that Bottom represents Jesus \( and , in the course of the play , undergoes a kind of Passion \) , and that Thisbe represents the Church Hudson completed the puzzle to show that Oberon is the figure of Yahweh \( God of the Jews \) , who is embroiled in the Jewish Roman war against Titus Caesar \( embodied by Titania \) over the abduction of the true Jewish Messiah \( the Iudean or Indian boy \) the flower , love in idleness \( a pun on idolatry \) , represents the Gospels and the end of the play is a Jewish apocalypse characterized by the distribution of dew as in the Zohar The Dark Lady Players debuted Midsummer Night s Dream in March 2007 at the Abingdon Theatre Arts Complex near Times Square The staging was never heavy handed and there were some uproariously funny moments , punctuated by scenes of violent carnage and deep , spiritual pathos The overall tone was of a promising marriage

Changes in interstellar distances are measurable The speed of light is constant and is measurable But what about Time itself , can changes to time be measured \? Or is that a paradox within itself \? How can we measure a potential change in Time itself if it is changing while we are trying to measure it \? For example , hypothetically speaking , if you are trying to measure how much a yard stick is decreasing in length against a second yard stick that is also decreasing in length at the same rate as the first one and if everything else around you \( including yourself \) was shrinking at the same rate than you would never confirm that such a change actually did occur So if we look at the relationship between space , time , and the speed of light if space is measurably expanding and the speed of light is still constant , can Time be speeding up \? No wonder they say , the older you get , the faster time goes by , if they only new Humanity continually strives to make its vehicles , technologies , and processes faster yet we never seem to have enough time or wish we had more time , doesn t that make you wonder More and more frequently people are suggesting that time is speeding up We hear people saying things like I never seem to have enough time to get everything done anymore or where has the time gone to The years are certainly flying by faster than ever and there is a scientific reason why time is speeding up There are also a number of reasons why we are changing so rapidly and it is all related to time speeding up Human beings are becoming more consciously aware and people are being drawn towards spirituality and personal development in greater numbers than ever before Why is this happening \? Scientists discovered many years ago that the earth gives off a pulse This pulse or frequency which has been likened to a heartbeat has been stable at approximately 7 8 cycles per second for thousands of years However , since around the year 1980 the earth s heartbeat began to speed up The most incredible thing is some scientists believe the earth will actually stop rotating when this pulse reaches 13 cycles per second When the earth stops rotating on its axis it is believed that it will remain still for around 3 days and then start spinning in the other direction This will cause a reversal in the magnetic field around the earth but what will happen after this point is unclear At this point you are thinking one of two things Either you are thinking this sounds pretty amazing or you simply cannot believe it I m kind of in the middle myself , I think it s hard to believe but I m prepared to keep an open mind Since I have become interested in spirituality I have seen wonderful things happen in my life and because of this I believe almost anything is possible It is due to this increasing pulse rate that we feel as though time is speeding up Why do we feel as though time is moving faster than it used to be \? The reason is what we once perceived to be a period of 24 hours now feels like only 16 hours Our clocks still move in seconds , minutes and hours and still click over a full day in 24 hours but due to the earths increased heartbeat , we perceive it to be only two thirds as long or a perception period of merely 16 hours As far fetched as all this may seem , a number of reports suggest that we will reach this critical mass or zero point when the earth stops rotating , very soon From my research into this phenomena and the changes I can see happening in my body and mind as well as what I see happening around the globe , I believe as do many others that we are now moving into the 4th dimension The fourth dimension is where our thoughts will manifest almost instantly This period of life on earth is where our good and bad karma will come back to us almost immediately This is why so many people , although perhaps unaware as to why , are becoming consciously aware and turning towards spirituality and away from materialism and greed We are feeling the urge to not only do the right thing for our own body and mind but we are more willing to help others than ever before in history The growth rate in awareness is off the charts What once took years of reading , learning and watching to become more spiritually aware may now only take a year or even months There is so much more information than ever before on spirituality available in books and on the internet that is serving to accelerate our learning and helping us move away from the darkness of fear and towards the light of love As we feel the need to change our direction in life and release our bad habits we are starting to meet others who feel the same way and collectively we are helping each other We are realizing that we are part of something greater than our individual self and this further accelerates our spiritual evolution We are leaving the Age of Pisces , a destructive and oppressive period and moving into the Age of Aquarius , a period of love and peace This is a difficult time for many people as they struggle to come to terms with what is happening around them and what is happening to their mind and feelings The key is to let go and trust in this natural process of change and not to fight your feelings As we move closer to the fifth dimension and as time speeds to an all time high , our thoughts , feelings and intentions will manifest into our reality in the twinkling of an eye What this means effectively is that those of us living with thoughts of fear and trepidation , will manifest just that into their lives causing untold pain However , those of us feeling happy and positive will manifest only love and joy into their lives It s all about choice , and it s your choice to make , nobody can make it for you As we continue through this exciting period of history the entire world will change along with everyone in it Eventually we will be forced to release our fears , there is no other way Fear will cease to exist and the greatest causes of fear , being time and money , will no longer be a part of our existence This is an exciting period to be alive so I m going to go with the flow and enjoy the ride , I hope you ll join me source universeofsuccess com why is time speeding up html Gregg Braden on the Photon Belt and Schumann Resonance Gregg Braden is currently traveling around the United States and in the media , telling of the scientific proof of the Earth passing through the Photon Belt and the slowing of the Earths rotation At the same time there is an increase in the resonant frequency of the Earth \( Schumann Resonance \) When the Earth stops its rotation and the resonance frequency reaches 13 cycles we will beat a zero point magnetic field The Earth will be stopped , and in 2 or 3 days it will start turning again in the opposite direction This will produce a reversal in the magnetic fields around the earth and so forth Geophysical Condition 1 Earth s Rising Base Frequency Earth s background base frequency , or heartbeat , \( called Schumann resonance , or SR \) is rising dramatically Though it varies among geographical regions , for decades the overall measurement was 7 8 cycles per second This was once thought to be a constant global military communications developed on this frequency Gregg Braden found data collected by Norwegian and Russian researchers on this it s not widely reported in the US \( The only reference to SR to be found in the Seattle Library reference section , is tied to the weather , and Science acknowledges SR as a sensitive indicator of temperature variations and worldwide weather conditions , Braden also believes the fluctuating SR may be a factor in the severe storms , floods , and weather of recent years \) Geophysical Condition 2 Earth s Diminishing Magnetic Field While earth s pulse rate is rising , her magnetic field strength , on the other hand , is declining According to Professor Bannerjee of the University of New Mexico , the field has lost up to half its intensity in the last 4 , 000 years And because a forerunner of magnetic polar reversals is this field strength , Prof Bannerjee believes that another reversal is due Braden believes that because these cyclical Shifts are associated with reversals , Earth s geological record indicating magnetic reversals also marks previous Shifts in history And , within the enormous time scale represented , there were quite a few of them Possible Outcomes 1 Time will appear to speed up as we approach Zero Point A 24 hour day will seem to about 16 hours or less Remember the Schumann Resonance \( or heart beat of Mother Earth \) has been 7 8 cycles for thousands of years , but has been rising since 1980 It stops at 13 cycles 2 Zero Point or the Shift of the Ages has been predicted by ancient peoples for thousands of years There have been many shifts including the one that always occurs every 13 , 000 years at each half of the 26 , 000 years , Procession of the Equinox 3 Zero Point or a flip of the magnetic poles will probably happen soon , within the next few years 4 It is said that after Zero Point the Sun will rise in the west and set in the east , approx Past occurrences of this change have been found in ancient records 5 The Zero Point flip will probably introduce us to the 4th dimension Here , everything we think or desire will instantly manifest This includes love and fear Our INTENTION will be of utmost importance 6 Most technology that we know will cease to operate Possible exceptions could be technology based on so called Zero Point or free energy 7 Our physical body is changing as we approach Zero Point Our DNA is being upgraded to 12 strands A new light body is being created We are becoming more intuitive source universeofsuccess com why is time speeding up html In5D Addendum Gregg Prescott , M S Editor , In5D com I have been tracking the daily Schumann Resonance on In5D

"Updated 3 02 02 Please view updates at the bottom of the page Addressing the Dell Issue 2 26 02 This is the letter I posted in a few Firearms Forums and sent via e mail This is a true account of my dealings with Dell over the past few weeks I am writing this because I feel every Firearms owner should know this story I placed an order for a Dell notebook computer on February 13 on line with Dell I was given a tentative delivery date of February 21st I was watching the order through the Dell on line tracking system I also opted for the automatic email notification of when the machine was to be shipped Well the 21st came and went , I am a Pistolsmith I know things can happen I made a phone call on the 25th , did a voice mail message for my salesman to get back to me and I was looking for the delivery date The 25th came and went with no callback On the 26th I placed another call this time to cancel the order After a few hours I got a call back , with this amazing reason for the delay It seems someone in Dell had already canceled my order , when I asked why I was told Dell was afraid I was going to use the machine for illegal purposes When I asked why someone would think that I was told it was because of the name of my business Weigand Combat Handguns Inc Because I am involved in firearms I might be doing something illegal Now keep in mind I was never called or informed of this decision the order was just canceled Many of you know me personally and know I run my business about as squeaky clean as possible In addition being the President of the American Pistolsmiths Guild I am under additional scrutiny as to how I run my business , if I am not clean how can I be the President of an organization that promotes just that ! I was informed by a Dell supervisor not long after all of this the reason I was refused was because of their post September 11th policy of screening buyers I would like to respectfully ask the firearms community to do the following If you intended to buy a Dell and because of this letter you do not , email Dell and let them know why Feel free to distribute this account to all you know in the Firearms community , I think they need to know I for one am sick and tired of people assuming just because we are involved with firearms that we are doing something illegal I also do not believe Dell deserves our business if this is how they intend to treat us God Bless Jack Weigand President American Pistolsmiths Guild Inc The above is the only letter I have written I have written comments on email I have received \( that number is now in the hundreds \) I would like to add the following I have spoken to Dell today 2 26 02 They informed me that the reason my order was cancelled was due to the new post 9 11 screening policy The word Combat in my company name is what triggered the cancellation of my order The cancellation was triggered automatically When I asked why I was not called to clear this up I was told there was a breakdown in communications on Dells part Just for the record so everyone knows where I stand I have no intention of further dealings with Dell , they do n't deserve my business I want nothing from Dell but I would gladly accept an apology to the Firearms community in general I posted this expressly to warn firearms owners of Dell policies PERIOD There are those that think I did this to generate traffic to my web site All this traffic just made it hard for my customers to shop this evening If you will notice there are no advertisements on my web so traffic is not a factor It has also generated hundreds of email that I personally answered Just so you all know I am not smart enough to do a publicity stunt of this magnitude on purpose , LOL ! I would humbly request the following Please , please refrain from making personal attacks on Michael Dell I have received hundreds of e mails attacking Mr Dell , please do not do this I know we are all passionate about our right to keep and bear arms but please be as professional as possible I thank all of those that took the time to confirm that this story was true before spreading it , you all are to be commended ! Update 2 27 02 After fielding hundreds of emails and dozens of phone calls today my heart felt thanks to all who responded I was contacted by a Dell representative this morning a Mr John Hood John made the following remarks He extended Dells sincerest apologies for the incident He said Dell would review and possibly change the screening policies to prevent this from happening again Dell offered to ship the machine I ordered to me at no charge , I respectfully declined the offer John told me he would have a statement sent to me sometime Thursday morning the 28th stating Dells position on this issue for me to post here for all to see I will post the statement as soon as I receive it 2 28 02 Update Statement from Dell To Our Valued Customers and Friends U S export laws restrict the sale of technology to terrorists and to people in countries that support terrorism These laws also prohibit computer sales to people who will use the technology in developing biological or nuclear weapons Dell strictly complies with our country 's export laws in order to ensure the safety of our customers and citizens around the world When there is reasonable cause for concern , we carefully review customer orders for prohibited destinations and activities When additional follow up on an order is required , our sales representatives ask our customers four basic questions 1 Who is the end user \? 2 Where will the product be used \? 3 What will the product be used for \? 4 What type of business or industry is involved \? The answers to these questions , like all customer information we gather , are confidential and are not shared outside of Dell We recently received an order from Mr Jack Weigand , whose company name , Weigand 's Combat Handguns Inc included the word combat We cancelled the order to give us enough time to follow up with the customer and be assured that the sale would be in compliance with U S export law However , we failed to contact Mr Weigand , and as a result , we did not deliver the order as promised , and the customer did not know why Once we discovered our error , we apologized to Mr Weigand for this misunderstanding , as well as the inconvenience caused by the delay This is not the service standard that we hold ourselves to at Dell We at Dell feel a strong obligation to uphold our federal law , but we have just as strong an obligation to be responsive to the needs of all our customers We want to assure you that the company does not discriminate against any business , regardless of the products or services they sell , nor do we discriminate against individual consumers We do , however , sometimes make mistakes as we did in this case Thank you for your support Sincerely , Dell Computer Corporation This is the link that has been circulating http www progressivefunds com hci I felt it was my obligation to post the following The following is a portion of a Dell statement that addresses the above link This was added 3 02 02 We appreciate the opportunity to clarify the facts regarding a customer issue reported in the media and Dell 's position on political or social issues that many of you care deeply about Regarding Handgun Rights Handgun Control Dell is a publicly traded , customer focused company with customers , shareholders and employees on both sides of many public , social and political issues Our place is to serve our customers rather than to endorse or support one position over another in public debates outside the scope of our industry We do not discriminate against any business , regardless of the products or services they sell , nor do we discriminate against individual customers We do , however , respect the right of any organization or individual to have their own point of view We follow all laws , rules and regulations Regarding allegations that Dell supports Handgun Control organizations through the Dell Affiliates program Dell as a company remains neutral on handgun rights and handgun control Dell customers can support causes and organizations , if they choose , through Dell 's affiliates program and charitable websites such as igive com and progressivefunds com These sites feature links to Dell 's website Dell 's affiliates program provides a way for customers to support the cause or organization of their choice through their Dell purchases Affiliate participants , such as igive com and progressivefunds com , include organizations and causes on different sides of nearly every social issue Some of the organizations participating through Dell affiliates such as igive com and progressivefunds com , promote handgun rights , others promote handgun control Handgun Control Inc \( HCI \) has been reported as one organization that participates in this program Others including The Gun Owners Foundation and the Michigan Coalition for Responsible Gun Owners Foundation , Inc also participate through Dell affiliate igive com The only organizations prohibited from participating in Dell 's affiliates program are those that promote sexually explicit material promote violence promote discrimination based on race , sex , religion , nationality , disability , sexual orientation or age or promote illegal activities 3 01 02 Update The free computer offer from Dell is a hot topic in much of the email I have received to date I have since purchased a notebook computer elsewhere so I hope that issue is settled Again I thank everyone for your thoughts and comments I will say I do n't agree with some of the letters but we are Americans , we have the right to free speech Please keep in mind when reading postings on my site I have no public relations department to draft and polish my postings I think long and hard about what needs to be said and I post it Please forgive me for being a little crude in my writing , keep in mind I am a Pistolsmith not a writer I am doing my best to keep up with the email , over 1000 to date I read every email I receive and respond to 99 of it 3 02 02 Update Please go to the following link at the NRA ILA web site http www nraila org ActionAlerts asp \?

"St Rita School On Friday night , the United States Senate passed their version of the Tax Cuts and Jobs Act , better known as tax reform Only one additive floor amendment made it into the bill Senator Ted Cruz \( R Texas \) offered an amendment to make 529 education savings accounts even more useful than today 529 accounts up until now have been used exclusively for college tuition and expenses The Cruz amendment expands the use of 529 dollars for two additional purposes tuition for students in K 12 private and parochial schools , and costs related to homeschooling a child Up to 10 , 000 per year per child can be distributed for these purposes In a dramatic turn , the Cruz amendment was stuck at 50 50 , requiring Vice President Mike Pence to hurry to the chamber and break the tie 529 plans can be thought of as the rough equivalent of Roth IRAs for education money goes in after tax , but then grows tax free Distributions are tax exempt if used for qualified education expenses If you participate in your home state 's 529 plan \( these accounts are mostly run by state agencies \) , you may be eligible for a state tax deduction If the Cruz amendment makes its way into the final bill \( and there is nearly identical language in the House version , so there is a good shot of this \) , the game will have changed on school choice Parents can start saving right away for private or parochial school , or for homeschooling expenses , in a 529 plan when a child is born That money can grow tax free for years to pay for things like Montessori school , Catholic high school , or home schooling networks With a tax deductible component in most states , parents will get an immediate tax benefit , and then further tax relief in the form of tax free growth YOU MAY ALSO LIKE Consider the case of a parent who saves 4000 per year in a 529 for a child 's education in my home state of Virginia He also deposits the 230 of annual tax savings he gets from Virginia into the account as a supplemental contribution Our taxpayer sends his child to a Catholic school which charges 6500 per year in tuition , and then a Catholic high school which charges 10 , 000 per year in tuition Throughout the course of the child 's pre college educational life , our taxpayer has saved 76 , 000 in original contributions to the 529 but had enough money in the account to spend just under 100 , 000 on tuition , assuming a 5 percent annual investment growth rate Nearly 25 , 000 was therefore totally free , totally tax exempt education funding His 529 subsidized one quarter of his daughter 's tuition bill , a bill he would have paid entirely with after tax dollars without the Cruz amendment 529 Annual Savings Out of Pocket 76 , 000 Reinvested Annual State Tax Benefit 4370 Growth in the Account \( 5 avg \) 19 , 630 Total 529 Assets 100 , 000 The best sign this is smart policy is that the Left is going completely apoplectic They hate the idea that parents can free themselves from the big teachers' unions , and have vowed to kill not only the Cruz amendment , but 529s in general Longtime readers might recall the Left made a run at that several years ago , and failed spectacularly Senator Ted Cruz deserves a lot of credit for taking this on Thanks to him , it will become a lot easier for parents and their kids to have more options when it comes to education",true
"Most readers will be familiar with Hitler s infamous quote , regularly presented to reinforce the notion that fascists must be physically smashed when they re still small Only one thing could have stopped our movement if our adversaries had understood its principle and from the first day smashed with the utmost brutality the nucleus of our new movement The first time I heard these words was in Bash the Fash , a 1994 song by the anarcho punk band Oi Polloi I have since been confronted with it countless times at political talks , in anti fascist pamphlets , and so on My reply is the same every time Hitler was a crafty politician but no great historian The fact that the quote only ever appeared in anti fascist agitprop and an exact source was never produced made me wonder Some websites claimed that Hitler wrote these words in 1934 , but they did not specify where Others attributed them to a speech given at the August 1939 party rally in Nuremberg , yet no available documents of that event \( which was dedicated to revving up the armed forces for the imminent war \) contained it For some time , the earliest source I could find was David Edgar s 1976 play about the National Front , Destiny At the end of the play , a voice meant to be Hitler s is heard delivering it in English language After a pause , the voice states Hitler , Nuremberg , third of September 1933 Finally , I found a scan of Die Reden Hitlers am Reichsparteitag 1933 , a 1934 book that contained complete transcripts of all speeches given by Hitler at Nuremberg in the previous year It turned out that he had employed a variation of the infamous phrase Find below my translation and marvel at the F hrer s social Darwinist wisdom And so , in 1919 I established a programme and tendency that were a conscious slap in the face of the democratic pacifist world \( \) We knew it might take five , ten or twenty years , yet gradually an authoritarian state emerged within the democratic state , and a nucleus of fanatical devotion and ruthless determination formed in a wretched world that lacked basic convictions Only one danger could have jeopardised this development if our adversaries had understood its principle , established a clear understanding of these ideas , and not offered any resistance Or , alternatively , if they had from the first day annihilated with the utmost brutality the nucleus of our new movement Neither was done The times were such that our adversaries were no longer capable of accomplishing our annihilation , nor did they have the nerve Arguably , they also lacked the understanding to assume an entirely appropriate stance Instead , they began to tyrannise our young movement by bourgeois means , and , by doing so , they assisted the process of natural selection in a very fortunate manner From there on , it was only a question of time until the leadership of the nation would fall to our hardened human material \( \) The more our adversaries believe they can obstruct our development by employing a degree of terror that is typical of their nature , the more they encourage it Nietzsche said that a blow which does not kill a strong man only makes him stronger , and his words have been confirmed a thousand times Every blow strengthens our defiance , all persecution reinforces our single minded determination , and the elements that do fall are good riddance to the movement I m not aware what source David Edgar used for his play \( and my attempt to contact him elicited no response \) , but it s interesting that his variation did not contain the first part of Hitler s statement i e the notion that the Nazi movement would have remained marginal had it been ignored by its opponents I say interesting because that was the tactic employed , for instance , by Austrian Social Democracy in the face of early fascist assemblies and disturbances in 1919 Evidently , it did not work Physical force anti fascists , on the other hand , like Hitler s second point for obvious reasons However , the two have to be read together and in context Hitler s advice reflects his conviction that battle inspires the fittest warriors to great deeds , that the weak naturally fall by the wayside , and that the thugs always emerge on top It doesn t offer any profound strategical or historical insight The original quote found on countless German leftist websites seems to be a translation of David Edgar s version into German It even contains the verb stoppen an anglicism that Hitler would have scarcely used in a formal speech In any case , I would argue that anti fascists should base their tactics on a concrete assessment of the situation at hand Naturally , these may involve physical force but sometimes , completely different tactics may be necessary What anti fascists should not do is peddle a dogma based on a bowdlerised Hitler quote Ultimately , though , fascism needs to be countered politically i e by fighting for a positive alternative to the capitalist societies that are its breeding ground Only the demise of the global system of competing nation states will eliminate their kind for good Hitler s was not the only radical v lkisch movement in Germany at the time Even anti fascists had succeeded in smashing the nucleus of the NSDAP , they would have still faced a massive cesspit that had formed in the ruins of a failed revolution the Stahlhelm , the Deutschv lkischer Schutz und Trutzbund , the Thule Society , the Deutschnationale , the Freikorps units , and many more For all his self assurance , the F hrer was unaware of how lucky he was to emerge as the main contender Maciej Zurowski",true

"b'Mississippi Republicans are taking a shoot first , ask questions later approach to preventing potential church violence with a bill that amounts to legalizing religious security squads tasked with killing perceived threats This week , the states Republican led senate passed the so called Mississippi Church Protection Act which would militarize the states churches while also walking back gun regulations and stripping away oversight The bill would allow churches to create security programs and designate and train members to carry concealed weapons It would provide criminal and legal protections to those serving as church security The bill also would allow concealed carry in a holster without a permit in Mississippi , expanding a measure passed last year that allowed concealed carry without a permit in a purse , satchel or briefcase , and another recent law that allows open carry in public The bill also seeks to prohibit Mississippi officials from enforcing any federal agency regulations or executive orders that would violate the state constitution an attempt to federal gun restrictions not passed by Congress Mississippi church goers will now get to assign church members as security which can carry concealed weapons without permits and are protected from legal liability if their actions result in death based on a designation of justifiable homicide the same legal standing that we afford police officers on duty pourmecoffee It passed pic twitter com H8WvOdHFA4 pourmecoffee \( pourmecoffee \) March 30 , 2016What could go wrong \?

"The Trump Administration The 45th President and His Administration Trump , Inc Exploring the Business of Trump Subscribe to Trump , Inc here or wherever you get your podcasts President Donald Trump loves putting his name on everything from ties to steaks to water and , of course , his buildings But now the Trump Organization appears to be borrowing a brand even more powerful than the gilded Trump moniker the presidential seal In recent weeks , the Trump Organization has ordered the manufacture of new tee markers for golf courses that are emblazoned with the seal of the president of the United States Under federal law , the seal s use is permitted only for official government business Misuse can be a crime Past administrations have policed usage vigilantly In 2005 the Bush administration ordered the satirical news website The Onion to remove a replica of the seal Grant M Dixton , associate White House counsel , wrote in a letter to The Onion that the seal is not to be used in connection with commercial ventures or products in any way that suggests presidential support or endorsement Listen to the Podcast After listening to the new ProPublica WNYC podcast Trump , Inc , a listener brought the signs to our attention Eagle Sign and Design , a metalworking and sign company with offices in New Albany , Indiana , and Louisville , Kentucky , said it had received an order to manufacture dozens of round , 12 inch replicas of the presidential seal to be placed next to the tee boxes at Trump golf course holes Two tee markers are placed on the ground at the start of a hole on golf courses to indicate where golfers should stand to take their first swing We made the design , and the client confirmed the design , said Joseph E Bates , who owns Eagle Sign , declining to say who the client was A table of presidential seal tee markers at Eagle Sign This photo was provided to ProPublica by a source An order form for the tee markers reviewed by ProPublica and WNYC says the customer was Trump International The Facebook page for Eagle Sign and Design shows a photo of the markers in an album with the caption Trump International Golf Course It is unclear how many Trump International golf courses will feature the markers The Trump Organization owns four courses with the International name in the U S and abroad , with a fifth course in Bali , Indonesia , in the works Eagle Sign makes a wide array of tee markers out of bronze and aluminum , and has made other signs for Trump s courses , according to its website At some of Trump s golf courses , tee markers have sported the Trump family crest , which he took from the family that originally owned Mar a Lago without permission and then altered by adding his own name Ethics experts have long been on the lookout for signs that the Trump Organization would exploit the office of the presidency for commercial gain Several said that using the presidential seal on the company s golf courses would fall into this category A law governs the manufacture or use of the seal , its likeness , or any facsimile thereof for anything other than official U S government business It can be a criminal offense punishable by up to six months in prison Get More Trump , Inc Stay up to date with email updates from WNYC and ProPublica about their ongoing investigations The law is an expression of the idea that the government and government authority should not be used for private purpose , said Kathleen Clark , a law professor at Washington University specializing in government and legal ethics said It would be a misuse of government authority The Department of Justice declined to comment on whether it was aware the seal had been used by entities outside the government The White House and the Trump Organization did not respond to request for comment The presidential seal was first sketched out by President Millard Fillmore in 1850 and the current design which shows a bald eagle with an olive branch in its right talon , a bundle of 13 arrows in the left , and a scroll bearing the words E pluribus unum in its beak was chosen by President Truman and made official in a 1945 executive order The seal that adorns the president s speaking lecterns is handmade by the Institute of Heraldry , a department of the Army located at Fort Belvoir in Virginia that designs and provides guidance related to military and governmental symbols Versions of the seal have occasionally been put to personal use by past presidents George W Bush and Barack Obama had custom sets of golf balls made with the seal Ronald and Nancy Reagan had a set of presidential china bearing the seal , and there have even been M M s and jelly beans that featured the seal In this case , the difference is that a private company is using the seal , said Richard Painter , vice chairman of Citizens for Responsibility and Ethics in Washington , a government accountability group Painter also served as an associate White House counsel during the George W Bush administration If we had heard of a private company using it for commercial purposes , we would have sent them a nasty letter , he said Trump , Inc is a

"LORD RUSSIAN NAZIMexican Mob Nearly Lynches Russian Nazi in CancunAvowed Nazi sympathizer Aleksei Makeev made himself a nuisance online in Mexico People who have no faith in police responded with mob justice 05 21 17 11 00 AM ETPhoto Illustration by Elizabeth Brockway The Daily BeastMEXICO CITY Kill him ! Kill him ! Kill him , chanted a mob of roughly 100 angry Mexicans in Cancun , the popular tourist destination on the coast of Quintana Roo , Mexico I m going to decapitate you , one man shouted at Aleksei Viktorovich Makeev , as the bloodied 42 year old Russian resident of Mexico fled the interior of his home for a nearby rooftop while the mob pelted him with large rocks and jeered When Makeev finally collapsed on the rooftop , covered in his own blood and that of an unarmed teenager whom he stabbed moments before , after the teen attempted to enter the Russian s apartment the townspeople finally let him be , as reporters livestreaming from the scene claimed that Makeev had died In fact , after being beaten with sticks and stoned nearly to death , the half naked Russian was transported to a local hospital and treated for his injuries The townspeople had fractured his skull Makeev is now reportedly in stable condition , but remains in a drug induced coma , paralyzed and likely brain damaged , said Dmitry Bolbot , Mexico City s Russian consul But the 19 year old youth whose last name has not yet been disclosed , Lalo a nickname for Eduardo bled out on the pavement as paramedics attempted to save his life He was pronounced dead soon after Makeev stabbed him repeatedly in the stomach with a kitchen knife as he fled the home The horrific stabbing was also caught on tape The Russian has just stabbed this person He s losing a lot of blood , someone said in one of many livestreams of the hours long encounter , as thousands of social media users watched from their phones and computers , leaving comments like Cut off the Russian s head ! Toss him in a ditch , and Finish him off ! Get it over with ! The mob descended on his home after local media reports began circulating on Friday about Makeev , who had spent the previous months uploading videos of himself on his personal YouTube channels surrounded by swastikas In the videos , one can see that he had made a hobby of disparaging the people of Mexico , speaking with particular loathing about indigenous women and infants He was dubbed LordNaziRuso on social media Lord Russian Nazi and outrage quickly grew Just past noon on Friday , Makeev posted on Facebook that he was feeling adventurous , along with the comment that Terrorists are trying to kill me ! Hours later , he posted a crude drawing that read lick my dick Mexican piece of shit as he laughed at the angry crowd that had begun to phone him and cover his Facebook wall with angry comments By dusk , as the mob formed outside the tiny one room apartment in Cancun from which he often posted videos at his untidy desk next to cans of peas and other food lining the windowsill a local reporter with a drone began to film the lead up to the lynching attempt , as Makeev sat at his desk and continued to poke the bear and mock the people online From that desk seated next to a family size bottle of ketchup and more pictures of swastikas and promotional material for his unpopular YouTube channels the Russian had repeatedly posted videos complaining about both the Mexican people and their police in a mix of Russian and the occasional insult in English or Spanish Though he made himself completely unwelcome in Mexico , Makeev who is originally from the small town of Elektrostal , on the outskirts of Moscow had also previously made a name for himself in Russia where he was apparently put under review by the Ministry of Internal Affairs in 2013 , after footage posted online showed him shoving an elderly woman and child He was reportedly interned in a Russian psychiatric facility for his erratic behavior as a result If the government doesn t want to do anything , if our authorities can t , we re going to get together and do this right , said one man in a livestream Friday night , just before the lynching attempt began , inviting the people of Cancun to come down to the man s home and get him We aren t going to lynch him , because that sounds bad , but we are going to teach him a lesson Cancun deserves respect , the man said , adding , It s the most beautiful place you could ever imagine The bizarre videos Makeev became known for show his fanatical obsession with Madonna and knives , and that he far too often sat at the local McDonald 's in Cancun , invasively filming humble Mexican diners zooming in on the faces of what he called their bastard children , and referring to the people as monkeys and pieces of shit In one video , filmed from a local rooftop , he stood shirtless next to a swastika and wearing a clown nose referred to McDonald Trump Many of his Facebook posts , in fact , relate to the various controversies involving the U S President s alleged ties to Russia He had been getting on people s nerves for a while , but had made at least a few friends locally Just two weeks ago , he uploaded a video of himself interviewing an American man who called himself Roy , who claimed to have been beaten by the local police , after picking up some cash from a local Western Union He said the cops took his 200 , stranding him in Mexico without a passport When I woke up , I m on my hands and knees And when I got up , I seen my teeth , so I picked em up and put em in my pocket , and the muth uh , they had gone They left So , I was left with nothing , and I was left with this , said a toothless Roy , pointing to a blackened right eye So I advise anyone coming here , be careful The police are very corrupt It was a common theme in his videos When not complaining about Mexicans , he complained about their cops Last December , he was locked up for a month in an immigration center in Quintana Roo and declared persona non grata after repeatedly threatening the local Maya people He complained in videos that he had not been given water , and had been treated poorly in detention In a statement , the National Migration Institute said that Makeev s definitive exit from the country was ordered on January 19 of this year But Makeev , who was previously employed as a scuba instructor at AquaWorld Cancun , remained in the country regardless When contacted on Saturday , the watersports company was unable to offer any comment , but said in a statement that he stopped working with them in November 2015 , after they noticed that his behavior had begun to turn aggressive A statement reportedly from the Russian Embassy did not condone his actions in Mexico , but added that they categorically reproach the manner in which Mexican citizens did not attempt to denounce his actions but instead took matters into their own hands , asking Mexican authorities to help clarify these unfortunate events But citizens and residents had reported his behavior to immigration authorities in recent months , even after his recent detention One local radio disc jockey , 55 year old Fabricio Rechy , provided The Daily Beast with screenshots of a conversation he had with immigration authorities this past February , in which he sends authorities the worrisome videos he had come across , requesting that the Russian be removed for posing a danger to the local people During his conversation , the immigration employee at first implied that the videos were filmed in Russia , but the radio host pointed out that they were filmed inside the local McDonald s He even made it easy for them , providing screenshots of the man s immigration documents They thanked me for the information and said they would investigate , Rechy said in a telephone interview on Saturday But I doubt they gave it any importance I stumbled on the videos , and saw the way he was threatening people , calling them shit , saying he was going to kill Mexicans , cut off their heads , and I thought he was a dangerous person , so I felt the need to report it It s my duty as a citizen , he said There are videos that show him giving babies the middle finger , throwing coins at an old woman in a grocery store , hitting another elderly lady inside a bank , and stepping on children s lunch on the beach As for the incident that ended one young man s life on Friday night , Rechy said , It never should have happened The police arrived at night , but left saying they couldn t do anything because the man was locked inside his home , he said Later that night , about half an hour after the lynching started , when the riotous fighting was well under way , the police finally returned with backup But by then the situation had become unmanageable As paramedics transported Makeev s unconscious bloody body to the hospital late Friday night , smiling families cheered and screamed insults at him at times chanting , Mexico ! Mexico ! Mexico ! The National Immigration Institute said in a statement that it would seek his repatriation back to Russia as soon as his legal situation in Mexico is determined But , Rechy noted , None of this would have happened if they had just taken notice when I asked them to That boy would still be alive , he said Unfortunately , this is a national problem in Mexico the lack of authority , and the authorities inaction I hate to say it , but we are used to corruption here in Mexico There just isn t any trust , he said People prefer to take justice into their own hands than deal with authorities That s how this works The Daily Beast s Moscow based correspondent Anna Nemtsova contributed to this report READ THIS LIST",false

"SIGN UP FOR THE BREITBART EMAIL NEWSLETTERSIGN ME UPStarbucks Holds Hiring Event for Refugees in San Diego , TB Rates Among Highest in CountryAPby Michael Patrick Leahy 8 Aug 2017 47268 Aug , 20178 Aug , 2017Starbucks held a hiring event exclusively for refugees in El Cajon , California on Tuesday , part of its recently announced commitment to hire more than 10 , 000 refugees over the next five years El Cajon is located in San Diego County , where more than 20 , 000 refugees have have been resettled by the federal government in the past nine and a half years since the beginning of Fiscal Year 2008 A 2013 study from a research team led by Dr Timothy Rodwell , an associate professor and physician in the Division of Global Health at UCSD University of California at San Diego that analyzed data from LTBI latent tuberculosis infection screening results of 4 , 280 refugees resettled in San Diego County between January 2010 and October 2012 , noted that San Diego County , in California , is a leading refugee resettlement site , and it also has one of the highest rates of active TB in the country , with an incidence rate of 8 4 cases per 100 000 people in 2011 \( The incidence rate in the entire population in the United States in 2016 was 2 9 per 100 , 000 \) The study , which was funded in part by the National Institutes of Health , found that , of the 4 , 280 refugees resettled in San Diego County during the 34 months beginning in January 2010 Nine hundred sixteen refugees \( 21 4 \) in the study had a positive QFT GIT result \( Table 1 \) Of those , 823 \( 89 8 \) had a normal chest radiograph and were diagnosed with LTBI \( Figure 1 \) Sixty one \( 6 7 \) did not receive a chest radiograph 14 \( 1 5 \) had an abnormal result that was consistent with active TB and 18 \( 2 0 \) had an abnormal result that was not consistent with active TB In other words , the incidence of active TB among the 4 , 280 refugees who were resettled in San Diego County between January 2010 and October 2012 was 327 per 100 , 000 , more than 100 times greater than the incidence of active TB among the entire population of the United States in 2016 About four percent of the entire population of the United States tests positive for latent TB infection Around 10 percent of those with LTBI will develop active TB at some point in their lives The triggering mechanism to activate latent TB is not entirely understood , but high levels of stress , crowded living situations , poor public health practices , the presence of other diseases that lower the immune system , and behavioral conduct such as smoking appear to increase the chances of activation The 21 4 percent of refugees in the San Diego County study who tested positive for latent TB infection is about five times the national average Breitbart News contacted Starbucks to learn if their refugee hiring process will include mandatory testing for latent and active TB , but has not received a response The Starbucks refugee hiring event will be held at the San Diego offices of the International Rescue Committee , one of the top nine voluntary agencies \( VOLAGS \) that are paid over 1 billion each year to resettle refugees in the United States KGTV reported About 30 Starbucks managers will conduct on the spot interviews at the International Rescue Committee s office located at 131 E Main Street in El Cajon from 11 a m to 1 30 p m on Tuesday , Aug 8 Applicants are encouraged to visit Starbucks online career center prior to the event and bring resumes along with them The store managers will talk to the refugee applicants about what it s like to work for Starbucks and review qualifications for the barista position The world s largest coffee chain said it would focus initial efforts on markets where refugee need is greatest and there s a store base to meet the need According to state and federal data , San Diego fits the bill No other California county has received more refugees during the past decade than San Diego county In 2016 , San Diego settled 3 , 100 refugees , along with 520 military interpreters on special immigrant visas California , like most states , requires TB testing for health care workers Employees of restaurants are not required by California law to be tested for TB prior to hiring Read More Stories About P S DO YOU WANT MORE ARTICLESLIKE THIS ONE DELIVERED RIGHT TO YOUR INBOX \?

"Steelworkers , machinists upset with Harley Davidson about plans for Thailand plant Harley Davidson Inc s plans to operate a motorcycle assembly plant in Thailand are drawing strong criticism from labor unions , although Harley says the plant won t result in any U S job losses The Thailand plant is scheduled to open in late 2018 , Harley said Tuesday , and it will assemble bikes from components produced at the company s U S facilities Milwaukee based Harley has similar operations in India and Brazil , where complete motorcycles are assembled from kits In India , where big touring motorcycles and cars are saddled with a 100 import tariff , Harley 's sales have grown by a brisk 30 in the past two years That 's largely because the company has been able to get around the tariff by assembling bikes there , something it 's done in that country since 2011 RELATED Trump says 100 tariffs hurt Harley Davidson sales in other countries RELATED Harley Davidson 's quarterly sales , profit decline The Thailand tariff on motorcycles assembled in the United States is about 60 , according to Harley By opening this plant , we expect our regional \( Asian \) operations to help reduce those costs , said Harley spokeswoman Katie Whitmore There is no intent to reduce Harley Davidson U S manufacturing due to this expansion , Whitmore said We anticipate an increase in the number of additional U S manufactured components that will be shipped to the Thailand facility , she added Asia is one of Harley s fastest growing markets But the Thailand plant , and others like it , worry the United Steelworkers Harley Davidson has been the crown jewel of American manufacturing Management s decision to offshore production is a slap in the face to the American worker and to hundreds of thousands of Harley riders across the country , Steelworkers President Leo Gerard said in a statement Harley Davidson has said it intends to grow its international business 50 by 2027 , and that international sales are pivotal to the company s future But the Steelworkers , which represents employees at the Harley engine operations in Menomonee Falls , says the company should abandon offshoring plans and , instead , expand operations in the U S Offshoring production is the wrong path to prosperity It puts in jeopardy the success that has propelled Harley over the years , Gerard said A similar statement came Tuesday from the International Association of Machinists and Aerospace Workers , which also represents employees in Harley 's manufacturing plants Harley Davidson is going overseas and taking American jobs with it While other companies think about moving work home , Harley Davidson is doing the opposite Harley Davidson is laying off U S workers monthly while continuing to hire temporary workers , said IAM President Robert Martinez Jr He added What part of Made in America does Harley Davidson not understand \?

"No , don t go anywhere We need to talk I ll keep it brief Below is a fake news article I wrote around six years ago as a joke , trying to show a friend how easy it is to come up with an article that looks plausible and official At the bottom of the page , there is a message saying that this is bullshit , clearly and blatantly , just to make sure nobody took this seriously And yet , despite this article being the most poorly written piece of shit and probably the worst joke I have ever made , it has been taken so seriously that I have 256 comments awaiting approval , snopes has had to debunk it by noting the last paragraph , and I ve had NUMEROUS cases of people sending this link to me as an argument This is a microcosm of a very serious problem We have a serious problem with fake news in this country , and if you have come across this page , you probably googled something to the effect of IQ and political views Please , stop If you keep googling things like this , you re going to find what you re looking for You re going to find one of those fake fictitious news websites run by think tanks or fringe political groups , and you re going to read what you want to hear Except , next time , you won t come across this message You won t come across the disclaimer at the bottom saying this bullshit Because while I was just a kid trying to make a point , the other news sources are not They are political groups who want more than anything to tell you what you want to hear and gull you to join their ranks You need to do better You need to check sources , you need to confirm what people are saying is true , even when you agree with them Especially when you agree with them If you believe what people say because they look like they re telling the truth , because you agree with them and you assume that they know what they re talking about , then you are going to be brainwashed , you are going to be gulled , you are going to be fooled They ll lie to you more and more Save yourself , and help save everyone else from this epidemic Don t get gulled Don t become some liar s follower Check sources , especially when you want the story to be right If you see something you agree with , don t be a fool and nod your head then move on like so many have with this page Stop , look at the source , follow the numbers , read some abstracts , figure out how they came to that conclusion and why That way , if what someone says is true , you won t just think it s true , you ll know it s true And if it s not , you will have discovered a liar , and no matter how much you wish what they said were true , call them out because the only thing worse than ignorance is willful ignorance Ask questions , think critically We do not want a future run by liars and their followers That s all And now , back to this A new study conducted at Harvard University shows that in America , Liberals have a significantly lower IQ than Conservatives The study was conducted on 100 , 000 registered voters in 40 different states over the last twelve years , and has concluded its results The first part of the study lists the correlation between political beliefs and intelligence Subjects of the study were chosen at random and requested to come to an unmarked van to take a test and answer some questions for a reasonable amount of money Of the 100 , 000 people , there were people from many doctrines , from conservative to liberal to marxist to fascist Socialists came out on bottom , with an average IQ of 87 The second worst were Liberals and then Marxists , with 88 and 89 respectively Conservatives received an average score of 110 , which is significantly above average However , the conservatives did not score the highest The holder of second place were Communists with an average I Q of 115 , and the first place was apolitical people who did not follow any specific doctrine , who received a whopping score on average of 135 IAHYM News attempted to interview President Barack Obama on the new find , but he refused to speak directly Instead , while walking down the strange hallway , he told correspondent Joseph Ducreux that the study was ridiculous and false , but failed to provide any reason as to why or how the science of the study is at fault Hilary Rodham Clinton was also contacted , but she immediately hung up the phone when she figured out that the study was being mentioned at all Other parts of the study included the daily activities of the various people based on their doctrines Apparently , Liberals are five times more likely to commit a crime , steal or cheat on a test than anybody else except for Socialists , 52 of which have committed a major felony while being watched Conservatives not only did not commit any crimes , but they actually prevented them , as the few events where a Conservative was threatened by a thief or mugger was hindered by a concealed handgun Also , Communists are the most likely to commit rape or sexual assault , second to socialists The study was conducted in other countries as well , where 81 of Muslim Extremists admitted to following the Liberal doctrine and idolizing President Barack Obama The study was conducted by a group of roughly 900 different scientists across the country over the past twelve years , each one taking on a little over a hundred people per person Reporting from New York City , this is John Bowling IAHYM News Network , 2011 Oh yeah , and everything in that bullshit you just read is completely and totally false There has been no such conclusive study , and all of the Finds are based on public paranoia If you , even for a second , thought this find might be true , you are probably an idiot Advertisements",false

"The essence of science is figuring out what things are made of , and how things work This page gives just a brief introduction to the science of snowflakes Delving deeper brings one into a fascinating , and still unfolding , story about the molecular dynamics of how crystals grow and develop For that you can browse the Contents page , and from there jump to a wide variety of topics relating to snowflake science What is a snowflake \? When people say snowflake , they often mean snow crystal The latter is a single crystal of ice , within which the water molecules are all lined up in a precise hexagonal array Snow crystals display that characteristic six fold symmetry we are all familiar with The picture on the left shows a snow crystal A snowflake , on the other hand , is a more general term It can mean an individual snow crystal , but it can also mean just about anything that falls from the winter clouds Often hundreds or even thousands of snow crystals collide and stick together in mid air as they fall , forming flimsy puff balls we call snowflakes Calling a snow crystal a snowflake is fine , like calling a tulip a flower Frozen water vapor Snow crystals are not frozen raindrops that is called sleet A snow crystal appears when water vapor in the air converts directly into ice without first becoming liquid water As more water vapor condenses onto a nascent snow crystal , it grow and develops , and that is when its ornate patterns emerge Why such complex , symmetrical shapes \? And why are no two alike \? A stellar snow crystal begins with the formation of a small hexagonal plate , and branches sprout from the six corners when the crystal grows larger As it tumbles through the clouds , the crystal experiences ever changing temperatures and humidities , and each change makes the arms grow a bit differently The exact shape of the final snow crystal is determined by the precise path it took through the clouds But the six arms all took the same path , and so each experienced the same changes at the same times Thus the six arms grow in synchrony , yielding a complex , yet symmetrical shape And since no two snow crystals follow the exact same path through the clouds as they fall , no two look exactly alike We have made identical twin snowflakes by exposing a pair of tiny seed crystals to nearly identical varying conditions as a function of time This shows essentially what would happen if two snow crystals traveled side by side as they fell from the clouds What synchronizes the growth of the arms \? Nothing The six arms of a snow crystal all grow independently , as described in the previous section But since they grow under the same randomly changing conditions , all six end up with similar shapes There are no mysterious forces quantum mechanical , acoustical , or anything else you might have heard about that provide communication between the arms to ensure they all grow alike One analogy I like is what happens on a rainy day You look outside , see that it is raining , so you grab your umbrella on your way out Then you find out that your neighbors are all carrying umbrellas too You did n't communicate with one another about this , yet everyone 's umbrella usage was synchronized The same goes for the six branches of a snow crystal When the temperature or humidity changes around the crystal , the six branches all change their growth in snychrony , even though the branches do not communicate with one another Now , let me assure you that the vast majority of snow crystals are not very symmetrical Do n't be fooled by the pictures irregular crystals \( see the Guide to Snowflakes \) are by far the most common type Just take a look for yourself next time it snows Near perfect , symmetrical snow crystals are fun to look at , and sought after by photographers , but they are not common Why six \? The six fold symmetry you see in a snow crystal arises from the arrangement of water molecules in the ice crystal lattice As this ice crystal model spins around , you can see the hexagons in the structure But a crystal is a three dimensional structure , and snowflakes are also three dimensional Stellar plates are thin and flat \( see the Guide to Snowflakes \) , but other snow crystals are not The simplest snowflakes When snow crystals first begin growing , they are shaped like the simple hexagonal prisms shown here Each prism has two basal facets and six prism facets Hexagonal prisms can be long , slender , hexagonal columns , or thin , flat , hexagonal plates , or anything in between Hexagonal prisms display the simple , perfect order of the molecular lattice These crystals result from slow growth , and they are usually small in size Snowflake Asymmetry If you take a close look at the snow crystal on the left , you will see that it is not very symmetrical Sure it has six similar branches , but the sidebranches are randomly positioned on the each of the branches This is a fernlike stellar dendrite \( see the Guide to Snowflakes \) , and each branch grows independently of the others Plus each branch grows rapidly \( compared to other snowflake types \) , sending out sidebranches at irregular intervals The chaotic branching of a fernlike stellar dendrite arises during rapid ice growth , in contrast to the slow , simple growth of hexagonal prisms Faceting , Branching , and Sharpening There is no blueprint or genetic code that guides the growth of a snowflake Yet they appear in these amazingly ornate , symmetrical shapes The shape of each crystal is not determined by any plan or predetermined design , but by different processes that govern its growth behavior Faceting One such process is faceting , which causes flat surfaces to appear on the crystal , surfaces that reflect the underlying molecular symmetry Click on the link to read more about faceting Branching This process causes complex structures to grow out from the ice Click on the link to read more Sharpening This process pushes snow crystal growth to thin , flat plates , happening mainly at temperatures near 15C \( 5 F \) The different growth processes guide snow crystal growth differently Faceting creates order , as embodied by the simple , perfect , hexagonal prism Branching brings chaos , as embodied by the randomly spaced sidebranches in a fernlike stellar dendrite But with the right mix of order and chaos , nature sometimes creates beautiful snow crystals that are both complex and symmetrical As you learn more about snowflakes , you soon find that the underlying science is quite complicated The growth of a snowflake depends on how water molecules diffuse through the air surrounding a growing crystal , and it depends on how water molecules stick to ice surfaces There is a lot going on as these crystals form in the clouds Of course , that is what makes it all so fascinating ! The Snow Crystal Morphology Diagram The way snow crystals grow depends strongly on the temperature and humidity in the clouds This is summarized in the Snow Crystal Morphology Diagram shown on the right This is also called the Nakaya Diagram , after Japanese physicist Ukichiro Nakaya , who discovered this behavior by growing snow crystals in his lab in the 1930s Go ahead , click on the diagram for a closer look It shows that the largest , most photogenic stellar snow crystals only grow in a narrow temperature range around 15 C \( 5 F \) Needles and columns are best found around 6 C \( 21 F \) Capped columns appear when the temperature changes as the crystals grow Remember these are temperatures in the clouds it is often substantially warmer on the ground You can also see that more elaborate , branched crystals grow when the humidity is high Simple prisms grow when the humidity is low \( or when the crystals are tiny \) Exactly why snow crystals grow this way is not yet fully understood , although much progress has been made The growth behavior of ice depends on the molecular structure and dynamics at the crystal surface , and this is all so complicated that no one really understands everything about it Although science has made great advances in understanding the secrets of the Universe , there remains a bit of mystery still in these remarkable ice structures More If you find this intriguing so far , please continue to the Contents page , from where you can jump to a wide variety of topics relating to snowflake science",true

You Google the word , and horrifying pictures of bloody , broken babies show up on the screen The pictures blur as you sit and stare until your eyes water As unlikely as that story might sound , it may one day be true Multiple media outlets reported this week that Bianca Coons and Cristobal Ruiz traveled from Idaho to the Planned Parenthood in Albuquerque in February 2016 when they discovered they were expecting their third child They decided they could not afford another baby , and so they headed to New Mexico where they could escape the mandated waiting period in their home state that would have resulted in the baby being further along at the time of the abortion Coons and Ruiz now claim they used all of their remaining resources to pay for the trip and the abortion , which cost 400 The abortion failed , and their little son is now two years old We know this because Coons and Ruiz are suing Planned Parenthood for failing to abort their baby boy , demanding that the abortion organization pay for the cost of raising him because medical negligence resulted in him being born alive in the first place Additionally , they are suing for breach of contract after all , they paid Planned Parenthood to kill him , and uncharacteristically , Planned Parenthood failed The abortion clinic had offered them a medication abortion , and Coons had taken one pill at the clinic and one a day later The first pill caused extreme dizziness and nausea Advertisement Follow Jonathon van Maren on Facebook Like 17K Share But when Coons checked into a local emergency room back in Boise , Idaho , the physicians there told the dismayed mother that her baby was perfectly healthy despite having taken the first pill The Planned Parenthood staff advised her to take the second pill , anyway Perhaps that would kill the baby But no such luck Another round of blood work indicated that Coons son was a fighter , and he was still alive and well despite the best efforts of his parents and the abortion clinic staff Coons and Ruiz felt betrayed This , after all , was not what they had paid for Planned Parenthood offered her a follow up abortion back in New Mexico , but the little boy s parents couldn t afford to go back and try again , and they said they couldn t afford a home turf abortion in Idaho , either And so Coons reluctantly gave birth , and the couple is now suing Planned Parenthood for 765 , 000 for the cost of raising an additional unplanned child The lawsuit states that , the defendant s failure to properly supervise and administer the abortion service directly resulted in the failure of the pregnancy termination which resulted in injury to plaintiffs interests in family planning and their interests in financial planning for the future of their family Someday , this toddler will grow up Someday , he will find out that his parents tried to abort him , and then resented raising him so much after that failed that they sued the abortion clinic that had failed to kill him for the cost of his life with them When he does , he will be devastated He will realize that his parents are sick people , that this is a sick culture , and that legal abortion has poisoned everything That realization will be gut wrenching , just as it has for each of us who have confronted this awful reality in one way or another in this growing culture of death",true

"BatchelderStimulating job creation and growth while simultaneously reining in an 8 billion state deficit are at the top of the priority list of both candidates running for the Ohio 69th House District seat The candidates approach to meeting those goals could not be more different , however Ohio is heading for quite a crisis unfortunately we did not have the focus on job creation in the last session that we should have , said incumbent 69th House Representative Bill Batchelder We sent 20 bills addressing job creation and expansion , but we should have been cutting back more on the appropriations level than we were , but as the minority party , we had no control over that Batchelder , who has been mentioned as a possible choice for Speaker of the House should the Republicans Party gain control , is serving the second term of his second time in the house He previ ously served for 30 years up until 2008 , when term limits forced him to give up the seat He has also served as a judge on the Medina County Common Pleas Court and the Ninth District Court of Appeals Addressing the deficit , which now accounts for roughly 20 percent of the entire state budget , will be a huge problem facing the next House of Representatives in their first six months , Batchelder said , adding that several tough battles must be waged to meet this goal He pointed specifically to seeking Federal waiers for participation in the Medicaid program , potentially via offsets for indigent services provided at facilities like MetroHealth Medical Center There are all kinds of things like that which we have n't done a good job of cataloguing , Batchelder said And the Federal government has arbitrary authority over granting waivers Batchelder also supports looking at the privatization of some medical services now done by public employees Many of these services are now done by people who are being paid higher than those in the private sector , Batchelder said He did not , however , indicate specifically which public sector jobs he would consider making cuts to , or how many of those jobs would be impacted by such a move We will be holding a lot of hearings and we will have to solve it in six months , when the budget must be in , he said On the growth side of the equation , Batchelder said enhancing the state 's Department of Development by encouraging the direct input of participation of business owners is key to job growth We are competing with Indiana and their economy is growing , Batchelder said It does n't help that our Department of Development has been through three or four directors in the same number of years But we have got to get guys in there from successful businesses who can tell us what they need National Cash Register is a company that was here for 100 years and now they are in Atlanta should n't we find out what companies like that need instead of having the government tell us what they need \? To provide an immediate shot in the state 's economic arm , Batchelder said there should be more of a focus on the needs of industries such as medical and metalworking We are starting to see a real philosophical difference between those who feel the government can create jobs and those who feel that only the private sector can , Batchelder said These 'green jobs' are generational , they are not something that will be ready next week or even next year All of these things are planned for the future there are a lot of ribbons being cut but not a lot of production You ca n't starve on your way to the green job Batchelder said Medina County is particularly poised to play a major role in this short term recovery focus When we create the jobs , it 's also important to have people trained to do them , he said So again , we have to find out from the business community what those needs are , then use or facilities such as the Akron University branch and the Medina County Career Center for that training That sort of business focus has begun to resonate with an increasingly weary electorate , in Batchelder 's view I think people are not so much looking for hope and change as nuts and bolts that maybe we need to be more business focused in order to put this economy back together , he said We have n't had control of the House for the last two years and it 's been malfunctioning , we had 109 session scheduled and held 49 Batchelder said that in spite of the fact that Ohio is in the worst shape since the Depression economically , having such a focus will turn around the state 's fortunes We need people who will roll up their sleeves to do the legislative work that needs done , he said There is no doubt in my mind we are in the position to do that Contact Lisik at \( 216 \) 986 2356",true
