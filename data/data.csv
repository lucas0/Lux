"January 26 , 2016 by Bristol Palin COUNT Unless you 've been totally off social media for the past week or so , you 've probably seen how actress and Fox News personality Stacey Dash caused Twitter to explode when she said that BlackHistoryMonth and BET should n't exist She said Either we want to have segregation or integration , and if we do n't want segregation , then we have to get rid of channels like BET and the BET Awards and the Image Awards , where you 're only awarded if you 're black , she continued If it were the other way around , we 'd be up in arms It 's a double standard There should n't be a black history month We 're Americans , period Well , she definitely started a conversation and has agreement in unexpected places 1 Listen to what famous rapper Waka Flocka said He said But honestly , I always felt like that Like why the f k we got BET \? BET is for black people and MTV is for white people \? Think about it Why the f k we got Black History Month only in February \? How can the people that took our history , give us our history for one month \? Just think about it I have to admit , I do n't know who Waka Flocka is , or what he sings , but I agree with him on this ! 2 Listen to what rapper , writer , actor , director Ice Cube said about the OscarSoWhite controversy We do n't do movies for the industry We do movies for the fans , for the people , Ice Cube said Friday To cry about not winning an award is like crying because you do n't have enough icing on your cake ! Though he did n't mention Stacey by name , is n't it interesting how he echoed her sentiments exactly \? We should n't segregate ourselves or limit Black History Month to one month a year I wish things were really colorblind I do n't know what we can do as a society to come together as one Ss far as what I have seen about the OscarSoWhiteControversy , it seems Jada Smith started it because her husband was n't getting nominated I do n't know how other people think about it , but I hope my son sees early on that not everyone gets a trophy Buy my Mom 's new devotional , Sweet Freedom , in bookstores everywhere !",false
"Pin ItAlthough no alcohol is sold in Disneyland itself \( except in Club 33 \) , locations in Disney California Adventure , the Disney owned hotels , and Downtown Disney serve alcohol Here 's our guide to the best beer and mixed drinks available throughout Disneyland Resort While it 's not as popular as Drinking Around the World at Epcot in Walt Disney World , leisurely afternoon spent exploring the various Disneyland Resort bars is a lot of fun Plus , all of these bars are within a short walk of one another given Disneyland 's condensed footprint , so it 's easy to hit them all in one day Some of the mixed drinks here might be off menu at some locations , but they 're listed because the bartenders at the given location do a great job with these drinks We try to give a couple suggestions for each location so that you do n't have to order a random drink off what I lovingly prefer to as the Generic DisneyParks Drink Menu I loathe this menu of sugar water and vibrantly color concoctions meant to appeal only to vacationers who do n't regularly drink It is the epitome of what is wrong with the contemporary Disney theme parks homogenization that has replaced unique experiences in the name of saving a few bucks because bean counters either do n't understand the Disney Difference , or think most guests wo n't notice , anyway More importantly , if you 're someone who has the mental and physical fortitude to partake in a bar crawl , you will be largely unimpressed by these drinks Plus , consuming more than a couple will make you sick to your stomach from an overdose of sugar Because of this , we make recommendations that are either unique to each specific stop on our tour , or are drinks most bartenders at the locations in question know how to make Order these , or order something else you enjoy that the bartender knows how to make You order drinks off the Generic DisneyParks Drink Menu at your own peril Obviously you should use your head when consuming alcohol Eat a big early lunch before you start , make sure to stay hydrated , and spread out your drinking This is enough fun that it should be an all day event , so take your time We recommend starting at around noon and concluding late in the evening Every good bar crawl needs a good name , and we 're fresh out Epcot has Drinking Around the World , which is a very solid name , but nothing spectacular for Disneyland sticks out like that In lieu of something better , I'm going to call this the Disneyland Drinking Debauchery Sounds a little more risque than it actually is , but I like alliterations It 's scientifically proven that the best place to start the Disneyland Drinking Debauchery is in Disney California Adventure Laugh if you want , but there is a very good reason for this Disney California Adventure has some attractions that are enhanced with alcohol Seriously , it 's like adding 3D to the Lion King It started out great , but 3D really adds an element of wow These alcohol enhanced attractions are California Screamin' , Silly Symphony Swings , Goofy 's Sky School , and the Golden Zephyr In other words , the stuff on Paradise Pier Science is needed here because you need to consume the perfect amount of alcohol to enhance these experiences Drink too little , and they 're the same as they normally are Drink too much , and it 's Upchuck City Population everyone in your general vicinity Not a pretty picture However , if you hit that slightly buzzed sweet spot , these attractions are a lot more fun Okay , let 's get started with the fun ! Disney California AdventureCarthay Circle Lounge Part of the all new Buena Vista Street , Carthay Circle contains a restaurant and two lounges The first lounge , 1901 , is available only to upgraded Club 33 members The other lounge is where you 'll be stopping , and there 's no reason to be down about this if you 're not a Club 33 member \( as is the case with 99 99999999999999999 of the population \) , because this lounge is spectacular The decor is classy and elegant , and most importantly , the lounge has its own unique menu There are several great options on this menu , with different types of custom ice \( seriously \) to boot ! My personal favorite is the Carthay Manhattan Sarah enjoys the Carthay Club Mojito The Aviator Cocktail is a good , strong drink , too Be careful when you step into Carthay Circle Lounge , as this could be the first and last stop on your Disneyland Debauchery Drinking tour That 's not necessarily a bad thing , as the drinks here are seriously good Al Fresco Tasting Terrace This location can be difficult to find It 's a secluded area upstairs from Wine Country Trattoria If you ca n't find the staircase leading here , ask a Cast Member It 's easier to find than it used to be , since changing over from the Al Fresco Lounge to the Tasting Terrace Now featuring more tasting plates and a robust drink menu , things have improved , as you can read in our Al Fresco Tasting Terrace Review Moreover , the views from this terrace into Cars Land are phenomenal Here , we recommend one of the cheaper wine flights or the Widmer Hefeweizen This is a wine bar , so I 'd caution against straying from wines and beers We 've never had a good mixed drink here In fact , the Irish Coffee Sarah once ordered here was about the most disgusting thing I 've ever tasted , and was nothing like a traditional Irish Coffee Fortunately , Al Fresco Tasting Terrace has come a long way since then , and it 's now one of our favorite spots in DCA Bayside Brews Bayside Brews is located near the Silly Symphony Swings , Golden Zephyr , and Goofy 's Sky School Unsurprisingly , it serves beer Although it 's just a little stand \( if we stopped at every little beer kiosk in DCA , you 'd end up in the hospital fear not , this is one of only two that we hit \) , it is notable because it serves good beer as compared to other beer stands in Disneyland We recommend grabbing a Sierra Nevada Torpedo IPA or whatever the Karl Strauss seasonal beer happens to be The Torpedo IPA is definitely your best bet , and possibly the best beer you can find at Disneyland Resort We highly recommend grabbing your brew from Bayside Brews , and then heading over to the actual bayside , to the secluded seating area under Silly Symphony Swings Enjoy your beer there in peace while looking out over the water , and then head upstairs for the ride of your life on the swings ! Cove Bar The next stop is Cove Bar Ahh , Cove Bar In the original version of this Drinking Guide that we published in 2012 , we regaled readers with tales of Cove Bar and its glorious Lobster Nachos Prior to that post , we never had to wait to be seated at Cove Bar , always walking up and having our choice of seats Shortly after that post , Cove Bar exploded in popularity Now , we are n't taking credit for that nor are we taking blame Irrespective of the reason , Cove Bar exploded in popularity , and a contributing factor was undoubtedly viral images of Lobster Nachos and colorful drinks on Instagram and Pinterest Cove Bar began drawing lines rivaling those of Radiator Springs Races The Lobster Nacho Revolution had begun Fortunately , in early 2016 , Disney opened an expanded seating area for Cove Bar , and now the waits have been reduced to more manageable times on most days \( 10 20 minutes \) The bartenders are usually very entertaining and fun at the Cove Bar , so sitting at the bar can also be a good time This should be your second food stop of the day \( you should 've eaten lunch before commencing the Disneyland Drinking Debauchery \) and there is one thing you should absolutely order here the Lobster Nachos As we wrote in our Cove Bar Review , the Lobster Nachos are a zen like experience that makes you feel like there are little angels massaging your taste buds and tickling your stomach a religious experience These are the most expensive thing on the bar menu , but they are so , so delicious My drink of choice here is the Zombie , which can be made a few different ways The bartenders here usually make it a dark green color , but do n't be surprised if it 's light It does have some fruit juices in it , but it also is heavy on the rum \( light , dark , and 151 \) The Cove Bar also has around 10 beers on tap , so pick one of those if you 're not down with the undead concoction Intermission During the intermission , enjoy the Golden Zephyr , Silly Symphony Swings , and , if your stomach can handle it , California Screamin' and Goofy 's Sky School Return to the Disneyland Drinking Debauchery after enjoying these attractions Intermission The Karl Strauss Beer Truck This beer truck tucked away in Pacific Wharf at Disney California Adventure is our second of two kiosk style stops As the name suggests , this truck serves Karl Strauss beer As Disneyland Resort , for some reason , is very lacking on good craft beers , we recommend making a stop here This should not be read as an endorsement of Karl Strauss beer , but comparatively speaking , it is fairly good Tower 10 IPA and Red Trolley Ale are both good , or go for the seasonal option This is one step we 'd recommend skipping if you want to drink less and or do n't care for beer Alternatively , you can also stop at the nearby Rita 's Baja Blenders , Cocina Cucamonga , or Lucky Fortune Cookie for different options Flo 's V8 Cafe The latest addition to our list is quite possibly the best stop of all If you 've paced things really slowly , you might be here around sunset That 's the perfect time to drink at Flo 's ! Grab a Racer 5 IPA and head back to the outdoor seating area at the back of the restaurant Here , you have a perfect view of the Cadillac Mountain Range and Radiator Springs Racers There 's nothing quite like an early evening enjoying a beer and watching the cars fly by one of Imagineering 's masterpieces You might just find yourself ending your debauchery here , as you get stuck at this spot for a couple of hours Make no mistake even though you 're not missing the mission , this is a noble feat On your way to the next stops at Disney 's Grand Californian Hotel Spa , pick up FastPasses for \( hopefully \) the late show of World of Color Grand CalifornianHearthstone Lounge Hearthstone Lounge has a pretty good selection of beers , with a lot of the standard choices available elsewhere from Karl Strauss and Sierra Nevada You can also find some choices from Sam Adams and New Castle , among others , here Here , we definitely recommend sitting at the bar or at least ordering from the bar We 've had inexperienced servers here in the general seating area who simply recommend any of the good drinks on the menu with the menu being the Generic DisneyParks Drink Menu I typically opt for a Sierra Nevada here , whereas Sarah usually experiments with whatever bartender 's choice These drinks have always tasted great , but beware , they can pack a punch ! Napa Rose Napa Rose is the best non club restaurant at Disneyland Resort It also has a pretty nice bar Luckily , you do n't have to drop 50 on some filet to grab a beer here \( although if you see or smell one , you might find yourself doing just that \) I recommend the Franziskaner Hefe Weisses here It 's creamy and moderately thick , with a nutty flavor and slight banana undertone to it Napa Rose is more well known for its world class wine collection , so if you 're into wine , you might go that route Rather than taking my advice on that , ask the bartender or a server All of the servers here are sommeliers , meaning they know a heck of a lot more about wine than me ! Here , the plan offers some wild card options See the below Other Stops section if you have time in your crawl and want to make an additional stop Hollywood Land Dance Party Insert Name Club There is a drink station set up each night for Mad T Party It was previously End of Line Club , now it 's Drink Me Who knows what it will be next Regardless of the name , the idea remains the same pricey light up drinks for clubin' While the drinks are fairly expensive \( over 10 for the light up specialties \) here to capitalize on the party oriented audience , ours have always been surprisingly good This is surprising because , given the location and target , we figured these would be watered down sugar drinks The Glowjito Mojito and Digitini Martini are both good and offer light up fun To be fair , they are somewhat sugar y , but the ones we 've had \( on several different nights \) have always had some kick I do n't know if this is just great luck or if it 's always this way After grabbing a drink , join the other programs or tweedle dums \( \? \) at elecTRONica or Mad T Party Once the dance party concludes , use your FastPass for the late show of World of Color Trader Sam 's Enchanted Tiki Bar After World of Color , the perfect way to cap off the evening is at the best bar in all of Disneyland Resort , Trader Sam 's If you want a thorough review of Trader Sam 's , read this review where I offer heaping amounts of praise to Trader Sam 's The CliffNotes version Trader Sam 's is the coolest bar in Disneyland , with an intimate \( 47 person capacity \) location that is packed with an astonishing amount of detail , interactive elements , and some fantastic drinks Some of these drinks include the Adventurers Club Kungaloosh \( a Walt Disney World classic \) , the HippopotoMai Tai , Shrunken Zombie Head , Tiki Tiki Tiki Tiki Tiki Rum , Shipwreck on the Rocks , and the Uh Oa ! The Uh Oa ! can be shared by 2 4 people , has a cool tableside presentation , and is our favorite drink at Trader Sam 's Trader Sam 's does serve some good beers as well , but this is one location where you should stick to mixed drinks because they 're really that good If you stay for only one drink , you can add items in from the Other Stops list below , but we recommend spending a couple hours here soaking up the ambiance and ending your night here It 's the perfect conclusion to Disneyland Drinking Debauchery Other Stops There are other places you can stop , but chances are , even with taking it slow and spreading out the festivities over the course of the entire day , eight stops will be the limit \( or even too much \) for most people The stops above are our picks for the best drinking spots in Disneyland However , since we heavily weigh ambiance , there might be some additional or alternative places that might appeal more to you personally , depending upon your preferences Here 's our list of the best of the rest",true

"NewsThe latest updates from our PartyResponse to Mitt Romney 's Claim That We Do n't Need More Firemen , More Policemen , More Teachers PostedJune 11 , 2012Comments Show Romney Has No Idea What 's Going On With Wisconsin 's Middle Class FamiliesDemocratic National Committee Communications Director Brad Woodhouse and President of the Professional Fire Fighters of Wisconsin Mahlon Mitchell held a press call earlier today responding to Mitt Romney 's statement that we do n't need more firemen , more policemen , more teachers Listen to the Woodhouse Mitchell call here Wisconsinites know that firefighters , police officers , and teachers are the backbone of a successful community , and Romney suggesting they are n't vital to our well being is shocking These are hard working Americans who want to make their cities and towns a better place and ensure that every American has a shot at the American Dream and the opportunity to live in a safe , prosperous community To say anything otherwise is further proof that Mitt Romney is detached from the reality of Wisconsinites But this comes as no surprise coming from a candidate who has joked about being unemployed himself , said he likes firing people and claimed that corporations are people Obviously , Romney does n't get it Mitt Romney saying we do n't benefit from more firefighters , police officers and teachers is further proof of his philosophy of Romney Economics tax cuts for the wealthy over investments in our community the same formula that benefitted a few , but crashed our economy and punished the middle class In Massachusetts , firefighters were among the many victims of Romney Economics As Romney made clear on Friday , he does n't care about these jobs but as governor , he did n't seem to care about their safety either , vetoing millions of dollars for fire safety equipment and targeting that equipment with a line item veto From that earlier call , these remarks prepared for delivery DNC Communications Director Brad WoodhouseThank you for joining the call today As you know , last week Mitt Romney showed just how out of touch he is with middle class Wisconsinites In addition to joking that he is unemployed , that he thinks corporations are people too , and telling us that he likes firing people , in a moment of candor Mitt Romney said we do n't need more firefighters , policemen , and teachers These types of statements and this type of sentiment is absolutely shocking Listening to that , hardworking Americans have to wonder just how much more disconnected from the concerns of middle class Americans could Mitt Romney be \? These are hard working folks who want to make their cities and towns a better place To say anything otherwise is further proof that Mitt Romney is detached from the reality of hardworking Wisconsinites and the concerns of their everyday lives President Obama knows that firefighters , policemen , and teachers are the backbone of a successful community and that they have been hit hard by the recession On top of creating 4 3 million private sector jobs over the past 27 months , President Obama has given Congress a clear plan that would create as many as one million new jobs and put firefighters , policemen , and teachers back to work But Republicans in Congress are doing nothing to pass that plan and is leaving a million jobs on the table President Obama is the only one with a plan to move this country forward and strengthen our economy Among the first things he did in office , President Obama saved more than 300 , 000 educators' jobs and helped states prevent massive layoffs And he 's making sure they have the resources they need to do their jobs He supported projects to modernize our children 's schools and smart reforms that give schools and school districts the flexibility they need to best serve students He also supported hiring programs , provided safety equipment and modernized firehouses and police stations that have helped thousands of police , firefighters and first responders keep their jobs and keep them safe President Obama understands that when these folks work , it not only helps our children in the classroom and keep our streets safe , but it also gives them more money to spend in their communities at the local shop or corner store President Obama is working hard to provide solutions And what is Mitt Romney 's solution to strengthen the economy \? Fire more people Even Scott Walker in Wisconsin said that Mitt Romney learned the wrong lessons from Wisconsin in promising he will make cuts to these jobs Mitt Romney saying that we do n't benefit from more firefighters , police officers , and teachers is further proof of his philosophy of Romney Economics more budget busting tax cuts for the wealthy and fewer rules for Wall Street the same formula that benefitted a few , but crashed our economy and punished the middle class And this is the same troubling formula that Mitt Romney put in place as governor of Massachusetts where he asked the middle class to continue to sacrifice more Romney made drastic cuts in funding to education and first responders , and Massachusetts fell to 47th out of 50 in job creation Middle class Americans ca n't afford Romney Economics tax cuts for the wealthy over investments in our community is not the formula for a successful community He 's promising the same solutions now Make no mistake , though , the American people and the people of Wisconsin are going to continue to see through Mitt Romney 's devastating economic plan It did n't work in Massachusetts , it wo n't work in Wisconsin , and it wo n't work for America President of the Professional Fire Fighters of Wisconsin Mahlon MitchellThank you , Brad I'm Mahlon Mitchell , the President of the Professional Fire Fighters of Wisconsin , which proudly represents thousands of professional firefighters across Wisconsin and this country First responders and teachers were among the many victims of Romney Economics in Massachusetts Romney has made it absolutely crystal clear he does n't care about our jobs And apparently , he does n't care about Wisconsinites safety , either In his first year as governor of Massachusetts , Romney slashed investments in local aid , costing about 14 , 500 Massachusetts teachers , cops , librarians and others their jobs Romney also vetoed millions of dollars for fire safety equipment And it was n't funding in all encompassing bill that Romney vetoed He specifically targeted this safety equipment by vetoing it with a line item veto Mitt Romney first cut funding for our coats , pants , helmets and boots equipment that is essential to do the job and that protects firefighters when they run into a burning building He went a step further when he cut funding for handheld lights that help firefighters see through the smoke , and the devices that help them communicate with other firefighters This type of funding would 've saved more lives by giving firefighters the tools they need to find the victims in a fire , and to track their fellow firefighters to make sure they make it out okay Even personal alert safety systems , air packs , tanks and compressors were on Romney 's chopping block That 's the equipment that literally keeps firefighters alive and breathing while they 're surrounded by flames Firefighters simply cannot do their jobs without that lifesaving equipment Mitt Romney made it clear that equipment our first responders needed to keep themselves and our communities safe was not a priority to him And these cuts were so contrary to the values of the Massachusetts people , that both parties in the State House and Senate overrode these vetoes unanimously But that did n't stop Romney Economics Governor Romney even had the gall to put a stop to building a fire station that would have been a living memorial for six local firefighters who died in a warehouse fire This would have been important to both the families and the community , but it was n't important enough to Mitt Romney Regardless of what Mitt Romney might think , more cops and firefighters keep our streets safe and our communities protected It 's a fact , and anyone who says otherwise is completely disconnected from reality The truth is Romney simply did n't advocate for the folks who would 've risked their lives to save him if his house was on fire and his comments on Friday prove that nothing 's changed I do n't know a single person other than Mitt Romney who thinks we have too many teachers , too many police officers and too many firefighters in our communities Our first responders look out for us in tough times , and it 's our turn to do the same for them Mitt Romney just does n't understand that",true

"DID YOU KNOW \? Trump Won 3 , 084 out of 3 , 151 Counties Hillary Only Won 57DID YOU KNOW \? Trump Won 3 , 084 out of 3 , 151 Counties Hillary Only Won 57Politics By Eren Moreno December 1 , 2016Are you growing tired of liberals crying over the so called popular vote , as if Hillary Clinton is some beloved disenfranchised leader \? There are rules to the contest , and Trump won fair and square The rest is just noise and sore loser whining If she wants , Hillary can go be the governor of California , or President of Saudi Arabia Aside from her popularity in the ultra liberal strongholds California and New York , the final election breakdown of the numbers shows what an ass kickin' Hillary received from the American people From Allen West The keening and caterwauling we 've been treated to by the left since Hillary Clinton 's defeat has been monumental Most entertaining has been the snowflake retreat to safe spaces with puppies and coloring books to assuage their anguish Less entertaining were the violent protests whichwere paid foreruptedPutting aside Jill Stein 's quixotic effort to force a recount , the left has been loudest with its demands to dismantle the Electoral College After all it 's unfair Hillary Clinton won the popular vote so she should win , right \? Wrong Our Founders in their infinite wisdom created the Electoral College to ensure the STATES were fairly represented Why should one or two densely populated areas speak for the whole of the nation \? The following list of statistics has been making the rounds on the Internet and it should finally put an end to the argument as to why the Electoral College makes sense Share this with as many whiners as you can There are 3 , 141 counties in the United States Trump won 3 , 084 of them Clinton won 57 There are 62 counties in New York State Trump won 46 of them Clinton won 16 Clinton won the popular vote by approx 1 5 million votes In the 5 counties that encompass NYC , \( Bronx , Brooklyn , Manhattan , Richmond Queens \) Clinton received well over 2 million more votes than Trump \( Clinton only won 4 of these counties Trump won Richmond \) Therefore these 5 counties alone , more than accounted for Clinton winning the popular vote of the entire country These 5 counties comprise 319 square miles The United States is comprised of 3 , 797 , 000 square miles When you have a country that encompasses almost 4 million square miles of territory , it would be ludicrous to even suggest that the vote of those who inhabit a mere 319 square miles should dictate the outcome of a national election Large , densely populated Democrat cities \( NYC , Chicago , LA , etc \) do n't and should n't speak for the rest of our country Support the Trump Presidency and help us fight Liberal Media Bias Please LIKE and SHARE this story on Facebook or Twitter",false

"Posted at 9 00 AM ET , 12 21 2010Virginia Rep Gerry Connolly on government workers under political fireBy Ed O'KeefeMore and more , when politicians talk about government employees whether they are federal , state or local it is with the kind of umbrage ordinarily aimed at Wall Street financiers and convenience store bandits Rep Gerald E Connolly \( D Va \) The Federal Eye and colleague Karen Tumulty write in Tuesday 's Washington Post about the growing backlash against public sector employees an issue of special interest in the Washington area , which is home to about 600 , 000 federal workers Rep Gerald E Connolly \( D Va \) represents about 56 , 000 of them who live in Northern Virginia The Federal Eye spoke with him last week about the growing public sector backlash A transcript edited for space appears below Question What do you make of this increased rhetoric against public sector workers , specifically , federal employees \? I think it 's very easy for politicians to demonize federal employees Politically , it costs very little to do that But I think in terms of what it does in the cost to public service is considerable Ultimately , the loser is the public itself , because the more you make public service unattractive , the more you reinforce stereotypes These are n't just nameless , faceless people who work in the bowels of a bureaucracy , they are real people who provide real services for real people It just demeans public service in a way that ultimately costs the public Does this feel like something new or more intense than he has seen before \? Is it new \? I think we 've been doing this since the age of Ronald Reagan , maybe even Jimmy Carter I'm a child of the 1960s , I remember John Kennedy and he ennobled public service Starting around Jimmy Carter and certainly perfected by Ronald Reagan , we had a very different message about public service I think we 've been fighting that battle back and forth ever since What about President Obama Is he closer to Reagan or Kennedy when it comes to public service and federal workers \? I think he 's in between Personally , he certainly believes in the nobility of service and would believe it 's a calling that 's worthy But on the other hand , as a politician , I think he too quickly singled out federal employment as , 'That 's the one I'm going to pluck out and put on the scoreboard That 's where we 're going to save money ' My reaction was , I believe federal employees and certainly the unions who represent them are willing to make a sacrifice and put some commitments on the table as part of this national cause of reducing red ink But help me understand why of all the items on the menu being served up by the Deficit Reduction Committee , the White House in advance picks this one and says this is what we 're going to do And this one just happens to be aimed and about federal employment Then what should he have picked otherwise \? I think the president unwittingly contributed to this unfriendly , if not hostile climate with respect to federal employment , and I think that 's too bad That 's not the same as saying that they should n't be willing to make a sacrifice , but signaling it out in advance of the commission 's report I think calls out the value we put on that service To me , that 's an unfortunate message that just piles on So where is this anti public sector debate headed \? I think the Congress we elected in November is a lot less hospitable to the interests of federal employees I think you 're going to see a lot more legislative action and suggestion aimed at reducing the size and compensation of that federal workforce and retirees Going right at the benefits , going right at the size of the workforce , and frankly , being a lot less attuned to the quality of that workforce Facts be damned There 's a lot of rhetoric on the other side about the growth of the federal workforce , but it 's about the size it was under the first President Bush There has n't really been a lot of net growth in the federal workforce when you compare it to say , 1990 It 's not like it 's gotten out of hand , it 's true I'm afraid that in the focus of reinforcing a stereotype is what will be lost in discussions are the ones we ought to be having , which are the quality of the workforce Where are we going to get the sophisticated skillsets we need for the future if we 're demeaning that service in the first place \? I think it 's self defeating It 's a compelling issue , because an awful lot of people are qualified to retire What if anything are you going to do combat this \? If the other side of the aisle is willing to engage in meaningful reforms , where we can have win win , and we 're able to get more out of the federal workforce , I'm all for that The president just signed my bill on telework last week There are a lot of other initiatives that can upgrade how we do things in the federal workplace and how we recruit and retain skilled workers What is really driving this debate \? What 's the political cost back in Utah or Idaho or Wyoming \? What 's the cost of picking on the federal bureaucrat \? It kind of feeds the narrative of this big , out or control federal bureaucracy that is so far removed from where you live and work that it 's an unnecessary impediment to the rest of us getting on with our lives It 's a powerful narrative in the sense I suppose of the American story , this fierce independence of Americans who , by nature are a little mistrustful of government That 's healthy But to despise the public servant and demonize that public servant , with impunity , does a real disservice to public service and is dangerous in terms of the quality of the government we 're going to need as we move forward The next Congress almost guarantees that they 'll be a lot more attackers than defenders People like me are going to have a much harder job to make the case , because I think there are fewer willing ears Read the full story and leave your thoughts in the comments section below2010",true

"We have the highest \( corporate tax rates \) in the world right now Pat Toomey on Sunday , January 2nd , 2011 in an interview on NBC 's Meet the Press Pat Toomey says U S has highest corporate tax rates in the worldBy Louis Jacobson on Monday , January 3rd , 2011 at 4 50 p m Sen elect Pat Toomey , R Pa , said during a Meet the Press roundtable that the U S has the world 's highest corporate tax rates We wondered whether he was correct On the Jan 2 , 2011 , edition of NBC 's Meet the Press , Sen elect Pat Toomey , R Pa , cited a striking statistic in urging the United States to lower its corporate tax rates Asked by host David Gregory about possible areas where President Barack Obama and congressional Republicans can work together , Toomey suggested several areas , including taxes I think tax policy is a possible area , one with plenty of landmines but plenty of opportunities , Toomey said Simplify the code , lower rates We should be lowering corporate tax rates because we have the highest in the world right now \( Later in the roundtable discussion , Yale Law School professor Stephen Carter repeated the statistic , but we 'll check Toomey 's quote here \) We wondered whether the U S really has the highest corporate tax rates in the world Using the most straightforward definition of corporate tax rates , Toomey is right The Organization for Economic Cooperation and Development , a group of 32 large , industrialized democracies , ranks the combined corporate income tax rate in its member nations That means the highest tax bracket for general corporate income , excluding taxes levied on specific products or services For 2010 , the U S ranks second to Japan by a fraction of a percentage point 39 54 percent for Japan to 39 21 percent for the U S But that figure is already outdated Japan has recently moved to cut its rate for 2011 by 5 percentage points , leaving the U S with the highest corporate tax rate among OECD nations But before we declare Toomey 's statement True , let 's dig a little deeper The OECD rate is the statutory rate that is , the top corporate tax rate on the books But many companies pay considerably less than that , due to deductions and other exclusions Adjusting for these factors produces a statistic called the effective tax rate The World Bank has assembled data from 183 nations and made a series of statistical adjustments to produce a full international comparison of effective tax rates By this measurement , the U S rate is considerably lower than the published rate 27 6 percent But in a comparative sense , that 's still pretty high Among larger international economies , only Japan , New Zealand and Thailand produced a higher effective rate in the World Bank study And Japan 's number should fall by the time next year 's study comes out The World Bank also produces another and broader statistic This measure factors in not only the corporate profit tax but also a range of other taxes paid by businesses , including the cost of employee taxes borne by the employer When the World Bank ranked countries from the lowest level of taxes to the highest , the U S ranked 124th out of 183 meaning corporate taxes were relatively high A number of other large and or democratic countries were higher , including Austria , Belgium , Brazil , China , France , Hungary , India , Italy , Spain and Sweden This last measure provides a wider snapshot of U S tax policy toward businesses , but it also introduces some complications Factoring in the employer paid portion of labor taxes makes the corporate tax rate seem higher in countries that provide higher benefits such as pensions or health care through business taxes , while making the rate seem lower for countries that provide less generous benefits through the tax code So making apples to apples comparisons can be tricky There 's also broader context that Toomey does n't get into In a previous item , we noted that when all taxes , including those such as personal income taxes and property taxes not just corporate taxes are taken into account and compared to gross domestic product , the U S does n't rank near the top of the OECD table in total tax burden Still , if you rate Toomey on his specific wording by looking at corporate tax rates , he 's right that the U S does now have the highest corporate tax rates on the books , at least among the biggest industrialized democracies , which is most economists' typical yardstick So we rate his statement Mostly True Advertisement",true

"An environmental activist was almost killed Yesterday in the Indian Ocean , after the great white shark he was trying to hug suddenly attacked him and bit his arm off 21 year old Darrell Waterford , from Eugene in Oregon , was participating in a promotional video for Greenpeace , some 100 nautical miles away from the Australian city of Perth Along with four other members of the organization , Mr Waterford decided to dive with some great white sharks in order to improve the marine predator 's public image and raise awareness about shark hunting The group shot some incredible footage during the first 30 minutes , as they swam with a group of sharks caressing and even hugging the large animals Unfortunately for the young American , one of the sharks suddenly became aggressive after being hugged and suddenly attacked him It attacked Mr Waterford and tore off his right arm right below the elbow The young man lost a large amount of blood , but was able to get out of the water and was rapidly taken to the hospital Huei Li Chong , the leader of the expedition , described the violent attack in an interview with the Australian Broadcasting Corporation The shark seemed really friendly at first , but then it went totally berserk It charged Darrell and bit off his hand in an instant , so we all hurried out of the water before it killed us According to him , the shark might have turned aggressive after smelling blood in the water Sharks can be affectionate an cuddly when they 're calm , but the smell of blood activates their predator instincts It 's not their fault , and we should n't hold them responsible Huei Li Chong , who was diving with Mr Waterford at the time of the attack , believes the shark may have become aggressive after smelling blood Greenpeace has been campaigning for years against shark finning , which consists of the removal of fins from sharks , often while the shark is alive Despite the organization 's efforts , finning has increased dramatically since 1997 largely due to the increasing demand for shark fins for shark fin soup and traditional cures Greenpeace has been trying for years to improve the white shark 's image in order to obtain an international ban , similar to the international treaty that applies to commercial whaling Several members of the organization now fear that this incident will compromise their campaign to restore the white shark 's image as a peaceful marine creature",false
"A study published by NPR reveals that over 25 million Hillary Clinton votes were completely fraudulent , meaning that the Democratic candidate actually lost the popular vote by a huge margin A study by the Pew Center claiming that over 800 , 000 non citizens voted for Hillary Clinton failed to take into account dead and fraudulent voters which totalled over 25 million registered voters According to reports , illegal aliens combined with dead voters and multiple state voters explains why Hillary appeared to have won the popular vote over Trump during this years presidential race A report by the Pew Center on the States finds that more than 1 8 million dead people are currently registered to vote , and 24 million registrations are either invalid or inaccurate , NPR reported in 2012 , which is ironic given how NPR is heavily controlled by Democrats And many of the dead , registered voters somehow keep voting Democrat from beyond the grave , most recently in Philadelphia , Penn and Colorado It 's also worth noting that the U S population has increased since 2012 , meaning that there 's likely more dead and invalid voters than before The Pew study found that almost 3 million people are registered to vote in more than one state , NPR added That 's because when a new resident registers to vote in a state , officials usually never bother to tell his former state about the change in voter residency Under the catch and release immigration program by the Obama administration , illegal aliens were routinely given bus tickets to travel to other states by immigration officials , so it was theoretically possible for non citizens to register to vote in a border country illegally , then register to vote in another state after their taxpayer funded bus dropped them off Clinton won most of the 163 most populous counties in the US that account for half of the total votes in the election , including dense urban areas in New York and California , yet she only won the popular vote by 2 8 million votes , which reveals the lack of enthusiasm voters had for her in comparison to Trump and that Democrats would have depended more on illegal votes A portion of the 24 million invalid voter registrations combined with a portion of the 1 8 million dead voters and the over 800 , 000 known illegal voters could explain the difference of 2 8 million votes , and it 's worth noting that the 800 , 000 figure could be a low , conservative estimate That said , a popular vote victory is meaningless if the president was elected by popular vote , then both Trump and Clinton would have campaigned in entirely different states because only densely population regions of the U S would decide who would become president Without the electoral college , the United States of America would be reduced to the United States of New York and California , with 48 other vassal states Yet notice how Clinton campaigned in other , less populated states They knew the popular vote was meaningless ahead of the election However , the popular vote is useful as a barometer for voter fraud since the most populous countries are also the most susceptible to election tampering by illegal , invalid and dead voters",false
"The State Department asked all secretaries of state to send their emails over Hillary Clinton 's the only one who 's done it Charles Schumer on Sunday , March 8th , 2015 in comments on CBS' Face the Nation Fact checking Chuck Schumer 's defense of Hillary Clinton 's private emailBy Steve Contorno on Sunday , March 8th , 2015 at 6 13 p m Hillary Clinton continues to face criticism for using a private email during her time as Secretary of State Former Secretary of State Hillary Clinton did n't appear on the Sunday political talk shows to explain her use of a private email account to conduct State Department business But Democrats were out in force to defend her as proxies For example , Sen Chuck Schumer , D N Y , appeared March 8 on CBS' Face the Nation to throw cold water on accusations of wrongdoing on the part of Clinton The State Department asked all secretaries of state to send their emails over , and she 's the only one who 's done it , Schumer said We decided to dig into Schumer 's claim Spokesman Matt House said Schumer was referring to an October 2014 letter from the State Department to former secretaries of states The letter has not been publicly published but its contents were outlined by State Department spokeswoman Marie Harf to the media last week Harf said the letter was part of a routine effort to update record preservation and asked former secretaries to turn over emails containing state work conducted on personal accounts A couple months after the request , Clinton turned over 55 , 000 pages of emails and documents from a personal email account created on a self operated server , according to the New York Times and the State Department Clinton has since requested \( via Twitter \) for those emails to be released It 's not as though the letter went out to living secretaries of state dating back to Henry Kissinger While it may be hard to remember a time before email , only four former secretaries have held the job during the prominence of electronic communications Clinton , Condoleezza Rice , Colin Powell and Madeleine Albright As it is , the State Department query was limited to just those four individuals Two of those individuals have n't provided personal emails for good reason They did n't use email much during their time at the State Department According to MSNBC , an aide for Albright said she did not use email while she was in office from 1997 to 2001 Similarly , Rice , head of the State Department from 2005 to 2009 , was not a habitual emailer either , according to multiple reports As Harf noted in a State Department briefing , Secretary Rice has repeatedly said that she did not regularly use email , and a spokesperson for Rice told ABC , She did not use personal email for official communication as secretary Essentially , two of the four former officials contacted did n't turn any emails over because they did n't have any to turn over That 's pretty important context And what about Powell , who served as Secretary of State during President George W Bush 's first term \? Powell appeared on ABC 's This Week to answers those questions Apparently , Powell ca n't turn over any documents Why \? Because he does n't have them anymore I retained none of those e mails and we are working with the State Department to see if there 's anything else they want to discuss with me about those emails , he said I did not keep a cache of them I did not print them off , he added I do not have thousands of pages somewhere in my personal files Harf acknowledged in a March 4 briefing that Powell 's account has been closed for a number of years , and said , He 's looking to see if there 's anything responsive he still has You can draw your own conclusions about Powell not saving official emails from a 10 year old account , and the relevance of that revelation to the Clinton controversy Powell said most of his important correspondence would have been archived already , since they were sent to staff who had State Department accounts But it does shed light on why Powell did n't provide emails to the State Department , and it also demonstrates that he has taken steps to comply with the request , even if only recently So to recap The State Department reached out to four former secretaries asking about personal email accounts Two have said they rarely used email , the third used personal email but had no records to turn over and the fourth was Clinton That makes Schumer 's defense fairly hollow when you think about it Clinton may have been the only person to provide emails , but realistically , that 's from a potential pool of two people We took all this back to Schumer 's spokesman House He stood by the comment There is another person \( Powell \) who specifically said he had emailed in a way that would be relevant to their request , but did not keep records so would n't be able to comply , House said So she 's the only one to do what State is asking Our rulingSchumer said , The State Department asked all secretaries of state to send their emails over , and \( Clinton is \) the only one who 's done it That statement is much more grandiose than the reality of the situation The State Department asked four former secretaries of state for any official business conducted on personal emails Two of those individuals , Albright and Rice , rarely used email at all while in office , let alone on a personal account The other , Powell , has said his personal emails no longer exist , but said he is working with the State Department to recover them , if possible The statement contains some element of truth but ignores critical facts that would give a different impression We rate it Mostly False Correction Clinton turned over 55 , 000 pages and documents from her private email account A previous version of this fact check described the number incorrectly Advertisement",false

"Boston Marathon Bomber Tsarnaev Severely Injured In Prison , May Never Walk Or Talk AgainPosted on Like 0FORT DEVENS , Massachusetts Infamous Boston Marathon bombing suspect Dzhokhar Tsarnaev , 22 , was the victim of an unfortunate accident yesterday at Ft Devens Detention Center in Massachusetts , just a few short months after his high profile trial and sentencing , according to warden Paul Jacobson Corrections officers reportedly found the terror suspect face down in a pool of his own blood in his cell a banana peel was found on the floor nearby It initially appeared as though Tsarnaev slipped on a discarded banana peel and hit the floor with such force that his head bounced off the hard tile surface , probably 16 or 17 times There was blood everywhere all over the walls , the floor , even the toilet The injuries have caused massive brain trauma , said prison investigator Joe Goldsmith We determined though , through expert analysis , that it would be impossible for these injuries to have occurred through a fall Our investigation has shown that that it was the Aryan Brotherhood who initiated an attack on Tsarnaev Yes , it was the brotherhood who took care of that bomber , said Miles Smith , head of the Aryan Nation inside Devens The other gangs , they wanted him , too We paid the guards the most money to have a shot They stood aside , and let us do what we do On the way out , they shook our hands , told us Thank you ' Well , You 're welcome You 're welcome , Boston You 're welcome , America ! Normally , an attack this violent , this cruel , on another inmate would get any offending party more time added to their sentence , said warden Jacobson Because of the nature of Tsarnaev 's crimes , though , we have decided to actually reduce the sentences of the Aryan members who were involved They have done our prison and our country a great service , and we appreciate it immensely They are heroes in the eyes of not only this institution , but also in the eyes of the people of the Commonwealth of Massachusetts Tsarnaev had pled not guilty to all thirty charges filed against him , but was found guilty on all counts in April He was sentenced to the death penalty per the crimes committed",false
"b'Mississippi Republicans are taking a shoot first , ask questions later approach to preventing potential church violence with a bill that amounts to legalizing religious security squads tasked with killing perceived threats This week , the states Republican led senate passed the so called Mississippi Church Protection Act which would militarize the states churches while also walking back gun regulations and stripping away oversight The bill would allow churches to create security programs and designate and train members to carry concealed weapons It would provide criminal and legal protections to those serving as church security The bill also would allow concealed carry in a holster without a permit in Mississippi , expanding a measure passed last year that allowed concealed carry without a permit in a purse , satchel or briefcase , and another recent law that allows open carry in public The bill also seeks to prohibit Mississippi officials from enforcing any federal agency regulations or executive orders that would violate the state constitution an attempt to federal gun restrictions not passed by Congress Mississippi church goers will now get to assign church members as security which can carry concealed weapons without permits and are protected from legal liability if their actions result in death based on a designation of justifiable homicide the same legal standing that we afford police officers on duty pourmecoffee It passed pic twitter com H8WvOdHFA4 pourmecoffee \( pourmecoffee \) March 30 , 2016What could go wrong \?

"TV 's Gupta Is Obama 's Pick for Surgeon GeneralVideoBy Ceci Connolly and Howard KurtzWashington Post Staff WritersWednesday , January 7 , 2009America 's most famous television surgeon , Sanjay Gupta , is poised to take his black bag and microphone to the White House as President elect Barack Obama 's choice for U S surgeon general A neurosurgeon who is also a correspondent for CNN and CBS , Gupta was chosen as much for his broadcasting skills as for his medical r sum , suggesting that the incoming administration values visible advisers who can drive a public message He has also been offered a top post in the new White House Office of Health Reform , twin duties that could make him the most influential surgeon general in history A practicing physician and one of People magazine 's Sexiest Men Alive , Gupta met for more than two hours with Obama in Chicago on Nov 25 , according to two sources with knowledge of the talks Gupta , 39 , later spoke with several Obama advisers , including Thomas A Daschle , who will run the new White House policy office and the Department of Health and Human Services The globetrotting doctor has told Obama aides he wants the job , which involves overseeing the 6 , 000 member Commissioned Corps of the U S Public Health Service When reached yesterday , Gupta did not deny that he plans to accept the offer but declined to comment Transition officials refused to speak on the record about his selection , but several Obama allies praised Gupta as the sort of highly visible , articulate physician who might restore the luster that the position of the nation 's doctor had in the person of Reagan appointee C Everett Koop and some of his predecessors A representative of the Commissioned Corps , however , said Gupta will face a credibility gap because he has never served in the uniformed Public Health Service I am unaware of any public health experience or qualifications he has to be the leader of the nation 's public health service , said Gerard M Farrell , executive director of the service 's Commissioned Officers Association This would be akin to appointing the Army chief of staff from the city council of Hoboken , N J The selection of Gupta represents a return to a communicator model , said Susan Blumenthal , who retired as an assistant surgeon general two years ago after 20 years in the Public Health Service If he is confirmed by the Senate , Gupta would provide the administration with a skilled television personality to help market what is planned to be a massive reorganization of the U S health system The Obama team already has initiated a public relations campaign aimed at mobilizing grass roots support for eventual health reform legislation Last week , Daschle appeared at town hall style meetings in Indiana and Washington to solicit public input The sessions , captured on video and posted on the transition Web site , were among more than 8 , 500 local gatherings held over the holidays Gupta is a great voice to get the public engaged in the discussion over health care reform , said Kenneth Thorpe , a former Clinton administration official who has become friendly with Gupta as a colleague at Emory University in Atlanta Gupta , the son of Indian parents , has long been drawn to policymaking He was a White House fellow in the late 1990s , writing speeches and crafting policy for then first lady Hillary Rodham Clinton He is currently associate chief of neurosurgery at Grady Memorial Hospital , Atlanta 's busy downtown hospital CONTINUED 1",true
"Reena Rose Sibayan The Jersey JournalPeople waited recently for several hours for the computers at the Motor Vehicle Commission in Jersey City to be fixed By Kevin OToole As a member of the state Senate Budget and Appropriations Committee , I recently participated in a hearing about recent problems at some Motor Vehicle Commission \( MVC \) offices in our area Specifically , these problems include long wait times and customers being turned away due to computer problems The public hearing proved itself to be nothing more than naked political theater by the Democratic members of the committee and a brazen election year stunt The problems with MVC service are almost entirely caused by an outdated computer system that is 30 years old The technology was placed in service back when drivers licenses were little more than laminated pieces of paper , not the secure documents that we rely on today to prevent identity theft , crime and terrorism Since the beginning of the Christie administration , the MVC has made great strides in serving its customers It has placed a greater emphasis on moving critical technology projects forward to better position the commission for the future We have finally restarted much needed upgrades that were put on hold during the Codey and Corzine administrations Year after year , during budget hearings , those of us who serve on the budget committees were told about major MVC technology investments , such as the Motor Vehicle Automated Transaction System \( MATRX \) and the Enhanced Digital Driver License \( EDDL \) , which were planned to improve customer service and make the MVC computers more reliable The proposed introduction of an extended six year license , along with plans to implement online license renewals , were meant to be positive changes for New Jersey drivers Those changes would make renewing easier and would reduce customer volume spikes and long lines at MVC offices In reality , projections about the effects of a six year license were off , implementation of the new digital driver license was greatly delayed and customer volume spikes and long lines exist to this day Had the EDDL project moved forward within the planned time frame under previous administrations , a contract would have been awarded in August 2008 Under this timeline , online renewals would have been in place by late 2009 , and the delays caused by the outdated , unreliable technology would not continue to occur While previous governors never made improving customer service at the MVC a priority , the Christie administration has been proactive in addressing short term MVC needs while it works to complete its long term technological improvements MVC office hours have been increased 20 percent to 54 5 hours per week more hours than ever before and include the restoration of service on Mondays Additional staff is being added at high volume MVC offices to speed up transactions , and additional cameras that are needed to issue drivers licenses are being installed , as well And to ensure that customers are not left waiting in line exposed to the elements , MVC office space is being rearranged to shelter more customers comfortably indoors while they are waiting to be served These changes will yield near immediate results in improving the customer experience at MVC offices and are the best short term options available to remedy a bad situation left by previous governors and Motor Vehicle commissioners But they are just that short term solutions The key to modernizing the MVC and solving its problems in the long term lies in updated technology Gov Christie is fixing the problems left by other governors who failed to bring the MVCs computer technology up to modern standards The dramatic change at the MVC is not just about this administrations push to introduce new technology , but also a number of other positive steps designed to better serve its customers From instituting the greatest number of agency service hours in motor vehicle history and the opening of state of the art facilities on state owned land to installing more camera equipment and increasing staffing levels at our states busiest agencies , under Gov Christies leadership , the MVC is doing whats necessary to fulfill the needs of New Jersey drivers After all of the upgrades are completed and more services are online , the wait times at the MVC will drop significantly In fact , most drivers will have to visit the MVC only once every eight years a welcome change from the current situation I would have hoped that my colleagues in the Legislature who noted concerns about the MVC would have shown greater interest over the last several years when essential technology projects were languishing under previous administrations Updating the technological capabilities of the MVC is of critical importance and should not be used for political gain As we near the 10th anniversary of the 9 11 terrorist attacks , we should not forget that some of the hijackers used New Jersey drivers licenses to board those aircraft Efforts like these to make the state drivers license more secure and the MVC more efficient will go a long way toward making drivers happier and New Jersey safer Kevin OToole , a Republican , represents the 40th District in the New Jersey Senate , where he is a member of its budget and

"Vice President Joseph R Biden Jr created a stir Tuesday at a campaign speech in Virginia when he told the crowd that Mitt Romney 's policies would enable the banking and financial sectors to put you all back in chains The remark came roughly two thirds of the way through Mr Biden 's 30 minute speech , which was delivered to a crowd that included many African Americans at the Institute for Advanced Learning and Research in Danville , Va Romney wants to let the he said in the first hundred days , he 's going to let the big banks once again write their own rules , unchain Wall Street , Mr Biden said They 're going to put you all back in chains On a C Span video of the speech , the audience does not appear to react negatively to Mr Biden 's phrasing indeed , laughter can be heard among the crowd President Obama and his surrogates have been campaigning heavily in Virginia , and the campaign 's strategy relies in part on energizing the black vote to take the traditionally Republican state , which moved to the Democratic column in the 2008 presidential election According to the Census , the population of Danville is roughly 48 8 percent white and 48 6 percent black After Mr Biden 's address , some Republicans assailed Mr Biden 's remark On Twitter , Ari Fleischer , a former press secretary for President George W Bush , likened the comment to one made by Sarah Palin when she compared critical press coverage to blood libel , a term alluding to the false allegation that Jews once killed Christian children to use their blood for religious rituals The press pounded Palin when she talked about blood libel , ' Mr Fleischer wrote What will they do about Biden 's chains' remark \? Later Tuesday , both presidential campaigns responded to the vice president 's remarks , with Mr Romney 's campaign calling the phrasing not acceptable After weeks of slanderous and baseless accusations leveled against Governor Romney , the Obama campaign has reached a new low , Andrea Saul , Mr Romney 's press secretary , said in a statement The comments made by the vice president of the United States are not acceptable in our political discourse and demonstrate yet again that the Obama campaign will say and do anything to win this election President Obama should tell the American people whether he agrees with Joe Biden 's comments In a statement , Stephanie Cutter , Mr Obama 's deputy campaign manager , defended Mr Biden For months , Speaker Boehner , Congressman Ryan and other Republicans have called for the unshackling' of the private sector from regulations that protect Americans from risky financial deals and other reckless behavior that crashed our economy Since then , the vice president has often used a similar metaphor to describe the need to unshackle' the middle class Today 's comments were a derivative of those remarks , describing the devastating impact letting Wall Street write its own rules again would have on middle class families We find the Romney campaign 's outrage over the vice president 's comments today hypocritical , particularly in light of their own candidate 's stump speech questioning the president 's patriotism Now , let 's return to that substantive' debate Mitt Romney and Paul Ryan promised 72 hours ago , but quickly abandoned As he concluded his speech , Mr Biden confused North Carolina with Virginia , where Danville is located With you we can win North Carolina again , and if we do , we win the election if we win you , Mr Biden said The city of Danville abuts the northern border of North Carolina , which also went for Mr Obama in 2008 but is considered a more challenging state for his campaign this time around At a second appearance on Tuesday , in Wytheville , Va , Mr Biden said his remarks had merely alluded to a term used previously by Republicans , including Mr Romney 's running mate , Representative Paul D Ryan In his response to Mr Obama 's State of the Union address in 2011 , Mr Ryan said , We believe a renewed commitment to limited government will unshackle our economy and create millions of new jobs and opportunities for all people , of every background , to succeed and prosper And I'm told that when I made that comment earlier today in Danville , Va , the Romney campaign put out a tweet , Mr Biden told the crowd in Wytheville You know , tweets these days \? Put out a tweet , went on the airwaves saying , Biden , he 's outrageous in saying that , ' I think I said instead of unshackled , ' unchained ' Outrageous to say that ' That 's what we had I'm using their own words I got a message for them , Mr Biden continued If you want to know what 's outrageous , it 's their policies and the effects of their policies on middle class America That 's what 's outrageous Mr Romney addressed Mr Biden 's original remark in a speech Tuesday evening in Chillicothe , Ohio , calling it an indicator that Mr Obama 's presidency had become angry and desperate , according to The Associated Press",true

"RECOGNIZE OUR CONSTITUTIONAL RIGHT TO OPEN CARRY FIREARMS AT THE REPUBLICAN NATIONAL CONVENTION AT THE QUICKEN LOANS ARENA IN JULY 2016 SUMMARY In July of 2016 , the GOP will host its convention at the Quicken Loans Arena in Cleveland , Ohio Though Ohio is an open carry state , which allows for the open carry of guns , the hosting venue the Quicken Loans Arena strictly forbids the carry of firearms on their premises According to the policy on their website , firearms and other weapons of any kind are strictly forbidden on the premises of Quicken Loans Arena This is a direct affront to the Second Amendment and puts all attendees at risk As the National Rifle Association has made clear , gun free zones such as the Quicken Loans Arena are the worst and most dangerous of all lies The NRA , our leading defender of gun rights , has also correctly pointed out that gun free zones tell every insane killer in America \( the \) safest place to inflict maximum mayhem with minimum risk \( March 4 , 2016 and Dec 21 , 2012 \) Cleveland , Ohio is consistently ranked as one of the top ten most dangerous cities in America By forcing attendees to leave their firearms at home , the RNC and Quicken Loans Arena are putting tens of thousands of people at risk both inside and outside of the convention site This does n't even begin to factor in the possibility of an ISIS terrorist attack on the arena during the convention Without the right to protect themselves , those at the Quicken Loans Arena will be sitting ducks , utterly helpless against evil doers , criminals or others who wish to threaten the American way of life All three remaining Republican candidates have spoken out on the issue and are unified in their opposition to Barack HUSSEIN Obama 's gun free zones Donald Trump said I will get rid of gun free zones on schools you have and on military bases on my first day It gets signed my first day you know what a gun free zone is to a sicko \?

"43rd Governor of the State of Florida Jeb2016 comFeb 5 , 2016I Will Preserve and Protect Social Security and MedicareAfter seven years of failed leadership from President Obama , our nation is now more than 19 trillion in debt Even after increasing taxes by nearly 2 trillion , Barack Obama will somehow manage to add more than 8 trillion to the national debt , which is more debt than the 43 presidents who held office before him compiled together As a result of the reckless spending in Washington , a child born today like my new grandson , Jack , comes into the world with nearly 60 , 000 of debt on his or her back The next president of the United States must tackle the spending and debt crisis , and leadership starts with being honest with the American people In 1965 , health care programs and Social Security spending consumed less than a sixth of Washington 's budget Today , they consume almost half of federal spending and are crowding out investments in national defense , roads and bridges , law enforcement and other national priorities The retirement of the baby boom generation and the aging of America is exacerbating the problem Consider that in 1950 , there were 16 workers paying taxes into Social Security for every senior collecting benefits Today the ratio is 3 to 1 and it will fall to 2 to 1 in a few short years The status quo is n't sustainable , and unless the next president and Congress , honestly address entitlement reform , today 's seniors and future retirees could face massive benefit cuts of as much as 25 percent I believe we should act now rather than inflict this level of pain on seniors Of all the candidates running for president , I have put forward the most detailed plans to preserve and protect Social Security and Medicare As the former governor of Florida , the state with one of the largest senior populations in the country , I understand and respect how important Social Security and Medicare are to ensuring a comfortable retirement for the American people I would never do anything to weaken these programs or break the promise that has been made to workers who pay into Social Security and Medicare The reform plan I have released would extend the solvency of the Social Security trust fund for 75 years , ensuring that today 's seniors and the next generation of retirees are protected Given the fact that we are living longer and healthier lives , it is only prudent that we increase the retirement age in a responsible way Today 's seniors and those close to retiring would receive no change in the eligibility age for Social Security But for younger people , we need to gradually increase the retirement age from 67 to 70 I also believe that we should make it easier for seniors who want to continue to work to do so My plan would eliminate the payroll tax on seniors at age 67 to encourage more people to continue participating in the workforce I would also reform the benefit structure to ensure that the minimum Social Security benefit is set at 150 percent of the poverty line Today , the minimum benefit falls below the poverty threshold This is wrong and I am committed to providing low income seniors with a level of benefits that ensures they can live a life of dignity in retirement I would pay for this reform and extend the solvency of the Social Security trust fund by means testing benefits for wealthy seniors who have ample personal retirement savings Regarding Medicare , I believe the best way to reform the system is to open it up to more competition If seniors want to continue participating in traditional Medicare that option should be preserved for them , but we should also give seniors the right to choose from a menu of high quality private plans that may offer benefit packages that are more attractive As a conservative , I believe deeply in the power of competition to deliver positive change I have seen it time and again in my 32 years in the private sector , and I know it will work for Medicare as well Finally , to better shore up Medicare 's finances , I would also apply greater means testing for wealthier seniors Liberals like Hillary Clinton are not being honest with the American people about the impending crisis in Social Security and Medicare They want the American people to believe that doing nothing is a viable option To ensure that seniors and future retirees can receive Social Security and Medicare benefits that provide them with peace of mind during their retirement years , we must be bold and courageous and tell the truth to the American people My plan does that and when I am president of the United States I will work to bring Republicans and Democrats together around solutions that preserve and protect Social Security and Medicare",true

"TOPBy Wayne LaPierreBefore I tell you how the NRA and our members are going to Stand And Fight politically and in the courts , let 's acknowledge that all over this country , tens of millions of Americans are already preparing to Stand And Fight to protect their families and homes These good Americans are prudently getting ready to protect themselves It has always been sensible for good citizens to own and carry firearms for lawful protection against violent criminals who prey on decent people During the second Obama term , however , additional threats are growing Latin American drug gangs have invaded every city of significant size in the United States Phoenix is already one of the kidnapping capitals of the world , and though the states on the U S Mexico border may be the first places in the nation to suffer from cartel violence , by no means are they the last The president flagrantly defies the 2006 federal law ordering the construction of a secure border fence along the entire Mexican border So the border today remains porous not only to people seeking jobs in the U S , but to criminals whose jobs are murder , rape , robbery and kidnapping Ominously , the border also remains open to agents of al Qaeda and other terrorist organizations Numerous intelligence sources have confirmed that foreign terrorists have identified the southern U S border as their path of entry into the country When the next terrorist attack comes , the Obama administration wo n't accept responsibility Instead , it will do what it does every time blame a scapegoat and count on Obama 's mainstream media enablers to go along A heinous act of mass murder either by terrorists or by some psychotic who should have been locked up long ago will be the pretext to unleash a tsunami of gun control No wonder Americans are buying guns in record numbers right now , while they still can and before their choice about which firearm is right for their family is taken away forever After Hurricane Sandy , we saw the hellish world that the gun prohibitionists see as their utopia Looters ran wild in south Brooklyn There was no food , water or electricity And if you wanted to walk several miles to get supplies , you better get back before dark , or you might not get home at all Anti gun New York City Mayor Michael Bloomberg had already done everything he could to prevent law abiding New Yorkers from owning guns , and he has made sure that no ordinary citizen will ever be allowed to carry a gun He even refused to allow the National Guard into the city to restore civil order because Guardsmen carry guns ! Meanwhile , President Obama is leading this country to financial ruin , borrowing over a trillion dollars a year for phony stimulus spending and other payoffs for his political cronies Nobody knows if or when the fiscal collapse will come , but if the country is broke , there likely wo n't be enough money to pay for police protection And the American people know it Hurricanes Tornadoes Riots Terrorists Gangs Lone criminals These are perils we are sure to face not just maybe It 's not paranoia to buy a gun It 's survival It 's responsible behavior , and it 's time we encourage law abiding Americans to do just that Since the election , millions of Americans have been lining up in front of gun stores , Cabela 's and Bass Pro Shops exercising their freedom while they still have it They are demonstrating they have a mass determination to buy , own and use firearms Millions of Americans are using market forces like never before to demonstrate their ardent support for our firearm freedoms That 's one of the very best ways we can Stand And Fight Inevitably , the anti gun media and the gun ban lobbies are demonizing the purchase of firearms They call us extremists because we wonder whether we will be able to buy a semi auto in three years or , even in some states , later this year That 's despite the fact that President Obama long ago made clear that he wants to ban them all ! The media try to make rank and file Americans feel guilty about buying a gun The enemies of freedom demonize gun buyers and portray us as social lepers But we know the truth We know that responsible gun ownership exemplifies what is good and right about America Responsible Americans realize that the world as we know it has changed We , the American people , clearly see the daunting forces we will undoubtedly face terrorists , crime , drug gangs , the possibility of Euro style debt riots , civil unrest or natural disaster Gun owners are not buying firearms because they anticipate a confrontation with the government Rather , we anticipate confrontations where the government is n't there or simply does n't show up in time To preserve the inalienable , individual human right to keep and bear arms to withstand the siege that is coming the NRA is building a four year communications and resistance movement The enemies of the Second Amendment will be met with unprecedented defiance , commitment and determination We will Stand And Fight First , we are going to devise legal capability like never before I fervently hope that President Obama does not get to appoint another anti gun Supreme Court justice like Sonia Sotomayor or Elena Kagan But he probably will , and we must meet that challenge His chances of appointing a replacement for one of the five pro rights justices in the 5 4 Heller and McDonald majorities are high And there 's no doubt he is going to appoint a huge number of new judges to lifetime positions in the lower federal courts YOUR GUN RIGHTS ARE UNDER CONSTANT ATTACK !

"By Christopher Ingraham By Christopher Ingraham Email the author October 14 , 2015 Email the author Follow cingrahamThis week a 2 year old in South Carolina found a gun in the back seat of the car he was riding in and accidentally shot his grandmother , who was sitting in the passenger seat This type of thing happens from time to time A little kid finds a gun , fires it , and hurts or kills himself or someone else These cases rarely bubble up to the national level except when someone , like a parent , ends up dead But cases like this happen a lot more frequently than you might think After spending a few hours sifting through news reports , I 've found at least 43 instances this year of somebody being shot by a toddler 3 or younger In 31 of those 43 cases , a toddler found a gun and shot himself or herself In August , for instance , a 21 month old in the St Louis area found a loaded handgun at his grandmother 's house and shot himself in the torso His mother took him to a local hospital , where he was pronounced dead Earlier in the year a Michigan 3 year old found a loaded 40 caliber handgun in a closet while his dad and brother were outside He shot himself in the head and died before rescue workers arrived This is what one year of gun deaths in America looks like The stories go on and on like this Roughly once a week this year , on average , a small child has found a gun , pointed it at himself or someone else , and pulled the trigger Boys are disproportionately likely to do this I could find only three cases where a girl under the age of 4 wounded someone with a gun In 13 of the 43 total incidents , a child 's self inflicted injuries were fatal In two other cases , another person died after being shot by a toddler a father in Alabama , and a 1 year old in Ohio In one instance , a 3 year old managed to wound both of his parents with a single gunshot at an Albuquerque motel Shootings by toddlers have happened in 24 states so far this year Missouri has seen the most , with five separate incidents Florida has had four Texas , three Due to the low number of total cases and the isolated nature of these incidents I 'd caution against drawing broad conclusions from the map above But it is worth noting that the shootings do n't necessarily follow broader population trends California , the most populous state in the nation , has n't had any Nobody has been shot by a toddler in New England or the Upper Midwest These numbers are probably an undercount There are likely instances of toddlers shooting people that result in minor injuries and no media coverage And there are probably many more cases where a little kid inadvertently shoots a gun and does n't hit anyone , resulting in little more than a scared kid and \( hopefully \) chastened parents Notably , these numbers do n't include cases where toddlers are shot , intentionally or otherwise , by older children or adults Dozens of preschoolers are killed in acts of homicide each year , according to the Centers for Disease Control and Prevention But I have n't included those figures here How often do children in the U S unintentionally shoot and kill people \? We do n't know These cases are invariably referred to as accidents in media reports But as Everytown for Gun Safety , a group that advocates for stricter gun laws , argues , many incidents like this are preventable In a study of accidental shootings by children of all ages \( not just toddlers \) , they estimate that more than two thirds of these tragedies could be avoided if gun owners stored their guns responsibly and prevented children from accessing them There are policy and technical responses to preventable childhood gun deaths as well States and localities could require guns to be locked up at home , a policy supported by 67 percent of Americans Various types of smart gun technology , which prevent anyone other than their owners from firing a given gun , exist as well But gun lock requirements and smart guns have been vehemently opposed by the National Rifle Association and its allies Instead , the NRA continues to promote a response that seeks to solve gun problems with more guns , and aims to broaden the saturation of firearms in nearly every sphere of public and private life , from homes to schools to churches to bars to airports and beyond In a country with more guns than people , it 's only natural that a certain number of small children are going get their hands on an unsecured firearm , with tragic consequences Guns in America For every criminal killed in self defense , 34 innocent people die Depending on where you stand on gun policy , you may feel that 13 dead toddlers in 10 months is too many Or , you might reason that stuff happens , and that this is part of the price we must pay to protect our gun rights I 've included my tally of toddler shootings below News sources are linked in the City column Know of any this year that I missed \?

"By Michael Learmonth learmonth On03 04 15 AT 2 28 PMGeorge R R Martin teased that some of the characters still alive in the books will die in Game of Thrones Season 5 Photo Facebook Game of ThronesHBO is in talks with Apple to make Apple TV a launch partner for its highly anticipated streaming service when it debuts next month HBO and streaming partner Major League Baseball Advanced Media are working to have the standalone service , called HBO Now , ready to launch in April in conjunction with the premiere of the fifth season of Game of Thrones , according to sources familiar with the plan When it launches , consumers will be able to subscribe to HBO Now directly from HBO for the first time , rather than through a cable , satellite or telco TV distributor such as Comcast or Verizon The retail price is expected to be 15 a month when purchased directly from HBO , or about what consumers pay when they order HBO through their cable , satellite or telco provider HBO 's corporate parent , Time Warner Inc , will rely on a whole new line of distributors \( e g , Apple TV , Roku , Xbox , PlayStation , Amazon , etc \) to help market HBO Now to an estimated 10 million U S broadband subscribers who do not pay for a cable TV bundle CEO Jeff Bewkes has said the offering could also help reach some of the 70 million cable TV subscribers who do not subscribe to HBO but might if given the opportunity to subscribe online HBO 's over the top service has been cast as the biggest challenge yet to the so called cable bundle , in which consumers are required to buy packages of channels , some of which they may never watch One study claimed the service would lead to a 7 percent drop in pay TV subscriptions , as users opt out of cable and opt in to HBO Now Some cable providers , however , such as Cablevision and Cox Communications , have expressed interest in bundling HBO Now with broadband for their own subscribers who do n't get cable TV Apple has been most aggressive in courting HBO in a bid to add the service to Apple TV , sources say Apple TV already carries HBO Go for current HBO subscribers , but it may add a second app for HBO Now Apple has spent the past several years negotiating for the rights to offer its own linear TV package in the meantime , HBO Now is seen as an added service to drive adoption of Apple TV While HBO has not confirmed a launch date for HBO Now , internally the target is an April launch , in time for the April 12 debut of Game of Thrones That 's an aggressive time frame for Major League Baseball Advanced Media , which is building the back end along with a new front end separate from HBO Go HBO is taking care not to launch HBO Now before it can guarantee that the service will work without some of the technical glitches that plagued HBO Go during last year 's debut of cult fave Game of Thrones The launch of HBO Now will be a milestone for Time Warner 's premium TV channel , which has for most of its 42 year history been distributed as an add on to a package of cable channels The Web service will allow HBO to sign on a new group of distribution partners , which it sees as no different than when it added satellite TV and , later , telcos such as Verizon and AT T Each of those distributors pays a wholesale price for HBO and then resells it to consumers for anywhere from 13 to 18 a month Most see HBO as a retention device those who subscribe are less likely to drop service or switch providers HBO and Time Warner declined to comment At 15 a month , HBO Now will be significantly more expensive than Netflix , which ranges from 8 to 12 a month for various levels of service , but cheaper than some were predicting HBO makes the case that it has more original programming than Netflix and a better , more current film library It 's a premium product , and it will be priced accordingly , HBO CEO Richard Plepler said during a Time Warner earnings call in February HBO 's push to launch HBO Now comes after years of talking about launching an over the top service that bypasses traditional cable TV Understandably , it has been met with some resistance from current distributors , including Time Warner Cable and Comcast , two companies in the midst of a 46 billion merger , according to sources HBO , of course , heard the same misgivings from cable companies when it first added satellite TV providers and then telcos as distributors HBO 's strategy is to give early partners a pricing advantage over newer ones it 's unclear how this will go over with Apple , which has a track record of

"Medicaid funding casts shadow over New Yorkers amid DC political dramaSaturdayJul 15 , 2017 at 7 41 PM Jul 15 , 2017 at 7 41 PMChris McKenna Times Herald Record ChrisMcKenna845One of the biggest things at stake for New Yorkers in the political drama in Washington over the fate of the Affordable Care Act is its impact on funding for Medicaid , a program that now provides health coverage for almost 165 , 000 residents of Orange , Ulster and Sullivan counties more than a quarter of the population Republican proposals to repeal and replace the 2010 law , better known as Obamacare , would affect health care in a multitude of ways It would lift the mandate that Americans have insurance , change the subsidies that help some pay for it , and cause the number of people with coverage to plunge by as much as 23 million over the next decade , according to the Congressional Budget Office But the aspects that have generated the most political friction , and that might affect the most people , in New York are those dealing with Medicaid The government insurance program expanded its reach under the Affordable Care Act and now covers nearly one in three New Yorkers Pending bills in Congress would cut or cap New York 's Medicaid funding in four separate ways Jason Helgerson , the state 's Medicaid director , told the Times Herald Record last week that he estimates those changes , once fully phased in , could cost the state as much as 8 billion or 9 billion a year , for a program that costs 65 5 billion this year The result is a sharp debate over Medicaid 's role and cost and the effect that Trumpcare would have on its beneficiaries and on hospitals in New York Helgerson argues the cuts would reverse coverage gains New York has made and have a devastating effect on upstate hospitals and the local economies they support Medicaid is the biggest payer of health care services in New York , he said , arguing that reducing that funding would force hospitals to lay off employees or even close In rural areas where those operations are the largest employers , the impact could trigger a ripple effect on the economy , Helgerson said Rep John Faso , the Republican freshman whose district includes Ulster and Sullivan counties , has been prominent in the debate because of a bill amendment he sponsored that would force New York to stop requiring its counties outside New York City to shoulder part of the Medicaid expenses He argues that the federal government must slow Medicaid 's spending growth because the current pace is not sustainable , and that New York would adjust to the changes without the dire consequences that Gov Andrew Cuomo and other critics predict But he also suggests the Medicaid program itself has grown beyond its original purpose and now covers more people than it should We now have about one third of New York 's population on Medicaid , Faso said Some people in Albany may look upon that as an accomplishment I look upon that as a failure Local impactFrom Warwick to Woodstock , from Newburgh to Callicoon , households and a variety of institutions rely on Medicaid to pay for costly services It pays for child births and dental care and diabetes drugs in densely populated areas where poverty is concentrated , places like Newburgh and Kiryas Joel , but also in largely rural areas like Sullivan County , where one in three residents is enrolled in Medicaid It pays for services for people with disabilities , such as children with autism at the Center for Spectrum Services in Kingston and Ellenville It is a primary funding source for the elderly and infirm living in 21 nursing homes with 3 , 100 total beds in Orange , Ulster and Sullivan counties It pays for addiction treatment in the midst of a national heroin and prescription pill epidemic Frank Petrucci , a 28 year old Warwick resident who suffers from a rare , debilitating disease , relies on Medicaid to pay the 50 , 000 bill each time he goes to the hospital for an intravenous drug treatment to prevent his condition from getting worse , at intervals of six weeks or two months Without those treatments , the disease is likely to progress and make him more and more incapacitated , taking away his ability to take care of himself , drive and work part time A national rower before his ailment set in , Petrucci coaches several times a week at the East Arm Rowing Club in Greenwood Lake Whether and how a reduction in Medicaid funding would affect his coverage is uncertain Petrucci , who has closely watched the legislative debate as it unfolds in Washington , said he 's covered now because of his low income If the state is forced to curtail eligibility for his income level , could he qualify instead because of his disability \? Would he have to allow his condition to worsen without treatment until he was disabled enough \? Would the wait for disability coverage require him to go even longer without treatment \? If that 's removed , then my world becomes a smaller place , Petrucci said , referring to the loss of mobility he would likely suffer What he knows for sure is that he 's an expensive patient and probably will remain so for many years I'm young , and this disease is most likely a lifelong disease , he said Heated debateThe amendment Faso sponsored with Rep Chris Collins would force the state to absorb the 2 3 billion that 57 counties now spend on Medicaid or else cut that amount from its spending Faso argues that imposing a cost share on New York 's counties when Medicaid began 51 years ago was a bad mistake , one that now helps drive up property taxes and cause residents to leave New York Shifting the counties' expense to Albany is restoring responsibility , he said Faso contends the state could shoulder that responsibility by cutting waste and fraud from Medicaid and other unnecessary state spending He dismissed Cuomo 's contention that the state might recover the lost revenue from its counties in some other manner , saying the Legislature would never approve it It 's time for him to man up and do what 49 other governors have done , Faso said On a broader level , Faso said that increased dependence on Medicaid is not a desirable thing , and that government should be striving to get people into private insurance It was not meant to be an insurance policy for able bodied adults , he said Helgerson counters that at a time when fewer employers give their workers health insurance , Medicaid has helped the state cut its rate of uninsured residents in half , a feat it celebrates without apology Does Congressman Faso want to double the uninsured rate in New York \? he asked Bill Hammond , director of health policy for the Albany based Empire Center for Public Policy , said he sympathizes with Republicans' quest to control Medicaid spending , which he said is growing faster than our ability to pay He also agreed with Faso that New York 's Medicaid program contains a fairly large amount of waste as any public or private insurance program does But he pointed out that cutting Medicaid spending to absorb the county costs would have a double impact , since the state would then lose a dollar for dollar amount in federal funding And he argued that the legislation under debate in Washington would have to offer Medicaid enrollees enough financial support for private insurance to make that a reasonable alternative It 's just unreasonable for them to find a couple thousand dollars a year to buy health insurance , Hammond said Rep Sean Patrick Maloney , the Cold Spring Democrat whose district includes Orange County , argues that Republicans undermined their rationale for cutting Medicaid spending growth as a fiscal necessity by proposing to eliminate two taxes on high income earners in the same legislation Their position would have more integrity , he said , if the savings had been used to balance the budget This whole thing is a scheme to cut taxes for the rich , he said Maloney applauded the drop in New York 's uninsured rate to 4 5 percent from 9 5 percent and said 55 , 000 people in his district alone had gotten coverage through the Medicaid expansion Maybe John Faso thinks too many people have health care , he said I do n't cmckenna th record comChoose the plan that 's right for you Digital access or digital and print delivery",true

"ESPN Suspends Curt Schilling for Comparing Islamists to NazisJared Wickerham Getty Imagesby Ben Shapiro 25 Aug 2015 025 Aug , 201525 Aug , 2015On Tuesday , ESPN suspended former Red Sox pitcher Curt Schilling for tweeting a meme comparing radical Muslims to Nazis Here was the offending tweet Schilling deleted the tweet after blowback ESPN released a statement upon suspending Schilling Curt 's tweet was completely unacceptable , and in no way represents our company 's perspective We made that point very strongly to Curt and have removed him from his current Little League assignment pending further consideration The tweet was offensive to radical Muslims Factually speaking , there were approximately 6 5 million formal members of the Nazi Party in 1940 , out of a total German population of well over 80 million a little over 8 percent That number of members did not fully represent the level of support for the Nazi regime in Germany in 1940 , of course The same is true in the radicalized Muslim community A very small percentage of Muslims globally are formal members of terror groups it is difficult to estimate precise numbers due to secrecy , although their total membership runs into the hundreds of thousands \( the Iranian Revolutionary Guard alone has 120 , 000 members , and some estimates have placed the ISIS membership at above 200 , 00 \) That terrorist membership is the tip of the iceberg as I have written before , a huge percentage of worldwide Muslims are radicalized If you calculate the number of Muslims globally who \( 1 \) believe that 9 11 was not committed by Muslims \( 2 \) think that shariah law ought to be implemented \( 3 \) support terrorist attacks or \( 4 \) have a positive or neutral attitude toward ISIS , Hamas , Hezbollah , Osama Bin Laden or any other terrorist group or terrorist , the number calculates out to well above 800 million radicalized Muslims PolitiFact 's ridiculous attempts to counter these calculations cherry picking their own , far narrower standard of radicalization led them to the awkward position that 19 percent of Muslims in various countries , including the West , are radicalized \( some 182 million Muslims worldwide \) As Schilling wrote , the math is staggering when you get to true numbers But ESPN has no interest in true numbers , because true numbers are awkward Unsurprisingly , ESPN refused to explain why Schilling 's tweet was unacceptable Is it because radicalized Muslims are somehow better than Germans who were n't formal Nazi Party members \? Is it because the genocidal Iranian regime or the barbarians of ISIS are somehow less objectionable than the Nazis themselves \? It is worth noting that Schiling did not say that all Muslims should be tarred with the terrorist brush , any more than all Germans should have been tarred with the Nazi brush The point of his tweet , to anyone with a functioning prefrontal cortex , is obvious a small , brutal percentage of a larger , partially supportive population can do tremendous harm That 's inarguable Fortunately , ESPN does n't have to argue with Schilling or anyone else They simply suspended Schilling , without any real rationale \( by way of comparison , they did not suspend frequent ESPN guest Kevin Blackistone for calling the Star Spangled Banner a war anthem on their airwaves \) And the compliant media breath a sigh of relief , having made the world safer for those offended by tweets and more ignorant of the threat of radical Islam Ben Shapiro is Senior Editor At Large of Breitbart News and The New York Times bestselling author , most recently , of the book , The People vs Barack Obama The Criminal Case Against The Obama Administration \( Threshold Editions , June 10 , 2014 \) Follow Ben Shapiro on Twitter benshapiro Read More Stories About Comment count on this article reflects comments made on Breitbart com and Facebook Visit Breitbart 's Facebook Page BREITBART CONNECT",false

"ShareThis \( Photo Bobby Doherty \) Editor 's Note In the most recent edition of New York , its annual Reasons to Love New York issue , the magazine published this story about a Stuyvesant High School senior named Mohammed Islam , who was rumored to have made 72 million trading stocks Islam said his net worth was in the high eight figures As part of the research process , the magazine sent a fact checker to Stuyvesant , where Islam produced a document that appeared to be a Chase bank statement attesting to an eight figure bank account After the story 's publication , people questioned the 72 million figure in the headline , which was written by editors based on the rumored figure The headline was amended But in an interview with the New York Observer last night , Islam now says his entire story was made up A source close to the Islam family told the Washington Post that the statements were falsified We were duped Our fact checking process was obviously inadequate we take full responsibility and we should have known better New York apologizes to our readers Rumors , on Wall Street , can be powerful A whisper can turn into a current that moves markets , driving a stock price up or sending it tumbling There may be only one other place where gossip holds such sway , and that is high school Late last year , a rumor began circulating at Stuyvesant that a junior named Mohammed Islam had made a fortune in the stock market Not a small fortune , either Seventy two million An unbelievable amount of money for anyone , not least a high school student , but as far as rumors go , this one seemed legit Everyone at Stuy knew that Mohammed , the soft spoken son of Bengali immigrants from Queens and the president of the school 's Investment Club , was basically a genius As the news spread , Mo 's stock went up The school paper profiled him , Business Insider included him on a list of 20 Under 20 , and Mo became a celebrity , as his friend Damir Tulemaganbetov put it on a recent Friday night at Mari Vanna near Union Square A VIP ! Mo , a cherubic senior with a goatee and slight faux hawk , smiled shyly He 's quiet today , said Patrick Trablusi , who was seated with Mo and Damir at a table littered with empty glasses Humble And tired This is our third meeting of the day , Damir said , signaling to the waitress for another round We saw a real estate agent , a lawyer , you Next we 're going to see a hedge fund guy , Patrick said The friends locked eyes and started to giggle He basically wants to give us 150 million , Mo explained , a blush like a sunset creeping over his cheeks The waitress arrived with a tray of green drinks Freshly squeezed apple juice , Damir said , passing them around It 's very good Do you like caviar \? After Mo became a celebrity , things got a little awkward at school \( Are n't you the kid who made all that money \? a teacher asked him \) So he reconnected with kids from his old school , Allen Stevenson One of them introduced him to Patrick , an aspiring financier , who introduced him to Damir at a poker game attended by kids whose parents are , according to Damir , the one percent of the one percent The son of a Kazakh oligarch , Damir is tall , slim , and cocky , like a cigarette wearing a fedora I call the poker game Destiny , ' he said The waitress arrived with a plate Here , have some caviar Over late nights out and dinners at Morimoto , the three hatched a plan to start a hedge fund There are a lot of steps we have to follow through , said Patrick , calling to mind a more serious Chuck Bass But we 're on the right track They plan to launch in June , after Mo turns 18 and can get his broker dealer license Mo 's our maestro , Patrick said He 's going to be earning the big bucks We 're just going to try to fill his needs All three plan to attend college next year , but they 're not concerned about classes getting in the way of their goal A billion dollars ! Damir said By next year ! Mo affirmed the number with a nod But it 's not just about money , he added We want to create a brotherhood Like , all of us who are connected , who are in something together , who have influence , like the Koch brothers Like in Wolf of Wall Street ! Damir interjected And Mo is Jordan Belfort No , but , not like that , Patrick said , blanching slightly Like Belfort , Mo started with penny stocks A cousin showed him how to trade He loved the feeling of risk the way his hand shook making the trade but he swore it off after losing a chunk of the money he 'd made tutoring I did n't have the balls for it , he said He was 9 It was a while before he was ready to try again In the meantime , he became a scholar of modern finance , studying up on hedge fund managers He was particularly enamored of Paul Tudor Jones I had been paralyzed by my loss , Mo said But he was able to go back to it , even after losing thousands of dollars over and over Paul Tudor Jones says , You learn more from your losses than from your gains ' Mo got into trading oil and gold , and his bank account grew Though he is shy about the 72 million number , he confirmed his net worth is in the high eight figures More than enough to rent an apartment in Manhattan though his parents wo n't let him live in it until he turns 18 and acquire a BMW , which he ca n't drive because he does n't yet have a license Thus , it falls to his father to drive him past Tudor Jones 's Greenwich house for inspiration It 's because he is who he is that made me who I am today , Mo said Which is to say a believer in Wall Street A lot of young people do start ups , but I think it 's a bubble Trading and investments will always be there Money will always be rotating Money never sleeps ! Damir added That 's from the Wall Street movie It all comes down to this , Mo continued What makes the world go round \? Money If money is not flowing , if businesses do n't keep going , there 's no innovation , no products , no investments , no growth , no jobs The check arrived for the caviar and apple juice It totaled 400 New York , that 's where the money 's at , Damir shouted , pulling out a credit card This reminded me of an old joke about robbing banks because that 's where the money is Damir grinned My father has a quote , he said It 's really dope You can rob a bank with a gun , but you can rob the whole world with a bank ' Patrick buried his face in his hands At the end of the day , he said , we 're young kids",false
"Beware , China Is Making Rice From Plastic Here 's How To Spot It Katie Mooney 10 19 2016 We may sometimes contemplate the amount of sugar , fat , or cholesterol contained in a food item before consuming it that 's being a smart and healthy consumer Manufacturers must provide a detailed list of ingredients on the side of food packaging , so we can then make the decision for ourselves whether to consume the food product or not We have the right to be informed , right \?

"At some point , perhaps as early as next week , federal agents will sit down with Donald Trump and tell him classified information about the government and our foreign policy efforts For Democrats , this is a point of both anguish and political calculation Senate Minority Leader Harry M Reid has suggested that Trump 's murky ties to foreign interests and general inability to not speak his mind should be reason enough for the people briefing him to simply make things up On the Republican side , there are similar calls to ban Hillary Clinton from being briefed , including by Trump , pointing to her use of a personal email server while she served as secretary of state And here 's the thing If he wanted to , President Obama could deny either or both of them the now traditional briefings The process does n't work the way you might think For one thing , the briefings are not legally mandated They are a courtesy provided by the sitting president , nothing more In an email , historian Michael Beschloss explained that the process began with President Harry Truman In 1952 , as Truman was preparing to leave the White House , he ordered that the CIA brief Dwight Eisenhower and Adlai Stevenson so that they would campaign with greater insight and also know key national security players once elected \( A bigger problem , he notes , for Stevenson , a governor , than Eisenhower , who 'd commanded the Allied invasion of Normandy \) No president has to do it presidents a century ago did n't For another , the briefings are not an ongoing series of updates about everything affecting our foreign policy They are n't as regular or as detailed as the Presidential Daily Brief , for example It 's at most a couple of in person meetings between the candidate , a staffer and representatives of the American intelligence community Lanhee Chen , who worked as the chief policy adviser to Mitt Romney 's 2012 presidential campaign , spoke with The Washington Post by phone on Thursday Chen was the one staffer that attended Mitt Romney 's two briefings four years ago The former secretary of state , senator and first lady is the Democratic nominee for president Wait 1 second to continue The nominee has access to one , maybe two or three briefings upon request , but that 's it , Chen said Because it 's not like you have a ton of time to sit there and get briefed every day anyway The briefings have to take place in SCIFs sensitive compartmented information facilities or secure conferencing facilities that the government has , so it 's not like you can just get the briefing on the campaign bus , he said We had two briefings One was at the federal building in Los Angeles in September , and the second was a few weeks later at a secure facility in the Washington , D C , metro area That was it The number and content of those briefings are negotiated between the campaign and the White House A memorandum of understanding is drafted between the two parties to formalize the agreement , but Chen notes that the process was remarkably easy and cordial particularly given that the administration that was briefing Romney was also in the process of trying to defeat him electorally The briefings themselves Chen described as a sort of presentation followed by a question and answer period It is , as I understand it , the same team of briefers from the intelligence community that prepare the briefing for the candidate as those who do the president 's daily briefing , Chen said But the level of detail as well as the amount of information covered is not the same It is meant to be a background briefing more than anything else The information that 's presented is tailored to what the candidate would like to know as you might expect , there are no handouts It 's worth noting that , while these are the only formal briefings , there was information shared by the federal government with the Romney campaign outside of the scope of national security As Hurricane Sandy approached that fall , Chen said , the campaign was given emergency response information from the Federal Emergency Management Administration and the Department of Homeland Security Businessman Donald Trump officially became the Republican nominee at the party 's convention in Cleveland Wait 1 second to continue In order to participate in the briefings , Chen had to complete paperwork to grant him top secret security clearance , which he held through the end of the campaign Romney did n't , Chen said The assumption is that a certain amount of sensitive information can be shared with the nominee because the nominee has been publicly vetted , Chen said Both GOP vice presidential nominee Rep Paul D Ryan and Romney had held or did hold security clearance \( Romney 's stemming from his time managing the 2002 Winter Olympics \) , but if they had n't like Trump they would not have had to submit the same documentation The information we received was obviously classified , he said , but I do n't believe that that information was of the same scope and specificity that the president or vice president or other national security leaders get once they 're actually in office He also indicated that the people conducting the briefing were more than capable of understanding what sorts of boundaries to information sharing should n't and would n't be crossed For those worried about a candidate getting access to information and then using it in the campaign , it has happened or so Richard Nixon believed Beschloss related a story about the 1960 election , pitting John F Kennedy against Nixon , who was then serving as vice president to Eisenhower , known colloquially as Ike In 1960 , Ike had JFK briefed by CIA Director Allen Dulles That fall , JFK publicly called for US backed freedom fighters to invade Castro 's Cuba Nixon was furious , presuming that Dulles had told JFK about the CIA backed invasion then being planned \( the record is unclear about what exactly Dulles told JFK about this \) , and that JFK had gone ahead and publicly called for something he knew the CIA was secretly planning Nixon said in his book Six Crises that , to protect the operation 's secrecy , he felt compelled in his TV debates against JFK to denounce the idea of such an invasion , which he did handing JFK the potent Cuba issue , so he felt Also Nixon was angry at Dulles for not using his briefing of JFK to definitively knock down the idea of a Missile Gap notion that USSR was soaring ahead of US in missiles leaving JFK free to use this important issue in the campaign Nixon felt that Dulles did so deliberately in order to cultivate JFK and get reappointed to the CIA , which he was It left Nixon forever suspicious of the CIA and its ability to foil him politically \( a refrain you can hear on the Nixon tapes when he was President \) Chen does n't figure that concerns about either of the current nominees potentially using information to their advantage \( or letting something slip \) will cause the Obama administration to avoid briefing a candidate or skip the briefings entirely He notes that what is disclosed is up to the administration , and how it is disclosed is up to people briefing the candidates who are well aware of the risks of sharing information and how to nuance what 's said But he also notes that the process of national security briefings is a small part of what makes presidential transitions smooth and conflict free There is a lot of discretion , comity and professional courtesy involved in how it all works But it did all work , he said It sort of gave me even more faith in the nature of our democratic system , Chen said , that there could be this kind of information sharing and civil dialogue , even in the heat of a very , very difficult campaign Or put another way The briefings are a well controlled feature to our democracy , not a bug",false

"b'The Apple Watch is a fairly large chunk of gold ! Get ready for the tech press to flip out when Apple announces the retail price for the gold Apple Watch Edition model Apple critics have always roasted the company for selling productsA that are more expensive than they should be , and they frequently use this as a wedge topic to criticize buyers But the 18 karat gold Apple Watch Edition will set a whole new bar with a sales price of 10 , 000 The funny thingA in this case is that Apple is perfectly right to be charging that much ! Do you disagree \? Check out my counterpoint , The Case Against the 10 , 000 Gold Apple Watch EditionGold is ExpensiveLets start with a little backgrounder in gold A Everyone has a vague sense that gold is expensive Even rabid Internet trolls have seen the banner ads and heard about that in the news But most people dont understand just how expensive even a little bit of gold is A So this is a good place to begin the discussion Update My calculations were wrong ! A Also , this was a bit back of the envelope Now that it has some readership I realize I should go back andA fix the calculations inA theA article to be more realistic Here are the basic facts Gold currently sells for between 1 , 200 and 1 , 300 per troy ounce and has been over 1 , 000 per troy ounce for the last five years 18 karat gold contains 75 pure gold , and that term is regulated by law One ounce of 18k gold occupiesA about 1 8 cubic centimeters of volume since a typical 18 karat gold alloy weighs about 16 5 grams per cc 18 karat gold currently sells for 29 11 per gram , 905 per troy ounce , or 480 per cc 25 ccA of 18k gold is about enough to construct a watch buckle and 75 cc gets you a deployant clasp It takes a few more to build a watch case , anywhere from 1 5 to 8A cc depending on the size and thickness of the case So the buckle is worth 120 360 and the watch case 720 to 3800 just as raw gold This is why gold watches generally sell for a lot more than 6 , 000 ! Gold Watches are ExpensiveLets apply this to a watch case Imagine you wanted to create a rectangular case 42 mm high by 36 mm wide by 10 mm deep If it was solid , this would equalA 15 12 cc of volume But its a watch case , so you have to leave room for the movement , dial , case back , etc So letsA just leave 5 mm of thickness all around , making a hollow rectangle This equals 6 8 cc \( 42 x 36 x 10 32 x 26 x 10 \) Therefore , the raw gold to make just the case of this hypothetical watch would cost 3 , 200A as of this writing A simple 42x36x10 mm rectangle of 5 mm thick 18 karat gold would costA more than 3 , 200Now lets consider the same shapeA but just 2 mm thick Thats 2 9 cc of gold , worth 1 , 400 Pick your thickness and youre still looking at thousands of dollars worth of gold How does this translate in the real world \? Lets look at the retail price of some watches thatA are available in both stainless steel and 18 karat gold This Cartier Tank MC is 15 , 000 more in 18k goldThe Cartier Tank MC measures 44 mm by 34 mm by 9 5 mm thick 15 , 000 extra \( list \) for 18k goldCartier Tank MC in stainless steel 7 , 000 list , 5 , 800 streetCartier Tank MC in 18k pink gold 22 , 000 list , 18 , 200 streetTheA Jaeger LeCoultre Reverso Squadra Hometime measures 50 5 mm by 34 9 mm by 14 mm thick 14 , 750 extra \( list \) for 18k goldJaeger LeCoultre Reverso Squadra Hometime in stainless steel 8 , 550 list , 6 , 800 streetJaeger LeCoultre Reverso Squadra Hometime in 18k pink gold 23 , 300 list , 18 , 400 streetThis list could go on and on , but the gist is simple 18 karat gold cases cost a lot more than stainless steel In fact , its pretty much impossible to find a gold watch for under 10 , 000 in any size and from any manufacturer Even tiny quartz ladies watches like the tiny Chopard Happy Sport Mini sells for 11 , 000 ! Most of the bargains commenters have pointed to are either 14 karat or less , very slim and small , or long out of production and with outdated pricing Then theres the bracelet SwapA a gold bracelet for a leather strap and you are looking at an extra 20 , 000 Adding a gold bracelet to thatA Jaeger LeCoultre bumps the price to 42 , 900 ! Certainly there is quite a bit of profit in luxury watches , but one simply cannot deny the raw material valueA in a gold watch case And the gold market is liquid like stocks and other commodities There are plenty of buyers and sellers of gold , and plenty of reserves , so no company , no matter how strong , can expect favorable pricing from their suppliers Another reason companies charge so much for gold watches and jewelry is as a hedge against volatility They cant priceA near the commodity price because they have to set a price and stick to it all year long So they generally price somewhat higher than they would , even taking into consideration all the rest of the materials , labor , distribution , and profit in a watch The Apple Watch Edition Will Cost 10 , 000Theres a reason I picked those twoA watches for my comparisons Both are similar in size and shape to the 42 mm Apple Watch The Cartier is a little smaller and theA Jaeger LeCoultre is a little larger , but bothA represent a traditional watchmakers gold cased square ish offering in the space And both cost more than 20 , 000 , with much of that price going to the gold case and matching buckle And Jony Ive recently said that the historic Cartier Tank was one of his inspirations for the Apple Watch design ! Apple would be crazy to sell the Apple Watch Edition for 20 , 000 , though ThatsA not going to happen So theyre likely to find ways to reduce the cost dramatically First , as we can see , the Apple Watch case is highly rounded in all three dimensions Although questionable from an estheticA standpoint , this reduces the amount of material required by quite a lot A Second , A Apple Watch has a large sapphire crystal front and back with the display , sensors , and such A Third , A the interior frame is likely made of steel or aluminum , not gold , to reduce cost and increase commonality with the aluminum and steel versions Could it be gold plated \? No Numerous reports state that it is a solid gold case Although Apple has not apparently used the word , solid in their press releases , they do claim it is crafted from 18 karat gold andA nowhere does it say it is plated or gold filled \( the industry term \) There are laws covering descriptions of metal content for jewelry and Apple cannot break these any more than Tiffany could Apple says that the Apple Watch will start at 349 for that aluminum Sport model , and many bloggers have reported the price for the steel Apple Watch to be roughly 1 , 000 A It is reasonable to assume that the gold Edition model will sell for substantially more than this , with many suggesting 4 , 000 or 5 , 000 But remember that this price would only cover 4 or 5 ounces of gold ! Even with thin walls and a steel frame , its hard to see how Apple could make a solid 18 karat gold case and buckle for a 42 mm watch with just 3 ounces of gold Gold is soft , but Apple claims that their special gold isA twice as hard as standard gold A Taking that at face value , perhaps they reduced the thickness of the case commensurately , cuttingA the amount of gold in half versus a standard rectangular watch This still leavesA a few thousand dollarsA of material value in the case A The Apple Watch Edition will come in 38 mm and 42 mm sizes , a difference of about 20 in terms of case volume So the smaller model could sell for 20 less still My prediction is that the 42 mm Apple WatchA Edition will retail for 9 , 999 with the 38 mm Apple Watch Edition retailing for 7 , 999 This covers the cost of the gold case , the internals , manufacturing , sales , and profit , and yet does not leave AppleA subsidizing the world gold market by selling at a discount or cheating with a too thin or plated case I will be shocked if the price is 4 , 999 , but I suppose its possible with some finagling and if thats the smaller model And it will not be any less than that This is a 10 , 000 productBonus prediction Given the very high price of the Apple Watch Edition , I predict that availability will be quite limited Apple will likely create special store within a store spaces inA certain Apple Store locations for the Edition A I further expect them to open special standalone Apple Edition Boutiques to sellA theA Watch Edition , accessories , and perhaps other future high end products Update ! Needless to say , many people disagree with me And now that Gruber Fireballed this post , A I imagine Ill hear from lots of them real soon ! The gist of theA disagreement lies in the amount of gold neededA for theA watch case I assumed it would be quite thick \( read sturdy \) and would contain upwards of 130 grams of 18k gold Then theres the strap lugs and buckle which would likely contain another few dozen grams But GAK PDX A \( and others , though he was most visually eloquent \) suspects it contains much less gold For fun , I took my Apple Watch models and used SW and some basic assumptions to figure the gold content 29 16g pic twitter com WGEnjtj1Yh Greg Koenig \( gak pdx \) February 19 , 2015I think this number is way too low , but its a good lower bound if the case was very thin and completely hollow And it puts the raw gold at about 849A at 29 11 per gram of 18k gold Although this is admittedly much , much lower than my estimate , it still illustrates my point that the Apple Watch Edition is not going to be cheap And I think hes way off but time will tell who is right and who isA wrong Another argument is based on this 2006 analysis of a gold Rolex watch Right off the bat one should point out that gold cost 400 oz when it was written and that watch includes a gold bracelet as well , something Apple is apparently not going to do with the Edition A That Rolex case contained 18 5 grams of gold alloy , but its much , much smaller than the Apple watch and its circular to boot ! A 34mm circleA is 107mm in circumference , while the 42mm Apple Watch is 156mm in circumference A Use the magic of math to scale theA Rolex up into a 42mm rectangle and were at 27 75 grams But that caseA is also much thinner since we excluded the bezel , and the Apple Watch is pretty slab sided So we can probably double this safely and come out withA 1 , 615 of gold in my mangledA square Rolex case So there are lower estimates than mine for the amount and value of the gold I can accept that But lets take a step back andA think about the final price A Even if it contained less than 1 , 500 of gold , how much would it sell for \? Certainly not 2 , 000 or 3 , 000 You still have to account for the cost of everything else , plus the intangibles of manufacturing and distribution And profit for Apple \( and a hedge against theA volatility of the price of gold \) So were back at the 4 , 000 5 , 000 estimate others have made As Greg Koenig tweeted , and Forbes reported , If anyone thinks Apple is charging less than 5k for the Edition , they are smoking crack Regardless of the total , its important to realize that the price of gold is in the drivers seat when it comes to pricing the Apple Watch Edition Id love to be wrong , A and I look forward to updating this piece Thanks for reading !

"6th Graders Taught How to Use Strap On DildoExplicit 11 12 year olds given sex toy lesson in Jacksonvilleby Paul Joseph Watson September 15 , 20149 , 23530931Shocking images out of a classroom in Jacksonville , Florida illustrate how 11 12 year olds in 6th grade are being taught how to use strap on dildos amidst a debate about sexual content finding its way into other Common Core subjects , material which has been attacked by some as pornographic The pictures were taken by a student with a cellphone camera They show a teacher demonstrating how to use a strap on sex toy in a number of different positions In one image , the teacher even shows how to insert the strap on while her buttocks are in the air and her legs up over her head In another image , the woman shows the children how to wear a harness to which the strap on is attached Clinton Middle School in Duval County hired 39 year old Sharon Mercer to teach the sex education class but after the photos emerged she was suspended and the school refused further comment Mercer claimed her suspension was an act of bigotry because she was a proud member of the LGBTQ community Newly implemented Common Core educational standards have been assailed for their attempt to create a lowest common denominator form of teaching which many assert only works to dumb down lessons and prevent smart students from excelling The teaching of so called alternative sexual lifestyles is being practiced in many states under Common Core as a result of sexual content finding its way into other subjects A school district in Arizona banned a Common Core approved book last year after it was found to contain sexually explicit passages that described scenes of bondage Common Core , which is being federally imposed on states across the nation , is a huge shift in teaching which opponents assert will eviscerate critical thinking and generally lower standards in the name of inclusiveness and political correctness Numerous examples have emerged of Common Core style exam questions which only serve to cause more confusion and frustration Perhaps the most infamous example of how Common Core will manifest itself in America 's schooling system was illustrated by a bizarre video in which a Common Core curriculum director said that 3 x 4 11 could be considered a correct answer so long as students could explain how they reached that number Common Core 's sex education content has also faced fierce criticism , with one group even claiming that it represents pornography which serves to desensitize children to sexual contact and could lead to an increased chance of molestation within the schooling system Common Core approved book aimed at 11th graders contains sexually explicit scenes of bondage What is taught includes teaching inappropriate sexuality skills , that should n't even be taught in college , writes Joseph R John According to child psychologists , the children are not mentally equipped to understand the detailed sexual indoctrination starting in kindergarten , they are indoctrinated in sexual practices that they should never be exposed to There is a heavy socio political content of sex throughout Common Core curriculum being taught in every grade and in every subject , the student is taught that there is a sameness of gender , there is no longer simply boys and girls according to Common Core , notes John The sexual content of Common Core crosses into every curriculum taught , from teaching sexuality skills in sex education courses by specially skilled and trained sex education teachers Sexual activities and content in included in every subject taught Sex is taught in the English curriculum , is included in the language curriculum , sex is woven into the science curriculum , in the math curriculum , in the social studies curriculum , and of course in biology As the backlash grows , more and more states are considering abolishing Common Core altogether , with Indiana 's decision earlier this year to ditch the program seen as a victory for conservatives FOLLOW Paul Joseph Watson https twitter com PrisonPlanet Paul Joseph Watson is the editor at large of Infowars com and Prison Planet com Print this page",false

"ago 10According to reports from World Net Daily , a New Jersey township that was sued by a group of Muslims for refusing to approve a massive mosque project is now returning to court because of a settlement agreement that restricts anyone from commenting on Islam or Muslims It 's important to note that a key tenet of Shariah bans any negative comments about the religion According to the Thomas More Law Center who sued the township on behalf of two residents whose home is within 200 feet of the proposed mega mosque , the settlement reads more like an instrument of surrender The Islamic Society of Basking Ridge won a decision in federal court after its mosque proposal was rejected based on traffic and other concerns The Township agreed on a 3 5 million payment and a public hearing to approve the settlement Residents Christopher and Loretta Quick challenged the agreement , arguing it restricts speech and violates the Establishment Clause The Quicks reside within 200 feet of the proposed mosque construction in a zoned residential area , Thomas More explained Yet , the settlement agreement prohibits them from describing the many unique features of Islamic worship which will impact the design of the building , traffic density , water and sewage , traffic control problems , road construction , and parking arrangements According to the settlement agreement , ISBR is permitted to make statements concerning Christians and Jews and their places of worship , but in contrast , the agreement prohibits commentary relating to Islam or Muslims In fact , ISBR has previously discussed the Christian and Jewish religions and their places of worship Richard Thompson , chief counsel for Thomas More , said the Islamic center has taken the extraordinary step of concealing significant links on their website to a radical group named by the federal government as an unindicted co conspirator in the largest terrorism financing trial in America history , the Islamic Society of North America \( ISNA' \) Thompson said that while claiming that the township had a religious animus against Muslims , ISBR hid from the public view its animus toward Christians and Jews , by not only hiding anti Christian and anti Semitic verses published on its website but also hiding its significant ties to ISNA Instead of standing up to defend its citizens against ISBR 's hate filled anti Semitic and anti Christian bias , the township colluded with ISBR 's Civilization Jihad' by capitulating to payment of millions of dollars to ISBR , allowing the construction of the new mosque and Islamic center in violation ISBR is setting a dangerous unconstitutional precedent by abusing a court process to chill and trample on the First Amendment rights of private citizens whose only involvement was to speak out against the mosque at public hearings , Thompson said earlier this year He asked for the subpoenas to be thrown out because the U S Supreme Court has held that speech at a public place on a matter of public concern is entitled to special protection 0",false
"As the flood of refugees fleeing jihadist filled war zones in the Middle East and North Africa have As the flood of refugees fleeing jihadist filled war zones in the Middle East and North Africa have poured into Europe over the past few years , Germany has served as the final destination for a substantial number of them According to According to Reuters , Germany witnessed an 8 5 percent increase in their migrant population in 2016 , placing the total number of residents in the country with an immigrant background at approximately 18 6 million people The Federal Statistics Office noted that roughly one fifth of the German population about 22 5 percent were either first or second generation migrants with one or less parents of Germanic heritage Advertisement story continues below To be sure , the majority of those To be sure , the majority of those migrants to Germany actually originated in other European nations and are descended from European heritage , but a significant minority of them particularly those who have come in the past few years have originated from the Middle East or Africa It is estimated that around 2 3 million people in Germany have familial links to the Middle East , a 51 percent increase since 2011 Similarly , the population of those whose families came from Africa stands at around 750 , 000 , a 46 percent increase since 2011 About 1 million of those migrants from the Middle East or Africa arrived in Germany as part of the wave of refugees in 2015 and 2016 Meanwhile , and potentially entirely unrelated the Meanwhile , and potentially entirely unrelated the U K Daily Mail just reported on a substantial rise in cases of bestiality within Germany over the same time period , so much so that animal brothels have actually become a thing Advertisement story continues below Yes , you read that correctly Yes , you read that correctly bestiality , also known as zoophilia , the practice of humans having sexual relations with animals , is a growing trend and lifestyle choice in the prominent central European nation A livestock protection and animal welfare officer named Madeleine Martin is now warning government officials that laws must be put in place to stop the rapid spread of these brothels that allow and encourage people to have sex with animals As an example of the growing trend , Martin pointed to a particular farmer with a flock of sheep who noticed that his animals had become increasingly skittish around people The farmer had surveillance cameras installed on his property , and lo and behold , caught several men entering his barn at night to engage sexually with his flock Advertisement story continues below Martin stressed that this was but one example of many similar cases she has compiled all across the country , and she wants the government to do something about it It is worth noting that bestiality was once illegal in Germany , but the law banning it was dropped from the books in 1969 There had been talk in 2016 of reinstating the ban , but Martin is done with mere talking and is demanding that changes be made to the national Animal Protection Code to do just that protect the animals from abuse by sexually deviant people The chairman of the agricultural committee , Hans Michael Goldman , said changes could be made in the laws to forbid the use of animals for individual sexual acts and to outlaw people pimping' creatures to others for sexual use , which would effectively ban the animal brothels or erotic zoos , as some call them Advertisement story continues below Violation of the newly proposed ban would likely result in a fine equivalent to more than 30 , 000 for a first offense , increasing thereafter Of course , proponents of bestiality have vowed to fight any ban with legal challenges of their own , so we will have see how that plays out in court Please share this story on Facebook and Twitter to spread the word about the significant increase in bestiality and animal brothels in Germany occurring at the same time the country has seen a vast influx of migrants and refugees",false
"ICE Agent Commits Suicide in NYC Leaves Note Revealing Gov't Plans to Round up DISARM Americans During Economic Bank Collapse After writing a lengthy suicide note exposing terrifying plans the government has for American citizens , a US Customs Agent walked onto a pier in NYC and blew his brains out Sources inside the New York City Police Department have revealed to SuperStation95 , the contents of a suicide note found on the body and they are utterly frightening The note , which says it was written over the course of a full week in advance , outlines why the officer chose to shoot himself The America I grew up in , and cherished , has been murdered by its own federal government Our Constitution has become meaningless and our laws politicized so badly , they are no longer enforced except for political purposes the note said Our elected officials are , to a person , utterly corrupt and completely devoid of any love or respect for the country which pays them To them , everything is about getting and keeping power , and making illicit money from backroom deals The 42 year old U S Immigration and Customs Enforcement deportation officer shot himself with a 40 caliber service pistol inside Pier 40 in Hudson River Park at around 11 am \( 1 \) A source at the scene described how the officer calmly walked into the park , took out his pistol and shot himself in the head A ICE federal agent fatally shot himself in the head at waterfront Chelsea park \( pictured \) in New York Friday The 42 year old worked as U S Immigration and Customs Enforcement deportation officer and his offices were nearby to the scene of the shooting He was rushed to Lenox Hill Hospital but doctors were unable to save him \( 2 \) ICE released a statement Friday afternoon 'Tragically , a U S Immigration and Customs Enforcement \( ICE \) deportation officer from the New York field office suffered a self inflicted gunshot wound and has passed away ' It added 'The agency is not releasing further details pending notification of the officer 's next of kin According to the suicide note , the Officer said I was hired to enforce the law to capture and deport people who come to this country against our laws But now , if I dare to do that , I face being suspended or fired because our President refuses to faithfully execute the duties of his office Instead , I come to work each day , and collect a paycheck twice a month , for intentionally doing little to nothing I cannot and will not be party to this fraud to this usurpation of the law , or to the despicable politicians betraying our nation the note continued ICE 's Office of Professional Responsibility is reviewing the matter and coordinating with the New York Police Department on the investigation The agent worked at a field office in lower Manhattan , just blocks away from the scene of the shooting MENTIONS FEMA CAMPS FOR AMERICANS \( 3 \) In the suicide note , the officer revealed what he claimed are terrifying plans the feds have been finalizing If the American people knew what this government is planning , they would rise up and overthrow it If I or anyone else in the federal government revealed what is coming , we would be killed anyway , so now I will reveal what I know We in federal law enforcement have been drilling for several years to control riots and uprisings from a coming financial collapse and widespread bank failures The drills involve life sized images of American men , even women and children , whom we are told to shoot for practice and to get used to it We have been told that the economy is terminally ill and will fail in 2016 We are also told the banks are all insolvent and the FDIC does n't have nearly enough funds to bail out depositors We are told these events are unavoidable and it is imperative that the government survive when people rise up over this When the collapse takes place , detention camps created under the FEMA REX 84 program in the 1980 's to house illegal aliens whom we were going to deport , will instead be used to imprison American Citizens whom the government feels constitute a threat American citizens will be rounded up without warrants and imprisoned without trial for God knows how long These camps have been equipped to carry out Hitler scale killings ! An actual purge of Americans citizens by the very government which they , themselves , created and pay for ! I cannot be party to this The Note goes on to say talk about state level national guard being disarmed by the feds \( 4 \) and over 1 Billion rounds of ammunition purchased by the feds \( 5 \) and the Military over deployed and being shrunk \( 6 \) The government knows the military will rise up to stop this , so our military is being deployed overseas , intentionally involved in foreign fights , and deliberately shrunk in size so they cannot be here or help Americans ! This is why certain ammunition and weaponry has been removed from state level National Guard Armories and over a Billion rounds of hollow point ammunition has been bought by the federal government The states themselves have been disarmed of military grade firepower so they cannot defend themselves from the federal activities This is also why local police departments have been militarized and provided with armored vehicles and weapons of war the note says When the inevitable collapse begins to take place , electric power to the entire country will be shut off , as will all forms of communication All banks will be immediately closed no one will be able to get any money because all ATM 's will be offline Credit , Debit and EBT cards will not function Anyone without cash will have no way to get any The Emergency Alert System will be used to takeover all broadcast stations and tell the public this is a result of a cyber attack But while the American people patiently await things to get back to normal , the government will unleash round ups of citizens they deem militants or dangerous With all civilian communications out , and all TV and radio stations taken over by the Emergency Alert System , by the time word spreads of what is taking place , the government will already have the upper hand Federal Prisoners to be GASSED TO DEATH The note goes into a wide array of very specific plans and does so in extremely specific detail about what the feds are allegedly planning For instance , it talks about federal prisons Every federal prison has been outfitted with lethal gas systems When things go bad , all prisoners in all prisons will be placed in their cells on lock down Prison staff will depart the facility , and a certain designated person will trigger a lethal gas system All federal prisoners , regardless of their crime or their sentence , will be gassed to death in their cells Once the gas clears , the dead will be removed and the prisons will then be used to house citizens who fight against the federal onslaught PRIESTS RECRUITED TO QUELL OPPOSITION \( 7 \) The note makes mention about Priests , Rabbis and Clerics from various religious denominations having been recruited and trained to quell resistance So intent is the government to succeed they have recruited priests , rabbis and clerics from various religions to quote appropriate Scriptures about obeying government They are being trained to tell people not to fight back and that their best hope is to pray EXECUTIVE ORDER 13603 \( 8 \) The suicide note goes to great lengths about Executive Order 13603 signed by President Obama on March 16 , 2012 The note details Executive order 13603 about National Defense Resources Preparedness This 10 page document is a blueprint for a federal takeover of the economy Specifically , Obama 's plan involves seizing control of All commodities and products that are capable of being ingested by either human beings or animals All forms of energy All forms of civil transportation All usable water from all sources Health resources drugs , biological products , medical devices , materials , facilities , health supplies , services and equipment Forced labor \( or induction as the executive order delicately refers to military conscription \) Moreover , federal officials would issue regulations to prioritize and allocate resources SuperStation95 took a look at this Executive Order from the Government Printing Office \( GPO \) SuperStation95 took a look at this Executive Order from the Government Printing Office \( GPO \) web site and , sure enough , everything contained in the Officer 's suicide note about this Executive Order is true ! To be sure , much of this language has appeared in national security executive orders that previous presidents have issued periodically since the beginning of the Cold War But more than previous national security executive orders , Obama 's 13603 seems to describe a potentially totalitarian regime obsessed with control over everything Obama 's executive order makes no effort to justify the destruction of liberty , no effort to explain how amassing totalitarian control would enable government to deal effectively with cyber sabotage , suicide bombings , chemical warfare , nuclear missiles or other possible threats There 's nothing in executive order 13603 about upholding the Constitution or protecting civil liberties In what circumstances , one might ask , would a president try to carry out this audacious plan \? Executive order 13603 says with ominous ambiguity during the full spectrum of emergencies DATABASE OF PREPPERS The suicide note touches on the subject of Preppers We in federal law enforcement have also been told that the government has a full database of all so called Preppers Those people will be dealt with first by armed federal agents coming to take their guns , then their food stocks , so food can be re distributed as the government sees fit If the dead Officer 's claims about an unavoidable economic and banking collapse are true , would it then follow that the Executive Order put in place by Obama , might be activated \? Would all of us find ourselves in forced labor , while the government takes OUR food and re distrubutes it under the Executive Order 's paragraph about allocating resources \? This is terrifying stuff ! There is much more to the suicide note and SuperStation95 is considering how much more to publish As such , this is a developing story and readers should check back for further updates THESE COULD SIMPLY BE INSANE RAMBLINGS It is not our intent to cause panic or alarm and while we expect readers to be intelligent enough to discern this on their own , we feel compelled to point out that these could simply be paranoid ramblings of an insane person who killed himself On the other hand , these could also be revelations by a person who was so distraught over the ugly truth , that he killed himself We at SuperStation95 just do n't know We urge everyone to stay calm , think rationally , and decide whether or not to take any action to prepare , in case this person 's suicide note is telling the truth SOURCING CORROBORATION \( 1 \) ICE Agent Suicide in NYC \( 1 \) ICE Agent Suicide in NYC NY Daily News \( 2 \) Taken to Lenox Hill Hospital \( 2 \) Taken to Lenox Hill Hospital NY Post \( 3 \) REX 84 FEMA CAMPS \( 3 \) REX 84 FEMA CAMPS Wikipedia \( 4 \) National Guard being stripped of Crew Serviceable Weapons and communications gear \( 4 \) National Guard being stripped of Crew Serviceable Weapons and communications gear Republic Broadcasting , John Stadmiller \( 5 \) Dept of Homeland Security Orders 1 6 BILLION rounds of ammunition \( 5 \) Dept of Homeland Security Orders 1 6 BILLION rounds of ammunition Forbes Magazine \( 6 \) US Army over deployed and intentionally shrunk \( 6 \) US Army over deployed and intentionally shrunk ARMY TIMES",false

"4 reddit Upvote Downvotesubmit 5 26K Like In yet another example of what the Religious Right 's recent focus on religious liberty is really about , five Republican presidential candidates are scheduled to speak at a religious freedom event hosted by a conservative pastor who has repeatedly declared that AIDS is God 's punishment for gay people 's immoral act and has called for a class action lawsuit against homosexuality Just last year , Vision America 's Rick Scarborough repeated his belief that AIDS is God 's judgment on a sinful generation , adding that God would probably give us the cure for AIDS today if the U S stopped supporting gay rights Commenting on the preparations for the event , Scarborough used the same pitch , only this time to refer to the fact that U S women seem to be having a lot of dirty fantasies and that 's why God has also decided it would be a good idea to give them breast cancer so they could learn from their sins You know , we 've seen this happen before , and I 've said it right from the start He is watching everything and He sees everything , you just ca n't hide anything from Him , he added Scarborough opined You 're going to have people who say , God works in mysterious ways ' Well , I have to say , to me , the Big Guy 's M O is pretty straightforward It 's all about cause and consequence First we had gays running rampant on Earth , so He took a look at that and decided we should have AIDS Then , he saw some other abomination walking on the very planet that he built , so again he decided it was time for some punishment And now , we have this a situation where American women ca n't get enough of dirty fantasies You 've got rape , kidnapping , incarceration , BDSM , anal , masturbation , you name it and our women are fantasizing about it And sure enough , He 's watching closely Why do you think we have breast cancer \? Because He 's sick of what he 's seeing But the best part about it , and the thing that we are obviously too stubborn to realize , the activist added , is He is more than willing to forgive He will always offer you a clean slate and a fresh start , no matter how sinful you 've become All we need to do now , all we need to do to help our women be better and more virtuous , is make them stop having dirty fantasies As if that was n't enough , Scarborough also stated his theory on how the deed should be done I ca n't say from personal experience , but I 've heard that talking to women never works because they 're too stubborn Beating the living daylights out of them is another way to go , and that 's what I 'd recommend I think every single woman who has dirty fantasies should be beaten and beaten well Then and only then will God even consider giving us the cure for breast cancer And another thing , Scarborough added I'm pretty sure that therapy by beating might also work on a certain percentage of the gay population I'm not sure what percentage , since a number of them probably loves to be roughed up during their filthy intercourse anyway , but it might prove to be a positive form of physical therapy after all",false
"Cashew nuts are one of the healthiest foods in the world Unfortunately , not many of you know the numerous benefits they offer , and only a very small percentage of the natural medicines comprehensive database is dedicated to them Countries like Nigeria , Tanzania , Mozambique and Brazil are the biggest producers of cashew nuts , mostly due to the fact that they need hot and humid climate in order to grow Health Benefits of Cashew Nuts Cashew nuts are rich in vitamins , soluble dietary fiber , minerals and many phytochemicals that prevent diseases , including cancers Cashews are also rich in calories , about 50 grams of these favorable foods contain 275 calories These beneficial nuts provide numerous essential vitamins , including pantothenic acid or vitamin B5 , pyridoxine or vitamin B6 , thiamin or vitamin B11 and riboflavinThe aforementioned vitamins are crucial for metabolism of fat , protein and carbs at a cellular level On the other hand , niacin improves the protection against pellagra or dermatitis Furthermore , B6 is extremely beneficial for our health for it significantly lowers the chances of developing sideroblastic anemia and homocystinuria Only 3 5 Oz \( 100 gr \) of these nuts provide about 30 of daily recommended levels of B6 \( that 's about 0 147 mg \) Moreover , cashews are also rich in essential minerals Some of the most useful minerals found in cashew nuts are potassium , manganese , copper , selenium , magnesium , zinc and iron Only a handful of these nuts on a daily basis can provide the necessary amount of these extremely needed minerals and protect you from deficiency related diseases For instance , copper acts as a co factor for many important enzymes , like superoxide dismutase and cytochrome c oxidase Zinc , on the other hand , plays the same role together with enzymes that are responsible for the regulation of the growth and progress of digestion , gonadal function and DNA synthesis Selenium is a very important micronutrient and it works as a co factor for antioxidant enzymes like Glutathione peroxides , known as one of the strongest antioxidants in human body Monounsaturated fatty acids which are in high quantities in these nuts are extremely good for the heart health , as palmitoleic and oleic acids They belong to the group of essential fatty acids that can increase the level of good HDL cholesterol and decrease the level of harmful LDLcholesterol in our blood In addition , as shown by many scientific studies , the so called Mediterranean diet which is mostly based on monounsaturated fatty acids supports the blood lipid profile , and protect our system from strokes and coronary artery diseases Furthermore , cashews also contain a small quantity of one very important pigment of flavonoid antioxidants , called zeaxanthin , which is selectively absorbed inside the retinal macula in our eyes This pigment provides protective and antioxidant UV ray filtering features , and it also protects from ARMD or age related macular degeneration in old people How Treat Depression Naturally A Basic Guide to Cashew Nutrition Cashew nuts are more than great source of tryptophan , which is a vital amino acid our body needs to take it throughout the food This amino acid helps children develop and grow , regulates mood , balances our behavior , improves sleep and can significantly lower the level of stress , anxiety and depression Just two handfuls of cashews contain somewhere between 1 000 and 2 000 mg of tryptophan This compound has been proven to be as equally successful as prescription antidepressants The best thing about treating depression with cashews is that you will surely avoid side effects that are usually caused by antidepressants Of course , this is yet another thing big pharma carefully hides from us According to FDA Deputy Commissioner for Policy 's David Adams , who was part of the Drug Information Association Annual Meeting back in 1993 , we need to pay close attention to the things happening around the legal arena and dietary supplements If producers of natural remedies manage getting the support , there will most likely be a completely new class of products , which will be competing with the already existing drugs This is why we need a special law that will have the function to regulate the supplements In addition , back in 1993 , FDA Dietary Task Force has released a report saying that the selling and existence of dietary supplements will not jeopardize efforts for creating new drugs As you are probably aware by now , big pharma is a huge business However , there is much effective and safer natural depression treatment they want to hide from the common people because thus they will lose lots of money An introduction to Cashew Nut Allergy Beside allergies caused by eating walnuts , almonds and other nuts , cashew nut cause allergy in both adults and children and is one of the commonest food allergies Same as peanuts , cashews can lead to occurrence of some very severe allergic reactions , even if the individual has consumed just a small quantity of cashews The healthy nuts we dedicate this article to are a hidden ingredient in many common foods such as ice cream , cakes and Asian dishes Anyway , if you ever experience symptoms of cashew nut allergy , it is mandatory to look for professional help Thank you so much for dropping by and reading this blog post For more posts about health , do n't hesitate and feel free to visit our website more often and please share this to your

"Michigan residents lost their right to farm this week thanks to a new ruling by the Michigan Commission of Agriculture and Rural Development Gail Philburn of the Michigan Sierra Club told Michigan Live , the news changes effectively remove Right to Farm Act protection for many urban and suburban backyard farmers raising small numbers of animals Backyard and urban farming were previously protected by Michigan 's Right to Farm Act The Commission ruled that the Right to Farm Act protections no longer apply to many homeowners who keep small numbers of livestock Kim White , who raises chickens and rabbits , said , They do n't want us little guys feeding ourselves They want us to go all to the big farms They want to do away with small farms and I believe that is what 's motivating it The ruling will allow local governments to arbitrarily ban goats , chickens and beehives on any property where there are 13 homes within one eighth mile or a residence within 250 feet of the property , according to Michigan Public Radio The Right to Farm Act was created in 1981 to protect farmers from the complaints of people from the city who moved to the country and then attempted to make it more urban with anti farming ordinances The new changes affect residents of rural Michigan too It is not simply an urban or suburban concern Shady Grove Farm in Gwinn , Michigan is the six and a half acre home to 150 egg laying hens that provide eggs to a local co op and a local restaurant The small Michigan farm also homes sheep for wool and a few turkeys and meat chickens to provide fresh healthy , local poultry We produce food with integrity , Randy Buchler told The Blaze about Shady Grove Farm Everything we do here is 100 percent natural we like to say it 's beyond organic We take a lot of pride and care in what we 're doing here Shady Grove Farm was doing its part to bring healthy , local , organic food to the tables of Gwinn residents , and it mirrors the attitudes of hundreds of other small farming operations in Michigan and thousands of others popping up around the nation The ruling comes within days of a report by The World Health Organization that stated the world is currently in grave danger of entering a post antibiotic era The WHO 's director general Dr Margaret Chan argued that the antibiotic use in our industrialized food supply is the worst offender adding to the global crisis The Michigan Agriculture Commission passed up an opportunity to support one of the hottest trends in food in Michigan public demand for access to more local , healthy , sustainable food , Gail Philbin told MLive Meanwhile , neighboring Indiana Governor Mike Pence signed Senate Bill 179 a few weeks before which freed up poultry and egg sales from local and state regulation Yesterday , the USDA Secretary Tom Vilsack announced massive funding to support research about small and medium sized family farms , such as small farms ability to build up local and regional economic systems There 's a lot of unnecessary legal action being taken against small farms who are doing good things in their communities , said Randy Buchler , who is also on the board of directors for the Michigan Small Farm Council The Michigan Small Farm Council actively fought to support Michigan farming freedom , but ultimately the Commission voted to approve the new restrictions Farm Bureau has become another special interest beholden to big business and out of touch with small farmers , and constitutional and property rights of the little guy , Pine Hallow Farms wrote to the Michigan Small Farm Council The Michigan Farm Bureau endorsed the new regulatory changes Matthew Kapp , government relations specialist with Michigan Farm Bureau , told MLive that the members weighed in and felt that people raising livestock need to conform to local zoning ordinances The Farm Bureau did not feel Michigan 's Right To Farm Act was meant to protect the smaller farms , and ultimately the Michigan Commission of Agriculture and Rural Development agreed",false

"Palin Blames Florida Shooting On Obama 's Policy Of Allowing Mexican Muslims To Walk Freely On Our Streets Written by Alex Stevan January 6th 2017 \( Photo Credit Fox News \) Five people have been shot dead by a gunman at Fort Lauderdale airport in Florida , say officials It happened at the baggage claim area in Terminal 2 , just before 1300 local time \( 1800 GMT \) , the airport confirmed Five people were killed , eight injured and one person was unharmed in custody , said police and local officials Hundreds of people were standing on the tarmac outside the terminal as dozens of police cars and ambulances rushed to the scene A witness told MSNBC that the gunman was a slender man who was wearing a Star Wars T shirt Florida Senator Bill Nelson told media that the gunman has been identified as Esteban Santiago , but that has not been confirmed by law enforcement Former half term governor of Alaska Sarah Palin took to the press to offer her thoughts and prayers to the families of the victims , but also used the opportunity to once again criticize former President Barack Obama 's policy on illegal immigration First of all , I 'd like to offer my condolences to the families of the victims of the Fort Lauderdale terrorist attack , as well as my support to those who have been injured in the incident , she said Make no mistake this was a full on terrorist attack , the likes of which we 've had several in the past months and years These lone wolf terrorist attacks have today become a danger far greater than any terrorist cell that might be planning an attack on U S soil It is terrible that we are faced with such an unpredictable network of individuals who will stop at nothing in order to harm innocent civilians She added , However , do n't be fooled by the idea that there was no stopping this sort of escalation of terrorist violence We could have prevented all of this 8 years ago , but unfortunately , the citizens of this country more specifically , true , conservative Americans were outvoted by those who believed Barack Obama was the right choice for president Eight years later , I'm sad to say America is choking on terrorism , racial issues and gender catastrophes the likes of which are unknown in its recent history Not only were the liberals not right they have single handedly surrendered this country into the hands of a man who 's done more damage to it than any Bush , Reagan or Stalin , for that matter , ever could It is Barack Obama 's policy of allowing Mexican Muslims to walk freely on our streets that has caused so much death and destruction recently , including this latest incident which has taken 5 innocent lives , she continued Think about that for a second Why were Mexican Muslims even allowed to walk our streets in the first place , I ask you \? They 're , like , double the threat they 're half Muslim , which means that they hate all of America by default , and the other half is Mexican , which means they can be very hard working , but at the same time , they 're also very jealous of white people And if , by some miracle , you were to add just an ounce of Germanic heritage to that , you 'd have Hitler in the mix as well That means they 'd be the ultimate killing machine They should have been incarcerated from the beginning Instead , we 're left with this situation I guarantee you no potential gunman would have ever seen the light of day other than through prison bars if anyone other than Barack Obama had been president All Muslim Mexicans would be scrutinized several times , compared to normal Muslims and Mexicans , the majority of whom would only be subjected to one scrutinization process yearly Instead , they were left to their own twisted behavior under the excuse of civil liberties , and what happened \?

"Activate your digital access Colorado doctors claim baby boy is first marijuana overdose deathBrandon Rittiman , USA TODAY KUSA TV Denver Published 9 33 a m PT Nov 16 , 2017 Updated 9 51 a m PT Nov 16 , 2017CLOSEOne doctor says he identified the first instance of pediatric marijuana overdose , but questions remain if marijuana can be directly attributed to an 11 month old 's death USA TODAYFernley City Council is discussing allowing a medical marijuana dispensary in the city \( Photo Getty Images iStockphoto \) CONNECT TWEET LINKEDIN 5 COMMENTEMAILMORETwo poison control doctors claim to have documented the first known case of death by marijuana overdose , sparking a medical debate over what killed an 11 month old baby in Colorado two years ago The case report was published in the journal Clinical Practice and Cases in Emergency Medicine and is co authored by a pair of doctors at the Rocky Mountain Poison and Drug Center , which is housed at Denver Health The doctors behind the case report , Doctors Thomas Nappe and Christopher Hoyte , worked on the baby 's care as part of their duties at the regional poison control center They claim that damage to the child 's heart muscle , which was listed as the boy 's cause of death , was brought on by ingesting marijuana This is the first news story in which either of the doctors publicly discussed the case that was published in a medical journal in March of this year More Nevada pot sales reach 32 4M in August , higher than July The only thing that we found was marijuana High concentrations of marijuana in his blood And that 's the only thing we found , Hoyte said The kid never really got better And just one thing led to another and the kid ended up with a heart stopped And the kid stopped breathing and died The case report makes what amounts to a very bold statement in the scientific world , As of this writing , this is the first reported pediatric death associated with cannabis exposure If correct , the phenomenon Dr Hoyte claims to have documented would remain the only time a marijuana overdose is known to have caused a human death Other doctors are deeply skeptical of the strong language used in the report CLOSESince Nevada legalized recreational marijuana , anyone 21 and over can possess up to 1 ounce in state How many people actually could look at an ounce and identify it , though \? We 're here to help educate you Jenny Kane RGJ That statement is too much It 's too much as far as I'm concerned , said Dr Noah Kaufman , an emergency medicine specialist based in Northern Colorado Because that is saying confidently that this is the first case We 've got one ! ' And I still disagree with that It 's widely accepted as fact that marijuana overdoses are not fatal The U S Drug Enforcement Administration fact sheet on pot says simply that no death from overdose of marijuana has been reported and the National Institutes of Health says there is insufficient evidence to link THC overdose to fatalities The claim that an overdose death happened in Colorado has the potential to change the way people think about the steady march toward marijuana legalization in the U S The controversyBoth published accounts of this case clearly state that the autopsy shows that the 11 month old boy died of myocarditis \( inflammation of the heart muscle \) which caused the heart to fail The Nappe Hoyte published case study takes the diagnosis a step further , theorizing that the myocarditis was caused by cannabis overdose , which then caused the baby boy 's heart to fail That diagnosis of this heart condition is at the core of the medical debate over this case study Myocarditis is rare in children , and can often be fatal when diagnosed In children , fatal myocarditis is usually caused by a virus called Coxsackievirus The authors of the case report say that virus was ruled out in this case CLOSEA recent poll says Americans believe marijuana is less harmful than opioids in pain relief , but are less comfortable with its use by children and pregnant women for medical conditions WochitMyocarditis has a long list of other known causes , mostly from infections by bacteria , viruses , fungi , and parasites We extensively ruled out almost every other cause that we can think of , Dr Hoyte said Myself , our team , plus the primary team taking care of the patient , plus the coroner who did the post mortem on the child And we found no other reason why this young kid ended up having inflammation on his heart Drs Hoyte and Nappe both worked on the case as physicians on staff at the poison control center More New 'Potcast' to dive into how marijuana legalization is changing AmericaWe do not know if this case has led to a criminal investigation Hoyte and Nappe declined to share the identity of the deceased child or even the name of the hospital in Colorado where the death took place , for fear of revealing his identity They report finding a high concentration of THC \( the psychoactive drug found in marijuana \) in the child 's urine and blood Short of that , they have no evidence that explains the child 's death We just wanted to make sure that we 're not going to call this a marijuana related fatality if there was something else that we could point at And we looked and looked and could n't find it , Hoyte said Their case report points to other research that shows myocarditis as a symptom associated with THC consumption , but those cases involved the presence of other drugs and do not propose a mechanism by which marijuana might bring on myocarditis None of those cases involved fatalities This hints at a scientific limitation of this study The doctors do n't have a proof positive way to demonstrate that marijuana caused the death in this 2015 case What they can do is demonstrate a presence of marijuana in the boy 's system , and that they ruled out a lot of other possible explanations for his death The child did n't leave the house between being normal and being sick The child had THC in the blood and in the urine and there were marijuana products in the house , Hoyte said I feel very comfortable with the workup that we did and how much we ruled out in this particular case This conclusion leaves other doctors curious , but skeptical that this truly is the world 's first documented death by marijuana overdose This child 's death in 2015 was previously noted in a 2016 paper published in the Journal of the American Medical Association Pediatrics In that paper , written by Dr George Wang of Children 's Hospital Colorado , said that marijuana could not be determined as the cause of myocarditis in this case However , Dr Wang says that his study focused on a wider review of years of data and not the relationship between this type of heart problem and evidence of marijuana found in that boy 's system Multiple ER doctors and medical researchers were interviewed for this story Many praised the Rocky Mountain Poison and Drug Center as a top tier institution for researching the issue , but none accepted this case as bulletproof evidence of a marijuana overdose death , though some were more open to the idea than others One spoke on the record I'm going to have to call BS' on this one , Kaufman said I'm not saying that it 's not But I think it 's a pretty big leap to say that it is Other possible causesWhile the study notes that the child tested positive for marijuana and that his case involved an unstable motel living situation and parental admission of drug possession , including cannabis , the doctors admit in their published report , the myocarditis could have been caused by something doctors ca n't test for A lot of the times the cause of myocarditis is infectious Or unknown , Hoyte said Dr Kaufman agrees about the number of unknown causes of myocarditis Hoyte may be pretty confident , Kaufman said , But I'm not I think that it 's more likely that there 's not a relationship There 's so many things that cause the problem that this poor baby had , that we 're not even close to saying it was definitively a marijuana overdose , Kaufman added Allergies can cause this What if the kiddo was allergic to the carnauba wax , or whatever is in the gummy that 's not the marijuana \? Kaufman also points out that there are thousands of known cases of accidental ingestion of marijuana by kids of all ages and while symptoms can be bad , none of those cases have proven fatal To him , that suggests there may be some other reason that a small segment of the population is more sensitive to overdose on THC than most people The case report on this death itself is missing some key information Hoyte and Nappe wrote that the boy ate an unknown dose of THC , and said they are n't sure exactly what product was involved or precisely when he ate it Based on the blood levels of THC metabolite they found , the doctors estimate that consumption took place 2 6 days before death Some context and adviceDoctors on both sides of the debate agree on what parents should learn from this case It 's the same advice they 've given since marijuana first became legal in Colorado keep it away from kids Even if I'm not convinced that it could kill your kid , you need to be really careful because it could make them really sick , Dr Kaufman said It needs to be locked up away in a medicine chest because it can cause seizures It can cause real big problems in kids that can lead to other problems Concerned parents can also learn the warning signs for marijuana ingestion , which include lack of balance , unusual and sudden sleepiness , and breathing difficulty , according to Children 's Hospital Colorado Hoyte and Nappe report that this baby displayed those symptoms for a day or so before he had a seizure and went to the ER Colorado has taken recent steps aimed at preventing accidental ingestion by children In the years since legalization , the state has imposed new restrictions on the potency and design of edible marijuana products New rules that took effect last month ban edibles that resemble existing non marijuana candies and also bans shaping edibles in the form of people , animals , or fruit Dr Hoyte was careful to point out that even though he does believe THC led to this death , there are plenty of more harmful substances parents also need to worry about We 're far more concerned about opioids in that case of a kid getting really sick than we are of marijuana , Hoyte said Even if Hoyte and Nappe 's determination is confirmed , it 's worth noting that we would have more confirmed deaths from swallowed laundry and dish detergent pods than from marijuana , according to poison control researchers at Nationwide Children 's Hospital in Columbus , Ohio The doctors who spoke agree further study may be warranted , including animal testing , to shed more light on possible links between myocarditis and marijuana More post mortem studies of the heart tissue from cannabis users who pass away could also be useful , Hoyte suggested However , he says that if he 's right , this phenomenon may be extremely rare Cases of kids ingesting cannabis have increased since Colorado legalized the drug , but Hoyte admits pot may not be causing enough serious health complications to study these issues extensively We 're not getting calls from kids getting sick from marijuana or even adults getting sick from marijuana getting sick to the point of having bad outcomes , Hoyte said We 're not getting these every single day They 're very few and far between Was this a rare case of marijuana death , or something else \?

he says I realized that day , regardless of whatever my decision was , neither one of them was going home an innocent man All he could think about was getting his life back , going home , playing football , finishing his high school education , enrolling at USC They put him in a room and gave him 10 minutes to make his decision He sat there crying I was unable to speak to my mom I was denied that right , he says At the age of 17 , I felt like 90 days was doable after already spending a year behind bars He underwent the 90 day observation The psychologist and counselor recommended probation The judge gave him six years He had never been in trouble before , not even a speeding ticket He sat in the holding cell , held both hands up , shaking uncontrollably as he figured out that he would have to serve 85 of the six years He had already served one year That meant he still had just over four years remaining Just the trauma and the stress that I had already dealt with that first year , it was unimaginable how I was going to do another four years , he says He went to jail with career criminals He was angry , depressed , hostile He saw fights , stabbings , killings right in front of him , riots , lockdowns He saw hell Banks lost 10 years of his life , a frightful five years and two months in prison followed by five years of high custody parole After his release in 2007 , he moved back in with his mother , a second grade schoolteacher who had sold her house and car to pay his attorney fees At 22 he tried to resume his football career at Long Beach City College He played in a game two days after his release , a good way to take out aggression But after playing a handful of games before the season ended , a new law went into effect in California requiring sex offenders to wear an ankle GPS tracking device , making it impossible for him to play football He had already registered as a sex offender and could n't live within 2 , 000 yards of a school or park He had trouble finding work I wanted revenge , Banks says I wanted people to be held accountable for the things that happened to me The past is the past It already happened Tomorrow is a mystery Life 's not fair , Banks thought I'm an innocent man Three years ago , Banks was checking his Facebook account and got a start He had been home for four years working odd jobs , still carrying the label of sex offender But there , staring him in the face , was a friend request It was her , Banks says , the girl who had accused me nine years ago Banks still does n't know her reasoning for selling him down the river when she knew they never had sex and there was no DNA trace on her underwear Maybe it was the 1 5 million she collected from the Long Beach school system , claiming it was an unsafe environment \( the city is trying to recoup 2 6 million from her now \) Banks thinks maybe Gibson was afraid her older sister , who went to the same high school , would find out she made out with him and tell her mother Or that he would brag to friends Maybe she thought he would just be suspended He does n't think she was trying to put him in jail He also thinks perhaps a school security guard saw her leaving the stairwell with him , asked what she was doing and if she wanted to do it Oh well , then he raped you , Banks surmises the guard said We do n't really know what the truth really is as to why she lied , he says I never really got a clear reason Banks never had contact with her from the day they made out until that day on Facebook in 2011 He asked why she would request him I was hoping we could let bygones be bygones , Banks says Gibson wrote I was immature back in the day , but I'm much more mature now Let 's hang out I 'd love to see you I 've seen your picture on Facebook You look real good I would love to hook up Banks obviously had no interest His parole agreement did n't allow him any contact with her Banks called a private investigator and said he felt there was an opportunity for her to tell the truth and he wanted it recorded In the event that I violated my parole conditions coming into contact with her and was sent back to prison , I wanted them to at least know what was said , Banks says I took a big risk I knew this was the only opportunity to prove my innocence by her admitting she lied In 2013 , Atlanta 's Brian Banks faces Cincinnati \( Kevin C Cox Getty Images \) He invited Wanetta Gibson to the investigator 's office They spoke with the investigator monitoring in another room Banks wanted her to understand what she did to his life He asked her to come back the second day to speak to the investigator Did he rape you \?

"Hearing loss of US diplomats in Cuba blamed on covert deviceBy MATTHEW LEE and MICHAEL WEISSENSTEINAug 10 , 2017https www apnews com 51828908c6c84d78a29e833d0aae10aaLink copied ! WASHINGTON \( AP \) The two year old U S diplomatic relationship with Cuba was roiled Wednesday by what U S officials say was a string of bizarre incidents that left a group of American diplomats in Havana with severe hearing loss attributed to a covert sonic device In the fall of 2016 , a series of U S diplomats began suffering unexplained losses of hearing , according to officials with knowledge of the investigation into the case Several of the diplomats were recent arrivals at the embassy , which reopened in 2015 as part of former President Barack Obama 's reestablishment of diplomatic relations with Cuba Some of the diplomats' symptoms were so severe that they were forced to cancel their tours early and return to the United States , officials said After months of investigation , U S officials concluded that the diplomats had been exposed to an advanced device that operated outside the range of audible sound and had been deployed either inside or outside their residences It was not immediately clear if the device was a weapon used in a deliberate attack , or had some other purpose The U S officials were n't authorized to discuss the investigation publicly and spoke on condition of anonymity State Department spokeswoman Heather Nauert said the U S retaliated by expelling two Cuban diplomats from their embassy in Washington on May 23 She did not say how many U S diplomats were affected or confirm they had suffered hearing loss , saying only that they had a variety of physical symptoms The Cuban government said in a lengthy statement late Wednesday that Cuba has never permitted , nor will permit , that Cuban territory be used for any action against accredited diplomatic officials or their families , with no exception The statement from the Cuban Foreign Ministry said it had been informed of the incidents on Feb 17 and had launched an exhaustive , high priority , urgent investigation at the behest of the highest level of the Cuban government It said the decision to expel two Cuban diplomats was unjustified and baseless The ministry said it had created an expert committee to analyze the incidents and had reinforced security around the U S embassy and U S diplomatic residences Cuba is universally considered a safe destination for visitors and foreign diplomats , including U S citizens , the statement said U S officials told The Associated Press that about five diplomats , several with spouses , had been affected and that no children had been involved The FBI and Diplomatic Security Service are investigating Cuba employs a state security apparatus that keeps many people under surveillance and U S diplomats are among the most closely monitored people on the island Like virtually all foreign diplomats in Cuba , the victims of the incidents lived in housing owned and maintained by the Cuban government However , officials familiar with the probe said investigators were looking into the possibilities that the incidents were carried out by a third country such as Russia , possibly operating without the knowledge of Cuba 's formal chain of command Nauert said investigators did not yet have a definitive explanation for the incidents but stressed they take them very seriously , as shown by the Cuban diplomats' expulsions We requested their departure as a reciprocal measure since some U S personnel 's assignments in Havana had to be curtailed due to these incidents , she said Under the Vienna Convention , Cuba has an obligation to take measures to protect diplomats U S diplomats in Cuba said they suffered occasional harassment for years after the restoration of limited ties with the communist government in the 1970s , harassment reciprocated by U S agents against Cuban diplomats in Washington The use of sonic devices to intentionally harm diplomats would be unprecedented",false

Medical cannabis , or medical marijuana , can refer to the use of cannabis and its cannabinoids to treat disease or improve symptoms However , there is no single agreed upon definition , says Wikipedia The use of cannabis as a medicine has not been rigorously scientifically tested , often due to production restrictions and other governmental regulations There is limited evidence suggesting cannabis can be used to reduce nausea and vomiting during chemotherapy , to improve appetite in people with HIV AIDS , and to treat chronic pain and muscle spasms Its use for other medical applications , however , is insufficient for conclusions about safety or effects In California , there are weed doctors who will write a prescription for cannabis to anyone claiming to suffer from anxiety , which means they passout prescriptions for pot like chocolate bars at a Halloween party As with so many other trends that started in California , expect to see medicinal marijuana sold in your town soon !

"b Curiously , the cancer rate is 10 percent higher in the left breast than in the right This left side bias holds true for both men and women and it also applies to the skin cancer melanoma Researchers Orjan Hallberg of Hallberg Independent Research in Sweden and Ollie Johansson of The Karolinska Institute in Sweden , writing in the June issue of the journal Pathophysiology , suggest a surprising explanation that not only points to a common cause for both cancers , it may change your sleeping habits For unknown reasons the rates of breast cancer and melanoma have both increased steadily in the last 30 years Exposure to the sun elevates the risk of melanoma , but the sun 's intensity has not changed in the last three decades Stranger still , melanoma most commonly affects the hip , thighs and trunk , which are areas of the body protected from the sun What is responsible for the left side dominance and increasing incidence of these cancers \? An intriguing clue comes from the Far East In Japan there is no correlation between the rates of melanoma and breast cancer as there is in the West , and there is no left side prevalence for either disease Moreover , the rate of breast cancer in Japan is significantly lower than in the West only 3 percent of what is seen in Sweden , for example The rate of prostate cancer in Japan is only 10 percent of that in the U K and U S The researchers suggest an explanation based on differences in sleeping habits in Japan and Western countries Previous research has shown that both men and women prefer to sleep on their right sides The reasons for this general preference are unclear , but sleeping on the right side may reduce the weight stress on the heart , and the heartbeat is not as loud as when sleeping on the left Still , there is no reason to suspect that people in Japan sleep in positions that are any different from those in the West The beds in Japan , however , are different The futons used for sleeping in Japan are mattresses placed directly on the bedroom floor , in contrast to the elevated box springs and mattress of beds used in the West A link between bedroom furniture and cancer seems absurd , but this , the researchers conclude , is the answer The first line of evidence they cite comes from a 2007 study in Sweden conducted between 1989 and 1993 that revealed a strong link between the incidence of melanoma and the number of FM and TV transmission towers covering the area where the individuals lived Despite epidemiological correlations like this one suggesting the possibility that electromagnetic radiation from FM and TV broadcasts stations could suppress the immune system and promote cancer , the strength of these electromagnetic fields is so feeble it has been difficult to imagine any biological basis for the correlation Consider , however , that even a TV set cannot respond to broadcast transmissions unless the weak electromagnetic waves are captured and amplified by an appropriately designed antenna Antennas are simply metal objects of appropriate length sized to match the wavelength of a specific frequency of electromagnetic radiation Just as saxophones are made in different sizes to resonate with and amplify particular wavelengths of sound , electromagnetic waves are selectively amplified by metal objects that are the same , half or one quarter of the wavelength of an electromagnetic wave of a specific frequency Electromagnetic waves resonate on a half wavelength antenna to create a standing wave with a peak at the middle of the antenna and a node at each end , just as when a string stretched between two points is plucked at the center In the U S bed frames and box springs are made of metal , and the length of a bed is exactly half the wavelength of FM and TV transmissions that have been broadcasting since the late 1940s In Japan most beds are not made of metal , and the TV broadcast system does not use the 87 to 108 megahertz frequency used in Western countries Thus , as we sleep on our coil spring mattresses , we are in effect sleeping on an antenna that amplifies the intensity of the broadcast FM TV radiation Asleep on these antennas , our bodies are exposed to the amplified electromagnetic radiation for a third of our life spans As we slumber on a metal coil spring mattress , a wave of electromagnetic radiation envelops our bodies so that the maximum strength of the field develops 75 centimeters above the mattress in the middle of our bodies When sleeping on the right side , the body 's left side will thereby be exposed to field strength about twice as strong as what the right side absorbs If this study is correct , the solution is simple Replace the metal in our beds with a nonmetallic mattress or orient your bed , like an antenna , away from the direction of the local FM TV transmission tower Call it high tech feng shui if you like , but if this new study has not identified the cause of left side cancer , it will , for some , be the cause of insomnia ABOUT THE AUTHOR R Douglas Fields , Ph D is the Chief of the Nervous System Development and Plasticity Section at the National Institute of Child Health and Human Development and Adjunct Professor at the University of Maryland , College Park Fields , who conducted postdoctoral research at Stanford University , Yale University , and the NIH , is Editor in Chief of the journal Neuron Glia Biology and member of the editorial board of several other journals in the field of neuroscience He is the author of the new book The Other Brain \( Simon and Schuster \) , about cells in the brain \( glia \) that do not communicate using electricity His hobbies include building guitars , mountain climbing , and scuba diving He lives in Silver Spring , Md The views expressed are those of the author and are not necessarily those of Scientific American Image credit iStockphoto",false

"More than 3 , 000 homicides were committed by illegal aliens over the past six years Rick Perry on Thursday , July 17th , 2014 in an interview with Glenn BeckRick Perry claim about 3 , 000 homicides by illegal immigrants not supported by state figuresBy W Gardner Selby on Wednesday , July 23rd , 2014 at 4 58 p m Texas Gov Rick Perry expressed concern about border crossing immigrants committing crimes , going on to tell Glenn Beck in a July 17 , 2014 , interview the number of illegal activities up to and including homicides I think over 3 , 000 homicides by illegal aliens over the course of the last six years that 's unacceptable and that 's the reason that we have to secure that border That sounded like a lot of killings by unauthorized residents \( Where were those headlines \? \) Perry 's backupWe decided to put Perry 's number to the Texas Truth O Meter , starting with Perry spokeswoman Lucy Nashed , who told us to consult the Texas Department of Public Safety DPS Director Steve McCraw referred to that many homicides in his July 3 , 2014 , testimony to the U S House Committee on Homeland Security After saying the consequences of an unsecured border with Mexico undermine public safety , McCraw said Another consequence seldom discussed is the high number of criminal aliens arrested for non immigration crimes throughout Texas He then mentioned over 3 , 000 homicides since 2008 Asked for elaboration , a DPS spokesman , Tom Vinger , pointed to an agency web page , Texas Criminal Alien Arrest Data , stating that since January 2012 , a monthly average of 5 , 899 foreign nationals individuals legally authorized to live in the U S or not have been arrested in Texas , with 40 percent having been arrested before on a criminal charge Also on the page From October 2008 through July 1 , 2014 , Texas has identified a total of 203 , 685 unique criminal alien defendants booked into Texas county jails Over their criminal careers , these defendants are responsible for at least 642 , 564 individual criminal charges mostly consisting of Class B misdemeanors or higher , including 3 , 070 homicides and 7 , 964 sexual assaults , the agency says The web page includes a pie chart tallying the criminal charges accumulated by the defendants Source Web page , Texas Criminal Alien Arrest Data , Texas Department of Public Safety \( accessed July 21 , 2014 \) The last line on the page says these are minimum figures as these numbers include only those aliens whose fingerprints were already in the federal system when they were booked and it does not necessarily include all those who are incarcerated in federal prison We asked Vinger for more detail about the homicide charges We especially wondered how many charges had been leveled since the flow of children crossing the border started to escalate in 2011 Vinger replied by email , We do n't have any additional information Outside criminologistsNext , we explored whether Perry accurately cited the DPS information To rehash , the governor told Beck more than 3 , 000 homicides had been committed by illegal aliens since 2008 However , the DPS web page does n't say that it does n't even specify when \( or where \) the 3 , 070 homicide charges in the criminal histories of all the alien individuals arrested in Texas since October 2008 accumulated Via the John Jay College of Criminal Justice in New York , we reached criminologists who looked over the DPS presentation Michael Walker , an adjunct John Jay professor and an expert in how the FBI gathers crime statistics , said the DPS information does n't demonstrate the 3 , 000 plus homicides were committed by any residents since 2008 Rather , Walker said by phone , the presentation telescoped the arrest histories of the 203 , 685 individuals put in county jails in the 69 months that were reviewed Where did they offend Texas \? Oklahoma \? Mississippi \? Walker said , his point being such information is n't on the web page Walker and Ramiro Martinez , Jr , a Northeastern University professor , each suggested it 's highly unlikely unauthorized residents committed that many homicides in the years mentioned by Perry Drawing on FBI Uniform Crime Statistics for Texas posted online by the DPS , Walker calculated that from 2008 through 2012 , there were 3 , 903 persons arrested on homicide charges in the state Walker said it 's not logical that residents in the state without legal permission accounted for most of the same deaths He conceded , too , he was n't able to roll in homicide charges from 2013 and 2014 he did n't see that data online nor were we successful in eliciting figures from DPS Martinez offered up his own analysis , which started by averaging the FBI 's tally of a little more than 1 , 100 homicides in Texas in 2011 and 2012 and extrapolating that over six years to reach an estimated total of nearly 6 , 700 homicides over most of the period analyzed by DPS By email , Martinez said Perry 's statement to Beck potentially would suggest 3 , 070 , or 46 percent , of the estimated homicides were committed by illegal aliens But , he said , that makes no sense He said in a follow up email It just boggles the imagination that level of aliens' were involved to that extent over time and nobody noticed The criminologists noted another weakness the DPS presentation mixes together recent homicide charges with those that might have been leveled decades ago Also , they noted , the agency tallied arrests only , not homicide convictions Martinez also raised an eyebrow at the mingling of criminal charges against legally authorized U S residents and individuals in the country without permission , risking conclusions irrelevant to border security today By the state 's approach , he said , it 's possible a homicide charge in the tally involves someone who reached the U S from Cuba in 1962 who was later charged with and or committed a homicide If so , he said , that charge would bear no relevance to criminal actions by people lately crossing the Rio Grande Neither the DPS or Perry 's office offered more information Our rulingPerry told Beck over 3 , 000 homicides were committed by illegal aliens over the last six years This claim is unsupported by the presentation he relied on , which indicates that since 2008 in Texas , more than 200 , 000 arrested immigrants foreign nationals living here with or without legal permission had among them accumulated 3 , 070 homicide charges \( not convictions \) in their lives Put another way , for this declaration to hold water , one would have to assume illegal immigrants committed nearly half of the state 's homicides since 2008 we found no such data This statement is both incorrect and ridiculous Pants on Fire !

"Staff Report August 11 , 2016By KIM MCCRAYOur Health Matters And when you vote for Amendment 2 , not only are you voting for a medication that is proven to help people with cancer , HIV AIDS , glaucoma , PTSD , MS and more , but you 're also voting for positive change in the community Now , the opponents of Amendment 2 have taken on a tone similar to Donald Trump instilling fear through saturating the media with misinformation For example , the opponents to this amendment have touted that states like Colorado \( who successfully passed a similar bill \) have experienced a higher use of marijuana among 10th graders But if you look at studies from noteworthy organizations such as the International Journal of Drug Policy , Colorado Department of Public Safety and Lancet Psychiatry to see the difference between adolescent use before and after passing a medical marijuana law , the level of misuse for that demographic went down Therefore I would strongly encourage you not to get caught up by those types of scare tactics while considering the many benefits that passing this bill will bring to people you deeply care about What is also important to know is that although some debilitated patients may require higher levels of THC than others based on their specific medical condition , medical grade marijuana alone , will not get that patient high , no matter what level of THC , CBD or any other compound is found in the plant And unlike the rumors floating around , medical grade marijuana does not have to be smoked to be effective It also comes in various other forms such as an ointment , oil , pill and skin patch I'm reminded of Bridgette Wilkie from Orlando Bridgette is a mother , wife and entrepreneur She suffers from sickle cell anemia and lives with chronic pain that most people cannot imagine Bridgette is taking elephant doses of Oxycontin and Oxycodone and still , there are days when she cannot get out of bed to see her daughter off to school because the pain is just too unbearable The narcotics that are prescribed for Bridgette have terrible side effects on her organs that make her overall condition worse It would be great if she could have access to other effective and safer alternative treatments like medical grade marijuana , without making her high Doctors should not be restricted from utilizing other safer and well proven treatment methods when patients like Bridgette have such painful reactions to the narcotics typically prescribed for people in her condition As you may know , current state regulations in Florida do not necessarily prevent doctors from prescribing \( or over prescribing \) other drugs such as Morphine , Xanax , Oxycontin and other potentially deadly medications that are much more likely to be habit forming By supporting Amendment 2 , you will help to ensure the right level of oversight in how medical grade marijuana will be prescribed and distributed In fact , one of the key provisions of this amendment is that only licensed physicians can recommend medical grade marijuana and will be held accountable if they are found to be negligent Think about the people in your life , your church or community who will begin to finally find comfort and relief when Amendment 2 passes Furthermore , history shows that when a state enacts a medical marijuana law , first time \( and ongoing \) use among teens in that state goes down So when we go to the ballot box , we need to vote YES to prevent Florida politics from over reaching at the expense of people like Bridgette \( or our veterans , cancer patients , those suffering from AIDS and others \) who could benefit greatly from a safer , more effective and more controlled medical alternative Kim McCray is the Outreach Director for United For Care She can be reached atmccray unitedforcare org",false

and the authors of the Moneyball for Government chapter Foreign Assistance and the Revolution of Rigor Gerson , an opinion columnist for The Washington Post , served as an assistant to President George W Bush for policy and planning Shah served as USAID administrator under President Barack Obama We have entered the era of America first with only a vague understanding of its meaning President Trump 's inaugural address signaled an ambitious nationalist reimagining of the post World War II international order Trump 's foreign policy team , in contrast , seems to spring from that order The resulting uncertainty is global and dangerous Vacuums of leadership are not generally filled by the good guys The administration 's policy shift is most evident so far in the areas of trade and refugees Trump prefers less of both Given a narrowed conception of national interest and the president 's discomfort with the idea of nation building , foreign assistance would seem a natural next target Persistent rumors that the administration is mulling major cuts at the U S Agency for International Development \( USAID \) have heightened this speculation Although Trump has n't spoken much on this topic , some of his comments have reflected an inclination to pull back It is necessary that we invest in our infrastructure , stop sending foreign aid to countries that hate us and use that money to rebuild our tunnels , roads , bridges and schools , he said when he announced his candidacy And in a March 2016 interview with the Washington Post editorial board , he said I watched as we built schools in Iraq and they 'd be blown up And we 'd build another one , and it would get blown up And yet we ca n't build a school in Brooklyn We have no money for education , because we ca n't build in our own country And at what point do you say , hey , we have to take care of ourselves Yet Trump has also added notes of ambiguity In August , he told the Miami Herald that Congress should increase funding to fight the Zika virus abroad In September , he underlined the importance of ensuring clean water for everyone in the world In October , he stated that we 're going to lead the way on AIDS relief In this case , Trump 's better angels would do more to serve the country than his budget cutters Putting foreign assistance on the chopping block would be a serious mistake , by any definition of the national interest Let 's begin by getting the facts straight Surveys have shown that many Americans assume the country spends upwards of 20 percent of the federal budget on foreign aid In reality , nonmilitary foreign assistance including all of America 's work on international development and global health represents less than 1 percent of the federal budget Slashing this tiny category of discretionary spending for the sake of budget control would be a form of deception a sideshow to avoid truly important \( and unpopular \) budgetary choices For less than 1 percent of the federal budget , the United States led a global coalition to fight HIV AIDS when the disease threatened to devastate and destabilize much of the African continent Battling another of the world 's most lethal killers , malaria , U S led global programs have saved more than 6 million lives , mainly children under 5 years old America also led a global effort to support agriculture when the food , fuel and financial crisis of 2008 pushed nearly 100 million people back into a state of chronic hunger and extreme poverty As of 2015 , that effort had directly benefited nearly 19 million rural households and reached more than 12 million children with nutrition programs And America led a global partnership to bring power to half a billion people in Africa who have too often lived , worked , studied and given birth in the dark This established impact runs up against a durable stereotype that foreign assistance is routinely bundled in large bills and thrown down rat holes of waste and corruption The charge is not entirely without historical root During the Cold War , foreign assistance had some remarkable successes , including the Marshall Plan and the Green Revolution , but also notable failures such as aid to Vietnam and to dictators in Central America In Africa , assistance sometimes went to strongmen such as Mobutu Sese Seko of Zaire , mainly because of a strategic chess game against the Soviet Union , not because he was spurring development But over the past two decades and past two presidential administrations , health and development spending has evolved into a rigorous , innovative and professional enterprise dedicated to measured outcomes Aid and development practitioners know how to set smart targets , engage private sector partners , adapt to changing circumstances and make sure taxpayers get the most value for their investments And they have evidence that what they are doing works Most U S foreign assistance no longer even goes to foreign governments It is given to U S companies and nonprofits in the form of contracts and grants these organizations then implement projects in other countries , employing a combination of American and foreign staff members and often partnering with institutions of civil society But why does this emphasis on rigor and outcomes matter to U S foreign policy \? How does foreign assistance serve definable American interests \? Many of our most dangerous global challenges such as terrorism , the drug trade and pandemic diseases gather strength in countries , or regions within countries , that are poorly governed , often corrupt , and marked by high levels of poverty , hunger and disease These places are incubators of risks to the United States Consider Ebola , which took root in the weak health systems of West Africa and threatened our nation and the world with death and panic Or the poverty and conflict in the Northern Triangle of Central America , which led to tens of thousands of child migrants trying to make their way to the United States on the tops of trains Or the collapse of sovereignty in Syria , which helped produce the Islamic State and a radiating , destabilizing flood of refugees into Jordan , Lebanon , Turkey and beyond Or the weak governments of South America , which are often unable to halt the flow of drugs that enter our country These are all very real consequences of poverty , instability and poor governance But gains in hope , health and stability reduce these threats and better protect Americans A forward leaning Ebola response , employing America 's full epidemiological and humanitarian capacity , helped save lives in Africa and prevented the outbreak from spreading around the globe In the Northern Triangle , our partnerships have helped reduce gang violence and stem the flow of unaccompanied minors to the United States The Syrian crisis continues apace , but our massive humanitarian support for those displaced and in dire need reduces the pressure of refugee migrations to many nations , including our own One of the best examples of the strategic role of aid has been in Colombia , where criminal gangs , violent conflict and the world 's largest production of cocaine threatened to destabilize the region and the world for decades In the late 1990s and early 2000s , the United States had a large security budget in Colombia and a small budget for development assistance Then the Colombians embraced a greater focus on long term development , which they integrated into their stabilization plans when territory was taken back from rebels U S development assistance was increased , then integrated and properly sequenced with defense activities As soon as landmines were cleared and local officials could safely return to liberated towns , USAID poured in assistance , which was crucial to consolidate gains Those long term investments are now paying off , supporting peace negotiations and helping to reintegrate former rebels and displaced civilians , in addition to improving business opportunities for U S firms U S foreign assistance in Colombia gave stability and peace a fighting chance , and helped remedy a serious security problem for the United States and its allies This type of foreign assistance is essential to preventing the kind of uncontainable strategic threats that might eventually require military intervention \( We are not talking here about humanitarian assistance , which should be driven entirely by the nature and scale of the need , or about direct military aid \) Defense Secretary Jim Mattis made a compelling case for conflict prevention when he was head of U S Central Command If you do n't fund the State Department fully , then I need to buy more ammunition A small investment in foreign assistance today saves big on defense later An America first approach to foreign assistance could mean deploying foreign aid even more rigorously to help keep America safe , rather than a simple retreat How do we create an aid system that uses big data to identify areas of weak governance that may produce global threats \? One that systematically employs the full spectrum of assistance \? One that uses information on measured outcomes to adjust policies and practices in real time \? And one that ultimately builds local capacity to confront problems \? There are specific actions the new administration can take to deliver on this vision It should designate a coordinator for development who is empowered to ensure results from U S foreign assistance programs This coordinator could be the new USAID administrator or the secretary of state himself but it must be someone who sits at the principals table at the National Security Council and has the clear backing of the White House He or she would need to review existing efforts and determine how they match rising threats To avoid being just another layer of bureaucracy , such an official should be authorized to move budget resources between the State Department , USAID and the Defense Department as necessary to effectively prevent conflicts Under these circumstances , aid should be categorized in the budget as national security spending , not non defense discretionary spending And the Trump national security team should make sure American leadership on these issues remains the bipartisan priority it has been for decades , starting with proposing and defending a strong budget commitment to these efforts right now The next few months could mark a turning point for foreign assistance , and it matters greatly what kind We could see the erosion of support for a cost effective instrument of foreign policy and national influence and we would see the consequences of such negligence later , probably in the form of military commitments or we could see a reform that makes foreign assistance a reflection of American ideals and a rigorous instrument of American interests The latter is a worthy and necessary goal for a great nation Michael Gerson is a nationally syndicated columnist who appears twice weekly in The Post",true

"You are here Home The College Speaks Position Statements of the College Health Issues New Concerns about the Human Papillomavirus VaccineNew Concerns about the Human Papillomavirus VaccineAmerican College of Pediatricians January 2016The American College of Pediatricians \( The College \) is committed to the health and well being of children , including prevention of disease by vaccines It has recently come to the attention of the College that one of the recommended vaccines could possibly be associated with the very rare but serious condition of premature ovarian failure \( POF \) , also known as premature menopause There have been two case report series \( 3 cases each \) published since 2013 in which post menarcheal adolescent girls developed laboratory documented POF within weeks to several years of receiving Gardasil , a four strain human papillomavirus vaccine \( HPV4 \) 1 , 2 Adverse events that occur after vaccines are frequently not caused by the vaccine and there has not been a noticeable rise in POF cases in the last 9 years since HPV4 vaccine has been widely used Nevertheless there are legitimate concerns that should be addressed \( 1 \) long term ovarian function was not assessed in either the original rat safety studies3 , 4 or in the human vaccine trials , \( 2 \) most primary care physicians are probably unaware of a possible association between HPV4 and POF and may not consider reporting POF cases or prolonged amenorrhea \( missing menstrual periods \) to the Vaccine Adverse Event Reporting System \( VAERS \) , \( 3 \) potential mechanisms of action have been postulated based on autoimmune associations with the aluminum adjuvant used1 and previously documented ovarian toxicity in rats from another component , polysorbate 80 , 2 and \( 4 \) since licensure of Gardasil in 2006 , there have been about 213 VAERS reports \( per the publicly available CDC WONDER VAERS database \) involving amenorrhea , POF or premature menopause , 88 of which have been associated with Gardasil 5 The two strain HPV2 , CervarixTM , was licensed late in 2009 and accounts for 4 7 of VAERS amenorrhea reports since 2006 , and 8 5 of those reports from February 2010 through May 2015 This compares to the pre HPV vaccine period from 1990 to 2006 during which no cases of POF or premature menopause and 32 cases of amenorrhea were reported to VAERS Many adolescent females are vaccinated with influenza , meningococcal , and tetanus vaccines without getting Gardasil , and yet only 5 6 of reports related to ovarian dysfunction since 2006 are associated with such vaccines in the absence of simultaneous Gardasil administration The overwhelming majority \( 76 \) of VAERS reports since 2006 with ovarian failure , premature menopause , and or amenorrhea are associated solely with Gardasil When VAERS reports since 2006 are restricted to cases in which amenorrhea occurred for at least 4 months and is not associated with other known causes like polycystic ovary syndrome or pregnancy , 86 89 cases are associated with Gardasil , 3 89 with CervarixTM , and 0 89 with other vaccines administered independently of an HPV vaccine 5 Using the same criteria , there are only 7 reports of amenorrhea from 1990 through 2005 and no more than 2 of those associated with any one vaccine type Few other vaccines besides Gardasil that are administered in adolescence contain polysorbate 80 6 Pre licensure safety trials for Gardasil used placebo that contained polysorbate 80 as well as aluminum adjuvant 2 , 7 Therefore , if such ingredients could cause ovarian dysfunction , an increase in amenorrhea probably would not have been detected in the placebo controlled trials Furthermore , a large number of girls in the original trials were taking hormonal contraceptives which can mask ovarian dysfunction including amenorrhea and ovarian failure 2 Thus a causal relationship between human papillomavirus vaccines \( if not Gardasil specifically \) and ovarian dysfunction cannot be ruled out at this time Numerous Gardasil safety studies , including one released recently , 8 have looked at demyelinating and autoimmune diseases and have not found any significant problems Unfortunately , none of them except clinical safety pre licensure studies totaling 11 , 778 vaccinees9 specifically addressed post vaccination ovarian dysfunction While data from those studies do not indicate an increased rate of amenorrhea after vaccination , the essential lack of saline placebos and the majority of participants taking hormonal contraceptives in those studies preclude meaningful data to rule out an effect on ovarian function A Vaccine Safety Datalink POF study is planned to address an association between these vaccines and POF , but it may be years before results will be determined Plus , POF within a few years of vaccination could be the tip of the iceberg since ovarian dysfunction manifested by months of amenorrhea may later progress to POF Meanwhile , the author of this statement has contacted the maker of Gardasil , the Advisory Committee on Immunization Practices \( ACIP \) , and the Food and Drug Administration \( FDA \) to make known the above concerns and request that \( 1 \) more rat studies be done to look at long term ovarian function after HPV4 injections , \( 2 \) the 89 VAERS reports identified with at least 4 months amenorrhea be reviewed by the CDC for further clarification since the publicly available WONDER VAERS database only contains initial reports , and \( 3 \) primary care providers be notified of a possible association between HPV and amenorrhea A U S Government Representative responded that they will continue to conduct studies and monitor the safety of HPV vaccines Should the weight of the evidence from VAERS or VSD and other sources indicate a likely causal association between POF and HPV vaccines , appropriate action will be taken in terms of communication and public health response The College is posting this statement so that individuals considering the use of human papillomavirus vaccines could be made aware of these concerns pending further action by the regulatory agencies and manufacturers While there is no strong evidence of a causal relationship between HPV4 and ovarian dysfunction , this information should be public knowledge for physicians and patients considering these vaccines Primary author Scott S Field , MDJanuary 2016The American College of Pediatricians is a national medical association of licensed physicians and healthcare professionals who specialize

"Special to the NJJNFebruary 28 , 2008John Hudson is a man with a mission Seven years ago , the 54 year old social theorist embarked on a literary adventure , following a long nursed hunch about Shakespeare 's true identity Hudson had spent most of his adult life grappling with complex questions that straddled the fields of social theory and cognitive science , creating high level strategic redesign for the energy , telecommunications , Internet , and public sectors Most of my work involved helping media companies rethink their industries , says Hudson Now I 've moved on to rethinking the Shakespearean industry With his life and plays comprising a billion dollar global industry , says Hudson , the Bard has managed to secure a sublime place in literary history as well as an omnipresence in pop culture and media But , like all industries , it rests on certain assumptions , says Hudson It is these very assumptions primarily about who the author of the plays really was that Hudson set about to reinvent Hudson had an uneasy feeling that there was more beneath the plays' surface than was brought to light by scholars and historians His search began in earnest after he enrolled in a postgraduate program at the Shakespeare Institute at the University of Birmingham in Stratford upon Avon , naturally where he spent four years delving into the texts He gradually devised the latest approach to Shakespearean authorship , the Amelia Bassano Theory recently recognized by the Shakespearean Authorship Trust as one of the top eight authorship theories The figure of Amelia Bassano Lanyer had turned up before in Shakespearean scholarship In 1973 , celebrated historian A L Rowse identified her as the actual Dark Lady of Shakespeare 's famed sonnets Bassano known as the first woman in England to have published a book of original poetry \( Salve Deus Rex Judaeorum , 1611 \) , which has been interpreted as an early feminist critique of the Christian Gospels was part of a family of Italian court musicians of Moroccan Semitic ancestry who lived as clandestine Jews Hudson explains that the unusual circumstances of Amelia 's upbringing accounted for her extraordinary education and literary sensitivity By age seven , she was adopted by the Countess of Kent , who provided her with a well rounded education , including studies in Greek , Latin , and the Bible By 13 , she became mistress to Lord Henry Hunsdon , the man in charge of the English theater and patron of the Lord Chamberlain 's Men the company that performed Shakespeare 's works The plays certainly suggest that their author had access to scholarly training as well as exposure to certain specific environments all of which coincide with Amelia 's biography The 2 , 000 musical references , for example , were her birthright the hundreds of references to plants , law , military life , and falconry could likely be the result of her involvement with Hunsdon Other subject matter in the plays echoes her childhood experiences But most important , Hudson discovered her key literary signatures in which Amelia left her name spread across various plays Her married name Lanier meaning falcon in French is spread across the two different versions of The Taming of the Shrew It is in the form of the central figure who is tamed like a falcon , together with her name Emila her father 's name , Baptista , and her husband 's name , Alphonso An Emillius and a Bassianus appear in Titus Andronicus as well But the most important signatures are those created after her husband 's death , between 1622 23 , when her full maiden name Aemilia Johnson Willough \( by \) Bassanio was spread across three Shakespearean plays , associated in each case with the standard image of the Renaissance poet Such a circumstance had little chance of being a mere coincidence She so badly wanted us to notice them , says Hudson , but nobody ever did Something revolutionaryThe next step for Hudson was to bring his case to the theater going public The first play he selected as a vehicle for his theory was A Midsummer Night 's Dream with its staging he intended to present the allegorical plot revealing the key subtextual layers indicative of Bassano 's Jewish authorship The challenge was to find the right people to do the job and convince them that he was on to something revolutionary Hudson is British , married to an American , and the couple often shuttles between London and New York It was there , in the fall of 2006 , that he set out to put together a theater group that had both the dramatic training and mental muscle to actualize his theories After a few months , Hudson had on board Mahayana Landowne , a Yale Drama School educated director Next he enrolled in a Shakespeare Boot Camp workshop at the New Perspectives Theatre Company , where he befriended Jenny Greeman , an experienced actress and theater educator who was to become his assistant director I found his theory compelling , said Greeman , and the figure of Amelia Bassano is absolutely fascinating She is someone who needs to be spoken about much more I am thoroughly ready to believe that she could have written these plays Translating Hudson 's esoteric theory into concepts and then into practice involved hours of improvisation between actors , directors , and dramaturge \( Hudson 's official title \) I was happy to adopt a hands off management style when it came to staging the plays and leave it to those who truly understood the physicality of the theater , he said Yet , when it came to selecting actors for his new troupe , The Dark Lady Players , he made a point of meeting extensively with each actor to ensure that they were willing to think about the plays allegorically and took a proactive role at the dramatic workshops Lila Dupree , who played Theseus , feels that the DLP achieved a group dynamic unlike any she had experienced before It is definitely a struggle at times to condense things so that they will be visually clear and clean With something this high concept , you risk alienating the audience , so a lot of our process involves finding ways to break down that fourth wall , so to speak Dupree is one of about 15 actors in the troupe , representing an eclectic melting pot' of theatrical backgrounds What they all share is Shakespearean training buttressed by a voracious appetite for intellectually rigorous work The DLP is now testing its version of As You Like It in workshops Also in the pipeline is Hudson 's biography of Amelia Bassano , as well as a documentary film deal With all the exciting attention on the horizon , the troupe feels wholly committed to its mission of presenting new and thought provoking interpretations of Shakespeare 's \( or Bassano 's \) plays We 've learned a lot from our experience with Midsummer , says Dupree , and with As You Like It , we are ready to take it to the next level To order a DVD of the Dark Lady Players'

Night 's Dream , John Hudson 's objective was , first and foremost , to reveal the play as a Jewish satire rife with pointed references to Christian idolatry In other words , comedy as revenge John Hudson carried out a literary adventure and brought it to the stage In his findings , each character is revealed to have a connection with a character in religious allegory , i e , a double in the Roman Christian world Stanford University professor Patricia Parker had already shown that Puck carries the name of two devils , that Bottom represents Jesus \( and , in the course of the play , undergoes a kind of Passion \) , and that Thisbe represents the Church Hudson completed the puzzle to show that Oberon is the figure of Yahweh \( God of the Jews \) , who is embroiled in the Jewish Roman war against Titus Caesar \( embodied by Titania \) over the abduction of the true Jewish Messiah \( the Iudean or Indian' boy \) the flower , love in idleness \( a pun on idolatry \) , represents the Gospels and the end of the play is a Jewish apocalypse characterized by the distribution of dew as in the Zohar The Dark Lady Players debuted Midsummer Night 's Dream in March 2007 at

"For a man in San Diego , getting bitten by a rattlesnake was just the beginning of his problems The life threatening encounter was followed by a shocking medical bill 153 , 000 for his treatment Todd Fassler was bitten earlier this month , reportedly while trying to pose for a selfie with the snake Like most snake bite victims , Fassler needed many doses of the antivenom CroFab , the only current drug available to counteract the potentially deadly snake venom Bites from less poisonous snakes can require as little as three doses , but the most toxic poisonous snake bites can take dozens of doses A California boy bitten by an highly toxic snake in 2012 required 42 vials of antivenom , and some patients need even more The only effective treatment is antivenom , Dr Keith Boesen , director of the Arizona Poison Drug Information Center , told CBS News There 's blood tests we can do to determine the effect of the venom Hospital bills can always be worked out or negotiated , but you ca n't really negotiate , other than prosthetics , the loss of part of your hand or your arm Boesen said he knew of one snake bite victim in Arizona who required 74 vials of antivenom The wholesale rate that hospitals pay to the manufacturer is 2 , 500 per vial and the markup to patients and insurance is much higher Fassler 's bill included a line item of 83 , 341 25 for pharmacy to cover the antivenom , as reporter Dan Haggerty of KGTV in San Diego posted on Twitter According to the original report , Fassler used up the antivenom supply from two hospitals Remember the Rattlesnake bite story I did Monday \? Guy just sent me this pic of his bill Uhhhhhhh pic twitter com ahK2W9KxVg Dan Haggerty \( 10NewsHaggerty \) July 16 , 2015 Part of the reason the bill is large for most snake bite victims is because there is only one manufacturer and limited supply of the antivenom In addition , a snake bite requires emergency room treatment , a few days in the hospital intensive care unit and sometimes therapy to recover function of the damaged body part Between 7 , 000 and 8 , 000 people are bitten by venomous snakes in the U S every year , according to the CDC and , of those , about 5 will die The vast majority of people seek and have access to medical attention where they quickly receive antivenom , also known as antivenin New antivenoms are in development including one recently approved by the FDA called Anavip , which Boesen 's group helped test Boesen calls Arizona the evenomation capital of the country because they treat so many poisonous reptile and insect bites The problem may become even more common as snakes become bolder searching for water in drought stricken states in the West He said the longer snake bite victims wait before receiving the antivenom , the more damage they will sustain For a person who is bitten , a snake bite start simply as puncture wounds , then the swelling and tissue die off visibly creeps up the extremity At the same time , the venom prevents the blood from clotting , causing bleeding problems and pronounced bruises All those responses can cause serious and permanent damage to the bitten area You 'll see it progress an inch an hour It 's almost at a visible pace where you 're watching your arm swell We 'll give antivenom to make that swelling stop , so it will stop progressing , said Boesen There is no drug that can reverse the damage , we can only prevent it from getting worse Death is very rare since antivenom has been available in the U S since the 1950s , he noted But faster treatment will mean less damage and less time for the substantial recovery process , which can take weeks to months So if someone , for example , does n't have any insurance and is afraid of a hospital , I would be much more afraid of losing my hand or my arm than an expensive hospital bill , he said",true

"PolitiFact Sheet 8 things to know about the Planned Parenthood controversyBy Will Cabaniss , Joshua Gillin on Wednesday , August 5th , 2015 at 11 32 a m The Center for Medical Progress , an anti abortion group , recorded undercover video of Dr Mary Gatter , Planned Parenthood Federation of America 's Medical Directors' Council president , discussing fetal tissue donations Controversial videos released by an anti abortion group have highlighted the murky guidelines for using fetal tissue for research purposes The group , called the Center for Medical Progress , has accused Planned Parenthood of selling aborted fetuses for a profit , a charge Planned Parenthood has denied One of its videos , recorded in secret and released July 14 , 2015 , shows members of the anti abortion group posing as tissue brokers discussing terms for procuring fetal tissue To some , it appeared that Planned Parenthood was proposing to illegally sell tissue , prompting lawmakers in several states to launch investigations and Republicans in Congress to attempt cutting off more than 500 million in federal money But Planned Parenthood maintains that its process is legal and limited to a handful of states Confused about what 's going on \? We 're here to help Here 's our rundown of eight things we know and do n't know about fetal tissue donation and Planned Parenthood 1 It is illegal to sell fetal tissue But donations are legal The National Institutes of Health Revitalization Act of 1993 allows a woman to consent to donating fetal tissue after an abortion The federal law sets restrictions that prevent the woman from knowing or having a say in how the tissue is used , or profiting from it Fetuses also ca n't be aborted for the specific purpose of using tissue , especially to sell it The option ca n't be discussed with the woman until after she has decided to have an abortion Researchers have used fetal tissue since the 1930s experimentation on the tissue was instrumental in eventually developing the polio vaccine Current studies are using the tissue to research diseases like AIDS , muscular dystrophy and Parkinson 's disease 2 The law allows for reasonable fees to cover the group 's costs of donating the tissue Part of the video shows Deborah Nucatola , senior director of medical services at the Planned Parenthood Federation of America , telling undercover activists that tissues can be obtained for fees in the 30 to 100 range Activists against abortion rights point to this as proof that Planned Parenthood is selling the body parts of aborted children But the 1993 law also makes allowances for reasonable payments associated with the transportation , implantation , processing , preservation , quality control , or storage of human fetal tissue The fees Nucatola discusses in the video likely fall under that definition , experts told PolitiFact 3 Nothing specifies how much appropriate fees should be What counts as a reasonable payment is not explicitly outlined in the law Organizations do n't have to publicly report how much they are charging buyers that process the tissue and isolate specific cells before selling them to researchers Activists in the videos were posing as brokers and went back and forth with Nucatola to get her to disclose Planned Parenthood 's fees The amounts she cites do not appear to be out of the ordinary , but no one knows because there is no registry or compendium of fees charged by organizations \( or \) institutions supplying fetal tissue , said Arthur Caplan , director of the Division of Medical Ethics at New York University 's Langone Medical Center When she haggles about fees , that does not appear to me to be trying to profit 4 There are no regulations for what brokers charge researchers , either While abortion clinics or hospitals sometimes provide tissue directly to researchers , organizations or private companies like the tissue brokers mentioned above often act as middlemen Profiteering may be occurring on this level , Caplan said Caplan said brokers can resell tissue to researchers at what seem like fairly high markups , but regulations do n't exist on fees , so what they charge is set by market California based StemExpress is one such broker and is cited in one of the Center for Medical Progress videos as contracting with Planned Parenthood for fetal tissue The company charges fees for many kinds of human cells , from 100 for a vial of peripheral blood to 24 , 000 for a vial of highly concentrated fetal liver cells The company reported 2 2 million in revenue in 2013 , according to a profile in Inc Magazine Prue Talbot , the director of the Stem Cell Center at the University of California , Riverside , agreed with a StemExpress statement that said research methods and expensive medical equipment are expensive Talbot said skilled technicians that can isolate and preserve specific kinds of cells also command high salaries , driving up costs 5 Political pressure is driving the issue in some states Since the videos were released , at least 12 states , including Florida , Texas , Georgia and South Carolina , have called for investigations into the organization 's tissue program States follow the federal law , but Wisconsin legislators have vowed to ban fetal tissue donation in the fall Louisiana Gov Bobby Jindal , a presidential candidate , canceled his state 's contract with Planned Parenthood even though the two facilities in that state do n't offer abortion services It is against the law for any organization to sell body parts , Florida Gov Rick Scott said on July 29 If a Planned Parenthood office is not following the law , we will move quickly to take legal and regulatory action against them Florida 's health services agency announced Aug 5 that three facilities would be cited for performing second trimester abortions without a proper license and a fourth will be cited for improper recordkeeping following its investigation 6 Planned Parenthood says it only has donation programs in a few states But we do n't know which ones Planned Parenthood president Cecile Richards has said her organization conducts tissue donations in less than five states But no one not from Planned Parenthood , its state affiliates or companies that procure the stem cells will disclose the states where this happens A spokeswoman for the Planned Parenthood Federation of America , the organization 's national wing , cited security concerns So far , affiliates in Maine , Vermont , New Hampshire , Indiana and Florida have denied having any form of a tissue donation program 7 Federal law does not require Planned Parenthood to disclose this information on their tax forms You may think that because Planned Parenthood receives federal money , it has to disclose more information about its business , including the fetal tissue donation locations But that 's not the case Planned Parenthood is a network of affiliated organizations that cooperate with each other , led by the Planned Parenthood Federation of America As a registered 501 \( c \) \( 4 \) nonprofit , each affiliate only has to release a yearly tax report called a Form 990 On the 990 , those affiliates have to list their five largest contractors , but do n't have to provide any other details about their operations 8 Abortions do not make up the majority of Planned Parenthood 's services But neither do mammograms The tissue donation controversy has reignited the country 's abortion wars , with advocates and critics alike slinging statistics about what Planned Parenthood really does In a recent interview with GOP presidential candidate Mike Huckabee , Fox Business reporter Smith said almost 95 percent of all their pregnancy services were abortions That rates False The cherry picked statistic traces back to a political action committee that opposes abortion By the group 's measure , which considered only Planned Parenthood 's reported abortions , prenatal care services and adoption referrals , abortions made up 94 percent of Planned Parenthood 's pregnancy services But the majority of Planned Parenthood 's work does not focus on prenatal care , and the group does not keep records on how many pregnant women it refers to outside health care providers Democratic presidential candidate and former Maryland Gov Martin O'Malley went the opposite direction , telling reporters 97 percent of the work that Planned Parenthood does is about mammograms and preventative health That rates Half True The 97 percent figure accounts for services other than abortion , including contraception , STD testing and treatment , cancer screenings , and more Preventive care comprises about 85 to 90 percent of all their services Mammograms are part of that group , but Planned Parenthood does n't offer mammograms They perform breast exams and give referrals to outside clinics that provide mammograms Editor 's note Hours after this story was published , Florida announced the results of its investigation into Planned Parenthood The piece has been updated AdvertisementResearchers Anna Bruzgulis , Will Cabaniss , Lauren Carroll , Joshua GillinSources",true

"Post PoliticsTrump tells story about killing terrorists with bullets dipped in pigs' blood , though there 's no proof of itBy Jenna Johnson and Jose A DelReal By Jenna Johnson and Jose A DelReal Email the author February 20 , 2016 Email the author Follow wpjenna Follow jdelrealThis story has been updated NORTH CHARLESTON , S C To explain his support for waterboarding and other heavy handed interrogation tactics , Donald Trump told a rally audience a story Friday night that involved U S Gen John J Pershing , a terrorist attack in the Philippines more than a century ago , 50 terrorists and bullets dipped in pigs' blood It 's a tale that has circulated on the Internet for years and is most likely not true The story came up as Trump reiterated his support for waterboarding , the advanced interrogation technique that the Obama administration considers torture and has ceased using Earlier this week , Trump said he supports this controversial method , along with those that are much worse , because torture works Proponents of waterboarding have long been careful to not label it as torture , which is strictly forbidden by U S and international law Donald Trump 'Torture works' The big question is Is it torture or not \? Trump said at a rally at a convention center here , the night before the South Carolina primary It 's so borderline It 's like your minimal , minimal , minimal torture Trump criticized his Republican rivals for not embracing waterboarding as enthusiastically as he has , which he says sends the wrong message to terrorists who use barbaric techniques like chopping off the heads of their foes You know , I read a story it 's a terrible story , but I 'll tell you , Trump said Should I tell you \? Or should I not \? As the crowd cheered him on , Trump told them about Pershing rough guy , rough guy who was fighting terrorism in the early 1900s Trump did n't say where this happened , but variations of this story online usually state that it happened in the Philippines during the Philippine American War part of the island nation 's protracted battle for independence early in Pershing 's career They were having terrorism problems , just like we do , Trump said And he caught 50 terrorists who did tremendous damage and killed many people And he took the 50 terrorists , and he took 50 men and he dipped 50 bullets in pigs' blood you heard that , right \? He took 50 bullets , and he dipped them in pigs' blood And he had his men load his rifles , and he lined up the 50 people , and they shot 49 of those people And the 50th person , he said You go back to your people , and you tell them what happened And for 25 years , there was n't a problem Okay \?

"Says the health care reform bill was paid for , in part , by taking money from students and the student loan system Rob Portman on Saturday , April 28th , 2012 in a conference call with reportersRob Portman says student loan money was used to cover health care reformBy Stephen Koff on Monday , May 14th , 2012 at 6 00 a m Americans have their reasons for liking or disliking health care reform and its mandate to purchase insurance But Sen Rob Portman mentioned one that was new to us during a conference call with reporters He was actually talking about student loans , but in answer to a question from WSPD radio in Toledo , Portman said The truth is , by the way , you know part of the health care bill is paid for by the administration taking the difference of what \( interest rate \) they can borrow at , and what most students pay , and putting some of that money into the health care bill He repeated that we took from students and paid for a new entitlement program we ca n't afford And he rephrased it by saying the health care bill was paid for in part by taking money out of the student loan system Portman 's comments , made April 28 , were in support of a Republican proposal to extend low interest student loan rates \( 3 4 percent \) for another year Republican lawmakers would do that by taking money out of the 2010 health care law , the Patient Protection and Affordable Care Act Specifically , the money would come from a fund in the health bill that covers prevention and public health We 're not here to debate whether that 's good policy But Portman , acknowledging Tennessee Sen Lamar Alexander 's leadership role in the GOP proposal , suggested something fresh to our ears the notion that Obamacare , as it is commonly called , used student loan money PolitiFact Ohio decided to learn more Students once were considered a poor lending risk To prime the pump and expand educational opportunities , the federal government in 1965 decided to guarantee student loans against default The government also guaranteed a certain interest rate to the banks , even if the rates students paid were lower And the government paid additional fees to the banks for administration and collection of student loans This wound up providing a lucrative revenue stream for the banks , while putting millions of Americans through college But the system required billions of dollars in federal subsidies , and some in Washington , especially Democrats , started looking at alternatives What if the government cut out the middle man \( the banks \) and gave loans directly to students through their colleges' financial aid offices \? Those offices already helped process most loans anyway By getting rid of the subsidies , the government could save billions and use the money for more financial aid for needy students , Democrats said Various pilot programs were tried Some universities , including Ohio State , said they liked dealing directly with the government But plenty of others liked the special attention private lenders gave them , and the private lenders spent millions lobbying Congress to keep the subsidy system This debate dragged on for years Then in early 2010 , Democrats found the opening they needed to permanently move away from subsidizing the lenders It coincided with passage of the Affordable Care Act The Senate generally needs 60 votes to overcome filibusters and objections to legislation Democrats lacked that number So they decided to employ a seldom used tactic involving budgets and government spending , known as reconciliation Reconciliation only requires 51 votes That 's how Senate Democrats were able to pass a combined student loan health care bill , the Reconciliation Act of 2010 , on March 25 , 2010 , with 56 votes You might not have heard much about the student loan portion at the time , because health care , a monumental social initiative , consumed most of the oxygen in Washington But the two were connected through the reconciliation bill , which is where we come back to Portman 's claim Did one component , student loans , help pay for health care \? The answer is not as simple as it sounds According to the Congressional Budget Office , the government was going to save 58 billion from the student loan program , over a 10 year period , by eliminating the middle man That would provide enough money to put an additional 36 billion into Pell grants and 3 billion more into several other programs , including Historically Black Colleges and Universities Even after these investments , the government would have 19 billion left , the CBO said So was this 19 billion going into Obamacare \? That 's what Portman 's press secretary , Christine Mangi , initially suggested when we first asked about Portman 's statement The problem with that assumption is that the CBO did not show it that way It showed the 19 billion as savings , or a net reduction in the federal deficit And several budget experts we spoke with said that 's exactly where the 19 billion was going The CBO also showed 124 billion in additional savings from the health care portion of the reconciliation act , thanks to new revenue , taxes and projected savings on Medicare Mangi was skeptical of this projection , as are other Republicans , saying the health care provisions are certain to cost much more than assumed in 2010 , wiping out any savings Where will the money come from then \? It 'll come in part from the money the government got by changing its student loan program , she said She also noted that some private lenders used to provide interest rate reductions for borrowers , and new borrowers wo n't have that option That 's speculation , however , and such private bank incentives to students became fewer after the 2008 financial crisis Still , we sought out budget and education officials on this , and then we called Alexander 's office Alexander was secretary of education under President George H W Bush His staff referred us to other CBO figures , but that just led to more dispute among budget experts over how to interpret the numbers But then we found agreement from two key Senate offices on opposite sides of the aisle Alexander 's office drew our attention to a statement made by Democratic Sen Tom Harkin of Iowa , a leader on education issues On March 23 , 2010 , on the Senate floor Harkin said that by ending the subsidies to banks , the government would have more money for Pell grants and historically black colleges He also said that 10 billion would go for debt reduction Notice that he said 10 billion \? But wait was n't it supposed to be 19 billion , according to the CBO figures \? So where did the other 9 billion go \? It went to pay for a portion of health care reform , Alexander 's staff insisted We turned to the staff of the Senate Health , Education , Labor and Pensions Committee , which Harkin chairs And at last , there was common ground Harkin indeed said 10 billion would go for debt reduction The other 9 billion , said committee spokeswoman Justine Sessions , went to help pay for expansion of community health centers , prescription drug access , and consumer protections in insurance That 's 9 billion for health care out the student loan program With that , we return to Portman 's claim that health care reform was paid for in part by taking money out of the student loan system Portman 's statement is partially accurate The overall health care bill has hundreds of billions in features before revenue and tax offsets bring the costs down , if projections prove to be right We 're not here to debate whether they will Nine billion dollars is a tiny share But Portman said in part , and that 9 billion is destined for health care , so he 's right there But he suggested this is at the expense of students That 's a big leap , leaving out important detail and context The combined student loan health care bill did not reduce the amount of money that students can borrow It actually expanded the amount of money available for student aid What it reduced is the banks' share The money that was saved was n't money that was going into education it was money that was subsidizing private banks , Sessions , of the education committee , said in an email Period On the Truth O Meter , Portman 's claim rates Half True Advertisement",false

Monday September 12 , 2005 By MIKE FOSTER CAMBRIDGE , Mass Scared stiff astronomers have detected a mysterious mass they 've dubbed a chaos cloud that dissolves everything in its path , including comets , asteroids , planets and entire stars and it 's headed directly toward Earth ! Discovered April 6 by NASA 's Chandra X ray Observatory , the swirling , 10 million mile wide cosmic dust cloud has been likened to an acid nebula and is hurtling toward us at close to the speed of light making its estimated time of arrival 9 15 a m EDT on June 1 , 2014 The good news is that this finding confirms several cutting edge ideas in theoretical physics , announced Dr Albert Sherwinski , a Cambridge based astrophysicist with close ties to NASA The bad news is that the total annihilation of our solar system is imminent Experts believe the chaos cloud is composed of particles spawned near the event horizon of a black hole \( a form of what 's called Hawking Radiation \) that have been distorted by mangled information spewed from the hole A super massive black hole lies about 28 , 000 light years from Earth at the center of our galaxy , explained Dr Sherwinski Last year the eminent physicist Stephen Hawking revised his theory of black holes which previously held that nothing could escape the hole 's powerful gravitational field He demonstrated that information about objects that have been sucked in can be emitted in mangled form It now appears that mangled information can distort matter Just imagine our galaxy the Milky Way as a beautiful , handwritten letter Now imagine pouring a glass of water on the paper and watching the words dissolve as the stain spreads That 's what the chaos cloud does to every star or planet it encounters To avoid widespread panic , NASA has declined to make the alarming discovery public But Dr Sherwinski 's contacts at the agency 's Chandra X ray Observatory leaked to him striking images of the newly discovered chaos cloud obliterating a large asteroid It 's like watching a helpless hog being dissolved in a vat of acid , one NASA scientist told Dr Sherwinski Ordinarily , Hawkings Radiation is harmless It 's produced when an electron positron pair are at the event horizon of a black hole , Dr Sherwinski explained The intense curvature of space time of the hole can cause the positron to fall in , while the electron escapes But when infected by mangled information from the black hole , the particles become a chaos cloud , which in turn mangles everything it touches If it continues unchecked , the chaos cloud will eventually reduce our galaxy to the state of absolute chaos that existed before the birth of the universe , the astrophysicist warned Some scientists say mankind 's best hope would be to build a space ark and hightail it to the Andromeda Galaxy , 2 1 million light years away We would n't be able to save the entire human population , but perhaps the best and the brightest , observed British rocket scientist Dr David Hall , when asked about the feasibility of such a project But even if such a craft could be built in time , evacuating Earth might prove fruitless if theories about the origin of the chaos cloud are correct A black hole at the center of Andromeda is about 15 times the size of the one in our own galaxy , Dr Sherwinski noted It might be like jumping out of the frying pan into the fire Speaking under the condition of anonymity , a senior White House official said the president 's top science advisors are taking the findings in stride This is a lot like global warming , where the jury is still out on whether it 's real or not , said the official The existence of this so called chaos cloud is only a theory Americans should n't panic until all the facts are in Email Story Printable Version",false
"4 13 18 , Maine First Media Staff Report , It was a feel good vote that I suppose will make it appear that they voted to ban FGM they did not Those are the words of Republican Rep Karen Gerrish of Lebanon Rep Gerrish was reacting to news out of the Coliseum on the Kennebec that the Maine State House passed a ban Thursday on Female Genital Mutilation in the Pine Tree State However , the bill passed in the House was nothing more than political theater a show bill On Wednesday , the State Senate unanimously passed LD 1904 , the strict FGM ban holding the mutilator , consenting parents guardians and the transporters accountable for this barbaric form of child abuse That is not the bill the House passed First , the House brought forward one of the two minority reports from the Criminal Justice and Public Safety Committee that the bill ought not to pass ' And the motion almost prevailed In fact , 65 swamp creatures entirely made up of Democrats and independents voted AGAINST banning FGM Unfortunately , I am not surprised at all , said Rep Gerrish , the ranking Republican on the CJPS Committee What did surprise me was the unanimous support in the Senate , and I thank them for understanding the seriousness of the issue I did find it remarkable that 65 House members , primarily Democrats , supported the ought not to pass' motion I expected some to back that motion , but much less I expected maybe 25 or so of the far Left liberal Democrats to support killing the bill outright But 65 , wow Failing to kill the bill outright , Democrat leadership next brought forward the second of the minority report from the CJPS Committee This one being the controversial amended bill , removing penalties for all accomplices to the crime In addition , the bill was further amended to remove the word mutilation , from the definition of this so called Female Genital Mutilation ban The watered down , feckless ban passed with mostly party line support , in a 73 68 tally Not a single Republican voted for the toothless version of the ban Now the bill heads back to the Senate , where Senators will decide if they want to stick to the bill they passed unanimously , or accept the toothless House version Multiple sources at the Capitol tell Maine First Media they expect the Senate to insist on their own version of the bill The proposed ban would then go back to the House for one last chance to come to an agreement However , there is little optimism that will happen Ultimately , I believe it will die between the two bodies in non concurrence , Rep Gerrish said It 's a very sad state of affairs for young immigrant girls in Maine Votes like this have consequences November should be interesting Republican Rep Heather Sirocki who has been the leading champion fighting for a ban on Female Genital Mutilation was the first to bring to Maine First Media 's attention Thursday morning that our neighbors in New Hampshire had joined the ranks of states banning this brutal form of ritual child abuse New Hampshire passed strong anti FGM legislation this morning , Rep Sirocki said This is a huge victory as it 's the 27th state to step forward Unfortunately , it 's not looking like Maine will be the 28th To fully understand why the ban is next to meaningless without holding accomplices accountable , we recommend you read Rep Sirocki 's explanation in this previous Maine First Media article If you 're having a difficult time comprehending how any legislators could be against banning Female Genital Mutilation , the opposition has made their reasoning very clear They fear offending the immigrant community and being labeled racist Female Genital Mutilation is the ritual cutting or removal of some or all of the external female genitalia In some cultures , the vulva is sewn shut , only to be ripped open on the woman 's wedding night The practice is designed to curb sexual desire in women Along with significant health risk to the young girls , women who suffer Female Genital Mutilation are left with life long physical and emotional scarring To learn more about the horrific abuse , listen to FGM survivor , F A Cole 's testimony in front of the CJPS Committee Cole fights through a panic attack to share her story with Maine Legislators in the hope it would save young daughters of Maine immigrants from suffering through the same terrifying experience",false

"6 4 million more Americans living in poverty under President Obama David Dewhurst on Wednesday , April 4th , 2012 in an online videoDavid Dewhurst says poverty ranks up by 6 4 million under ObamaBy Meghan Ashford Grooms on Tuesday , April 10th , 2012 at 12 33 p m In this web video , 90 Rounds , Texas U S Senate candidate David Dewhurst criticizes Barack Obama for playing golf during economically difficult times In an online video suggesting that President Barack Obama plays golf while Americans suffer , U S Senate candidate David Dewhurst highlights the increase in the number of people living in poverty since Obama took office The ad from the Texas lieutenant governor shows video of Obama golfing or riding a golf cart along with snippets of others speaking about the nation 's economic troubles The video culminates with these claims , which appear in red letters 6 4 million more Americans living in poverty under President Obama and over 90 rounds of golf We 've already checked the sporty part of that claim , rating as True the statement that Obama has played more than 90 rounds of golf since he became president Here , we 'll focus on Dewhurst 's claim that the ranks of the poor have grown by 6 4 million As backup , Dewhurst 's campaign sent us a January 2012 editorial from the conservative Washington Examiner that says there are 6 4 million more Americans in poverty today than when Obama took office Dewhurst 's campaign also pointed us to a page from the website of the Senate Republican Conference , which consists of Republican members of the U S Senate The page dated April 2 , 2012 , and titled He 's Made it Worse The Obama Economic Record is presented as a comparison of conditions when Obama became president and today according to statistics such as the unemployment rate and the size of the federal debt Under Americans in Poverty , the page says there were 39 8 million on Obama 's inauguration day \( Jan 20 , 2009 \) and are 46 2 million today The difference 6 4 million people The page does not give a source for the poverty numbers , so we turned to the U S Census Bureau , which is the official federal source of poverty statistics The bureau uses a measure of poverty called the poverty thresholds to help determine the number of U S residents living in poverty If a family has an income below the relevant threshold , then the members of that family are considered to be living in poverty The bureau 's thresholds , which are adjusted annually for inflation , vary by family size For example , the preliminary figures for 2011 , which are the most recent thresholds , show that a family of four people would be considered to be living in poverty if it earned less than 23 , 018 through the year Alternatively , the 2011 threshold for single people younger than 65 is 11 , 702 The bureau 's thresholds are different from the poverty guidelines overseen by the U S Department of Health and Human Services , which are used to determine if applicants are eligible for government assistance programs Census Bureau spokesman Robert Bernstein told us that the bureau estimates the number of U S residents living in poverty on an annual basis The figure is based on a survey of a scientifically selected sample of about 100 , 000 households that takes place between February and April each year The survey asks respondents their income for the previous year And from the survey results , the bureau extrapolates the number of U S residents that were living in poverty that year The 2010 poverty statistics were released in September 2011 The next estimate of the number of U S residents living in poverty , for 2011 , is scheduled for release in September 2012 We should note that there have long been concerns about the bureau 's measure , which determines a person or family 's poverty status based on before tax cash income One of the primary identified weaknesses with this method is that it does not take into account government policies or benefits that can shrink a family 's income \( such as payroll taxes \) or enhance it \( such as food stamps \) Another criticism The thresholds are not adjusted to account for variations in the cost of living in different places We checked the bureau 's poverty figures to compare with the Senate Republican Conference 's data and found that the group was comparing the number of Americans in poverty in 2008 to the number in 2010 In other words , the Senate group used the bureau 's 2008 statistic 39 8 million for the number of people in poverty on Obama 's inauguration day in January 2009 And it used the 2010 statistic 46 2 million , the most recent for its count of poor Americans in April 2012 The bureau data show that the estimated number of U S residents in poverty in 2010 , Obama 's second year in office , was greater by 6 4 million than it was in 2008 , George W Bush 's final full year in office The largest increase came in 2009 , Obama 's first year in office , when the poverty total was 3 8 million higher than the year before In 2010 , the number was 2 6 million greater than the 2009 level The 46 2 million residents in poverty in 2010 amounted to the greatest number of Americans in the low income category since the government started tracking the statistic in 1959 But the recent increase did not start on Obama 's watch The number of Americans living in poverty , by the bureau 's measure , first creeped up in 2007 , when 800 , 000 more people were in poverty than the year before The subsequent 2008 increase 2 5 million people In fact , during Bush 's eight years as president , the estimated number of Americans in poverty rose every year but two We applied the Dewhurst campaign 's methodology to the Bush years , comparing the number of people in poverty the year before Bush took office \( 2000 \) with the number during his last full year in office \( 2008 \) We found an increase of 8 2 million people In making such comparisons , though , there is another , better way to judge change As PolitiFact noted in a previous fact check , because of population growth , it 's important to notice shifts in the share of all residents in poverty And during the years Dewhurst focused on , the portion of U S residents in poverty increased , although like the estimated number of people in poverty , the climb began in 2007 The figures 2006 12 3 percent 2007 12 5 percent \( 0 2 percentage point increase \) 2008 13 2 percent \( 0 7 percentage point increase \) 2009 14 3 percent \( 1 1 percentage point increase \) 2010 15 1 percent \( 0 8 percentage point increase \) The 2010 poverty rate of 15 1 percent was higher than that of every year for more than four decades , save two 1983 , when the rate was 15 2 percent , and 1993 , when it was the same as the 2010 figure , 15 1 percent A September 2011 New York Times news article about the 2010 poverty statistics said economists pointed to joblessness associated with the 2008 financial collapse and subsequent recession as the main factor pushing more Americans into poverty A final note Dewhurst implies that Obama is to blame for the rising number of people in poverty But our sense is that it 's unfair to place all the responsibility in the president 's lap The economic downturn began before Obama took office Also , poverty experts such as Sheldon Danziger , director of the National Poverty Center at the University of Michigan , say that more Americans would have been forced into poverty without the 2009 federal stimulus plan , championed by Obama , which included billions of dollars for programs that help low income Americans such as Medicaid and unemployment insurance More broadly , no single official controls the number of Americans living in poverty Our rulingDewhurst 's figures draw from a reliable source on Americans in poverty in 2010 which , of course , is not 2012 compared with 2008 , the year before Obama became president A better understanding of the extent of U S poverty lies in looking at the share of Americans in dire straits That measure also supports Dewhurst 's point that poverty has increased during Obama 's term Then again , the percentage of residents in poverty had begun to grow in 2007 , two years before Obama 's first in office Finally , it 's a reach to say Obama is personally to blame for the increase in poverty On balance , we rate Dewhurst 's statement Half True Advertisement",true

"\( Photo Hero Images Getty Images \) On June 27 , 2017 , my son Alec was found dead , alone in his Minneapolis apartment It should n't have happened Alec had Type 1 diabetes , a serious condition that is manageable with access to insulin and proper supplies But Alec turned 26 years old on May 20 of last year , which meant that his coverage under my health insurance policy ended a few days later Alec had a full time , steady job But , like a lot of US workers , he did not have good health insurance offered through his employer For Alec and others with diabetes , this presents a deadly situation Many people with type 2 diabetes need regular access to insulin to live all persons with Type 1 do Insulin is a 95 year old drug whose discoverers sold their patents for 1 each , but its price has increased over 1 , 000 percent since the late 1990s A vial of the same insulin that was once sold for around 25 can now cost patients like Alec nearly 300 , and many people need multiple vials per month to survive The pharmaceutical companies that sell insulin wo n't disclose any details , but it is likely that this same vial is manufactured for just a few dollars Which means that those companies are making huge profits and paying huge CEO salaries The three insulin manufacturers have raised their prices in lockstep for many years now , prompting a class action lawsuit and criminal investigations into collusion Additionally , the insurance industry is also complicit in the drug pricing scheme For Alec , this meant that his insulin and supplies cost almost 1 , 300 a month He and I together researched for months in advance about his health insurance options They were n't good The best plan we found would cost him 450 a month for the premium with a whopping 7 , 600 deductible That deductible meant he would be paying out of pocket for his medicine for many months anyway , so he decided to go without the plan until he could find a different job with benefits With the cost so high , Alec tried to ration his insulin I have since learned that this is not uncommon Globally , half of the people who need insulin ca n't reliably get access to it With 6 million people in the US insulin dependent , and nearly 40 percent of Americans uninsured or facing high deductibles that leave their medicine costs uncovered , the crisis is occurring right here , too Endocrinologists here in the US report that as many as one in five of their patients are not able to afford their insulin For many persons with diabetes , that means they land in the emergency room with diabetic ketoacidosis For others , like Alec , they never get there Just 27 days after his coverage under my insurance ended , I received the call no parent ever wants to get As you would imagine , my family and I are still grieving But I 've decided that sharing our story may help prevent someone else from going through what Alec did There are a lot of proposals to increase access to affordable health coverage and to lower the price of medicines , including forcing drug companies to be transparent about their research costs and profits , and allowing Medicare to negotiate down the price it pays for prescription drugs To me , they all boil down to one theme Access to insulin , and other life essential medicines , is a human right The inventor of insulin , Frederick Banting , believed that When he was asked why he gave away his patent for 1 , he replied , Because insulin does not belong to me It belongs to the world That spirit is being violated today , where there are thousands of GoFundMe pages devoted to people like Alec , desperately trying to cobble together the money they need for their monthly insulin There are a lot of good people working to change this , including US lawmakers But it seems clear to me that significant movement toward universal access to essential medicines will only come when the affected patients and their loved ones help lead the way So I was happy to see that people with diabetes in Nevada were able to help push through a law that requires transparency in insulin pricing there And that is why I support the patient group T1International s demand that insulin manufacturers disclose the profits they are making off of each vial and reverse their unjustified price increases That is why I shared Alec 's story at a recent demonstration led by Type 1 diabetes patients outside the headquarters of insulin manufacturer Eli Lilly and Company , demanding increased transparency and lower prices As I told the patients and activists gathered there , my Alec was the best son anyone could ask for He was loved by so many and I am so proud to have been his mom for the short 26 years I had with him But he should still be here I should not have buried my son at 26 because he could n't afford the one thing in life that was created to keep him alive",true

"Dear Ed 1 I think that such answer as I can give to your letter of November first will be arranged in reverse order at least I shall comment first on your final paragraph You keep harping on the Constitution I should like to point out that the meaning of the Constitution is what the Supreme Court says it is Consequently no powers are exercised by the Federal government except where such exercise is approved by the Supreme Court \( lawyers \) of the land 2 I admit that the Supreme Court has in the past made certain decisions in this general field that have been astonishing to me A recent case in point was the decision in the Phillips case 3 Others , and older ones , involved interstate commerce 4 But until some future Supreme Court decision denies the right and responsibility of the Federal government to do certain things , you cannot possibly remove them from the political activities of the Federal government Now it is true that I believe this country is following a dangerous trend when it permits too great a degree of centralization of governmental functions I oppose this in some instances the fight is a rather desperate one But to attain any success it is quite clear that the Federal government cannot avoid or escape responsibilities which the mass of the people firmly believe should be undertaken by it The political processes of our country are such that if a rule of reason is not applied in this effort , we will lose everything even to a possible and drastic change in the Constitution This is what I mean by my constant insistence upon moderation in government Should any political party attempt to abolish social security , unemployment insurance , and eliminate labor laws and farm programs , you would not hear of that party again in our political history There is a tiny splinter group , of course , that believes you can do these things Among them are H L Hunt \( you possibly know his background \) , a few other Texas oil millionaires , and an occasional politician or business man from other areas 5 Their number is negligible and they are stupid To say , therefore , that in some instances the policies of this Administration have not been radically changed from those of the last is perfectly true 6 Both Administrations levied taxes , both maintained military establishments , customs officials , and so on But in all governmental fields of action a combination of purpose , procedure and objectives must be considered if you are to get a true evaluation of the relative merits You say that the foreign policy of the two Administrations is the same I suppose that even the most violent critic would agree that it is well for us to have friends in the world , to encourage them to oppose communism both in its external form and in its internal manifestations , to promote trade in the world that would be mutually profitable between us and our friends \( and it must be mutually profitable or it will dry up \) , and to attempt the promotion of peace in the world , negotiating from a position of moral , intellectual , economic and military strength No matter what the party is in power , it must perforce follow a program that is related to these general purposes and aspirations But the great difference is in how it is done and , particularly , in the results achieved A year ago last January we were in imminent danger of losing Iran , and sixty percent of the known oil reserves of the world 7 You may have forgotten this Lots of people have But there has been no greater threat that has in recent years overhung the free world That threat has been largely , if not totally , removed I could name at least a half dozen other spots of the same character This being true , how can anyone be so unaware of what is happening as to say that this Administration has conducted foreign affairs under the same policies as did the former Administration \? As a matter of fact , if you will press any individual who brings to you all these strictures and comments , I venture that your experience will be the same as mine That experience is that these individuals have no idea of what the foreign policy of the previous Administration was and what the present one is They have heard certain slogans , such as give away programs They have no slightest idea as to what has been the effect of these programs in sustaining American security and prosperity Moreover , they have no idea whatsoever as to comparative size of them now as compared to even two or three years ago You say that these critics also complain about the continuance of controls , presumably over our economy There is nothing in your letter that shows such complete ignorance as to what has actually happened as does this term When we came into office there were Federal controls exercised over prices , wages , rents , as well as over the allocation and use of raw materials The first thing this Administration did was to set about the elimination of those controls This it did amid the most dire predictions of disaster , run away inflation , and so on and so on We were proved right , but I must say that if the people of the United States do not even remember what took place , one is almost tempted to regret the agony of study , analysis and decision that was then our daily ration You also talk about bad political advice I am getting I always assumed that lawyers attempted accuracy in their statements How do you know that I am getting any political advice \? Next , if I do get political advice , how do you know that it is not weighted in the direction that you seem to think it should be although I am tempted at times to believe that you are just thrashing around rather than thinking anything through to a definite conclusion \? So how can you say I am getting bad advice why do n't you just assume I am stupid , trying to wreck the nation , and leave our Constitution in tatters \? I assure you that you have more reason , based on sixty four years of contact , to say this than you do to make the bland assumption that I am surrounded by a group of Machiavellian characters who are seeking the downfall of the United States and the ascendancy of socialism and communism in the world Incidentally , I notice that everybody seems to be a great Constitutionalist until his idea of what the Constitution ought to do is violated then he suddenly becomes very strong for amendments or some peculiar and individualistic interpretation of his own Finally , I must assure you again that I am delighted to get your own honest criticisms , particularly if you will only take the trouble to lay down the facts on which you reach what seem to me to be some remarkable conclusions But the mere repetition of aphorisms and political slogans and newspaper headlines leaves me cold I am sorry you are not going to be at Abilene 8 It would be easier to tell you these things than to write them except that by this method I hope to make you do a little thinking rather than devote yourself just to the winning of a noisy argument As ever P S I attach a paragraph and a cartoon that came to me in the same mail as did your letter At least it represents a different viewpoint Incidentally , it comes from one of the most successful businessmen in the nation 9",true
"PrintIt is n't known if schools in America are installing holy water fonts next to the classroom doors , although they are small , plastic , inexpensive , and unobtrusive , nor is it known if Christian students are now allowed 20 seconds a day to say Grace before lunch , and there is little evidence that school districts have made the switch to Kosher foods to accommodate the dietary restrictions of Jewish students The St Cloud , Minnesota school district , however , is devoting its resources to providing accommodations to Muslim students based solely on the basis of their religion , which under the current interpretation of the Establishment clause of the First Amendment , would be impermissible for Christian or Jewish students or Hindu , Buddhist or pagan students , either The accommodations come as a result of a federal lawsuit filed in 2011 by the Council of American Islamic Relations \( CAIR \) alleging that the school district had created a hostile environment for Muslim students Somalis are the fastest growing group of residents in St Cloud , a small city of 65 , 000 in central Minnesota comprising approximately 20 percent of the school district 's 10 , 000 students Now Muslims students are not only given time both in class and in private rooms for prayer , which is required by their faith , but providing prayer rugs for them to use free of charge courtesy of the taxpayers The practice , which comes during the school day , disrupts classroom activities and leaves non Muslim students confused and resentful that they do not have an excuse to leave the classroom and be dismissed early on Friday , while forcing teachers to design lesson plans and manage the classroom schedule so that mandatory activities like tests and presentations do not conflict with Muslim prayer time The school district has also taken steps of hiring full time staff members to navigate cultural differences , but the efforts have been directed at non Muslims One staff member said teachers needed to be educated to understand that Somali students do not make eye contact as a sign of respect , rather than helping students become comfortable looking others in the eye , a basic communication skill that will help them form friendships , fit in on sports teams , and eventually in jobs and careers where they live now",false
"McDonald 's Removing Big Mac , Apple Pies And Eliminating Large Size OptionsPosted onby Daily Buzz LiveMcDonald 's Removing Big Mac , Apple Pies And Eliminating Large Size Options McDonald 's has just announced that it will be phasing out 8 menu items the beginning of next year and most McDonald 's customers are not happy With McDonald 's profits tanking over the recent months , the company has had to make some tough decisions to find adequate solutions for their financial distress by shrinking menu sizes Our intent is to have a cleaner menu board that is easier for customers to absorb , spokeswoman Lisa McComb said in a statement To do so we must simplify our current menu This means the end of the Big Mac , apple pie and large size menu items Currently , the Big Mac has a whopping 550 calories and 29g of fat The Apple pie contains 250 cal , and it would take a full 69 minute to walk that off ! With that being said , those two menu items were not a tough decision for elimination McDonald 's is currently testing out a new version of their slim down menu in Delaware , Little Rock , Waco , Bakersfield , Macon and Knoxville They plan a full nationwide rollout beginning February 1 , 2015 One notable ingredient preservatives might also be eliminated from the menu altogether Mark Andr s , President of McDonald 's USA , sparked widespread speculation when he asked investors , Why do we need to have preservatives in our food \?

the hardest hit places when Hurricane Harvey 's torrential rains slammed Texas Residents now seeking Harvey relief face a strange ultimatum agree not to boycott Israel , or your application for aid will be denied According to the Houston Chronicle , the city 's hurricane repair grant application , which allows residents to apply for funds to help rebuild a home or business impacted by Hurricane Harvey , includes a surprising stipulation By executing this Agreement below , the Applicant verifies that the Applicant \( 1 \) does not boycott Israel and \( 2 \) will not boycott Israel during the term of this Agreement , it states The application has gotten the attention of the American Civil Liberties Union , which called the prohibition unconstitutional on Thursday The First Amendment protects Americans' right to boycott , and the government cannot condition hurricane relief or any other public benefit on a commitment to refrain from protected political expression , Andre Segura , the legal director of the ACLU of Texas , told the Chronicle Dickinson 's requirement is an egregious violation of the First Amendment , reminiscent of McCarthy era loyalty oaths requiring Americans

cruelty and bigotry The only way to pass along civic values is to first live up to them Bush said our political system has been corrupted by conspiracy theories and outright fabrication , and cautioned against the U S turning inward under Trump We 've seen nationalism distorted into nativism , forgotten the dynamism that immigration has always brought to America , Bush said We see a fading confidence in the value of free markets and international trade , forgetting that conflict , instability and poverty follow in the wake of protectionism We 've seen the return of isolationist sentiments , forgetting that American security is directly threatened by the chaos and despair of distant places He took aim at white supremacy too Our identity as a nation unlike many other nations

"NOAA 's GOES satellite shows three storms in the Atlantic Hurricane Irma , Tropical Storm Jose , and Tropical Storm Katia , on September 8th Photo by NASA NOAA GOES Project via Getty ImagesThis summer , the US has had several record smashing natural disasters over 110 large fires are burning throughout the country , especially in the West California recently had a deadly heat wave that set all time heat records in several towns , including San Francisco and after Hurricane Harvey brought unprecedented raining and flooding to Texas , Hurricane Irma swept through the Caribbean and Florida the strongest storm ever recorded in the Atlantic Ocean outside of the Caribbean and the Gulf of Mexico Although it 's impossible to attribute any one of these single events to climate change , the signals are clear , scientists say \( That kind of attribution may be possible with certain kinds of modeling studies those studies have not yet been conducted \) These extreme weather events are very consistent with what climate change is expected to bring in the years ahead global weirding Extreme weather events become more extreme , and climate change is loading the dice' toward more extreme floods , heat waves , droughts , and hurricanes , says Michael Mann , a climatologist and director of the Earth System Science Center at Pennsylvania State University , in an email to The Verge We should n't be surprised we 're turning up snake eyes so often now This is going to be the future Mann 's not alone in thinking this summer has the shape of things to come This is going to be the future , says David Titley , a meteorologist and director of the Center for Solutions to Weather and Climate Risk at Penn State The future is going to have stronger heat waves , more wildfires , heavier rain storms , and a greater number of very intense hurricanes , Titley says At some point , our luck will run out It 's wrong to say that climate change caused this summer 's extreme weather events , scientists say Hurricanes and fires have occurred in the past , after all But undoubtedly climate change is playing a role , says Kevin Trenberth , a distinguished senior scientist at the National Center for Atmospheric Research These extreme weather events are being exacerbated by the climate change element So here 's the role climate change might have played in this summer 's record breaking heat waves , wildfires , and hurricanes Heat wavesOver Labor Day weekend , California was broiled by a record setting heat wave that killed six people San Francisco reached 106 degrees Fahrenheit , the hottest it 's ever been since record keeping started about 150 years ago \( The previous record was 103 degrees Fahrenheit , set in 2000 \) A few other cities broke heat records , as well In June , Phoenix , Arizona , also hit a daily record , reaching 119 degrees Fahrenheit Update One additional all time record high temp to report from recent heat event 6 all time record warm overnight lows CAwx CAheatwave pic twitter com Xdl63XZQUV NWS Bay Area \( NWSBayArea \) September 5 , 2017Heat waves are the simplest weather event to attribute to climate change , says Adam Sobel , an atmospheric scientist at Lamont Doherty Earth Observatory and head of Columbia University 's Initiative on Extreme Weather and Climate A variety of studies have shown that a warming climate increases the chances of heat waves and how severe those heat waves are going to be , Sobel says The world 's average temperature has increased roughly by 1 53 degrees Fahrenheit from 1880 to 2012 , according to the Intergovernmental Panel on Climate Change That may not seem like a lot , but if we do n't keep global warming well below 3 6 degrees Fahrenheit , we could see irreversible changes like melting polar ice caps , extensive flooding , bleached coral reefs , food shortages , and deadly diseases As temperatures rise , there 's a greater chance of getting more intense heat waves and setting new heat records , says Sobel WildfiresAll over the US , there are more than 110 large fires , burning through almost 2 million acres of land , including more than 80 wildfires in the western part of the country These fires are making it hard to breathe all over the Pacific Northwest It 's very unusual to have this many fires burning this many acres across such a broad area at this time in September , National Interagency Fire Center spokeswoman Jennifer Jones told Reuters So far this year , we 've had more than 48 , 000 fires , burning more than 8 million acres of land , 2 million acres over the national yearly average from 2007 to 2016 An image taken on September 4th by the NOAA NASA 's Suomi NPP satellite shows the direct path of the smoke from the West Coast fires that stretches across the entire countryPhoto NASA image courtesy Jeff Schmaltz LANCE EOSDIS MODIS Rapid Response Team , GSFCThere are several ingredients required for wildfires some connected to climate change and some that have nothing to do with it But dry conditions and extreme heat create good tinder , making wildfires worse in certain areas , says Benjamin Bond Lamberty , an ecosystem ecologist with the Joint Global Change Research Institute A warmer planet will cause more water to evaporate off the landscapes , drying trees and grasses which then burn more easily That sets the stage for increased fire , Bond Lamberty says Climate change can also make forests more prone to burning , since some pests can spread more readily in warmer temperatures , Bond Lamberty says The mountain pine beetle , for instance , is thriving because warmer winters do n't kill its larvae , allowing the beetles to spread and kill more trees , which serve as fuel That really sets up a lot of forest ready for things like a wildfire , he says Flames spread on a moonlit night at the La Tuna Fire on September 2nd near Burbank , California Los Angeles Mayor Eric Garcetti said at a news conference that officials believe the fire , which is at 5 , 000 acres and growing , is the largest fire ever in LA Photo by David McNew Getty ImagesOf course , climate change alone does n't cause wildfires lightning or people are still required A Forest Service policy of suppressing fires over much of the 20th century has also made our forests older , and more prone to burning We 're still paying the cost of that 20th century policy , Bond Lamberty says There 's a big accumulation of fuel built up on the landscape Still , climate change might already have an effect A study last year found that in the West , climate change has doubled the area affected by forest fires over the last 30 years Washington state had its biggest fire in state history in 2015 , breaking its 2014 record , says Amy Snover , the director of the University of Washington 's Climate Impacts Group The fire season has also lengthened , starting a month earlier in Alaska , she writes in an email to The Verge HurricanesThis hurricane season has been incredibly active , with a number of severe storms First , Hurricane Harvey barreled into Texas , dumping record rains and causing unprecedented flooding in cities like Houston Then , Hurricane Katia struck the east coast of Mexico , and Hurricane Irma a Category 5 hurricane and one of the strongest storms ever recorded in the Atlantic wreaked havoc on the Caribbean \( Irma smashed a bunch of other records \) Another hurricane , called Jose , followed Irma , but now it seems the storm may remain out in the ocean Floodwaters surround homes on September 7th in Richwood , Texas Over a week after Hurricane Harvey hit Southern Texas , residents are beginning the long process of recovering from the storm Photo by Justin Sullivan Getty ImagesThe intensity of these hurricanes seem to match what climate scientists are expecting in the future , says Titley Research shows that strong hurricanes , like Harvey and Irma , will become more frequent as the planet warms , says Suzana Camargo , a professor of ocean and climate physics at Lamont Doherty Earth Observatory at Columbia University Climate change is expected to affect hurricanes in a few ways warmer ocean waters will provide more energy to these storms , and more moisture in the atmosphere will increase the amount of rain these hurricanes can dump Rising sea levels will also make storm surge from hurricanes worse , leading to higher floods Whether climate change is already affecting hurricanes is up for debate , Sobel and Camargo say It 's true that Harvey was fueled by warmer than usual waters in the Gulf of Mexico , but it was also particularly destructive because it stalled over Texas for a few days , dumping unprecedented amounts of rain It 's still an open question whether climate change has anything to do with wind patterns , Titley says And we do n't have enough data on hurricanes to understand whether stronger storms like Harvey and Irma are part of a larger trend , Sobel says Boats , cars and other debris clog waterways in the Florida Keys two days after Hurricane Irma slammed into the state September 12th , 2017 in Marathon , Florida Photo by Chip Somodevilla Getty Images The change might be there but it 's hard to prove it , he says It 's like you 're listening to somebody talking quietly in a loud room You may not be able to hear them but that does n't mean they 're not talking Whether we can attribute Harvey and Irma directly to climate change , however , kind of misses the point , Titley says People can see that these changes are coming and they are very consistent with what the vast majority of climate scientists have told us for decades is going to happen , he says We should n't really be surprised Climate change is a known threat multiplier this summer 's extreme weather events are just a taste of what 's about to come and the sooner we address climate change , the better off we 'll be That means lowering greenhouse gas emissions and building infrastructure that can survive sea level rise , for instance By and large , I think most of us do n't really like the change what we 've seen , Titley says , and the climate system is kind of saying , Hey guys , you ai n't seen nothing yet ' Next Up In Science",false

"b'Its nearly impossible today to go anywhere without seeing someone talking into a tiny earpiece , but the headsets with blinking blue lights were not so common just a decade ago Use of Bluetooth equipped devices has stretched across the globe , yet the technologys origins and name can be traced to an engineer obsessed with making computers function using as little energy as possible Power is one of the key attributes Battery life is life Its the life of the product To ignore that is totally unacceptable You have to design things to work efficiently , but more importantly , do nothing efficiently , said Jim Kardach , retired chief power architect at Intel Originally intended as a wireless replacement for cables to connect phones , headsets , computers , keyboards and mice , Bluetooth technology has proliferated over the past decade , allowing devices in close proximity to connect while using very little battery power The headsets are ubiquitous , but according to the Bluetooth Special Interest Group \( SIG \) they are only one of many product types that make up the 9 billion Bluetooth devices in the world today That number keeps growing Over the next 2 years , annual Bluetooth device shipments are expected to double from 2 to 4 billion , according to ABI Research Intel mobile computing engineer Jim Kardach was instrumental in bringing together Ericsson , IBM , Intel , Nokia and Toshiba to form the Bluetooth SIG in 1998 That group created the universal standard that is used by more than 17 , 000 member companies Kardach recalls playing the role of instigator and mediator among the founding companies , but says the group quickly agreed on a common goal to create a small , low power consuming , low cost , short range radio with built in security and the ability to connect ad hoc with other devices Inspired by a book about Vikings that he was reading at the time , he came up with the Bluetooth name Just days before he retired in December , Kardach reflected on his 27 year career at Intel , including the genesis of Bluetooth , the many low power design breakthroughs that led to 100 patents and his work on the first notebook system on chip \( SoC \) sold in the 1980s by Intel called the 386SL 486SL How did you get involved with the creation of Bluetooth \? I got the assignment in 1997 when my boss at the time came up to me and said , Youre finishing up the ACPI stuff , can you figure out how to integrate wireless into the notebook \? We got together Ericsson , Nokia , Toshiba and IBM That probably represented 60 percent of both the cellphone and notebook markets at the time The key was to define the goals of what we wanted to do We formed a SIG , all agreeing that we wanted to build this universal , very low cost , private , wireless cable We did it under an open IP \( intellectual property \) policy , allowing us to take the best pieces from everywhere and put them together We had goals on what we wanted this thing to cost and strategies for it being built on a bulk CMOS process , which hadnt been done before It had security , privacy and had to work across the world , so we picked the ISM band , which required fixing some of the regulatory issues around it We had a term sheet that everyone agreed to and we put it together Intel became the leader simply because we had IBM and Toshiba who didnt trust each other , and Ericsson and Nokia who didnt trust each other , so we were kind of the Switzerland How does a chief power architect look at things \? The idea for the Bluetooth name came from Jim Kardach of Intel , who was reading a historical novel about Vikings and King Harald Bluetooth at the time Power is one of the key attributes Battery life is life Its the life of the product To ignore that is totally unacceptable You have to design things to work efficiently , but more importantly , do nothing efficiently Those are the two rules of power management We rely on architectural designs to lower power use We design chips to turn things off and back on only when theyre needed We architect things to minimize latency and anticipate when something is needed so it gets turned on just in time We used to rely on randomness , like when you drive to work and hope to miss all of the red lights , but more recently weve purposely tried to line up activities in order to create big idle gaps between these activities If the idle gaps are long enough , we can shut off all of the power For example , we now have special offloading accelerators that run to do specialized media loads and then be able to put the rest of the platform to a low power state , which means 98 percent of it is powered off Hardware not designed for power management can be like crying babies that wake up the whole house They ping memory every couple of milliseconds or microseconds , keeping the CPU out of its low power state This can keep memory and the busses between them alive A Bluetooth radio should require about a milliwatt of power , but when you put it on a USB plug , because of the way the bus was architected , it generates an extra 6 watts of power by pinging memory every millisecond These are things we want to catch up front when architecting for good power management The fourth generation Intel Core processors that use an SoC design are coming out soon Whats the advantage of SoCs over traditional CPU designs \? SoC allows you to do things that arent possible if you have a handful of chips from different venders We have the advantage of doing our own chipsets and CPUs , which allows us to design power management between them and the rest of the platform In the 1980s I worked on the 3SL and 4SL SoCs We were doing it in an era where we were cramming hundreds of thousands of transistors on a die and now we can fit billions We can now take advantage of Moores Law and increased capacity that were getting from bigger wafers and smaller transistors This lets us integrate more capabilities into a small chip Having an SoC allows us to bring power management across the platform With the 3SL , we added new operating modes to the CPU that pulled some power management underneath the operating system This work is still used today To design an SoC , sometimes you have to trade off time to market but you can really take advantage of them to manage power consumption This content was originally published on the Intel Free Press website '",true
"ISIS Lays Down Arms After Katy Perry 's Impassioned Plea To Like , Just Co Exist'May 24 , 2017Tweet on TwitterMAYADIN , SYRIA Abu Bakr al Baghdadi , the leader of the Islamic State , released a statement Wednesday confirming that ISIS would be immediately surrendering its fight to establish a powerful caliphate after viewing an interview in which pop singer Katy Perry said , The greatest thing we can do just unite and love on each other and like , no barriers , no borders , like , we all need to just co exist The powerful statement which single handedly dismantled ISIS came shortly after a terrorist attack on civilians in Manchester killed 22 people , and led the reclusive head of ISIS to hold an emergency press conference declaring the group 's jihad finished Despite my previous belief that we must slay the infidel in the name of Allah until Islam rules the world , I just ca n't deny that Katy 's words have touched my heart , al Baghdadi said as he symbolically held up and then tossed an AK 47 onto the ground It is time for the mujahideen to start uniting and loving on people I just ca n't believe we did n't see it before It 's all so clear now , he added After the video started to go viral in ISIS cave networks and strongholds , thousands of terrorists began pouring out into the streets of Mayadin , giving one another spontaneous group hugs , destroying their weapons , and planting trees and flowers in an attempt to begin rebuilding the Middle East into a utopian wonderland According to reports , al Baghdadi further confirmed that a recent advertisement in which Kendall Jenner offered a group of riot police a Pepsi was also influential in his decision to immediately cease their murderous reign of terror and lead ISIS down a path of peace TAGS",false
"For eight years , Michelle Obama genuinely thought she was a queen and expected to be treated like one Now that she 's a regular citizen , she 's having a hard time of letting go of her former status as the \( failed \) first lady and keeps trying to push her way into every major social scene where she does n't belong and is apparently not invited When she heard the news that Prince Harry was marrying a black American girl , she assumed it was her place to be on that guest list , which has to be approved by the Queen of England herself Michelle made a desperation move to sneak a spot on that exclusive guest list and as soon as the real queen found out what the wannabe royalty did , she delivered a brutal beatdown that was definitely deserved As soon as the big news about the royal engagement of Prince Harry and an American actress Meghan Markle was announced , the Obamas saw an opportunity to edge their way into the elites , like a couple of desperate kids trying to hang with the popular crowd at school Barack immediately got on social media to beat President Trump to the congratulatory punch He has a lot more time on his hands than the Commander in Chief who is busy cleaning up his mess Barack practically stalked the prince on Twitter and made a post within seconds of the news coming out , which perhaps had an undertone of letting the royals know that he and Michelle were available that day to attend The Obamas know what they are doing when it comes to getting attention on themselves and this post was no exception It garnered a whopping 1 million likes on it which both he and Michelle were likely elated about since the royal family was likely sure to see it The exposure of this post sparked rumors that the Obamas would likely be added to the guest list in the current president and first lady 's place , the Independent reported While Barack was making desperate tweets to secretly get on the guestlist , Michelle was doing something worse to shove the Trumps aside and ensure her spot , even though the honor is typically reserved for the current president and first lady Michelle has been making the speaking engagement rounds lately to rack in hundreds of thousands of dollars to trash Trump Her recent trip to Canada was no exception as she combined it with a hidden mission of getting to the royal wedding The former first lady had been invited as the keynote speaker in addressing the Economic Club of Toronto , when she deviated from her planned remarks to double down on her and Barack 's desperate attempt to kiss up to the Queen of England According to Page Six , Michelle took the opportunity to make fun of President Trump then immediately gushed over the queen Both conversation deviations had no place in an event like this , but for calculated Michelle , it has a passive aggressive purpose of saying that Trump was n't fit for her guest list , but since she loves the queen so much , she should get a spot After being introduced by Canada 's first lady , Sophie Trudeau , Obama told the crowd that it is never a good idea' to put your first thought in the morning on social media , and never a good idea to tweet from bed , ' which appears to be one of the president 's favorite pastimes , presuming that he is actually in bed when he tweets at 3 a m , Page Six reported Going on about effective communication , and the importance of doing drafts , Obama went on , Then you need to edit and spell check it ' The 45 minute conversation , hosted by the Economic Club of Toronto , flowed into a bunch of amusing side stories , including her memories of being awestruck when meeting Queen Elizabeth of England 'What do you do with the queen \? I touched her She touched me first , ' she said , adding that her dream dinner guest would be Jesus , whom she 'd serve pizza It 's well known that the respect , proper etiquette , and holding a high level of decorum is important to the royal family and by painting a picture that Trump ca n't control himself , Michelle thought she was making him look like a bad person to have at the wedding However , the bigger motive in her comments was to cover up her actual faux pas with the Queen when , not surprisingly , brash Michelle showed a complete lack of respect and protocol when she got a little too touchy with her bullying her way into a hug and pushing her toward a chair , The Guardian previously reported The Queen felt so grossly disrespected by Michelle that she royally snubbed the former first lady after the touchy feely offense When she flew into London with her mother and daughters in tow , expecting an audience with Queen Elizabeth only , she received a big slap in the face instead , the Globe reported Instead of spending the day with Michelle and her family who flew in to meet with her , the Queen ditched her and went off the horse race instead Michelle may think she 's royalty and even try to act like it , but she 's got nothing on the actual Queen of England who 's the real deal and put her in her place when she changed plans The Queen does what she wants which hopefully means that she kicks her off the coveted guest list too",false
"In 1967 , the USS Forrestal suffered near catastrophic damage from a fire that raged on board for nearly two days John McCain was stationed on the Forrestal at the time and was quite likely responsible for the fire that killed 134 sailors and injured 62 others Hot dog pilots were well known for their wet starts , a process which allows fuel to build up in the engine before hitting the plane 's start switch The result of the wet start is a long flame erupting from the tail of the plane It was done simply for effect , a showy procedure meant to draw attention to the pilot On June 29 , 1967 , John McCain is alleged to have used a wet start to shake up a pilot in the plane behind him The result was a fired rocket , dropped bombs and a fire that raged for nearly two days 134 sailors lost their lives and another 62 were badly injured McCain never had to answer for the incident His father and grandfather were Navy admirals with a great deal of sway Three months after the Forrestal disaster McCain was shot down over North Vietnam You know the rest of the story Is this man a maverick or a dangerous lunatic \?

"By Matt MillerTuesday , September 8 , 2009A dangerous sentiment on the left threatens to derail what could be the biggest progressive achievement in half a century It 's the view that any health care reform that does n't include a public option is n't real reform and thus is n't worth doing This mantra has become an article of faith among many Democrats who have n't necessarily thought through the matter but who take their cues from leaders advancing this argument Unless liberals rethink this premise , and fast , Democrats will squander their best chance in a generation to end the scandal of the uninsured , bring health security to every American family and begin the long term process of getting national health costs under control The first fallacy of the public option or nothing mantra is the notion that we 'll never cover everyone without a Medicare style program for Americans under 65 The experiences of Switzerland and the Netherlands prove that this is n't the case Both have pioneered market based universal health care Both cover all their citizens using private insurers , and they do so for much less cost 10 percent of gross domestic product for the Dutch and 12 percent for Switzerland , compared with 17 percent in the United States , where nearly 50 million people are still uninsured Those countries also boast better health outcomes than we do , even when compared to states with similar demographics , such as Connecticut and Massachusetts Sick people in both countries are pursued as customers by private insurers \( rather than shunned , as they are in the United States \) because health plans are paid more for sick enrollees via a government designed system of risk adjustment The Swiss and Dutch achievements are important because conservative critics often act as though fully socialized systems , such as those in Britain and Canada , are the inevitable result of any drive for universal coverage In fact , as these two countries show , it is possible to cover everyone without a big government takeover A related fallacy is that the public option is the most important issue to debate It 's not The central progressive breakthrough in any reform should be to make it possible for every American to access group health coverage outside the employment setting access that does not currently exist but which the proposed insurance exchanges would enable What 's critical , therefore , is the structure of these exchanges and the rules about who would be eligible to use them Such questions have received disturbingly little attention but need to be front and center For example , some legislation proposes barring people who enjoy employer based coverage from seeking insurance from the new exchanges this ban should be scrapped in favor of the proposal offered by Sen Ron Wyden , under which employees could use the cash their companies spend on their benefits to buy coverage they prefer at the exchange I respect those in my party who seek the single payer system into which the public option might eventually evolve But I do n't agree that it 's the best answer for the United States Though single payer has merits , especially in administrative efficiency , it is also likely to freeze in place our fragmented , uncoordinated system of fee for service care It would encourage providers to goose volume \( to boost their incomes \) rather than improve quality and would offer greater rewards for providers of acute care when we need a fresh focus on chronic disease management Single payer also asks government to do things I do n't think it is competent to do , such as setting prices across a large swath of the health sector in ways that seem certain to create damaging rigidities or resource misallocations \( as happens in Medicare \) Finally , if government is the sole payer , provider payments will become even more politicized than they are today On the eve of beneficial innovations in drug therapies , devices and cost effective ways to deliver better care , it is ill advised to make the government 's hand too rigid Private health plans have many flaws , to be sure , but if sensibly regulated they 're likely to respond more nimbly to disperse medical innovations Liberals should make peace with the notion that a regulated market of competing private health plans can be the vehicle for getting everyone covered Yes , it means that unlike some other advanced countries , we 'll have billions of health dollars siphoned off by middlemen and marketers But if liberals think of it as a jobs program , they 'll learn to love it If everyone 's covered and insurer cherry picking is dead , health insurance will come to look more like a regulated utility Those on the left still seeking incentive should consider In 2006 , Sen Ted Kennedy urged Massachusetts Democrats to support Mitt Romney 's plan for universal coverage via a competing system of regulated private insurers , paired with an individual mandate and subsidies for low earners Kennedy knew this would become a model for a bipartisan fix for the country Now , a Kennedy approved model is within reach Liberals , far from resisting it as a setback , should celebrate it as a triumph Matt Miller , a former Clinton White House aide , is a management consultant and the author of The Tyranny of Dead Ideas In recent years he has advised and given paid

"Alaska Fish Wildlife News September 2003 Lemming Suicide Myth Disney Film Faked Bogus Behavior By Riley Woodford Lemmings do not commit mass suicide It 's a myth , but it 's remarkable how many people believe it Ask a few It 's a complete urban legend , said state wildlife biologist Thomas McDonough I think it blew out of proportion based on a Disney documentary in the '50s , and that brought it to the mainstream Lemmings are a kind of short tailed vole , a mouse like rodent that favors tundra and open grasslands Three kinds are found in Alaska , including the collared lemming , the only rodent that turns white in winter In 1958 Walt Disney produced White Wilderness , part of the studio 's True Life Adventure series White Wilderness featured a segment on lemmings , detailing their strange compulsion to commit mass suicide According to a 1983 investigation by Canadian Broadcasting Corporation producer Brian Vallee , the lemming scenes were faked The lemmings supposedly committing mass suicide by leaping into the ocean were actually thrown off a cliff by the Disney filmmakers The epic lemming migration was staged using careful editing , tight camera angles and a few dozen lemmings running on snow covered lazy Susan style turntable White Wilderness was filmed in Alberta , Canada , a landlocked province , and not on location in lemmings' natural habitat There are about 20 lemming species found in the circumpolar north but evidently not in that area of Alberta So the Disney people bought lemmings from Inuit children a couple provinces away in Manitoba and staged the whole sequence In the lemming segment , the little rodents assemble for a mass migration , scamper across the tundra and ford a tiny stream as narrator Winston Hibbler explains that , A kind of compulsion seizes each tiny rodent and , carried along by an unreasoning hysteria , each falls into step for a march that will take them to a strange destiny That destiny is to jump into the ocean As they approach the sea , \( actually a river more tight cropping \) Hibbler continues , They 've become victims of an obsession a one track thought Move on ! Move on ! The pack of lemmings reaches the final precipice This is the last chance to turn back , Hibbler states Yet over they go , casting themselves out bodily into space Life loving lemming lemmings do not commit mass suicide , although in lean times they may become cannibalistic These mouse like rodents are found in Alaska and in northern countries around the world , mostly favoring tundra and open grassland Lemmings are seen flying into the water The final shot shows the sea awash with dying lemmings Certainly , some scenes in nature documentaries are staged In Sir David Attenborough 's recent documentary , The Life of Birds , the close up footage of a flying duck , filmed razor sharp from the bird 's wingtip , was shot from a car using a mallard drake trained to fly alongside the car But faking an entirely mythical event is something else Disney had to have gotten that idea from somewhere , said Thomas McDonough , the state wildlife biologist Disney likely confused dispersal with migration , he added , and embellished a kernel of truth Lemming populations fluctuate enormously based on predators , food , climate and other factors Under ideal conditions , in a single year a population of voles can increase by a factor of ten When they 've exhausted the local food supply , they disperse , as do moose , beaver and many other animals Lemmings can swim and will cross bodies of water in their quest for greener pastures Sometimes they drown Dispersal and accidental death is a far cry from the instinctive , deliberate mass suicide depicted in White Wilderness , but Hibbler explains that life is tough in the lemmings' weird world of frozen chaos The voice over implies that lemmings take the plunge every seven to ten years to alleviate overpopulation What people see is essentially mass dispersal , said zoologist Gordon Jarrell , an expert in small mammals with the University of Alaska Fairbanks Sometimes it 's pretty directional The classic example is in the Scandinavian mountains , where \( lemmings \) have been dramatically observed They will come to a body of water and be temporarily stopped , and eventually they 'll build up along the shore so dense and they will swim across If they get wet to the skin , they 're essentially dead There 's no question that at times they will build up to huge numbers , Jarrell added One description from Barrow does talk about them drowning and piling up on the shore Jarrell said when people learn that he works with lemmings , the mass suicide issue often comes up It 's a frequent question , he said 'Do they really kill themselves \?

"b' Share191K TweetMadrid Doctors of the Carlos III hospital confirmed this morning in a press conference , the first case of human death caused by the ingestion of genetically modified food Juan Pedro Ramos died from anaphylaxis after eating some recently developed tomatoes containing fish genes , which provoked a violent and lethal allergic reaction This surprising announcement comes after the autopsy of the 31 year old Spanish man who died at the Madrid hospital in the beginning of January The young mans health rapidly deteriorated after he suffered an unexplained allergic reaction , and all the drugs used to refrain the anaphylaxis were entirely inefficient The team of experts claims to have been able to determine that the genetically modified tomatoes that the victim ingested at lunch were the cause of the allergic reaction that caused his death Mr Ramos was working as a clerk in a Madrid warehouse on January 7 , when he started feeling ill just after lunch A number of symptoms started to manifest themselves , including a violent itchy rash , some serious swelling of the throat and a drastic drop in blood pressure The man , who was known to have allergies , quickly injected himself some epinephrine , but his health condition continued to deteriorate The young man was rapidly carried to the hospital by co workers , but the medical staff was unable to identify the cause of his allergic reaction in time and none of the usual treatments or drugs seemed to work Mr Ramos was confirmed dead just over an hour after arriving at the hospital The young man appeared happy and healthy when this picture was taken by his roomate , less than 24 hours before he died The medical examiners and forensic experts at the Carlos III hospital had to execute a lot of tests and analysis before they could precisely determine what caused Mr Ramos to die of an allergic reaction to seafood , since all he had eaten before his death was a bacon , lettuce and tomato sandwich with a diet cola They were astonished when they discovered that the tomato he had ingested , not only contained some fish related allergens , but also some antibiotic resistant genes which had prevented Mr Ramos white blood cell from saving his life At first we thought that there had been some form of contamination of his food , from contact with fish or seafood during the preparation explained Dr Rafael Perez Santamarina It was only when we tested the tomato itself that we noticed that it contained some allergens usually found in seafood We did many different analysis and they all confirmed that the tomato was indeed the source of the allergens that killed Mr Ramos Many experiments on GMOs had produced some horrible tumors and event death in rats and other lab animals , but most genetically modified products on the market were considered to be harmless to humans The case of Mr Ramos is the first human death officially confirmed to be linked to the ingestion of genetically modified food It contradicts most studies on GMOs which had concluded that genetically engineered crops currently on the market were completely safe to eat A team led by University of Nebraska scientists had anticipated this kind of problem in 1996 , when they found that a Brazil nut protein introduced to improve the nutritional quality of genetically modified soybeans was able to provoke an allergic reaction in people with Brazil nut allergies However , this kind of problem was dismissed by most scientists as very improbable , since it could easily be avoided with proper safety testing The soybean injected with the Brazil nut gene was indeed abandoned during development , but it seems that the genetically modified tomato that caused Mr Ramos death had not been submitted to sufficient testing and the lethal risk had not been identified before it was marketed The Spanish ministry of Health , Social Services and Equality ordered for the tomatoes of Portugese origin which infected the young man , to be recalled and removed from stores and markets for safety reasons More than 7000 tons of tomatoes will therefore be ceased across the country by ministry inspectors and public safety officials The ministry also issued a public statement about the death of Mr Ramos in which it sends its condolences to his family and adds that it will immediately demand further research on the subject to determine if other genetically modified food products on the European market could represent a risk for the Spanish population Share191K Tweet '",false
"Bernie Sanders Proposes Bill Forcing Christians Holding Public Office To Wear Scarlet CrossJune 10 , 2017Tweet on TwitterWASHINGTON , D C Bernie Sanders is doubling down on his condemnation of Christians holding public office as hateful According to reports from within the U S Senate , the Senator from Vermont proposed a bill Friday that would force Christians holding any kind of public office to wear a visible scarlet cross on their clothing at all times , in order to clearly identify themselves as hateful bigots Dubbed the Hateful Bigot Identification Act , the bill would require anyone believing in salvation through Christ alone to wear the cross , in order that co workers and citizens could immediately identify and disregard the opinions of the disgusting , backwards , religious public servants We have to know who to take seriously , and who 's a dangerous threat to our society , Sanders said as he introduced the bill on the Senate floor By separating Christians from the rest of us , we 'll have finally achieved the religious liberty and tolerance the founding fathers dreamed of Sanders also stated that other religious people , such as Muslims , would be excluded from the act We 're only worried about the Christian bigots here , he said The Senate is projected to vote on the bill next week TAGS",false
"St Louis , MO Monsanto , the multi billion agribusiness giant , has announced today it has patented the first genetically modified strain of marijuana The news that has been welcomed by scientists and leaders of the agriculture business alike as a move forward towards the industrial use of marijuana and hemp products could bring a major shift towards marijuana policies in the U S A and ultimately , to the world Under present US federal law , it is illegal to possess , use , buy , sell , or cultivate marijuana , since the Controlled Substances Act of 1970 classifies marijuana as a Schedule I drug , although it has been decriminalized to some extent in certain states , Monsanto 's interest in the field has been interpreted by experts as the precursor to a major shift in marijuana policy in the US as it is believed the company would not have invested so much time and energy if it had not had previous knowledge of the Federal government 's openness towards the future legalization of marijuana Lawyer and marijuana law specialist , Edmund Groensch , of the Drug Policy Alliance , admits Monsanto 's involvement in marijuana projects could definitely help the pro legalization activists Currently , Federal law criminalizes marijuana and hemp derivatives because public opinion is still against it and legal commercial production in the U S is currently handled by a patchwork of small farmers whom are not trusted by investors A major player as Monsanto could bring confidence within government and towards investors in the market if it were to own a large part of the exploitable lands and commercial products There is presently no way to control the production of marijuana and the quality of the strains A GM strain produced by a company with the credentials and prestige of Monsanto would definitely lend a massive hand to pro legalization activists within certain spheres of government and within the business world he explains Although Monsanto 's testing on cannabis is only at an experimental stage , no plan has yet been released by the agriculture business firm as to what purposes the patented strain would be used for , although specialists believe answers should come this fall as rumors of a controversial new bill which could loosen up laws around medical marijuana is reportedly scheduled to pass before congress coming this fall Critics fear genetically modified cannabis will mix with other strains and could destroy the diversity of DNA , a reality dismissed by most studies claim experts",false
"On Friday , my colleagues Tara Golshan , Dylan Scott , and Jeff Stein published a remarkable piece collecting interviews with eight congressional Republicans about their health care bill They asked the simplest question possible What problems do you think this bill will solve , and how do you think it will solve them \? Not a single Republican has a clear answer The exchange with Sen John McCain is particularly bizarre Tara Golshan Generally , what are the big problems this bill is trying to solve \? John McCain Almost all of them They 're trying to get to 51 votes Tara Golshan Policy wise What are the problems in the American health care system this is trying to solve and is the bill doing that right now \? John McCain Well , it 's whether you have full repeal , whether you have partial repeal , whether you have the basis of it It 's spread all over Tara Golshan But based on the specifics of the bill you have heard so far , is it solving the problems in the health care system \? John McCain What I hear is that we have not reached consensus That 's what everybody knows But McCain 's reply , while incoherent , is n't as offensive as Health and Human Services Secretary Tom Price 's straight lie that Americans will absolutely not lose Medicaid coverage under the House bill It 's worth asking why Republicans are lying about this , why they ca n't give a clear explanation as to what their bill does , why they 're jamming the legislation through a secretive , rushed process that even their own members are criticizing Because there is a reason And it is damning In 2009 , Democrats had an easy answer to what the Affordable Care Act was meant to do They wanted to cover more people and cut costs They could give that answer because it was a basically popular position , and because it 's what their bill actually did , or at least tried to do In 2017 , Republicans have a similarly easy answer for their bill They want to cover fewer people and use the savings to fund tax cuts for the wealthy That is what their legislation does But they ca n't give that answer because it 's a horribly unpopular position What if , just work with me here , instead of passing a hugely unpopular HC bill in the dead of night , the GOP tried to do something popular \? Ross Douthat \( DouthatNYT \) June 13 , 2017 That is why they are trying to write a bill in secret and pass it before the public has a chance to mobilize against it That 's why , when asked to describe the bill 's provisions , Republicans offer baldfaced lies or word salad The difference between Obamacare and Trumpcare Democrats always believed the Affordable Care Act would be popular They believed that even when polls said it was n't popular They were certain that when Americans understood what was in the law when they saw it would cover tens of millions of people , and regulate away the worst abuses of the insurance industry , and let children stay on their parents' plans , and use Medicare to pilot a host of cost control experiments they would come around This basic belief carried through the more than year long process behind the bill It 's why Democrats held dozens of hearings , and released draft after draft of their legislation It 's why , when the bill was in danger , President Obama invited congressional leadership to the Blair House for a multi hour televised debate over the bill He was certain he had the better of the argument , and that if the American people could just hear it , Democrats would win By contrast , Republicans have concluded the public will hate their bill if they know what 's in it , and so they are doing everything in their power to keep it a secret and move on from it as fast as possible The process that produced the House health bill was shocking The law was rushed to its first vote , with barely any public hearings , in less than a month It was passed before the Congressional Budget Office had even scored the final version It was n't just that House Republicans did n't want the public to know what their bill did They did n't want to know what their bill did ! The Senate process has been less chaotic but even more cynical The legislation is being written by 13 Republican senators all of them men in secret No one has seen a draft of it No public hearings have happened , and none are scheduled Republicans briefly considered banning cameras from the halls of the Senate so they could n't be asked about the bill on television Various Senate Republicans have condemned the process The process is better if you do it in public , and that people get buy in along the way and understand what 's going on , Sen Bob Corker \( R TN \) told the New York Times but they 're not forcing any changes to it Though no bill exists for public viewing today , Mitch McConnell 's plan is to pass the legislation before July Fourth The extreme secrecy is a situation without precedent , at least in creating health care law , writes Julie Rovner , one of Washington 's most respected health reporters My colleague Sarah Kliff , in a searing piece , recalls the hours she spent covering hearings during the drafting of the Affordable Care Act , and notes C SPAN is empty of similar hearings today I 've covered Obamacare since day one , she writes I 've never seen lying and obstruction like this A bill you ca n't defend is a bill that wo n't survive The strategy Republicans have chosen may work to pass a bill , but it wo n't work to defend the chaos that bill creates Democrats thought the Affordable Care Act would become more popular as it began delivering insurance to people , and so the world they were creating was a world they would be able to defend Do Republicans really believe their health plan will become more popular when it begins taking insurance away from people \? And if they do n't , then what do they think will come next \? I 've written my prediction They 're paving the way to Medicare for all , as the next Democratic majority will respond to Obamacare 's destruction by passing the law liberals wanted to pass in the first place I assume Republicans have a different view than that But what is it \? If their plan is so unpopular they ca n't defend it in theory , how will they defend it in practice \? Each day this goes on , it seems less like a legislative process and more like a form of madness The only plausible explanation I 've heard for the persistent progress of this bill no one likes is that Republicans feel they need to keep their promise to repeal and replace Obamacare , and this is a version of keeping that promise But this is n't what they promised Donald Trump swore everyone would be covered under his plan Mitch McConnell promised lower deductibles and copays , and criticized Obamacare for leaving 25 million people uninsured Read the clarity of McConnell 's critique of Obamacare , and compare it with how he and his colleagues are talking about health care now Well , what you need to understand is that there are 25 million Americans who are n't covered now If the idea behind Obamacare was to get everyone covered , that 's one of the many failures In addition to premiums going up , copayments going up , deductibles going up And many Americans who actually did get insurance when they did not have it before have really bad insurance that they have to pay for , and the deductibles are so high that it 's really not worth much to them So it is chaotic The status quo is simply unacceptable Republican voters thought the GOP would replace Obamacare with something better , something that would help them They thought that because that 's what Republican politicians told them That was what they were promised This bill breaks the GOP 's health care promises",false
"NEW YORK DAILY NEWSMonday , March 28 , 2016 , 4 38 PMOur European allies are under siege from radical Islamic terrorism The Paris attacks last November killed 130 people and seriously injured hundreds more The Brussels attacks last week killed more than 30 people and struck at the heart of NATO Americans were among the victims of both attacks as the terrorists do not differentiate between us and our close allies One of the causes of this horror has been European bureaucrats restraining law enforcement from fully engaging with the Muslim community in no go zones As a result , for years , a radical , theocratic , violent ideology has spread in some mosques and Muslim neighborhoods throughout Europe Terrorists have exploited these isolated enclaves to recruit followers , formulate plots and orchestrate attacks BRATTON RIPS CRUZ AGAIN OVER PROPOSALTO MONITOR MUSLIMSThere is no better example of these no go zones than one neighborhood in the city of this latest horrific attack the municipality of Molenbeek in the city of Brussels In attack after attack , from 9 11 to Madrid to Paris to Brussels , the trail seems to come back repeatedly to Molenbeek At least three of the terrorists of the November 2015 Paris attack grew up and lived there In fact , one of the key terrorists of the Paris attack , Salah Abdeslam , fled back to Molenbeek where he knew he could find sanctuary It is telling that Abdeslam effectively hid in plain sight there for weeks in the same city as the headquarters of NATO and the European Union Even Belgium 's own Prime Minister , Charles Michel , has admitted after the Paris attacks that A lmost every time there 's a link with Molenbeek It 's been a form of laissez faire and laxity Now we 're paying the bill Many European leaders are now recognizing that passively allowing the Islamist threat to fester was a serious error We cannot make the same mistakes in America NYPD TERRORISM CHIEF TED CRUZ 'CAMPAIGNING THROUGH FEAR' In the wake of the Brussels attacks , I called for vigorously guarding against the political correctness that has plagued Europe I also called for empowering law enforcement to patrol and secure Muslim neighborhoods before they follow the path of Molenbeek and become havens for radical Islamic terrorists The response was predictable Liberal politicians , including President Obama , Hillary Clinton and Mayor de Blasio , all loudly denounced my approach Indeed , they seemed far more outraged at my calling for us to prevent radical Islamic terrorism then they were at the terrorists who attacked in Brussels In high dudgeon , they insist we must remain willfully blind to the root causes of these attacks The Islamic State is not Islamic , President Obama absurdly tells us New York Daily News front pages on the presidential electionEveryone knows that 's nonsense Of course , there are many peaceful Muslims in America , and hundreds of millions across the world , who can be our allies in this global battle But we cannot fight and win without identifying and confronting the enemy Islamism is a political and theocratic philosophy that commands its adherents to wage jihad , to murder or forcibly convert the infidels \( by which they mean everyone else \) Islamism is the enemy , and it must be defeated To do so , we must take a risk based approach that focuses resources on the enclaves and potential hotbeds of radicalization where terrorists are likely to thrive Just as with law enforcement 's successful efforts against gangs or drug dealers or the Mafia , we need resources and informants and undercover officers placed where terrorists are likely to be We need lawful surveillance operations And we need far more engagement between law enforcement and members of Muslim communities who are committed to working to rid their neighborhoods of the scourge of terrorism In the wake of 9 11 , there was a broad consensus in favor of a common sense domestic counterterrorism strategy But over the last seven years , the focus on protecting the homeland has been lost The Obama administration has even joined Islamist governments in sponsoring a UN resolution that would shred our First Amendment by threatening to make discussion of radical Islamism potentially illegal And now we are seeing the erosion of our counterterrorism tools here at home , even while we know from successful attacks from Boston to San Bernardino that terrorists are still plotting to strike America A prime case study is here in New York City Under Mayor Michael Bloomberg and Commissioner Ray Kelly , the NYPD started a counterterrorism unit that tracked demographic trends in New York City to provide investigators with important information about where terrorists might congregate and recruit That sophisticated analysis can be a critical part of counterterrorism efforts to prevent an attack before it occurs or disrupt burgeoning terror cells That unit likely saved lives For example , a former director of intelligence analysis for the NYPD , Mitchell Silber , explained that the unit identified the Islamic Books and Tapes bookstore in Brooklyn as a venue for radicalization , and provided a predicate for an investigation that thwarted a 2004 plot against the Herald Square subway station Moreover , the Obama administration 's counterterrorism advisor and now CIA director , John Brennan , stated the administration knew about this unit and referred to its work as exceptionally good Indeed , while running for mayor in 2013 , even then candidate Bill de Blasio said he believed the unit was legal and was created in good faith to protect New Yorkers Once elected mayor , however , de Blasio shut down that counterterrorism unit He was taking heat from liberal advocacy groups who caricatured the unit 's work as spying on Muslims , which it was n't New Yorkers , including the Muslim community , are less safe as a result After the Brussels attacks , I called out the de Blasio administration for its shortsighted capitulation to its liberal allies at the expense of the safety and security of the people of New York In response , Commissioner Bill Bratton penned an op ed attacking my policy in this newspaper He did not say that the work of the unit was misguided or a failure Instead , he alleged , remarkably , that the unit was finished with its work and it was n't serving any useful purpose Bratton has a difficult job , and I am grateful for all he does to keep the people of New York safe I also understand that politically , he has no choice but to implement the de Blasio Obama liberal agenda But his explanation for dismantling the unit makes no sense it ignores the nature of the threat that we face from radical Islam Simply put , demographic trends are not static They are dynamic They change over time The pockets of New York City that are fertile grounds for terrorist recruitment today may not be fertile grounds next year , and places without a significant radical presence right now may become hotbeds of terrorist activity in the future To say that the work of a vital intelligence unit was finished is not plausible It is the excuse of an administration grasping for anything to justify what was obviously a surrender to political correctness Hitting back \( Alex Wong Getty Images \) Former Mayor Rudy Giuliani and former Mayor Michael Bloomberg have both stated they believe the unit was lawful and effective , and should not have been shut down The de Blasio administration is trying to avoid the ideological foundation of the war radical Islamic terrorists are waging against us While Bratton admits that the jihadists are driven by ideology , he astonishingly maintains that our response should have no ideological component whatsoever That 's ridiculous If the terrorist threat is driven by radical Islamic ideology , then we must take account of that ideology in countering the threat To stop the terrorists before they strike , we must understand what their motivation and goals are , where they might plot attacks and which targets they are inclined to strike Their ideology tells us how they might peddle their radical Islamism in our cities and towns and helps us encourage our fellow Muslim citizens to choose a different path The hollow argument that ideology has no role in counterterrorism leaves no doubt that politics is afoot here I repeat my call for de Blasio to repudiate the dangerous confines of political correctness and reinstate this important unit as the first step towards a more proactive , hard headed counterterrorism strategy on the home front The bottom line is that to defeat radical Islam , we need to focus our counterterrorism resources where terrorists are likely to be That 's not profiling or spying It 's common sense An investigation of Wall Street fraud would n't focus on community banks in the outer boroughs If we want to defeat radical Islam , we need to focus on areas that are at risk of being infiltrated by jihadists The vast majority of Muslim Americans are law abiding citizens Indeed , patriotic American Muslims have provided critical assistance to our law enforcement , intelligence and military officials to detect and disrupt jihadist plots And we need their help in the war on terrorism These are dangerous times If I am elected President , every American will have a commander in chief fiercely committed to defeating radical Islamic terrorism This is a battle we must win If we do n't want to become Europe , we need to put aside the political correctness , focus our efforts on stopping radicalization and do what needs to be done to keep America safe Cruz , U S senator from Texas , is running for the Republican nomination for President Sign

"Guns are deeply rooted within Swiss culture but the gun crime rate is so low that statistics are not even kept The country has a population of six million , but there are estimated to be at least two million publicly owned firearms , including about 600 , 000 automatic rifles and 500 , 000 pistols This is in a very large part due to Switzerland 's unique system of national defence , developed over the centuries Instead of a standing , full time army , the country requires every man to undergo some form of military training for a few days or weeks a year throughout most of their lives Between the ages of 21 and 32 men serve as frontline troops They are given an M 57 assault rifle and 24 rounds of ammunition which they are required to keep at home Once discharged , men serve in the Swiss equivalent of the US National Guard , but still have to train occasionally and are given bolt rifles Women do not have to own firearms , but are encouraged to Few restrictions In addition to the government provided arms , there are few restrictions on buying weapons Some cantons restrict the carrying of firearms others do not The government even sells off surplus weaponry to the general public when new equipment is introduced Guns and shooting are popular national pastimes More than 200 , 000 Swiss attend national annual marksmanship competitions But despite the wide ownership and availability of guns , violent crime is extremely rare There are only minimal controls at public buildings and politicians rarely have police protection Mark Eisenecker , a sociologist from the University of Zurich told BBC News Online that guns are anchored in Swiss society and that gun control is simply not an issue Some pro gun groups argue that Switzerland proves their contention that there is not necessarily a link between the availability of guns and violent crime in society Low crime But other commentators suggest that the reality is more complicated Switzerland is one of the world 's richest countries , but has remained relatively isolated It has none of the social problems associated with gun crime seen in other industrialised countries like drugs or urban deprivation Despite the lack of rigid gun laws , firearms are strictly connected to a sense of collective responsibility From an early age Swiss men and women associate weaponry with being called to defend their country",true

"Trump Administration Eases Nursing Home Fines in Victory for IndustryBy JORDAN RAUContinue reading the main storyPhotoSeema Verma , administrator for the Centers for Medicare and Medicaid Services , has said that the agency 's regulations were taking doctors away from what matters most patients Credit Al Drago for The New York TimesThe Trump administration is scaling back the use of fines against nursing homes that harm residents or place them in grave risk of injury , part of a broader relaxation of regulations under the president The shift in the Medicare program 's penalty protocols was requested by the nursing home industry The American Health Care Association , the industry 's main trade group , has complained that under President Barack Obama , federal inspectors focused excessively on catching wrongdoing rather than helping nursing homes improve It is critical that we have relief , Mark Parkinson , the group 's president , wrote in a letter to Mr Trump in December 2016 Since 2013 , nearly 6 , 500 nursing homes four of every 10 have been cited at least once for a serious violation , federal records show Medicare has fined two thirds of those homes Common citations include failing to protect residents from avoidable accidents , neglect , mistreatment and bedsores AdvertisementContinue reading the main storyThe change in policy aligns with Mr Trump 's promise to reduce bureaucracy , regulation and government intervention in business Dr Kate Goodrich , director of clinical standards and quality at the Centers for Medicare and Medicaid Services , said in a statement that unnecessary regulation was the main concern that health care providers raised with officials Rather than spending quality time with their patients , the providers are spending time complying with regulations that get in the way of caring for their patients and does n't increase the quality of care they provide , Dr Goodrich said But advocates for nursing home residents say the revised penalties are weakening a valuable patient safety tool They 've pretty much emasculated enforcement , which was already weak , said Toby Edelman , a senior attorney at the Center for Medicare Advocacy Medicare has different ways of applying penalties It can impose a specific fine for a particular violation It can assess a fine for each day that a nursing home was in violation Or it can deny payments for new admissions The average fine in recent years has been 33 , 453 , but 531 nursing homes amassed combined federal fines above 100 , 000 , records show In 2016 , Congress increased the fines to factor in several years of inflation that had not been accounted for previously AdvertisementContinue reading the main storyThe new rules have been instituted gradually throughout the year In October , the Centers for Medicare and Medicaid Services discouraged its regional offices from levying fines , even in the most serious health violations , if the error was a one time mistake The centers said that intentional disregard for residents' health and safety or systemic errors should still merit fines A July memo from the centers discouraged the directors of state agencies that survey nursing homes from issuing daily fines for violations that began before an inspection , favoring one time fines instead Daily fines remain the recommended approach for major

subscribed to this email Opt out or contact us anytimeDavid Gifford , the American Health Care Association 's senior vice president for quality , said daily fines were intended to prompt quick remedies but were pointless when applied to past errors that had already been fixed by the time inspectors discovered them What was happening is you were seeing massive fines accumulating because they were applying them on a per day basis retrospectively , Mr Gifford said But the change means that some nursing homes could be sheltered from fines above the maximum per instance fine of 20 , 965 even for egregious mistakes In September 2016 , for instance , health inspectors faulted Lincoln Manor , a nursing home in Decatur , Ill , for failing to monitor and treat the wound of a patient whose implanted pain medication pump gradually slipped over eight days through a ruptured suture and protruded from her abdomen The patient died The Centers for Medicare and Medicaid Services fined Lincoln Manor 282 , 954 , including 10 , 091 a day for 28 days , from the time the nursing home noticed the problem with the wound until supervisors had retrained nurses to avoid similar errors An administrative law judge called the penalties quite modest given the appalling care The fines were issued before the new guidelines took effect if the agency had issued a one time fine , the maximum would have been less than 21 , 000 Lincoln Manor closed in September Its owner could not be reached for comment , and his lawyer did not respond to an interview request AdvertisementContinue reading the main storyAdvocates for nursing home residents say that relaxing penalties threatens to undo progress at deterring wrongdoing Janet Wells , a consultant for California Advocates for Nursing Home Reform , said the changes come as some egregious violations and injuries to residents are being penalized finally at a level that gets the industry 's attention and is n't just the cost of doing business In November , the Trump administration exempted nursing homes that violate eight new safety rules from penalties for 18 months Homes must still follow the rules , which are intended , among other things , to reduce the overuse of psychotropic drugs and to ensure that every home has adequate resources to assist residents with major psychological problems In June , the Centers for Medicare and Medicaid Services rescinded another Obama administration action that banned nursing homes from pre emptively requiring residents to submit to arbitration to settle disputes rather than going to court We publish nearly 11 , 000 pages of regulation every year , the agency 's administrator , Seema Verma , said in a speech in October That paperwork is taking doctors away from what matters most patients Janine Finck Boyle , director of health regulations and policy at LeadingAge , a group of nonprofit nursing homes and other entities that care for older people , said the group 's members had

"The new health care law will cut 500 billion from Medicare That will hurt the quality of our care 60 Plus Association on Wednesday , September 8th , 2010 in a campaign adMedicare 'cuts' in the health care law will hurt seniors , says 60 Plus AssociationBy Angie Drobnic Holan on Monday , September 20th , 2010 at 3 23 p m The conservative 60 Plus Association has run similar ads against Democratic members of Congress Guess which member of Congress betrayed seniors by voting in favor of the 2010 health care law , a vote for Nancy Pelosi 's health care bill which will cut 500 billion from Medicare and hurt the quality of our care Which member is it \? Well , lots of them , according to the 60 Plus Association The advocacy group bills itself as a conservative alternative to the American Association of Retired Persons \( AARP \) and supports a free enterprise , less government , less taxes approach to seniors issues It has created substantially similar ads to run against Democratic members of Congress in districts around the country In Florida , the group is targeting Rep Allen Boyd , who represents the Panhandle area , and Reps Alan Grayson and Suzanne Kosmas , both from central Florida It is also running ads against Wisconsin members Steve Kagen , representing Green Bay and Appleton , and Ron Kind of western Wisconsin Another target is John Boccieri of Canton , Ohio Still other ads target House members from Arizona , New York , Indiana and Pennsylvania It 's true that all of these members of Congress voted in favor of the new health care law when it came up for a vote on March 21 , 2010 But the ad gives a highly misleading impression about funding for Medicare Here 's the text of the ad running against Boyd , the Florida congressman who represents the northwest Panhandle area Alan Boyd has betrayed Florida 's seniors Instead of voting to protect us , he supported Nancy Pelosi 's liberal agenda Boyd voted for Nancy Pelosi 's health care bill which will cut 500 billion from Medicare That will hurt the quality of our care Florida 's seniors can send Alan Boyd a message He betrayed us , and this November , we 'll remember Because of our previous fact checks on the health care law , we knew this ad was leaving out important details on how the health care law , formally known as the Patient Protection and Affordable Care Act , changed Medicare Medicare , a government run health insurance program , provides health care coverage for the vast majority of Americans over age 65 It accounts for about 12 percent of the federal budget It 's important to note that the law does not take 500 billion out of the current Medicare budget Rather , the bill attempts to slow the program 's future growth , curtailing just over 500 billion in future spending over the next 10 years Medicare spending will still increase the nonpartisan Congressional Budget Office projects Medicare spending will reach 929 billion in 2020 , up from 499 billion in actual spending in 2009 Next , we wanted to address how those reductions are expected to affect the quality of care Some \( changes \) increase Medicare spending to improve benefits and coverage , said Tricia Neuman , director of the Medicare Policy Project at the nonprofit Kaiser Family Foundation Other provisions reduce the growth in Medicare spending to help the program operate more efficiently and help fund coverage expansions to the uninsured in the underlying health reform legislation Other provisions are designed to improve the delivery of care and quality of care Neuman walked through the changes in an easily digestible tutorial on the Kaiser Family Foundation 's website , a good non ideological explanation for people interested in changes to Medicare under health care reform Some of the savings are for relatively minor programs , such as 36 billion for increases in premiums for higher income beneficiaries and 12 billion for administrative changes The law directs a new national board to identify 15 5 billion in savings , but the board the Independent Payment Advisory Board is prohibited from proposing anything that would ration care or reduce or modify benefits More significantly , there 's also 136 billion in projected savings that would come from changes to the Medicare Advantage program About 25 percent of Medicare beneficiaries are enrolled in a Medicare Advantage plan Let 's back up for a minute and explain Medicare Advantage There are two basic ways most people get Medicare coverage They enroll in traditional Medicare and a prescription drug plan through the government and maybe buy a supplemental policy to cover most out of pocket costs Or they enroll in Medicare Advantage programs \( they include drug plans \) , which are run by private insurers Medicare Advantage programs typically have more generous benefits such as dental and vision coverage Some plans even pay the patient 's monthly Medicare premium , which can amount to about 100 The Medicare Advantage program was intended to bring more efficiency from the private sector to the Medicare program , but it has n't worked as planned A June 2009 analysis from the Medicare Payment Advisory Commission said that the Advantage programs costs taxpayers on average of 14 percent more than the traditional Medicare plan President Barack Obama has said repeatedly that the Medicare Advantage plan wastes public money that could be put to better use The health care law that President Obama signed in March phases out extra payments for Medicare Advantage programs over the next three to six years to bring their costs in line with traditional Medicare and institutes other rules for the program How these payment changes will affect beneficiaries remains to be seen but is expected to vary across the country , Neuman said The Congressional Budget Office projects the law will result in fewer enrollees in Medicare Advantage plans , and fewer extra benefits for Medicare Advantage enrollees , on average It is also possible that the number of plans available to beneficiaries will decline which may or may not be a concern On average , Medicare beneficiaries have 30 plans available to them in 2010 PolitiFact has waded into this argument about whether the adjustments to the Medicare Advantage option constitute a cut before Most experts we talked to had the same answer yes and no On one hand , they might not be considered cuts because nowhere in the bill are benefits actually eliminated , experts said And other parts of the bill expand coverage for seniors and ultimately make some components of Medicare less expensive for patients \( More on this in a bit \) Still , changes could be in store for Medicare Advantage participants , especially the extra benefits that people receive under Advantage , experts said But basic benefits that mirror regular Medicare will stay the same Finally , there 's 220 billion in Medicare savings achieved by reducing annual increases in payments health care providers would otherwise receive from Medicare The reductions are part of programs intended to improve care and make it more efficient , such as reducing payments for preventable hospital re admissions These adjustments are aimed at hospitals , skilled nursing facilities , and home health agencies The Office of the Actuary for Medicare and Medicaid Services questioned in an April 2010 report whether these levels of savings are realistic , saying that some health care providers would become unprofitable if payments were reduced \( The 60 Plus ad cites this report in its fine print \) The actuary 's report suggests that Congress will intervene to change the payment formula to avoid health care providers dropping out of Medicare The report also includes this caveat about how difficult it is to project the effects of the health care law The legislation would result in numerous changes in the way that health care insurance is provided and paid for in the U S , and the scope and magnitude of these changes are such that few precedents exist for use in estimation Consequently , the estimates presented here are subject to a substantially greater degree of uncertainty than is usually the case with more routine health care legislation Finally , the 60 Plus ad also fails to mention new benefits for seniors under the health care law , such as a 250 rebate for prescription drugs purchased through Medicare Part D \( A statement on the 60 Plus website calls the drug rebate the senior suckup \) Currently , after an initial benefit period , enrollees are required to pay 100 percent of their prescription drug costs until they reach a level of catastrophic coverage The rebate is meant to begin to close what is often called the doughnut hole in prescription drug coverage for beneficiaries By 2020 , Medicare will pay 75 percent of the total cost of generic prescription drug coverage in the gap , a marked improvement to the current program Getting back to the Truth O Meter , the 60 Plus ad says that the new health care law will cut 500 billion from Medicare That will hurt the quality of our care The ad loses points for accuracy because the 500 billion are n't actual cuts but reductions to future spending for a program that will still grow significantly in the next 10 years The ad also says those cuts will hurt the quality of seniors' care But we find that to be a highly contentious subject , and the 60 Plus ad does n't hint at any of the ways that the reductions are ways to make Medicare more efficient Finally , the ad does n't mention any of the benefits to seniors , such as improved prescription drug coverage The ad seems more intent on attacking the health care law than accurately describing this complicated piece of legislation Because it leaves critical facts out of its description in a way that gives a misleading impression , we rate the statement Barely True Editor 's note This statement was rated Barely True when it was published On July 27 , 2011 , we changed the name for the rating to Mostly False Advertisement",false

"BY MIKE RYAN As a Mayor of a town with 90 , 000 residents , thousands of businesses , 11 public schools , and millions of visitors a year , I have a very keen interest in preventing gun violence where possible As a former PTA president and father of two in our Broward County Public Schools , I have a very personal interest in protecting our children and schools Sunrise is also home to the only public recreational shooting range in Broward County We welcome , and have enjoyed a positive relationship with , responsible gun owners those who are interested in recreational and competitive shooting are friends , neighbors , visitors and residents Last Friday , Sheriff Scott Israel hosted a Roundtable convened by Congresswoman Debbie Wasserman Schultz regarding gun violence Attending were predominantly law enforcement chiefs , but also School Boards of Miami Dade County and Broward , a judge handling mental health issues , a prosecutor handling exclusively gang violence and gun crimes , a former ATF agent , a current FDLE agent , and the Mayors of Miami Dade County and Broward County In talking to responsible gun owners , law enforcement and residents , there is an evolving consensus We must take whatever reasonable steps we can to prevent guns being placed in the hands of the irresponsible , derangedand criminals This is not simply a reaction to a single event or a series of sensational events In America , each day , there are 33 murders committed with guns There is no single solution That does not mean we should do nothing We should have School Resource Officers to play an important role in protecting our children and teachers not as armed guards , but as part of the community policing model meant to understand the dynamics of students and families and how they interact in and out of our schools In addition to deterrence , they help address problems of drugs , gangs , and issues facing our neighborhoods and at risk youth In Sunrise , SROs have been or are active members of SWAT , Field Force , Hostage Negotiators and other specialized units while still being able to open the milk carton for a frustrated 1stgrader or help a parent navigate the car loop Universal background checks on ALL sales , with meaningful enforcement and real penalties for violators Background checks that are meaningful Full prosecution of anyone breaking existing laws Severely increase penalties for crimes committed with guns Ways to address the mentally ill and those with mental health issues Now someone committed involuntarily for 72 hours under the Baker Act \( as a danger to themselves or others \) will have their guns returned to them by the police automatically and immediately upon discharge after 72 hours AND their commitment is never entered into a background check database As a result , there is also no impediment or second thought given to someone being released and purchasing a gun Penalties for the possession of a firearm obtained without a background check If you should n't have the gun , responsible gun owners say throw away the key How we get there is part of the discussion Roughly 6 6 million guns a year are transferred without background checks , many through the internet Right now , private sellers exclusively decide whether or not they should seek a background check That is unworkable and an illogical step to curb the flow of guns into the hands of the irresponsible , deranged and criminals A March shooting rampage in New Mexico occurred after someone who would never have been able to pass a background check purchased guns privately , through an ad in the paper The seller later admitted how badly he felt The same scenario happened in a Wisconsin mass shooting last year involving an act of domestic violence How many other times a day does this happen \? We must make sure databases are populated with the right information on domestic violence history , convictions , mental health issues AND the state databases are linked to federal databases Databases do prevent bad guys from getting guns In 2009 , over 150 , 000 were prohibited from purchasing Since 1999 , 1 7 million have been prohibited from buying guns from federally licensed dealers But , gaps have let felons , those with domestic violence convictions and restraining orders and the mentally ill to actually obtain guns and permits to carry a concealed firearm At Virginia Tech , the mass shooting was committed by someone who passed a background check even though a judge had found him mentally ill and ordered he not be permitted to purchase or possess a gun The information was never linked to the necessary databases How many times a day does this happen \? All this means increased resources for enforcement and prosecutions , as well as a change in law to make the penalties severe enough that criminals , unscrupulous dealers , law enforcement and federal prosecutors take this seriously The raging national debate over bans and restrictions on the character of guns and magazines are more difficult Licensed dealers and law enforcement tell me since the Sandy Hook mass shooting , you cannot even find certain military style weapons to purchase or the prices have skyrocketed It is true so many of the murders committed each day involve weapons not even contemplated by any proposed ban or not involving high capacity magazines So , some solutions should be implemented without even tackling the thorny issues presented However , many in law enforcement said limiting high capacity magazines would make a difference over time regarding dangers they face and in many of these shootings Mark Kelly emphasized this point last week in an interview his wife Gabrielle Giffords was shot when the killer was stopped as he attempted to reload after emptying 30 rounds from a magazine Sure , they can just reload But , for the untrained particularly , reloading is a point where intervention can occur or where mechanical failure can impede Some question why any civilian needs 30 round or more capacity We must take the steps we all agree will make a difference Doing nothing is not an option Becoming paralyzed by politics will cost lives Mike Ryan , the mayor of Sunrise , is also Chair of the Broward League of Cities Public Safety Committee and the Co Chair of the Joint SRO Taskforce of the Broward League of Cities",true

"The White House cleaning staff that served under Obama was removed and replaced this week with people more familiar and trusted by the Trumps Their new head of housekeeping , Carmen Ortiz Santiago Delouise , was the head of housekeeping at Mar A Lago in Palm Beach Florida , having worked her way up from the laundry room Delouise , who has worked for the Trumps for nearly 25 years , was tasked with a super cleaning of the residence , as the Trumps tend to not feel at home until everything around them has been cleaned , sterilized and scented with the family pheromones During the cleaning , Delouise and her staff came across a small compartment under a carpet in the master bedroom walk in closet the Obamas must have forgotten they left there Inside they found a box containing 2 marijuana joints , a Zippo lighter and a gram of aged hashish It seems the Obamas decided they 'd use the White House as their own little drug den Delouise gave her statement to a translator since she still speaks very little English The box was under the board in the closet It looked very old and had strange letters engraved on it You could clearly make out a backwards B , an M and what looked like some kind of Muslim symbol Since marijuana in small amounts is legal in DC , President Trump decided he would rather use the find to humiliate Obama and instead took out a full page ad in the Chicago Tribune with a picture of the box and an offer to return Barry 's stash The new White House Head of Housekeeping was also pushed through and given legal resident status , along with her family , as a reward for her hard work In the picture of the box , you can clearly see that a backwards B , which is the Muslim symbol for Barack , an M and a symbol experts believe to be an ancient Muslim emblem meaning hungry were painted on years ago The contents of the box , of course , are indicative of the Obamas and their love for the thug life , gang symbols , Beyonce and Snoop Dogg Yet more proof that Obama spent his time in the White House wasting taxpayer money for his salary while he and his wife sat around getting stoned",false

"May 17 , 2012 4 CommentsI am in the process of preparing the data on the first several hundred children I have observed with GcMAF therapy for elevated nagalase activity The preliminary data is extraordinary But not everyone who thinks they understand GcMAF therapy gets it Many are using hugely too much and hurting children in the process Please do n't overdose the children if you are using the right GcMAF it takes very little to help Our process involves homeopathic activation using classical techniques And when our techniques are used properly this is what we are hearing from the families so often Dear Dr Bradstreet , What has happened to my child \? Could it be that it was only a few months ago that my little boy preferred sitting alone at the computer or lining up toy cars and planets in his room \? It seems like it 's been a lifetime Now , I look at my happy , interactive , responsive , 6 year old child with amazement J began using GcMAF since 27 weeks ago and we noticed changes for the better almost out of the starting gate Only 3 weeks in , my son asked to ride his bike My husband and I looked at each other with dread Unfortunately , in the recent past it took all three of us to make that bike go My husband and I would use our hands to push his feet on the pedals while one of us attempted to steer It was a backbreaking ordeal Our son just could n't coordinate the mechanics of it But , not this time he jumped on that bike and rode all over the neighborhood We could n't believe our eyes Could it be the GcMAF \? We just were n't sure The IEP meeting was scheduled We were just 4 weeks into the new school year and 4 weeks into using GcMAF The teacher presented me with written work from the beginning of the year , then placed Jayden 's most recent work alongside it Surely , it was from two different children The earlier writing was erratic , with one letter written over top of the other , it was disproportionate , and trailed sloppily down the edge of the page His recent work was neat , orderly , and consistently sized It was even on the line The teacher started gushing about his performance He was starting to read and was learning full curriculum kindergarten academics He was specifically excelling in math Everyone around the conference table verbally gave each other a high five for their achievement Now hold on , I interrupted , the success must primarily be attributed to the biomedical approach and the diet that we 've implemented I gave them a brief explanation and we left the meeting feeling excited for what the future might hold It was not a steady climb up the staircase , however We experienced some regression following dental surgery , but quickly got back on track \( by resuming GcMAF \) Previously , I had a difficult time getting my son to respond when I called out his name He would run out into the street without looking , if I did n't stop him He was able to parrot back canned answers to rehearsed questions Now , here we are , 6 months later , and my son 's cognition has exploded He laughs at jokes and is able to tell his own He has started to ask and answer questions cognitively He initiates and organizes the family during playtime activities Recently , while in the pool , he touched his Dad 's hair and said , Nice haircut , Dad At breakfast , after drinking his juice he asked , Was that mango juice \? I wanted pear juice The morning after I went to see a show he awoke and said , Good morning Mommy How was the show \? Just 2 months ago , a van from a local karate school brought children to the playground that we were at My son was excited to play and ran over to a boy and gave him a two handed chest shove I apologized and quickly led him away before he got a karate chop Just last week , we went back to that same playground I watched nervously as J ran over to a group of three boys I heard him say , Come on guys , let 's play Chase me ! And , you know what they did ! My boy led this group of normal boys all over that playground One of the boys asked him what was his name He told him , My name is J As I glanced around at the other parents scattered about the playground I wondered if I was the only one there who saw a miracle that day My son did experience some symptoms while using GcMAF There was occasional regressive stimming , a rare fever up to 102 , a few shooting head pains with sensitivity to light that lasted for only a few seconds , and he was often tired But , those symptoms were easily lost in the shadows of the exceptional gains that we were experiencing The best part about GcMAF is that Jayden now frequently and spontaneously speaks those words , that for years , I 'd longed to hear , I love you , Mommy And , if that 's not a good enough reason to stick your kid with a needle 27 times , I do n't know what is Dr Bradstreet , there are no words adequate enough to express my sincere and heartfelt appreciation for everything that you 've done for J Thank you for including us in your personal journey of discovery and healing God bless you and your family Sincerely , Dr Bradstreet 's 1 FanShare this",false

Rauner would love to spend these gray winter days focused on his November re election bid against a Democrat opponent , but he ca n't First , he 's got to win the Republican primary on March 20 , in which he will face off against former ally state Rep Jeanne Ives of Wheaton On Monday , Rauner and Ives made a joint appearance before the Tribune Editorial Board at which they sparred over who has the better strategy for addressing Illinois' political dysfunction and creating jobs This is their only scheduled debate you can view it at chicagotribune com gopgov Whenever an incumbent gets a serious primary challenge , that says something that there 's uncertainty among party faithful , or dissatisfaction Such is the case for Rauner , the former private equity executive who defeated Gov Pat Quinn in 2014 as the unconquerable outsider Turns out Rauner has n't been able to bend House Speaker Michael Madigan and the Democratic run General Assembly to his will The governor 's turnaround agenda stalled Residents are fleeing high tax Illinois Employers are bailing , too , or choosing instead to invest in other states We 've begun to think about this election in dire terms The Land of Lincoln has a festering pension crisis and a reputation as a loser Job growth is weak A lot of voters think Illinois must change or die Ives , a social conservative , edged into the race after Rauner signed legislation expanding taxpayer subsidized abortion for women covered by Medicaid or state employee health insurance But now that she 's in , she 's running hard as a critic of the governor 's economic policy chops and his relentless public feuding with Madigan One of Illinois' problems is that Madigan actively blocks the governor 's job growth efforts Before the primary , we will endorse a Republican and a Democratic candidate for governor Today we reach only the conclusion that Ives , now in her third term in the Illinois House , makes a persuasive case as an alternative to Rauner Especially on the question of who might work with , or work around , Madigan and colleagues , Ives presented herself as a Republican legislator who knows how to work with Democrats in Springfield We said at the top of this editorial that the governor is eager to run against a Democrat , not another Republican He made clear Monday he thinks his greatest adversary is Madigan , whom the governor attacked for being a property tax attorney in a state where many property owners challenge their assessments We need to focus on Speaker Madigan and his corruption , Rauner told us He then connected dots from Madigan to J B Pritzker , one of the Democrats running for governor Pritzker is Madigan 's handpicked candidate for governor He 's in effect Madigan 's bagman for funding that whole corrupt culture One comment about such incendiary talk We do n't see how it convinces employers such as Amazon CEO Jeff Bezos , who values a stable culture of governance , to invest money and hire in Illinois Rauner wishes Madigan would just disappear Rauner 's second wish is that the U S Supreme Court rules in Illinois' favor in two cases that could weaken the role of unions and thus make the state appear more friendly and flexible to employers Indeed that 's possible , but it 's bad policy to bet the farm on the deliberation of judges Yet Rauner , as if he were quoting James Earl Jones in Field of Dreams , sounds convinced of his own good luck You watch us boom after the court victories , Rauner promised Even if Madigan is still in power , which I hope he 's not after November , we will get

"Islamic Tribunal Confirmed in Texas Attorney Claims It 's Voluntary'Islamic Tribunal Websiteby Bob Price 27 Jan 2015 027 Jan , 201527 Jan , 2015An Islamic Tribunal using Sharia law in Texas has been confirmed by Breitbart Texas The tribunal is operating as a non profit organization in Dallas One of the attorneys for the tribunal said participation and acceptance of the tribunal 's decisions are voluntary Breitbart Texas spoke with one of the judges , Dr Taher El badawi He said the tribunal operates under Sharia law as a form of non binding dispute resolution El badawi said their organization is a tribunal , not arbitration A tribunal is defined by Meriam Webster 's Dictionary as a court or forum of justice The four Islamic attorneys call themselves judges not arbitrators El badawi said the tribunal follows Sharia law to resolve civil disputes in family and business matters He said they also resolve workplace disputes In matters of divorce , El badawi said that while participation in the tribunal is voluntary , a married couple cannot be considered divorced by the Islamic community unless it is granted by the tribunal He compared their divorce , known as Talaq , as something similar to the Catholic practice of annulment in that the church does not recognize civil divorce proceedings as ending a marriage He also said there is a difference between how a man and a woman can request a divorce under their system The husband can request the divorce directly from the tribunal , El badawi stated The wife must go to an Imam who will request the divorce for her He called it two paths to the same result The practice of Khula is the process where a wife can initiate a divorce proceeding and where the husband can agree to the divorce in exchange for a financial compensation It appears the wife must agree to give up any claim to the dower that was not already paid or to return it if it has already been paid Once the financial issues are resolved the husband can then proclaim the Talaq \( divorce \) El badawi said they follow Texas family law when it comes to child support , visitation , and custody He said that in most cases , custody of children is awarded to the mother Breitbart Texas asked what happens when there is a conflict between Sharia law and Texas law El badawi said most of the time , the laws are in agreement When pushed further he admitted that , we follow Sharia law However , he explained , If the parties are not satisfied with the tribunal 's decision , they do not have to accept it and they can take the matter to Texas civil courts He did not say what the social ramifications of rejecting the judge 's decision would be The website for the Islamic Tribunal states , The courts of the United States of America are costly and consist of ineffective lawyers Discontent with the legal system leads many Muslims in America to postpone justice in this world and opt for an audience on the Day of Judgment It goes on to state , It is with this issue that Muslims here in America are obligated to find a way to solve conflicts and disputes according to the principles of Islamic Law and its legal heritage of fairness and justice in a manner that is reasonable and cost effective In explaining Sharia law , the website states , Stoning adulterers , cutting of the hands , polyandry and the like \( all can be traced in the relevant literature and can be explained in their Islamic legal mentality and rational context in fairness and justice \) , are mainly a part of Islamic Criminal Law In fact criminal law within Islam only makes up a fraction of the Shari'ah It is unscholarly and unfair to generalize that type of understanding , that is Criminal Law , to compromise the whole of Islamic law if we stick to speaking in technical terms The website lists four judges Imam Yusuf Z Kavakci , Imam Moujahed Bakhach , Imam Zia ul Haque Sheikh and Dr El badawi It states the Islamic Tribunal resolves business disputes , divorce \( Talaq \) cases , community problems , serious family problems , and Khula El badawi restated several times that participation in the tribunal is voluntary However , he would not discuss what happens to someone who did not follow their rulings Bob Price is a senior political news contributor for Breitbart Texas and a member of the original Breitbart Texas team Follow him on Twitter BobPriceBBTX Read More Stories About Comment count on this article reflects comments made on Breitbart com and Facebook Visit Breitbart 's Facebook Page BREITBART CONNECT",false

"A terrible double standard has been uncovered within the media , and it centers on one of the left 's favorite talking points this month Underage illegal immigration For weeks , the topic has dominated headlines and sparked what seems like coordinated outrage among liberals Apparently oblivious to the fact that the Obama administration detained minors at the border for years , the left has pointed fingers instead at President Donald Trump for enforcing regulations that were enacted before he was even president Advertisement story continues below Pundits including MSNBC 's Joe Scarborough even compared U S law enforcement officials Pundits including MSNBC 's Joe Scarborough even compared U S law enforcement officials to Nazis , all because they separate children who are brought along during the commission of federal crimes from adults who are being placed into criminal custody This is akin to being outraged because police do n't throw the children of suspects in jail with their parents during arrests , but instead take them into protective environments The left leaning media The left leaning media stayed strangely silent when the detention of migrant children went on for years before Trump took office and now it looks like they also kept quiet when Barack Obama 's administration literally placed immigrant children in the hands of human traffickers just a few years ago Advertisement story continues below The United States government placed an unknown number of Central American migrant children into the custody of human traffickers after neglecting to run the most basic checks on these so called caregivers , ' The United States government placed an unknown number of Central American migrant children into the custody of human traffickers after neglecting to run the most basic checks on these so called caregivers , ' New York magazine reported in 2016 , based on a Senate report Blame Trump ! The problem , for the left , however , is that this horrific mistreatment of immigrant children happened in 2013 right in the middle of the Obama presidency , and two years before Trump even announced he was a candidate In the fall of 2013 , tens of thousands of unaccompanied minors traveled to the U S southern border , continued New York magazine Do you believe a double standard is at play to smear President Trump \?

their abusers , the senator continued The Obama administration was appallingly lax at conducting even basic checks about the adults who showed up to claim migrant children As detention centers became incapable of housing the massive influx of migrants , the Obama run Department of Health and Human Services started placing children into the care of sponsors who would oversee the minors until their bids for refugee status could be reviewed , explained New York magazine , again confirming that the detention of child migrants took place long before Trump Advertisement story continues below The

horrific slavery like circumstances under Obama 's watch Over 90 , 000 immigrant children were placed into so called sponsor care during the time frame of 2013 to 2015 Exactly how many of those fell

search of this incident reveals only a handful of media outlets covering the story between 2013 and 2014 , despite the clearly huge implications of this Obama scandal It seems that when immigration enforcement policies made President Obama look bad , they were swept under the rug Now that the same border problems that have existed for decades can be used against Donald Trump , however , liberal journalists have miraculously found the backbone to cover the story The reality is that border and immigration issues are tough , and children are unfortunately caught in the middle Advertisement story continues below Just as it 's heartbreaking but necessary for police to make an arrest when children are witnesses , or for Child Protective Services to step in when a family situation turns ugly , the presence of minors does n't mean that we stop enforcing national laws This would only encourage law breakers to use children as legal shields as they commit more crimes Reality is n't always pretty There are no easy or magic answers on how to enforce U S border laws while being humane and compassionate to innocent kids dragged into the chaos by adults It 's a difficult situation from any angle Trump 's administration is doing its best to deal with a problem it inherited from past presidents but the fact that the mainstream media barely said a word about much worse treatment

To provide an immediate shot in the state 's economic arm , Batchelder said there should be more of a focus on the needs of industries such as medical and metalworking We are starting to see a real philosophical difference between those who feel the government can create jobs and those who feel that only the private sector can , Batchelder said These 'green jobs' are generational , they are not something that will be ready next week or even next year All of these things are planned for the future there are a lot of ribbons being cut but not a lot of production You ca n't starve on your way to the green job Batchelder said Medina County is particularly poised to play a major role in this short term recovery focus When we create the jobs , it 's also important to have people trained to do them , he said So again , we have to find out from the business community what those needs are , then use or facilities such as the Akron University branch and the Medina County Career Center for that training That sort of business focus has begun to resonate with an increasingly weary electorate , in Batchelder 's view I think people are not so much looking for hope and change as nuts and bolts that maybe we need to be more business focused in order to put this economy back together , he said We have n't had control of the House for the last two years and it 's been malfunctioning , we had 109 session scheduled and held 49 Batchelder said that in spite of the fact that Ohio is in the worst shape since the Depression economically , having such a focus will turn around the state 's fortunes We need people who will roll up their sleeves to do the legislative work that needs done , he said There is no doubt in my mind we are in the position to do that Contact Lisik at \( 216 \) 986 2356",true

"Mitsu Yasukawa The Star LedgerAssemblyman Declan J O'Scanlon speaks during a meeting of the Assembly Budget Committee at the Statehouse Annex in Trenton in June of 2008 By Declan O'ScanlonIt 's a simple question loaded with political appeal With so many people hurting and income disparities rising , should n't we ask New Jersey 's millionaires to pay a fair share' in taxes \? Okay , what 's a fair share \? If the current share of state income tax paid by the top 1 percent of New Jersey 's taxpayers about 37 percent is n't high enough , what is \? Would 80 percent be fair \? Or 90 percent \? Taxpayers earning 1 million pay an effective tax rate that is about four times what taxpayers earning 100 , 000 pay When and how will we know when we 've achieved fairness \? Unfortunately , intense partisanship feeding on visceral emotions has made it virtually impossible to have a rational conversation about taxes in America As a senior member of the state Assembly 's Budget Committee , I think those of us in positions of leadership have a responsibility to do more than stoke emotions , and instead , adopt tax policies that generate the revenue needed to support budget priorities on a fair and sustainable basis Piling taxes on the rich may be great politics , but it 's lousy public policy New Jersey already has a progressive income tax system , which , thanks to high income households receiving a greater proportion of their income from investments and capital gains , has made our revenue base highly volatile Increasing our relative reliance on high income taxpayers will increase volatility , making it more difficult to engage in prudent , long term financial planning Most experts believe increased volatility is a problem because fiscal stability is a condition precedent to sound policymaking Wild fluctuations in revenues fuel an inefficient boom and bust approach to budget making that mismanages expectations The impact of emergent budget cuts on New Jersey residents is regressive those at middle and lower income levels experience the pain of budget cuts disproportionately , since they more often benefit from state programs Some editorialists have suggested Gov Andrew Cuomo 's recent decision to embrace higher rates for high income New Yorkers should serve as an example for New Jersey New York 's current high rate is 8 97 percent , the same as New Jersey 's Instead of letting the rate go down to 6 85 percent , as scheduled , Cuomo is saying he 'll let the rate fall to 8 82 percent for taxpayers at 2 million or more , but let the rate fall to 6 85 percent for taxpayers between 300 , 000 and 2 million Everyone in New York will get a tax cut , but folks above 2 million will get less of a tax cut than they had expected If that 's the standard of fairness , maybe the editorialists are right and we should follow New York 's example Here 's the critical point The top marginal rate in New York will soon fall below the top rate in New Jersey that 's not good news for our competitive position A review of national IRS data by Charles Steindel , the state Treasury 's chief economist , confirmed a statistical connection between tax increases enacted under former Gov James E McGreevey and an increase of affluent taxpayers who moved out of , or never moved into , New Jersey Steindel also conducted a survey confirming a significant proportion of tax advisers had discussed the idea of moving out of New Jersey with their relatively affluent clients The study and survey were modest in scope and merely confirmed what we already know Yes , Virginia , taxes matter Are they the only competitive consideration \? Absolutely not Infrastructure , regulations , climate , educational levels and other factors play a major role Instead of asking What 's fair \? we should be asking What 's in our long term self interest \? I suggest it 's in New Jersey 's interest to pursue policies that support sustainable and growing revenue collections over time Although New Jersey cannot expect to compete globally on the basis of low taxes alone , we should avoid negative outlier status and , with it , the kind of reputation that once prevented the Garden State from getting into the starting blocks when companies make site selections Assemblyman Declan O'Scanlon \( R Monmouth \) is the ranking Republican on the state 's Assembly Budget Committee Most Read",true

"By Mikey CampbellMonday , March 02 , 2015 , 06 55 pm PT \( 09 55 pm ET \) Investment firm Piper Jaffray issued a report on Monday breaking down expected Apple Watch average selling prices , saying an aggregate of consumers will likely spend closer to 550 on the device , considering case and internal storage options Building off Apple 's quoted starting price of 349 , analyst Gene Munster anticipates combined Apple Watch ASPs to fall closer to 550 , or 575 to 600 including additional bands Apple Watch will come in three separate price tiers Apple Watch Sport , Apple Watch and Apple Watch Edition each series including two display sizes and a variety of strap choices Starting with Apple Watch Sport , the aluminum and glass version widely thought to be the least expensive model , Munster expects an ASP of 450 after factoring in configuration alternatives like case and internal storage options The stainless steel Apple Watch model , which also features a more expensive sapphire glass cover , is expected to start at 499 to 549 , again depending on customizable features Munster sees an overall ASP at around 650 for the mid tier Watch series On the high end , the analyst forecasts base model Apple Watch Edition devices to start at 4 , 999 , but classifies segment ASP closer to 7 , 500 after adding in straps made from precious metals Based on current pricing for Apple 's silicon iPhone 6 cases , which come in at 35 , Munster sees elastomer Apple Watch straps to start in a similar 29 to 35 range , while leather bands could be priced between 49 to 59 Pricing for metal bands like the link bracelet and Milanese loop are more difficult to determine , but the analyst believes steel versions will come in at 99 , while gold bands could be priced into the thousands of dollars If you assume that 55 percent of bands purchased are elastomer , 35 percent leather , 10 percent steel , and about 5 , 000 total gold bands are sold , the average band ASP could be around 50 , Munster writes He added that if half of all Watch buyers purchase a band assuming 8 million Watches are sold in 2015 the accessory range would add 25 to Apple 's watch category , equating to a 575 ASP If every Watch customer purchases an extra strap , it would tack on 50 , bringing ASP up to 600 The lower cost Sport model is expected to make up 55 percent of overall Watch sales , while the mid tier Apple Watch will take another 45 percent That leaves very little room for Apple Watch Edition , but Munster believes Apple might sell roughly 10 , 000 units this year In an interesting comparison , the firm calculates that Apple Watch Edition business could equate to about two percent of luxury watchmaker Rolex , which moves between 600 , 000 to 750 , 000 units each year Finally , Munster expects Apple to reveal a better sense of device pricing at its March 9 event , as well as highlight special features to drum up consumer interest ahead of release AppleInsider will be covering the Spring forward event live from San Francisco 's Yerba Buena Center next week Topics",false
"Y es , said Parkland student es , said Parkland student Emma Gonz lez She and her fellow students at Parkland 's Marjory Stoneman Douglas High School ostracized fellow student Nikolas Cruz Said Gonz lez when speaking in Washington at the anti gun March for Our Lives Since he was in middle school , it was no surprise to anyone who knew him , that he was the shooter Those talking about how we should have not ostracized him \? You did n't know this kid ! OK \? We did ! Which is to say , Gonz lez just made a startling admission Parkland students bullied Nikolas Cruz It may well be that Gonz lez is right the rest of us did n't know him But there are a large number of people some of whom are celebrities and either marched in and or supported the March who have spent years insisting that what Gonz lez and her friends who ostracized Nikolas Cruz did was bullying Take actress Debra Messing Messing is Take actress Debra Messing Messing is listed on this site called Stomp Out Bullying The site describes itself as follows STOMP Out Bullying , a national anti bullying and cyberbullying program for kids and teens , is a signature program of STOMP Out Bullying , a national anti bullying and cyberbullying program for kids and teens , is a signature program of Love Our Children USA , the national nonprofit leader in fighting violence against children since 1999 Created in 2005 , STOMP Out Bullying focuses on reducing and preventing bullying , cyberbullying , sexting and other digital abuse , educating against homophobia , racism and hatred , decreasing school absenteeism , and deterring violence in schools , online and in communities across the country It teaches effective solutions on how to respond to all forms of bullying as well as educating kids and teens in school and online , providing help for those in need and at risk of suicide , raising awareness , peer mentoring programs in schools , public service announcements by noted celebrities , and social media campaigns An additional focus educates parents on how to keep their children safe and responsible online Fair enough They are opposed to bullying and support educating kids and teens in school and online , providing help for those in need and at risk of suicide All to the good But now look at this tweet from Messing I stand with the brave , indomitable kids who galvanized a nation , a world , did not take inaction as an answer You have put the adults in DC to shame CS gun laws with finally be enacted , you will be the Heroes of a generation TODAY you lead us all I stand with the brave , indomitable kids who galvanized a nation , a world , did not take inaction as an answer You have put the adults in DC to shame CS gun laws with finally be enacted , you will be the Heroes of a generation TODAY you lead us all MarchForOurLives Debra Messing \( DebraMessing \) Debra Messing \( DebraMessing \) March 24 , 2018 Again , to be fair , Messing has no more idea what went on in the day to day life of Parkland 's high school than any other outsider But it is striking that her first reaction to support the kids completely contradicts the stated objective of the STOMP Out Bullying program which she also supports For as we all now know , there on the platform at the March is one of the Parkland students turned anti gun activist blurting out to the world that , well , yes , the peers of Nikolas Cruz , in their common high school , bullied him by ostracizing him and who knows what else And the excuse \? Well , the rest of us did n't know him , you see and per Gonz lez , if we did we would know Nikolas Cruz deserved to be ostracized He deserved to be bullied In the immediate aftermath of the shooting , in which Cruz took 17 lives , the TC Palm of the USA Today network In the immediate aftermath of the shooting , in which Cruz took 17 lives , theTC Palmof theUSA Todaynetwork headlined this Florida school shooting Student knew Cruz I could have said something to administrators' The story reports the following Marolo Alvarez remembers students taunting Nikolas Cruz He looked like a school shooter , Alvarez said students used to say about him Alvarez , who spoke to reporters at Alvarez , who spoke to reporters at a vigil for victims of the area 's second mass shooting in 13 months , said he wishes he had said something earlier I could have said something to administrators , that hey this kid gets bullied a lot , please help him , please reach out to him ' I kind of regret not doing that , Alvarez said Catch that \? Nikolas Cruz was n't just bullied he was bullied a lot Now Nobody is going to blame Alvarez , an 11th grader He at least had the thought that he should say something But all these kids who are now momentary celebrities and out there with more than a whiff of self righteousness blaming the NRA \? One has to wonder Who among them bullied Nikolas Cruz \? Gonz lez admits to it What about David Hogg \? Or Cameron Kasky \? Or the rest on that Time magazine cover that blares the caption Enough Kasky has played an important role in the protest , Kasky has played an important role in the protest , writing this at CNN We ca n't ignore the issues of gun control that this tragedy raises And so , I'm asking no , demanding we take action now Why \? Because at the end of the day , the students at my school felt one shared experience our politicians abandoned us by failing to keep guns out of schools But this time , my classmates and I are going to hold them to account This time we are going to pressure them to take action This time we are going to force them to spend more energy protecting human lives than unborn fetuses Well aside from the appalling notion part of the left wing canon that unborn babies are not human lives , note that Kamsky and doubtless his friends are intent on holding other people to account Politicians But nowhere are they saying that maybe , just maybe , they need to have a good long look in the nearest mirror and ask themselves what 11th grader Alvarez is asking Which is could they have done more \? Were any of them as Emma Gonz lez admits participating in the ostracizing of Nikolas Cruz \? Were any of these kids in any way bullying Cruz \? All too often Americans see stories where some bullied kid feels so set upon by his or her peers that they commit suicide Nikolas Cruz effectively committed suicide , by killing seventeen people , most of them students peers He will face the death penalty and one would think he will get it But the problem undiscussed at this rally the other day was the responsibility of Cruz 's peers themselves in not taking the STOMP Out Bullying message into their own hearts and practice Instead , as Emma Gonz lez freely admits , they did exactly what so many celebrities like Debra Messing and others say they are so passionate about They bullied a kid , taunted him Because , like , you know , he deserved it He was so weird The really sad part is that this was just another day in high school , where since forever the popular kids sneer at the geeks , the nerds , and the weirdos But in this case , when something terrible happened , the kids blamed the politicians for their troubles And no adult blinked",false

"Editor Note The legal argument for the removal of Pelosi is about halfway into the article The petition can be found at the end Make sure to pass this around if it hits home with you America , we have a problem There is someone who needs to be impeached , fired , and removed from office There is a very particular leader in our country that is refusing to do the job that she was elected by the American people to do Not only is she refusing to do her job , her policies are dangerous for LEO 's and treasonous to America We can no longer sit idly by and be abused by this woman and her selfish ideas of how she thinks America should be Friday President Trump announced that he would be signing a temporary deal that would fund our federal government until February 15 , 2019 in order to make sure federal government employees would get paid The big surprise was that this temporary deal came without any money funding the border wall , which has been the catalyst in the stand off between Trump and the Nancy Pelosi led Democrats After President Trump 's announcement came a fury of feelings from both sides of the aisle What ensued was based off of President Trump declaring that if there is no deal reached by February 15th , he would be declaring a national emergency to fund the wall and Nancy Pelosi leading a braggadocious celebration that she had defeated Trump Social media exploded with reactions to the surprising move But many people that were most impacted by this temporary deal were Law Enforcement Officers The real issue at hand is which side , Trump or Pelosi , really has LEO 's best interest at heart , and American 's best interest at heart \? Who was willing to give in on what they were demanding in order to re open the government so that the 800 , 000 federal workers who were not getting paid could receive their paychecks \? I'm going to argue in favor of President Trump and explain why Nancy Pelosi is not only a traitor to LEO 's , she is a traitor to the American people Let 's look at the numbers These are the estimates from the Senate Appropriations Committee on the number of LEO 's that were not getting paid while the government was shut down Law enforcement More than 41 , 000 federal law enforcement and correctional officers were not getting paid , including 2 , 614 Bureau of Alcohol , Tobacco , Firearms and Explosives \( ATF \) agents 16 , 742 Bureau of Prisons correctional officers 13 , 709 FBI agents 3 , 600 Deputy U S Marshals 4 , 399 Drug Enforcement Administration \( DEA \) agents Homeland security Up to 88 percent of Department of Homeland Security employees were not getting paid , including 53 , 000 TSA employees 54 , 000 Customs and Border Protection agents and customs officers 42 , 000 Coast Guard employees President Trump 's decision to sign a temporary deal to re open the government , without the funding for the border wall , shows how much compassion he feels towards these federal employees Nancy Pelosi , Chuck Schumer , and the Democrats complete unwillingness to negotiate over the past 35 days shows they do n't care at all about people not getting paid to do their jobs while they work After all , Pelosi , Schumer and all of Congress received their paychecks the entire time the government was shut down Remember President Trump works for free because he donates every one of his Presidential paychecks , so his motivation was not related to money Worse than not caring about LEO 's getting paid , Nancy Pelosi also votes and passes laws that are dangerous to our security and dangerous to the lives of LEO 's Nancy Pelosi 's Sanctuary Policies that provide aid , comfort , and protection to illegal aliens make it extremely difficult for LEO 's to preform their jobs , which they took an oath and swore to uphold and enforce the laws of this land For example , in March , Nancy Pelosi , who accused the Trump administration and ICE agents of carrying out cowardly attacks on illegal immigrants , issued the statement after the Justice Department filed a lawsuit against California , claiming three recently passed state laws are deliberately interfering with federal immigration enforcement Nancy Pelosi 's disdain for ICE is obvious from her statement The people of California will not be bowed by the Trump administration 's brazen aggression and intimidation tactics , the California Democrat said Californians will continue to proudly keep our doors open to the immigrants who make America more American We will fight this sham lawsuit and will fight all cowardly attacks on our immigrant communities Nancy Pelosi clearly chooses illegals over ICE agents Her support of sanctuary and protection for illegal criminals is truly unreal for an elected representative of the American people , and treasonous behavior puts ICE agents in danger and makes their ability to do their jobs extremely difficult Perhaps one of the most infuriating recent examples of how Nancy Pelosi and her sanctuary policies hurt LEO 's is the murder of Corporal Singh Singh was a legalized immigrant to the US and was living his American dream of being a police officer in the state of California Corporal Singh was murdered by illegal alien , Gustavo Perez Arraiga , who was a dangerous gang member California 's sanctuary law includes more than 800 exceptions for violent crimes and felonies and bars police from asking people about their citizenship status These are laws that Nancy Pelosi supports because she cares more about illegal aliens than she cares about legal citizens and LEO 's being able to perform their jobs safely Do you know what Nancy Pelosi 's response to the murder of Corporal Singh was \? Nothing Not a peep No response to the murder of a legal immigrant who was serving the people of California as a police officer Zero However , Nancy Pelosi did issue comments that day She decried the deaths of two illegal immigrant children that died the same day , bashed the government shut down , and on New Year 's Eve she promoted her upcoming MSNBC special Corporal Singh worked for Newman Police Department which was not far from her district in San Francisco President Trump called the family of Corporal Singh expressing his condolences and again cried out for the need for a border wall and the dangers of illegals At this point , can we just say that Nancy Pelosi seems to care less about LEO 's lives \? To her Blue Lives do n't matter Only Illegal Lives do or should we say illegal votes I will go further Nancy Pelosi needs to be arrested for treason ! This House Majority Leader , Nancy Pelosi , was first elected to the House of Representatives in 1987 , some 32 years ago , and is now 78 years old The average age of retirement in the US is 62 years old Americans can start collecting Social Security at age 62 Yet Nancy Pelosi refuses to retire and pry her fingers off of her powerful seat , California 's 12th Congressional District At this point , it would be easy for me to make a case for term limits for all elected Congressional Representatives However in this case , I'm actually going to argue for a case of treason First and foremost , our elected Representatives take an oath to office swearing to support and defend the Constitution of the United States against all enemies , foreign and domestic 5 U S Code 3331 Oath of office states An individual , except the President , elected or appointed to an office of honor or profit in the civil service or uniformed services , shall take the following oath I , AB , do solemnly swear \( or affirm \) that I will support and defend the Constitution of the United States against all enemies , foreign and domestic that I will bear true faith and allegiance to the same that I take this obligation freely , without any mental reservation or purpose of evasion and that I will well and faithfully discharge the duties of the office on which I am about to enter So help me God This section does not affect other oaths required by law According to Article 1 , Section 6 of the United States Constitution states this about why Senators and Representatives can be arrested The Senators and Representatives shall receive a Compensation for their Services , to be ascertained by Law , and paid out of the Treasury of the United States They shall in all Cases , except Treason , Felony and Breach of the Peace , be privileged from Arrest during their Attendance at the Session of their respective Houses , and in going to and returning from the same and for any Speech or Debate in either House , they shall not be questioned in any other Place According to 18 U S Code 2381 Treason is defined as follows Whoever , owing allegiance to the United States , levies war against them or adheres to their enemies , giving them aid and comfort within the United States or elsewhere , is guilty of treason and shall suffer death , or shall be imprisoned not less than five years and fined under this title but not less than 10 , 000 and shall be incapable of holding any office under the United States Our U S Constitution and U S Code of Law tells us that treason is a serious crime , even punishable by death There are only three crimes that United States elected Representatives of the House or the Senate can be arrested for treason , felony , and breach of peace Given that Nancy Pelosi , upon taking her oath of office , swore to support and defend the U S against all enemies , why has she engaged in passing laws that provide Sanctuary to illegals , continue to oppose funding to a border wall to protect our national security , and obstruct any negotiations to fund the border wall ending the government shut down \? Let 's break this down Nancy Pelosi is worth hundreds of millions of dollars and is elected to SERVE America and Americans , yet every decision she makes using American 's tax dollars , is about making sure our southern border is open to drug cartels , human trafficking , and a full on illegal invasion In the state of California , she is a major ring leader of the political organized crime ring that is destroying the beautiful state of California with their traitorous Sanctuary policies These anti American policies are designed to destroy the state and our country financially , guarantee illegal Democrat votes , and ruin beyond repair the sovereignty of the United States of America ! Not only that , but Nancy Pelosi voted Nay on HR 3004 Kate 's Law , which was a bill that increases criminal penalties of undocumented immigrants reentering the United States after being deported once already Kate Steinle , an American citizen , was murdered in San Francisco in Nancy Pelosi 's very own district , by an illegal alien who was a seven time felon and deported five times Again Nancy Pelosi voted NO to Kate 's Law ! Voted NO to protecting her own citizens ! Voted NO against Americans over illegals ! This clearly provides aid and and comfort to enemies to Americans Nancy Pelosi is a criminal , guilty of treason by refusing to lead her political party to fund the wall and border security measures that would protect our national security Nancy Pelosi is a criminal guilty of treason by being a key member of a tyrannical government that has enslaved the American people into 21 trillion dollars in debt , which China owns most of our debt Nancy Pelosi is a traitor to the American people who pay her paycheck and expenses for her service , security , staff , and travel , while she takes our hard earned tax dollars to send billions of our hard earned tax dollars to foreign governments , yet refuses to fund our border wall of 5 7 billion for our national security Particularly she wants to send 10 billion to Mexico this year , yet refuses to meet with our president for lunch to work out a deal for our safety and government budget Nancy Pelosi is a traitor to America because while she refuses to fund our border wall for our national security , she uses our hard earned tax dollars to pay her travel expenses to fly to Hawaii and vacation , then turning right around to fly and party in Puerto Rico with lobbyist , PACS , and celebrities , while simultaneously forcing a government shut down causing 800 , 000 federal workers to not get paid Thanks to President Trump , they will get paid at least until Feb 15th Nancy Pelosi is a traitor to the American people because she refuses to meet with Angel families yet boast continually about her Christianity and uses pious words to talk down anyone who stands in her path Never forget she voted NO against Kate 's Law ! The bottom line is America has a crisis It is real Walls work Nancy Pelosi knows walls work and that is why she and other Democrats voted yes to fund 500 million of U S tax payer 's dollars in 2018 to fund a 287 mile border wall in Jordan to protect it against terrorist along it 's border with Syria and Iraq We have drugs , human trafficking , and terrorist coming across our border daily and Nancy Pelosi refuses to fund OUR border wall Nancy Pelosi refuses to protect America from enemies attacking us through our unprotected wide open border Nancy Pelosi is breaking her oath of office to protect and defend the U S against enemies Nancy Pelosi is giving aid and comfort to the millions of illegals who invade the U S by providing them with sanctuary and by refusing to fund the wall to protect our southern border from enemies who invade our lands Nancy Pelosi will again refuse to fund the wall when February 15th arrives to shut down the government again Nancy Pelosi will continue in her obstinance in order to continue her war with Trump Nancy Pelosi is proving over and over she could care less about our nation 's laws , those who enforce our laws , and our national security Nancy Pelosi is guilty of treason Nancy Pelosi must be impeached , fired , and removed from office , for committing treason Once upon a time in this country , The People gave a damn Once upon a time The People stood for something Once upon a time The People would stand up against wrongs and would take action to right them Do something Sign the petition to Impeach Nancy Pelosi We need 100 , 000 signatures in 30 days in order for this petition to get a response from the White House We need The People to take a stand and send a message that we will not tolerate this type of political corruption any longer With everyone 's support , we can then move to the next level It 's time Sign , verify , and make a difference by clicking here Marjorie Taylor Greene is a proud Whiskey Patriot , entrepreneur , business owner , writer , commentator , speaker , defender of the Second Amendment , shooting enthusiast , CrossFit athlete , wife , and mother redeemed through grace She states Our life is a sum total of our decisions Every day I have the gift to choose to make it an amazing life",false
"Flashback Hillary Clinton 's Longtime Support for Sanctuary CitiesAP Photo Frank Franklin IIby Caroline May 8 Jul 2015 08 Jul , 20158 Jul , 2015While Democratic presidential candidate Hillary Clinton now says cities should comply with federal immigration requests , she has been a supporter of sanctuary city policies in the past In 2007 at a Democratic debate in New Hampshire Clinton expressed support for sanctuary city policies NBC'S Tim Russert Senator Clinton , would you allow the sanctuary cities to exist \? Clinton Well , in addition to the general points that have been made , that I agree with , why do they have sanctuary cities \? In large measure because if local law enforcement begins to act like immigration enforcement officers , what that means is that you will have people not reporting crimes You will have people hiding from the police And I think that is a real direct threat to the personal safety and security of all the citizens So this is a result of the failure of the federal government , and that 's where it needs to be fixed Russert But you would allow the sanctuary cities to disobey the federal law Clinton Well , I do n't think there is any choice The ICE groups go in and raid individuals , but if you 're a local police chief and you 're trying to solve a crime that you know people from the immigrant community have information about , they may not talk to you if they think you 're also going to be enforcing the immigration laws Local law enforcement has a different job than federal immigration enforcement The problem is the federal government has totally abdicated its responsibility During an interview with Bill O'Reilly in 2008 , highlighted this week by MRCTV , Clinton was equally on board with the idea of sanctuary policies O'Reilly Are you going to crack down on the sanctuary cities \? Clinton No , I'm not And I 'll tell you why O'Reilly Whoa Clinton I'm not , I'm not because the reason why a lot of those folks do it in New York , why do police officers turn a blind eye \? O'Reilly Because they want them to report crimes Clinton They want them to report crimes Because O'Reilly Does n't override Clinton the well , sometimes you have two competing values You want to report crime , you want to protect people and the violence spills way beyond whatever community In the wake of the murder of Kate Steinle at the hands of a multiple deportee , multiple felon Clinton is now saying cities should cooperate with federal officials CNN 's Brianna Keilar Last week , an undocumented immigrant who had been deported five times , killed a 32 year old woman , Kate Steinle , in San Francisco , a sanctuary city where local law enforcement does not enforce federal immigration laws When you last ran for President you supported sanctuary cities In light of this terrible incident , does that change anything about your view on this \? Clinton Well what should be done is any city should listen to the Department of Homeland Security , which as I understand it , urged them to deport this man again after he got out of prison another time Here 's a case where we 've deported , we 've deported , we 've deported , he ends back up in our country and I think the city made a mistake The city made a mistake not to deport someone that the federal government strongly felt should be deported So I have absolutely no support for a city that ignores the strong evidence that should be acted on However , there are , like if it were the first time traffic citation , if it were something minor , a misdemeanor , that 's entirely different This man had already been deported five times , and he should have been deported at the request of the federal government Read More Stories About Comment count on this article reflects comments made on Breitbart com and Facebook Visit Breitbart 's Facebook Page BREITBART CONNECT",true

Missouri state Sen Maria Chappelle Nadal , D University City , wrote during a morning Facebook exchange , referring to Republican President Donald Trump She quickly deleted her post , but not quickly enough By midafternoon , the political verdicts of her own party were rolling in U S Sen Claire McCaskill , D Mo I condemn it Its outrageous And she should resign U S Rep William Lacy Clay , D St Louis \( C \) alling for the assassination of the President is a federal crime \( She is \) an embarrassment to our state She should resign immediately Missouri Democratic Party Chair Stephen Webber The Party will absolutely not tolerate calls for the assassination of the President I believe she should resign Missouri Senate Democratic Caucus leader Sen Gina Walsh \( She \) should be ashamed of herself for adding her voice to this toxic environment Republican Gov Eric Greitens said in a statement We can have differences in our country , but no one should encourage political violence The senator should resign Lt Gov Mike Parson , a Republican , and state Auditor Nicole Galloway , a Democrat , also called for Chappelle Nadals resignation In an interview , Chappelle Nadal acknowledged she wrote the offending line on her personal Facebook page in response to another commenter before deleting it I didnt mean what I put up Absolutely not I was very frustrated Things have got to change , Chappelle Nadal told the Post Dispatch It was in response to the concerns that I am hearing from residents of St Louis I have deleted it , and it should have been deleted , but there is something way more important that we should be talking about She added later I am not resigning What I said was wrong , but I am not going to stop talking about what led to that , which is the frustration and anger that many people across America are feeling right now Chappelle Nadal said her comment stemmed from frustration over the events in Charlottesville over the weekend , in which a white supremacist protester allegedly rammed his car into a group of counterprotesters , killing a 32 year old woman 1 Trumps reaction to the tragedy , which included the assertion that both sides of the protests were to blame for the violence , has drawn criticism across the political spectrum There are people who are afraid of white supremacists in the aftermath of Charlottesville , she said There are people who are having nightmares There are people who are afraid of going out in the streets Its worse than even Ferguson According to a screenshot of the now deleted conversation obtained by the Post Dispatch , another commenter named Christopher Gagne was writing about a cousin of his who he said was on Trumps Secret Service detail But , what I posted earlier , I truly believe will happen , sooner not later , he wrote In a subsequent interview with the Post Dispatch , Gagne said that wasnt a reference to assassination , but to his earlier stated belief that Vice President Mike Pence will use the 25th Amendment of the Constitution to have Trump removed from office Damn , Gagne then wrote , now Ill probably get a visit from the Secret Service He followed that comment with smdh , an abbreviation for shaking my damn head Chappelle Nadal responded No I will I hope Trump is assassinated !

Shes also tried to exert political payback against her foes She spent nearly 20 , 000 on negative ads against Rep Joe Adams , whom she had defeated in her race for the Senate five years previously She got into a fight with Sen Jamilah Nasheed , D St Louis , at a Lil Wayne concert at Scottrade Center in 2011 over legislation regarding local control of the city police department Last year , she unsuccessfully challenged Clay , the St Louis based congressman , in the Democratic primary During the most recent legislative session , Chappelle Nadal focused her efforts on a controversial buyout program for homeowners in the Spanish Village neighborhood of Bridgeton who have been impacted by pollution in the nearby Westlake Landfill Initially , she wanted her colleagues to approve a 12 million program and threatened to shut down the Senate with a filibuster if it didnt move forward She backed off when the Senate endorsed a 1 million pilot program But the House didnt agree and she left the Capitol in May with nothing Kurt Erickson and Joe Holleman of the Post Dispatch contributed to this report ndn video player 3 ndn embedded ndn floatContainer margin top 10px margin bottom 20px",true
"Say Oregon Reps Peter DeFazio and Earl Blumenauer are socialists who are openly serving in the U S Congress Bloggers on Friday , August 12th , 2011 in web pagesBloggers claim Peter DeFazio and Earl Blumenauer are socialistsBy Charles Pope on Monday , August 29th , 2011 at 5 03 p m Bloggers are spreading a list of so called socialists in Congress Democratic Rep Peter DeFazio has been called a lot of things over his 12 terms in Congress hot head , visionary , renegade , principled , effective and determined Now , if a burst of activity on websites and blogs in recent weeks is to be believed , DeFazio is something else a socialist And he 's not alone The posts , all of which piggyback from a single offering that has been replicated on dozens of websites in recent weeks , says there are 70 card carrying Socialists in the House of Representatives , including Rep Earl Blumenauer , another Democrat from Oregon \( The number actually varies Some posts say 70 while others insist it 's either 73 or 76 One post used both 76 and 75 in the same entry \) An Aug 12 post on the website for a group called Sovereign Citizens United mentions DeFazio and Blumenauer by name It also says this I'm sure if you asked random people on the street if we had open socialists in the US Congress , they would say well only Bernie Sanders \( Senate \) But the right answer is much , much worse This should come as a surprise to absolutely no one , says an Aug 16 post on ConservativeByte com The radical Marxist progressives \( communists \) took control of the Democrat party some time ago They 've only become more emboldened with the election of Barack Obama , who was raised as a communist from birth In case you miss the point , the post comes equipped with a large and very bright hammer and sickle emblem While most of the names politicians are called are opinions , calling a congressman a Socialist sounds both emphatic and exact , which always gets our attention here at PolitiFact Oregon Another thing that gets our attention is when a claim gets spread far and wide This one meets that test , too Here 's a blog post on Aug 17 by Texas radio host Dan Cofall , whose show airs out of Fort Worth The magic number 70' is the number of members of the 111th Congress who are members of the Democratic Socialists of America \( DSA \) These are not just politicians who vote left of center these are card carrying members of The Democratic Socialists of America' Cofall did not respond to an email asking for comment And we could n't reach anyone from ConservativeByte Before we get to our ruling , let 's begin with some basics Congress resets itself every two years , which means the current edition is the 112th Congress , not the 111th Why does that matter \? Because the new Congress that begins in January every two years always follows an election and some of the people on the list are no longer in office Cofall acknowledges this but then continues to list names from the 111th Congress anyway Those listed as card carrying socialists who are no longer serving include Robert Wexler \( Florida \) , Phil Hare \( Illinois \) , John Hall \( New York \) , Alan Grayson \( Florida \) , and Neil Abercrombie \( Hawaii \) Then there 's this Real card carrying Socialists say those members , including DeFazio and Blumenauer , are n't Socialists The list that Cofall and dozens more rely upon is completely fraudulent , said Frank Llewellyn , who served as national director of the Democratic Socialists of America for 10 years until stepping down July 5 There is not one member of Congress who is a formal member of the DSA , Llewellyn said In order to join , a person must fill out a form and pay dues Even Vermont Sen Bernie Sanders , a self described democratic socialist , is not a formal member of the DSA , Llewellyn said The last member of Congress who was an actual card carrying member , he said , was California Democratic Rep Ron Dellums , who served 28 years in the House until leaving in 1998 Llewellyn and DSA 's new national director , Maria Svart are chagrined for two reasons First , they have to spend time knocking down reports that never seem to go away Second , Llewellyn said , if we had formal political relationships with 70 odd members , we would be making a lot more money'' from dues For the record , both DeFazio and Blumenauer say they 've never been associated with the Democratic Socialists of America This is another made up Internet rumor that has no merit , DeFazio said I am a proud Democrat who has taken many independent stands over the years I am anti so called free trade , pro American jobs , pro infrastructure investment , pro fair taxation , anti amnesty , pro balanced budget amendment , pro Wall Street re regulation , and pro audit the Pentagon and Federal Reserve I am an Oregonian and an independent thinker Blumenauer was equally annoyed No matter which side of the political aisle it comes from , this kind of name calling and rhetoric represents exactly what is wrong with our democracy today , he said Rather than bringing people together to solve our nation 's problems , it spreads false and divisive allegations throughout the media and the public It is a major distraction from the real work that needs to get done Bad information gets spread all the time But where did the number , or numbers , come from \? The list purported to have originated with the DSA says this on page two Q How many members of the U S Congress are also members of the DSA \? A SeventyIt then lists them by name What it does not say is that the names are simply lifted en masse from the membership of the Congressional Progressive Caucus , a collection of liberal leaning lawmakers that includes DeFazio and Blumenauer but officially , not a single socialist According to its website , the Progressive Caucus is one of the largest in Congress and works for such causes as economic justice , civil rights and civil liberties as well as global peace and security Llewellyn said that DSA supports some of the policy positions of the caucus Voicing support for positions embraced by a group of lawmakers is a routine part of business on Capitol Hill and is employed by organizations as disparate as the U S Chamber of Commerce , the National Rifle Association and NORML , a group devoted to legalizing the use of marijuana But agreeing with some positions does n't make a member of Congress a card carrying Socialist Llewellyn says similar accusations of Socialism \( with a capital S \) have surfaced every election year since 1991 when the Progressive Caucus was created There 's nothing we can do to stop it , Llewellyn said I ca n't tell you the number of times we 've tried to stop it Misinformation and smear campaigns also are part of political life But these persistent claims about socialists are riddled with errors and outright lies Any one of the problems would be sufficient to discredit the report , but taken together , the effort is flagrantly false For that reason , we rate this claim Pants on Fire",false

Virginia Gov Terry McAuliffe will no longer have to answer questions about his potential role in a Clinton administration And U S Rep Robert C Bobby Scott and a handful of Republican hopefuls can shelve their battle plans for a special election to fill Kaines seat As Donald Trumps stunning victory over Hillary Clinton rocks national politics , few states are feeling the consequences as swiftly as Virginia Kaines failure to ascend to the vice presidency simplifies Virginias electoral calendar , but Trumps win shook up the 2017 governors race thats already underway Corey Stewart , a 2017 GOP gubernatorial hopeful who served as chairman of Trumps Virginia campaign for almost a year but was fired last month for aggressively protesting the Republican National Committee , declared in an interview that Trumps victory propels him to frontrunner status for the GOP nomination He attacked Republican rival Ed Gillespie , an early leader in gubernatorial fundraising and endorsements , as being insufficiently loyal to the president elect Ed Gillespie treated Donald Trump like he had typhoid , Stewart said He would not appear with him on stage He would not mention his name unless he was condemning him A former Republican National Committee chairman , Gillespie has kept his distance from Trump while voicing support for the GOP ticket He introduced Indiana Gov Mike Pence , Trumps running mate , at two rallies , but was noticeably absent from the Trump campaigns Virginia leadership committee that included the other two Republican gubernatorial candidates , Rep Robert J Wittman , R 1st , and state Sen Frank W Wagner , R Virginia Beach In a statement , Chris Leavitt , executive director of Gillespies political action committee , said Gillespies support for the Trump Pence ticket was clear from the beginning Nows the time to bring our country and party together , but once again Corey is putting his personal political ambitions first , Leavitt said And if he wants to anoint himself , thats fine We see how well Hillary Clintons coronation went With no U S Senate vacancy for McAuliffe to fill , the governors race will unfold without the added drama of a special election for Kaines seat McAuliffes pick would have had to defend the seat in a special election next year and again in 2018 when it comes up for its regularly scheduled election Scott , D 3rd , was widely seen as the favorite to get the nod from McAuliffe , who declined to publicly discuss Senate prospects until after Election Day Wittman was rumored to be considering switching to run for Kaines Senate seat if it came open A spokesman said Wednesday that his plans for 2017 remain the same , adding that Wittman is thrilled to be a part of the chance that Republican victories in the House , Senate and White House represent Wittman was easily re elected to his congressional seat Tuesday With the Senate seat now a moot point for next year , all eyes will be on the governors race Virginias race is expected to draw national interest as one of only two gubernatorial races along with New Jerseys scheduled for what will be Trumps first year as president Though Clinton lost nationally , she won Virginia by roughly 5 points , continuing the streak of statewide wins for Democrats She ran up large margins in the key counties of Fairfax , Loudoun , Prince William and Henrico , a sign that Democrats hold demographic advantages that Republicans have struggled to overcome in state races The Republican candidate for governor who is selected in a June primary will face Democratic Lt Gov Ralph S Northam Democrats have sought to link the four Republican candidates to Trump The Democratic Party of Virginia launched a website late last month intended to hold Republican gubernatorial candidates accountable for supporting and enabling the most dangerous candidate to ever be nominated by a major party But instead of Trump serving as a past embarrassment for Republicans looking to move on , Trump will have taken up residence across the Potomac as Virginians choose a new leader In a statement , Northam congratulated Trump and said he was disappointed in the result but proud of Clinton and Kaine We will continue to advocate for our values like defending womens access to reproductive health care and equality while building on our economic progress by focusing on workforce development , attracting new industries and promoting our quality of life , Northam said Stewart , a Prince William supervisor , said he hopes to implement the Trump agenda on a state level by cracking down on illegal immigration , replacing the Affordable Care Act and scrapping regulations on businesses But Stewarts decision to take part in a protest outside the RNCs headquarters in Washington seems to have burned bridges with the Trump campaign Mike Rubino , the Trump campaigns Virginia state director , said Stewart acted like a petulant child and hurt Trumps chances by dividing the party He constantly pitted people against each other , Rubino said He was actively running for governor on my bosss coattails while my boss was seeking the highest office in the land That , to me , is disloyalty Stewart called his alliance with Trump a Hail Mary pass thats now paying off Ive embraced Trump and defended him when other people wouldnt , Stewart said And I believe that loyalty

of using fake identities to later get green cards and naturalize \( AP Photo Reed Saxon , File \) LOS ANGELES \( AP \) The U S government agency that oversees immigration applications is launching an office that will focus on identifying Americans who are suspected of cheating to get their citizenship and seek to strip them of it U S Citizenship and Immigration Services Director L Francis Cissna told The Associated Press in an interview that his agency is hiring several dozen lawyers and immigration officers to review cases of immigrants who were ordered deported and are suspected of using fake identities to later get green cards and citizenship through naturalization Cissna said the cases would be referred to the Department of Justice , whose attorneys could then seek to remove the immigrants' citizenship in civil court proceedings In some cases , government attorneys could bring criminal charges related to fraud Until now , the agency has pursued cases as they arose but not through a coordinated effort , Cissna said He said he hopes the agency 's new office in Los Angeles will be running by next year but added that investigating and referring cases for prosecution will likely take longer We finally have a process in place to get to the bottom of all these bad cases and start denaturalizing people who should not have been naturalized in the first place , Cissna said What we 're looking at , when you boil it all down , is potentially a few thousand cases He declined to say how much the effort would cost but said it would be covered by the agency 's existing budget , which is funded by immigration application fees The push comes as the Trump administration has been cracking down on illegal immigration and taking steps to reduce legal immigration to the U S Immigrants who become U S citizens can vote , serve on juries and obtain security clearance Denaturalization the process of removing that citizenship is very rare The U S government began looking at potentially fraudulent naturalization cases a decade ago when a border officer detected about 200 people had used different identities to get green cards and citizenship after they were previously issued deportation orders In September 2016 , an internal watchdog reported that 315 , 000 old fingerprint records for immigrants who had been deported or had criminal convictions had not been uploaded to a Department of Homeland Security database that is used to check immigrants' identities The same report found more than 800 immigrants had been ordered deported under one identity but became U S citizens under another Since then , the government has been uploading these older fingerprint records dating back to the 1990s and investigators have been evaluating cases for denaturalization Earlier this year , a judge revoked the citizenship of an Indian born New Jersey man named Baljinder Singh after federal authorities accused him of using an alias to avoid deportation Authorities said Singh used a different name when he arrived in the United States in 1991 He was ordered deported the next year and a month later applied for asylum using the name Baljinder Singh before marrying an American , getting a green card and naturalizing Authorities said Singh did not mention his earlier deportation order when he applied for citizenship For many years , most U S efforts to strip immigrants of their citizenship focused largely on suspected war criminals who lied on their immigration paperwork , most notably former Nazis Toward the end of the Obama administration , officials began reviewing cases stemming from the fingerprints probe but prioritized those of naturalized citizens who had obtained security clearances , for example , to work at the Transportation Security Administration , said Muzaffar Chishti , director of the Migration Policy Institute 's office at New York University law school The Trump administration has made these investigations a bigger priority , he said He said he expects cases will focus on deliberate fraud but some naturalized Americans may feel uneasy with the change It is clearly true that we have entered a new chapter when a much larger number of people could feel vulnerable that their naturalization could be reopened , Chishti said Since 1990 , the Department of Justice has filed 305 civil denaturalization cases , according to statistics obtained by an immigration attorney in Kansas who has defended immigrants in these cases The attorney , Matthew Hoppock , agrees that deportees who lied to get citizenship should face consequences but worries other immigrants who might have made mistakes on their paperwork could get targeted and might not have the money to fight back in court Cissna said there are valid reasons why immigrants might be listed under multiple names , noting many Latin American immigrants have more than one surname He said the U S government is not interested in that kind of minor discrepancy but wants to target people who deliberately changed their identities to dupe officials into granting immigration benefits The people who are going to be targeted by this they know full well who they are because they were ordered removed under a different identity and they intentionally lied about it when they applied for citizenship later on , Cissna said It may be some time before we get to their case , but we 'll get to them",true

"Gallagher Bettman has changed his tune on NHL expansionTony Gallagher \( The Province \) Updated August 28 , 2014 9 56 AMFiled Under EmailNHL commissioner Gary Bettman says the National Hockey League will listen to expressions of interest' in adding teams Photo by Mark HumphreyIt was n't very long ago that NHL commissioner Gary Bettman was treating talk of expansion as though he was being asked if he 'd like an epidemic of Ebola But recently the nature of the rhetoric has changed so much that the question is becoming not if , but when And then the ultimate question Will they be able to limit the number of new teams to just two \? Sources close to the situation have indicated Las Vegas is a done deal , the only thing to be determined being which owner will be entitled to proclaim that he brought the first major league sports franchise to Sin City And given how dead set against a team in the gambling haven the commissioner was 10 years ago , this move into another player friendly state tax free zone represents a considerable about face indeed But people have been betting on hockey games for years and to pretend games could n't be fixed just as easily anywhere as in Vegas is pretty ridiculous , so that posturing has fallen by the wayside A new team close to the newly renamed Arizona squad and California 's big three is all but assured , the only question being when and with which other city Or should that be plural \? With all the activity going on in the Seattle area in the last little bit it would be quite a stretch to imagine that much time and effort being spent by so many wealthy men being frittered away for nothing At the moment there are no surefire plans to build a new rink , but that could change at any time with Vancouver billionaire Victor Coleman among many reportedly showing interest in putting an NHL team into the city And Bettman has n't been visiting there to see if it really does rain a lot It 's been 15 years since the NHL expanded and given there are 16 teams in the east and just 14 in the west , taking in two more teams would certainly seem to make a lot of sense , the same amount of sense it made when realignment was first announced And expanding without the players getting their mitts on any of the money other than the increase in payrolls is surely tempting , at least to those owners who remember the hefty cheques they cashed for Columbus and Minnesota Whereas before the commissioner balked at expansion , this is a sample of his more recent verbal footwork There 's a lot of interest We 're hearing from multiple groups in Seattle and in Vegas and Kansas City and Quebec City , Bettman said to the Tribune while scoping out Target field in Minny for yet another trip to the well of outdoor games We have not decided to engage in a formal expansion process but we listen to expressions of interest It 's not something we 've seriously considered yet Like hell it is n't They 'd have to be nuts not to be thinking about it seriously And since then things have changed for a commissioner who hates to move teams in his league no matter how dire the circumstances might appear one of the most likable aspects of his regime for most hockey fans Once the league comes to your area , it is going to stay through thick , thin and the almost impossible , as seems to be the case in Phoenix But could that long standing policy and loyalty change with the Florida situation \? True there 's a lease until 2028 , but with the Panthers bleeding money , even the city of Sunrise ca n't seem to see the point of carrying on much longer , so perhaps one of these new cities could get an existing team after all And while Kansas City is n't really likely to be a serious contender in this expansion soup unless they 're going to stretch it to four teams , saying no to Quebec City in favour of two more U S cities with no proven NHL backgrounds is almost certainly not going to happen Going back to Minnesota has been a success , and there 's no question there 's more money and corporate backing than ever before in Quebec Even an expansion team there in a new arena would be virtually assured of sellouts into perpetuity There will be all manner of bleating about there being insufficient talent , of course , but even if it 's true , after such a long wait this trivial detail which only troubles the fans is n't going to get in the way of a financial windfall like this And any time the league decides it could use talent , they can start doing away with most of the coaches they employ whose chief calling in life is to devise ways to stop offensive players and choke the very life out of the game that 's paying their salaries Expansion will be happening , and soon The only question is how many new cities will be involved",false

Knowing Trump , probably not Trump apparently thinks he 's diversifying his cabinet It 's the diversity of ideas that 's important , not diversity in skin color Clarke , like his hero Trump , is also impulsive He , too , shoots from the hip spewing fact free rhetoric from questionable sources or making claims that have already been debunked His attacks on Black Lives Matter have been copious , vitriolic and unrelenting , but rarely based on facts Following the shooting of two police officers in Dallas and Baton Rouge , he claimed that America was at war and that BLM was the enemy However , the police chiefs in both cities had , after conducting a thorough investigation , publicly stated that neither perpetrator had been associated with Black Lives Matter What the shooters did have in common was that both were ex military , Afghan war veterans It 's much more like likely that both were suffering from untreated PTSD than anything else But , that does n't fit Sheriff Clarke 's hate filled rhetoric , so he ignored it Or , perhaps he never even considered PTSD as an option since he , like Trump , has never served in the military Which brings me to my final point Stolen Valor 2 Look at this fucking guy 's uniform You see all that shit pinned all over his dress uniform jacket \?

"b' Netanyahu We wont tolerate Hamas or ISIS flags at protests in Israel Profile of a freedom fighter The Canadian Israeli who joined the fight against ISIS WATCH How do American college students react to ISIS , Israeli flags \? Share on facebookShare on twitterGila Rosenberg \( photo credit FACEBOOK \) Uncertainty abounds concerning the fate of Israeli Canadian Gill Rosenberg , who was reportedly captured by Islamic State Islamist websites some of them known to be close to , or even serving as a front for , the terrorist organization reported Sunday that the 31 year old adventurer was captured during fierce battles with Kurdish fighters in unspecified areas Be the first to know Join our Facebook page According to the websites , Rosenberg was taken hostage following three suicide attacks on sites where Kurdish fighters had barricaded themselves The websites gave no further details regarding the circumstances of the capture , nor provided any proof of it The Islamic State claims do not make clear whether Rosenberg was captured in Iraq or in Syria The main battlefield between the Kurds and Islamic State is in the Syrian Turkish border town of Kobani Kurdish sources approached by Israel Radio reporter Eran Cicurel expressed doubt over the Islamic State report They said Rosenberg was not in Kobani In the assessment of these Kurdish sources , the reports of Rosenbergs capture are probably the terrorists propaganda The Shin Bet \( Israel Security Agency \) told The Jerusalem Post that there are no further details at this stage Rosenberg wrote on her Facebook page on November 20 that she was handing over management of her account to someone else and would be without Internet access for at least two weeks , until December 8 , she wrote It is not clear where she went at this time If the websites reports are true , Rosenberg would be the first confirmed Western female to fall into Islamic State captivity Holding Israeli citizenship would complicate her situation even further Unlike the US and the UK , which refused to negotiate over their respective captured nationals , thus giving the impression of a laissez faire interest , Israel invests intense concern into the fate of its citizens captured by terrorists This does not mean Israel will negotiate for Rosenberg , if she has indeed been captured or that Islamic State would agree to talk with Israel , making her nationality Canadian alone If Rosenberg is in captivity , she would be the second Israeli of dual nationality in this position Steven Sotloff , a freelance American journalist who also held Israeli citizenship and filed for The Jerusalem Report on the Syrian civil war , was captured by Islamic State last year shortly after crossing the Syrian border and beheaded by the Islamist group this past August As well , Rosenberg breached Israeli law by flying to Iraq , an enemy country , which Israeli citizens are forbidden to enter No matter what has happened to her since joining the Kurdish forces , upon return to Israel she will be arrested and prosecuted , as was the case of several Israeli Arabs who joined Islamic State and subsequently returned to Israel This is not Rosenbergs first tryst with adventurism in 2009 she was arrested in an American con scandal and sentenced to four years in jail This is , however , her first serious willful encounter with death Rosenberg was born in Vancouver , and experienced a family crisis after her parents divorced In an interview with Maariv in 2009 , she said that already at the age of 22 she was pursuing a promising career as a pilot of Boeing passenger planes , but decided to leave everything behind and immigrate in 2006 In Israel , she joined the IDF , serving as an instructor for Kenyan soldiers who came to Israel for home front search and rescue training Rosenberg said she had ambitions to join the Mossad , but was hurt during her military training and afterwards had money problems She met an American friend in an ulpan Hebrew language course who led her into crime , she said She joined a group of Israelis who were accused of setting up a ring to cheat elderly Americans and steal their money through a fake lottery scheme According to the indictments filed against them , they stole hundreds of thousands of dollars , perhaps even millions , from the unknowing pensioners After a number of complaints were filed , a joint Israel Police and FBI investigation was launched The probe led to the arrest of several suspects and their extradition to the US , where they were tried Rosenberg served four years in jail She may have decided to fulfill an act of redemption after getting out of jail and regaining her freedom Hopefully the Kurdish sources are right , and Rosenberg is indeed far from executioners Canada is trying to confirm reports that Rosenberg has been captured , a foreign ministry spokesman said Sunday Canada is pursuing all appropriate channels to seek further information and is in touch with local authorities , the spokesman said in a statement Yossi Melman is an Israeli journalist and writer who specializes in security and intelligence affairs He is co author of Spies Against Armageddon inside

"By Dwayne 'The Rock' Johnson Politics February 1 , 2017 Comments \( \) By Dwayne 'The Rock' Johnson Politics February 1 , 2017 Hi My name is Dwayne Johnson Many of you may know me better as The Rock I am running for the President of the United States I know that this may sound like a joke to many of you But it 's not I am throwing my hat in the ring for 2020 I am not running against Donald Trump I am not running against whatever candidate the Democrats field I am not running against anyone I am running for the country As an independent I am running on a simple platform of compassion and civility You may ask why someone who has never publicly expressed a political opinion is running for office , and I will tell you that is exactly why I am running for the Presidency I do not owe any obligation to either party , so I do not need to feel beholden to either of their platforms or their ideologies Mine , again , is a simple platform based on civility and compassion It is based on a desire to lift everyone up rich , poor , young , old , black , white , American born or foreign born , gay , straight or transgender to bring us together again , to make this country whole The fact that I have expressed so few political opinions I hope will help me in this effort because it is my hope not to advocate for the extreme positions of either party , but to find a middle ground between them both It used to be possible to find some common ground , for each side to listen to each other , negotiate , and find a place in the middle that leaves everyone happy enough I am running for the 70 percent of this country who wants to get along , who is willing to give a little to get a little Who is nostalgic for dinnertime conversations that revolve around workdays or school , dance recitals , little league games , movies , TV shows , worship services , and celebrity gossip , instead of eating dinner fraught with anxiety about what 's going on in the news I am someone who has worked successfully with people from both sides of the political spectrum and who , I believe , has gained the respect of people from all political stripes I 've been a popular college football player I 've been a popular professional wrestler , and I have been a popular actor , but I have also been careful never to let my ego get in the way I have had a lot of box office hits , and I have had a lot of box office bombs , but I have never been defined by ratings , by the number of people who go see my movies , or by the crowds that came out to see me during my football and wrestling careers I am the same , big hearted , caring person every day , whether Hercules makes 10 million at the box office , or whether Fast Furious 10 makes 100 million There is one position where I will not bend , however , and that 's where it concerns compassion for everyone , from immigrants to low income white people to the people of color in our cities , in our suburbs , and in rural America , to the people from abroad escaping poverty , famine , or brutal dictators We live in a huge country , and there is plenty of space for everyone , and plenty of money and resources to go around , even if that means taking a little more from the extremely well off to help out the extremely unfortunate As Commander in Chief , I will refashion foreign policy to align with my own personality I will use my strength and might of our military to serve the big heart of the American public It 's important that we stand up for the little guy , but that in doing so , never become bullies ourselves Bullying and bluster is the surest sign of insecurity and weakness , and it is not who we are It sure as hell is n't who I am We have to be better than that Some of you may be wondering why I 've announced my intention to run for the President of the United States only 12 days into the existing administration There 's two reasons , actually First of all , President Trump signed papers to begin his run for 2020 on Inauguration Day , so I am already 12 days behind ! More importantly , however , is my hope to use my popularity , my broad demographic appeal , and my name recognition to shift focus away from the ugly partisanship going on in D C right now and onto the themes on which I plan to run I intend to hit the campaign trail immediately , and it is my hope that whatever cultural capital I have accrued over the years fighting Hulk Hogan or Vin Diesel is enough to attract both crowds and the media It is also my hope that those crowds and the media might begin to absorb some of the lessons about compassion and civility that I plan to impart and apply them long before our next election rolls around I wo n't run a negative campaign , because I do n't need to I'm Dwayne Johnson I will never begin a sentence with , But my opponent I do n't need to tear anyone down in order to make myself look bigger God has also blessed me with a smile that has a calming effect on those around me , and I hope to put it good use over the next four years as I tour this country in an effort to bring us all back together I want to rebuild us around a very simple idea that that a difference of opinion does not have to separate us , that within most of us , there is goodness , that we can put that goodness to use , and that we are a better country when we are united than when we let our leaders divide us I'm not asking for your vote now I'm just asking you to listen Give me four years to let me convince you that I deserve your vote before you make a decision I 'll probably regret a few of the things I saw along the way , and in a campaign this long , there will probably be a backlash , and then a backlash to the backlash , but for the first three years , anyway , I'm not here to win your vote I'm here to offer you hope , to remind you that there 's an alternative to this current political climate waiting in the wings I hope that I can offer you all a light at the end of the tunnel I am Dwayne The Rock Johnson , and I hope to be your next President of the United States Thank you , God bless you , and God bless this country we love Get entertainment , celebrity and politics updates via Facebook or Twitter Buy Pajiba merch at the Pajiba Store Bigots , Trolls MRAs Are Not Welcome in the CommentsThe Pajiba Store",false

But instead of force feeding a duck and then eating it 's liver , this was the liver of a human who had force fed themselves on junk food A fatty liver fit for the kings of Hollywood Describing herself as not terribly fond of organ meats , Perry passed on the liver dish , but did enjoy sampling human flesh during the multiple course Bacchanalian feast It tastes like pork , the singer explained of human meat But a little bit bitter , stronger Katy Perry promoting Illuminati symbolism Katy Perry 's cannibalistic confession is merely the latest in a long line of public dalliances the singer has shared with the dark side After starting her career as a Christian country singer , the she reinvented her image as a raunchy pop star , flashing Satanic hand gestures and promoting Illuminati symbolism as she rode to the top of the charts Since establishing herself in the global consciousness as a Devil worshipping entertainer , Katy Perry has attempted to sugar coat her image , however the disturbing conversation she held with the French radio host suggests she is far from a reformed character , and she has openly embraced the darkest forces in our society The incident has also sparked fears around the world that the Illuminati have moved onto the next phase of the masterplan , and have begun openly promoting dark spirituality as a viable religious choice for those seeking guidance",false
"Flashback Obama HHS Placed Migrant Children Into Custody Of Human Traffickers 1 01 AM 06 18 2018 Kerry Picket Reporter The Obama administration handed off an unknown number of migrant minors into the custody of human traffickers under the assumption that these so called caregivers were related to the children In the wake of the current debate over how to handle illegal aliens who claim asylum while crossing the border with children in tow , supporters of tighter border controls point to issues related to not knowing whether the children are indeed sons and daughters of the border crossers Previous reports say the federal government already had a poor record of placing these children in dangerous environments during the Obama administration The Associated Press reported two years ago that in April 2014 the U S Department of Health and Human Services relaxed its safety standards to promptly move migrant children out of government shelters and into sponsors' homes when waves of illegal aliens surged across the southern border However , according to the AP 's reporting , the lowered standards resulted in children landing in unsafe homes where they were sexually assaulted , starved or forced to work for little or no pay The AP found almost 30 children who were placed with caregivers who exposed them to sexual abuse , labor trafficking , abuse or neglect HHS lowered standards by ceasing required fingerprinting of much of the adults claiming children as theirs In April 2014 , HHS ceased asking for original copies of birth certificates from most sponsors to prove who they were In May 2014 , the AP noted , HHS stopped filling out forms that asked for sponsors' identifying information prior to placing any of the children in the sponsors' residence Finally , the agency ended FBI background checks of the caregivers they were sending the migrant children to HHS estimated that around 90 , 000 migrant children were placed into sponsor care between 2013 and 2015 , but the agency did not know how many of those children were trafficked because the department failed to keep track of them after their placement Following the AP 's piece on the matter , the Senate Committee on Homeland Security and Government Affairs released a 56 page report on Protecting Unaccompanied Alien Children from Trafficking and Other Abuses The report urged HHS to roll back the loosening of safety standards by the agency and bring back fingerprinting and background checks of potential sponsors , among other things Presently , there is an impasse as to where the unaccompanied children should go when illegal aliens who cross the border with them claim they are their parents For those seeking asylum at ports of entry , we have continued the policy from previous Administrations and will only separate if the child is in danger , there is no custodial relationship between family' members , or if the adult has broken a law Sec Kirstjen Nielsen \( SecNielsen \) June 17 , 2018 Democrats have accused the Trump administration of breaking up migrant families who reach the southern border but the White House says it is simply enforcing federal law that existed long before President Trump came to office The separation of illegal alien families is the product of the same legal loopholes that Democrats refuse to close And these laws are the same that have been on the books for over a decade The president is simply enforcing them , White House Press Secretary Sarah Huckabee Sanders told reporters last Thursday Between April 19 and May 31 , there were 1 , 995 children separated from 1 , 940 adults by U S Border Patrol , a spokesperson for the Department of Homeland Security \( DHS \) confirmed Saturday The numbers represent families who were separated because of illegal entry , immigration violations , possible criminal conduct by the parent , and cases where officials could not verify the family relationship , the DHS spokesperson said",true

"Yet it remains all too possible that health care reform will fail , as it has so many times before I'm not that worried about the issue of costs Yes , the Congressional Budget Office 's preliminary cost estimates for Senate plans were higher than expected , and caused considerable consternation last week But the fundamental fact is that we can afford universal health insurance even those high estimates were less than the 1 8 trillion cost of the Bush tax cuts Furthermore , Democratic leaders know that they have to pass a health care bill for the sake of their own survival One way or another , the numbers will be brought in line The real risk is that health care reform will be undermined by centrist Democratic senators who either prevent the passage of a bill or insist on watering down key elements of reform I use scare quotes around centrist , by the way , because if the center means the position held by most Americans , the self proclaimed centrists are in fact way out in right field What the balking Democrats seem most determined to do is to kill the public option , either by eliminating it or by carrying out a bait and switch , replacing a true public option with something meaningless For the record , neither regional health cooperatives nor state level public plans , both of which have been proposed as alternatives , would have the financial stability and bargaining power needed to bring down health care costs Whatever may be motivating these Democrats , they do n't seem able to explain their reasons in public Please verify you 're not a robot by clicking the box Invalid email address Please re enter You must select a newsletter to subscribe to You agree to receive occasional updates and special offers for The New York Times 's products and services Thank you for subscribing An error has occurred Please try again later You are already subscribed to this email Thus Senator Ben Nelson of Nebraska initially declared that the public option which , remember , has overwhelming popular support was a deal breaker Why \?

Mr Nelson softened his stand after reform advocates began a public campaign targeting him for his position on the public option And Senator Kent Conrad of North Dakota offers a perfectly circular argument we ca n't have the public option , because if we do , health care reform wo n't get the votes of senators like him Honestly , I do n't know what these Democrats are trying to achieve Yes , some of the balking senators receive large campaign contributions from the medical industrial complex but who in politics does n't \?

"SaveIn the weeks since the tragic passing of visionary musician Prince , many speculate his death may have been linked to drug abuse We now know his death resulted from an overdose of the opiate medication Fentanyl Prince 's hits were all over the radio when I was in my 20s and 30s He was a truly gifted artist , and he will be missed by many fans Out of his death , his fans and everyone noting his passing should take away two very important lessons First , we as a society must work harder to reduce the stigma that surrounds substance addiction As people speculated about the cause of Prince 's death , what judgments were they forming , perhaps even just subconsciously \? Did they think he must be weak or of low moral character \? Too often , society attaches labels such as those to people who are suffering from addiction The truth is that addiction is a disease We would not view people with leukemia or diabetes as deserving to suffer or die because they have the misfortune of being struck with a disease What do we think , though , when we hear a news story about a person who died from a drug overdose \? About 10 percent of Americans suffer from substance addiction Addiction knows no socio economic , gender , geographic or racial boundaries For many people struggling with addiction and their families , it is kept secret because they fear the judgments they will face from others As a result , they do n't seek help when they should Prince seemed to have some quirks that go with being a celebrity , but I have never seen anything that suggests he was weak or a person of bad character It is time to start looking at others who struggle with addiction compassionately and supportively The odds are high that someone you care about suffers from this disease , and perhaps that person has n't sought help and is afraid of what you will think It is time to change that Second , I hope the passing of this music legend teaches us that no one is immune to the dangers that come with the abuse of prescription painkillers They are highly addictive and can be deadly when abused As a multi millionaire , Prince had resources far beyond anything available to most of us He could have afforded the best treatment available Still , it took his life This is probably not the first time opiates caused Prince serious health dangers He had cancelled a concert due to a health concern prior to his fatal overdose I do n't know whether that was opiate related , but Fentanyl is an extraordinarily strong opiate It is many times more powerful than heroin that can be purchased on the street Data shows most people do not start off abusing the strongest painkiller More likely , Prince progressed to abusing such a strong drug after his body built up a higher tolerance for less potent prescription medications Here is a frightening fact 80 percent of those who abuse heroin started by abusing prescription pain pills such as Oxycontin , Percoset or Vicodin Once their tolerance builds , they seek ever higher doses or more powerful opiates They become helplessly trapped Opiates took Prince 's life despite his virtually unlimited resources and network of supporters If it can happen to him , it can happen to any of us Once addicted , the power of these drugs can be stronger than even the fear of death And far too often , addiction comes quickly As a society , we need to make treatment more readily available to those who are addicted We absolutely need to lock up those who prey on our society by trafficking deadly drugs , especially to young people , but we will not incarcerate our way out of this public health crisis Ultimately , our best chance to stem the nationwide opiate and heroin crisis is prevention We must alter our view of opiates More people now die in Wisconsin from drug overdoses than car crashes Prescription opiates , not heroin , are the top killer in our state In fact , more die from prescription painkillers than from heroin and cocaine combined Opiates are appropriately prescribed in some circumstances , but they must only be used in exactly the way they are prescribed by a doctor About 70 percent of the time , when a person begins abusing opiates , they do not get them from a doctor They acquire them improperly from a family member or a friend So we all have a role in solving this epidemic by securely storing painkillers in our homes and by properly disposing them I was sad to learn about Prince 's death I am even more saddened , though , about the 850 or so of my fellow citizens in our state who die from drug overdoses every year Let 's not let any of them die in vain Let 's do something to put an end to this tragic public health crisis Please go to doseofrealitywi gov to learn more about how we can make our state safer and healthier",true

Hannity asked Perry replied that he 'd had a conversation with Reagan 's son Michael , a political consultant and former radio host I told Michael Reagan the other day You know , I love your dad , and he was part of the reason I became a Republican , ' but I said , I became a Republican sooner in my life than your dad did ' Perry and Hannity shared a laugh over that But that light moment left unresolved how old each leader was when he made his D to R leap Did Perry beat Reagan to the flip point \?

"Ned StaffordTransformed child psychiatry by advocating research into developmental problemsEarly in his medical career , in the mid 1950s , Leon Eisenberg became fascinated with the childhood mind Wanting to know more , he broke free from the shackles of the Freudian psychoanalytic dogma that dominated child psychiatry at the time to conduct groundbreaking biologically based research of childhood developmental problems This research included the first randomised clinical drug trials in child psychiatry I think what Leon brought to the field was a different way of thinking thinking out of the box , said David DeMaso , chairman of psychiatry at Boston Children 's Hospital and professor of psychiatry and pediatrics at Harvard Medical School He was thinking in terms of biology , of evidence based treatment , way before anybody else His was a bio psycho social model at a time when psychoanalytical thinking was the norm Eisenberg 's direct involvement as a child psychiatry researcher was over by 1967 , when he moved to Harvard Medical School as chief of psychiatry at Massachusetts General Hospital But in a dozen years he had helped transform the discipline Beginning in 1952 at Johns Hopkins University in Baltimore , Eisenberg began a fellowship under Leo Kanner , the Austrian born child psychiatrist , who , in the early 1940s , first described autism In a study of autistic adolescents published in 1956 , Eisenberg recognised patterns of language use as the best predictor of prognosis At the time , many patients who are now are diagnosed as having autism were thought to have mental retardation He followed that paper with a barrage of papers on attention deficit disorder , learning delays , and other childhood problems In a study of children otherwise developing normally , Eisenberg found that early reading difficulties increased the chances of later bad behaviour His most revolutionary study came in 1962 , when he launched the first randomised clinical drug trial in child psychiatry In subsequent drug trials he showed that tranquillising drugs were inferior to placebo in the treatment of anxiety disorders and that stimulant drugs could be effective in controlling hyperactivity Those studies were the first steps towards ever increasing use of drugs to treat child and adolescent disorders , a development that in recent years concerned Eisenberg Drug companiesDeMaso , who in the late 1970s became one of Eisenberg 's many prot g s , said that Eisenberg thought that many psychiatrists were being influenced by drug companies , adding , He thought children are now being overdiagnosed with bipolar illness and then overmedicated Leon Eisenberg was born in Philadelphia on 8 August 1922 , the oldest child of Russian immigrants His father steered him from the beginning towards medical school But despite near straight As in college , he was turned down by several medical schools because of his Jewish background Finally , with help from a Pennsylvania state legislator who his father knew , he was admitted to the University of Pennsylvania School of Medicine After graduating in 1946 as valedictorian of his class , he took a rotating intern position at Mount Sinai Hospital in New York city , where he became interested in psychiatry He served two years as a captain in the US Army Medical Corps and in 1952 moved to Johns Hopkins , becoming chief of child psychiatry in 1961 He held the position until becoming chief of psychiatry in 1967 at Harvard , where his focus shifted to training new generations of researchers Although Eisenberg has been widely recognised for his childhood research , the Harvard psychiatrist and anthropologist Arthur Kleinman thinks that his contributions from the 1970s onward are as important Kleinman , a psychiatry resident in the 1970s under Eisenberg , said that he converted the department from a small group of mostly psychoanalysts to a diverse and vibrant national powerhouse that helped shape modern psychiatry He made that department , Kleinman says He set the intellectual tone to be highly academic In 1968 Eisenberg also became a leading proponent of affirmative action for African Americans and other minorities at Harvard Medical School , guided by his own experiences of discrimination as a Jew in the 1940s Social sciencesDuring the 1970s , Eisenberg advocated a closer relationship between medicine and the social sciences , which he thought would improve medical care by , as Kleinman put it , bringing biology together with the social world In 1980 Eisenberg became founding chairman of Harvard 's department of social medicine , a position he held until 1991 Eisenberg was the ideal choice to guide the new department , said Kleinman , adding , He had an omnivorous hunger for knowledge that went across the fields Eisenberg was honoured with numerous awards , including the distinguished service award and special presidential commendation from the American Psychiatric Association He served from 1964 as mental health consultant to the World Health Organization in multiple capacities and was an honorary fellow of the UK Royal College of Psychiatrists On 1 July this year , the Leon Eisenberg chair in child psychiatry at the Children 's Hospital Boston was officially launched , with DeMaso named as the first holder Decades after his groundbreaking studies , he still yearned to better understand the childhood mind I was eating lunch with him about a year ago , and he told me that more child psychiatry research was needed , said DeMaso He asked me , What are you doing about encouraging your psychiatrists to do more research \? They need to do more research We need more research ' And DeMaso dutifully followed the advice of his mentor We are going to do more research in child psychiatry , he says We are planning to focus on training the next generation of child psychiatry researchers Eisenberg leaves his wife , Carola , former dean of students at Harvard Medical School and a cofounder of Physicians for Human Rights , two children from a previous marriage , and two stepsons NotesCite this as BMJ 2009 339 b4615Footnotes",true

"Facebook Employee Admits To Bernie Sanders Blackout Posted By admin March 30 , 2016This is really scary , I'm a member in a lot of different groups from cars and trucks to Bernie Sanders even Hillary or Trump groups on Facebook I use them all to promote Bernie , trying to change 1 mind a day Today I was talking to a Hillary supporter within a group called Hillary VS Bernie It was a very good conversation that lasted over 2 hours with a total of 86 comments The Hillary supporters main subject was about how Hillary Tells The Truth I was trying to explain to her how Hillary lies over and over She then turned the subject into saying So does everyone even Bernie After about an hour of asking her to show any REAL proof of Bernie lying she gave up and said Look it up your self and I do n't have time for you \( These statements come after 2 hours of conversation \) My last comment was going to be , Clearly you ca n't post any proof nor can I because he never lies But when I hit enter I got this popup I though it was just a glitch , so I refreshed the page but same thing happened \? \? \? I clicked the link and was sent to a Facebook appeal form I filled it out saying I have done nothing wrong A few hours went by and I got an email titled Your Facebook appeal PLEASE READ It was not from abuse facebook com or any of the Facebook email addresses so I first thought spam , then I was like how can anyone know I'm blocked from posting anything on Facebook besides me \? The email was a guy saying he works for Facebook and to contact him via Skype This was extremely weird , but I was curious to see where this was going I added him on Skype He accepted me right away and said I'm going to tell you something you may or may not believe All I ask is you do not share my email or Skype I replied back Ok but why not just contact me via a fake email and Skype then \? He said They are fake but I still feel I could be traced I said Fair enough , but what is this all about \? He said I work for Facebook , and I'm reaching out to people who have been blocked on Facebook after posting keywords like FeelTheBern At this point I'm kinda freaking out How does anyone know I have been blocked from posting \? They also have my personal email and know about me posting FeelTheBern He then began to explain to me Facebook is actively and automatically blocking millions of accounts with a algorithm that detects people who post keywords like FeelTheBurn I for example was banned from posting anything for 30 days due to the fact I posted FeelTheBernHe also said Quote In a staff briefing everyone was told to deny any appeal that happened due to posting political opinions \( As he laughed and said these members are banned due to spamming give them time to calm down \) I asked him why not go public with a widely viewed TV network or huge websites like HuffingtonPost \? He said I have emailed a few local news TV stations plus all the big well known websites and 100 's of Facebook users , yet I have n't seen this story get viral I told him most likely the reason huge websites or news stations wo n't talk about it is because they are scared to post something without having a face to back it up with But I understand why he is scared to come out He can be sued for breach of contractHe will lose his good paying jobHe would never be hired after leaking company information I promised I would do my best to get this information out to the world This is insane ! I knew the corrupt corporations ran the media but I never thought it would get down to blocking people from Facebook What can you do \? Share this post on Twitter , Facebook , YouTube , etc Contact HuffingtonPost asking them to reply to the emails sent Contact Woodland Hills , CA News station ABC7 to reply to the emails sent We can not let this subject get swept under the rug This is a 1000 times worse then corrupt corporations running Fox News This is like YouTube or Google removing any blog or video that says anything good about Bernie",false

"1 33KUT 's Syeda Hasan reports What I find is that leaders of the other party are against efforts to crack down on voter fraud , Abbott said The fact is that voter fraud is rampant In Texas , unlike some other states and unlike some other leaders , we are committed to cracking down on voter fraud In an interview with the Texas Tribune CEO and Editor in Chief Evan Smith on Friday , Obama said that leaders in Texas are partly to blame for low voter turnout in the state The folks who are governing the good state of Texas are n't interested in having more people participate , Obama said Obama has been previously critical of Voter ID laws like the one Texas passed in 2011 A federal judge ruled last year that the Texas law had a discriminatory effect by restricting access to the polls for black and Hispanic Texans Last week the full U S 5th Circuit Court of Appeals announced that it would hear arguments over whether the law violates the Voting Rights Act The law requires most citizens to show one of a handful of forms of allowable photo identification before their election ballots can be counted One specific policy that Obama suggested the state should adopt to increase turnout would be online voter registration But Abbott appeared uninterested in the proposal when asked about it at a press conference following the announcement that California based Pegasus Foods is building a new , 80 , 000 square foot manufacturing facility in Rockwall , Texas We do n't want to open the system up to methodologies or ways of voting that would promote or allow voter fraud , Abbott said To the contrary to the president 's comment , the fact is despite our voter registration laws we had the highest level of turnout than ever before in the primary that occurred just a few weeks before he made that comment While Texas did witness historic voter turnout in the 2016 primaries , the state still had one of the lowest voting age participation rates of the states that have held primaries so far at 21 5 percent , besting only Louisiana as of last week But Abbott did not attribute those figures to the state 's election laws , instead pointing to the lack of faith in government among voters Voters and citizens repeatedly say , Why go vote if we 're going to have corrupt leaders in office \? ' Abbott said So we need to root out and eliminate corrupt leaders and root out and eliminate corruption in the voting process , and that means greater ballot security , not less ballot security Abbott noted that he personally prosecuted voter fraud cases across the entire state of Texas while he was the state 's attorney general from 2002 to 2015 As U S Sen Cory Booker , D New Jersey , pointed out last year in light of the 50th anniversary of the Voting Rights Act , Voter fraud remains by many accounts a rare phenomenon in Texas You 're more likely to get struck by lightning in Texas than to find any kind of voter fraud , U S Sen Cory Booker , D New Jersey , said last year , an assertion that PolitiFact found to be true As of last year , there had been a total of 85 election fraud prosecutions resolved in Texas , including 51 guilty or no contest pleas and 9 convictions , according to PolitiFact Lorraine Minnite , a Rutgers professor and author of the book The Myth of Voter Fraud , determined that four cases in Texas from 2000 to 2014 involved in person voter fraud Tags",true

"I spent 18 months putting together the sanctions against Iran so that we could force them to the negotiating table Hillary Clinton on Friday , November 6th , 2015 in a Democratic primary forumHillary Clinton says she helped usher Iran to the negotiating tableBy Lauren Carroll on Monday , November 23rd , 2015 at 11 26 a m Former Secretary of State Hillary Clinton takes questions after delivering a speech on her approach to defeating the Islamic State terrorist network at the Council on Foreign Relations Nov 19 , 2015 in New York City \( Photo by Spencer Platt Getty Images \) If it were n't for Democratic presidential candidate Hillary Clinton , there likely would n't yet be an Iran nuclear deal , according to the former Secretary of State While her Republican rivals who oppose the Iran deal might use that line against her , Clinton has touted progress with Iran as one of the hallmarks of her tenure at the State Department I spent 18 months putting together the sanctions against Iran so that we could force them to the negotiating table , she said at the MSNBC Democratic forum Nov 6 She 's said this line a few times throughout her campaign , so we decided to dig into it According to her campaign , Clinton was referring to her first 18 months as secretary from January 2009 to June 2010 During this time , U S and global sanctions on Iran increased , it 's fair to say that Clinton and the State Department played a major role in this development The invitationUpping sanctions on Iran was a clear priority for Clinton 's State Department She talked at length about the importance of pressuring Iran to discontinue nuclear activity , including through sanctions , at her nomination hearing in January 2009 She and other members of President Barack Obama 's administration regularly spoke publicly about the topic throughout her first 18 months in office During this time period , the State Department top aides and Clinton herself led the diplomatic lobbying effort to get other countries to join the U S plan to pressure Iran , overcoming large hurdles such as getting Russia and China to get on board In her memoir Hard Choices , Clinton recalls hashing out final details of a plan over drinks with a Chinese official In June 2010 , the United Nations Security Council approved tough new sanctions on Iran including expanding an arms embargo and restricting certain financial and shipping enterprises At the time , Obama called them the toughest sanctions ever faced by the Iranian government Those sanctions enabled even tougher measures from the United States and the European Union , which were passed immediately Congress passed several more bills containing additional sanctions on Iran during the rest of Clinton 's tenure , which ended in early 2013 While the Treasury is the primary agency responsible for enforcing sanctions , Clinton appointed a special adviser in 2010 to oversee U S efforts to ensure full and effective implementation of all U N Security Council resolutions related to Iran , including most recently UNSCR 1929 Experts told us that Clinton is correct to take some of the credit for the rapid increase in international sanctions on Iran , and these sanctions were a big part of the reason why Iran rejoined multilateral talks about its nuclear program The RSVPThe State Department was key to getting other countries to go along with and add to U S efforts to pressure Iran , said Patrick Clawson , senior fellow and research director at the Washington Institute for Near East Policy He added that her claim does n't give enough credit to other players but is essentially correct Clawson specifically noted that he is not a fan nor a political supporter of Clinton The international sanction ramp up shocked Iran 's leaders , Clawson said Besides the pain the sanctions inflicted , they raised the possibility more worse was coming That was a key factor pushing Iran to resume more serious talks There is room for subjective interpretation on who deserves the credit for effective sanctions because many corners of the U S government are involved in the Iran effort , said Suzanne Maloney , deputy director of the foreign policy program at the Brookings Institution But the State Department had its hands in every aspect of new sanction making and implementation , she said And in the absence of the United Nations resolution Clinton 's lobbying success it would have been challenging to get a global coalition to significantly ramp up the sanctions , she said But whether sanctions were a big factor in bringing Iran to the negotiating table is not crystal clear , Maloney said Iranian officials have historically denied the significance of sanctions , but Ayatollah Ali Khamenei has said recently that Iran negotiated the deal specifically to have sanctions lifted Beyond the multilateral effort , Clinton 's team also played a role in the sanctions that Congress passed , said Richard Nephew , an expert on sanctions with the Center on Global Energy Policy at Columbia University Lawmakers would not have written that legislation without consulting the State Department and the administration \( as evidenced in this 2010 New York Times article \) Nephew noted , though , that Congress did pass some sanctions that went further than the administration 's wishes Without Secretary Clinton 's good diplomacy and the message that she radiated down the system to make this a priority and so forth you can argue that the reductions would not have been as steep or as lasting , Nephew said Congress' sanctions that affect Iran 's oil exports resulted in a 50 percent reduction in oil exports and were instrumental in getting Iran to the negotiating table , said Nephew , who worked at the State Department under Clinton Our rulingClinton said , I spent 18 months putting together the sanctions against Iran so that we could force them to the negotiating table Clinton 's claim is for the most part accurate , though a little exaggerated During her first 18 months as secretary , the State Department was at the helm of a global effort to increase sanctions on Iran , culminating in an important U N resolution Clinton was personally involved in these diplomatic efforts and pushed them publicly And experts said these sanctions , on top of other sanctions passed before and after , were crucial to getting Iran to the negotiating table However , Clinton was n't singularly responsible for the sanctions , just as the sanctions passed under her watch likely were n't singularly responsible for opening up Iran to talks

It just makes good business sense Companies like Ben Jerry 's recognize that hiring formerly incarcerated individuals and working with suppliers that do the same is important for our business , our culture , and our bottom line Studies have shown that those with a criminal conviction can often make the best employees they are retained at higher rates than those with no criminal record , saving companies costs associated with hiring and training , which can be as much as 4 , 000 per employee Additionally , companies that hire people with criminal convictions are eligible for the Work Opportunity Tax Credit \( WOTC \) , which provides a maximum tax credit of 2 , 400 per employee Formerly incarcerated individuals are often the most motivated at work A study of army enlistees found that enlistees with felony records were 33 percent more likely to be promoted to sergeant than those with no conviction history , a testament to their dedication and motivation Ben Jerry 's is incredibly proud of our long relationship with the Greyston Bakery in Yonkers It was Ben who heard about the bakery and came up with one of our most successful flavors , Chocolate Fudge Brownie , specifically to allow our company to work with and expand the impact of the baker which , through its open hiring process , has helped thousands of returning citizens and their families rebuild their lives and their dignity It is in part because of our long relationship with the Greyston Bakery that we 've made changes to our hiring and recruiting process so that people are judged by their skill and qualifications , not the mistakes of the past There is no doubt , with 1 in 3 Americans having been convicted of a crime , if we were to use criminal conviction as screen for recruiting , we would be leaving very qualified candidates out of our process That 's just a bad business decision Across New York , the Cuomo administration has long been dedicated to providing employment for those with criminal convictions In 2012 , we launched the Work for Success Program , which matches qualified and appropriately trained job applicants with criminal convictions to open job listings In the last five years , we have placed more than 18 , 000 people in jobs , and each new company that signs on to our Work for Success Pledge also commits to listing job openings with the program In 2015 , the Council on Community Reentry and Reintegration took further steps to ensure equity in hiring by setting uniform guidelines that evaluate qualified applicants for state occupational licenses and adopting fair chance hiring for New York State agencies , meaning agencies will not ask about a job applicant 's criminal convictions until and unless the agency has interviewed the candidate and is interested in hiring him or her As a result of Reentry Council efforts in 2016 , New York is also the first in the nation to prohibit insurance companies from denying insurance coverage to businesses that hire people with criminal convictions These are small steps that can make a huge difference Together , by signing the Work for Success Pledge , businesses have a real opportunity to not only provide a helping hand to those who have been cut off from opportunities , but to also improve our bottom line New York State is dedicated to creating a true state of opportunity for everyone FollowFollowingUnfollowAndrew Cuomo",true

air , likely moving to control points We have no reports of any engagements Domestic assets are moving into defensive positions POSSIBLY RELATED MATERIAL \( UPDATES CONTINUE BELOW FOLLOWING THIS RELATED MATERIAL \) American and Russian fighter jets had a tense showdown in the skies above Syria as the Russians dropped bombs on U S backed rebels U S and Russian fighter jets bloodlessly tangled in the air over Syria on June 16 as the American pilots tried and failed to stop the Russians from bombing U S backed rebels in southern Syria near the border with Jordan The aerial close encounter underscores just how chaotic Syria 's skies have become as Russia and the U S led coalition work at cross purposes , each dropping bombs in support of separate factions in the five year old civil war The near clash also highlights the escalating risk of American and Russian forces actually coming to blows over Syria , potentially sparking a much wider conflict between the world 's leading nuclear powers The incident began when at least two twin engine Su 34 bombers , some of Moscow 's most advanced warplanes , struck what the Pentagon described as a border garrison housing around 200 U S supported rebels in At Tanf on the Syrian side of the Syria Jordan border The rebels had been conducting counter ISIL operations in the area , the Pentagon stated on June 18 , using an alternative acronym for ISIS The United States and its allies in Syria clearly did not expect the air strike The rebels in At Tanf are party to a shaky ceasefire agreement between rebel forces and the regime of Syrian president Bashar Al Assad and , by extension , the Russian military contingent backing Al Assad The Los Angeles Times reported that Russian planes had not previously been active over At Tanf The Su 34s' initial strike wounded , and perhaps killed , some of the rebels in At Tanf The U S Navy scrambled F A 18 fighters to intercept the Russians , the Los Angeles Times reported The Navy has deployed two aircraft carriers to the region for strikes on ISIS As the F A 18s approached the Su 34s , officials with U S Central Command which oversees America 's wars in the Middle East and Afghanistan used a special hotline to contact their Russian counterparts directing Russia 's own intervention in Syria Arriving over At Tanf , the American pilots apparently spoke directly to the Russian aviators Pilots CAN communicate with one another on a communications channel set up to avoid air accidents , Central Command confirmed in a statement to The Daily Beast Washington and Moscow had established the hotline as part of a so called Safety of Flight Memorandum of Understanding that the two governments signed in October specifically in order to avoid the kind of aerial confrontation that occurred over Syria last week With the American jets flying close enough to visually identify the Su 34s , the Russians departed the air space over At Tanf Some time shortly thereafter , the F A 18s ran low on fuel and left the area in order to link up with an aerial tanker That 's when the Su 34s reportedly returned to At Tanf and bombed the rebels again According to the Los Angeles Times , the second strike killed first responders assisting survivors of the first bombing run The next day , senior U S Defense Department officials organized an extraordinary video conference with Russian counterparts to discuss the incident The meeting included Acting Assistant Secretary for International Security Affairs Elissa Slotkin and U S Marine Corps Lt Gen Kenneth McKenzie , a strategic planner on the Pentagon 's joint staff , plus unspecified Russian Ministry of Defense officials Department officials expressed strong concerns about the attack on the coalition supported counter ISIL forces at the At Tanf garrison , which included forces that are participants in the cessation of hostilities in Syria , and emphasized that those concerns would be addressed through ongoing diplomatic discussions on the cessation of hostilities , Defense Department spokesman Peter Cook explained in a statement Regarding safety , department officials conveyed that Russia 's continued strikes at At Tanf , even after U S attempts to inform Russian forces through proper channels of on going coalition air support to the counter ISIL forces , created safety concerns for U S and coalition forces , Cook continued Department officials requested Russian responses to address those concerns Russian Defense Ministry spokesman Igor Konashenkov confirmed , via the country 's state owned media , that the teleconference took place but he did not specify the results of the extraordinary meeting Russian warplanes had previously shadowed planes belonging to the U S led coalition over Syria , but the coalition always described the Russians' behavior as professional By contrast , in April Russian Su 24 bombers repeatedly buzzed the U S Navy warship USS Donald Cook while the vessel sailed in international waters in the Black Sea A Pentagon spokesman called the Russians' actions in that incident provocative and unprofessional The Kremlin should be keenly aware of the potential for unwanted and potentially destabilizing bloodshed that exists in the air over Syria In November , a Russian Su 24 bomber flying a mission over Syria strayed over the Syria Turkey border into Turkey and a Turkish F 16 fighter promptly shot it down The two Russian crew members ejected One flier died when Syrian rebels on the ground opened fire on his parachute Russian , Syrian and Iranian forces launched a complex rescue mission that ultimately retrieved the surviving pilot One Russian marine died and a helicopter was destroyed during that operation The fallout from the November incident continues , with Russia and Turkey exchanging threats and Moscow imposing economic sanctions on Ankarra including limits on some food imports to Russia from Turkey It 's not clear how close the U S fighters came to attacking and potentially shooting down the Su 34s over At Tanf Central Command declined to say what the rules of engagement are for American pilots flying over Syria ROE are actually specifics that we do n't get into , Central Command said in a statement The last time a U S military warplane shot down a Russian actually , Soviet plane was in 1953 , over Korea or China , depending on which historians you believe The last time a Russian or Soviet warplane shot down an American aircraft was in 1970 , when a U S Army plane strayed over Armenia RESUMING UPDATES At 4 32 AM EDT A huge explosion has struck an ammunition depot at a military firing range in southern Russia The Defense Ministry said around 600 people have been evacuated The incident took place at Ashuluk testing range near the city of Astrakhan in southern Russia As of 6 23 EDT this morning Currently NATO has an abnormal ammount of fighters and c 130s up over europe x10 F 16",false

"SAND HILL , Fort Benning , Ga Many soldiers and family members are angry over reports of controversial remarks from the Commanding Officer of Fort Benning at a recruit graduation Speaking to an assembled crowd of new soldiers and their families at basic training graduation , Maj Gen Robert Brown was reported as extremely hostile His speech began with the standard fluff about duty , country , and the privileges of serving when such a small percentage of the country chooses a career in the Armed Forces The speech took a turn , however , when the General reached a point in his remarks , obviously reused from previous ceremonies Look to your left and right towards your brothers in arms , said Brown You 're all now members of a proud warrior class , and heroes like your fathers before you who The General stopped , took a deep breath and crumpled the sheet before flinging it to the ground Fuck it ! I ca n't read shit like this anymore Listen up you little bald bastards The newly minted soldiers trying to stay awake throughout the ceremony shifted uncomfortably in their seats at the sudden change in tone Some of you fucks wo n't make it past AIT Advanced Individual Training You 'll wash out with the rest of the weakness that never should have been here in the first place Most of you who do graduate will immediately go to combat units and deploy overseas Many of you will threaten to kill yourselves to get out of real work , although you wont have the balls to actually do it ! Brown 's tone got softer as he attempted to clarify Do n't get me wrong here Many of you will actually go fight and engage the enemy in close combat For that I salute you It takes a hard motherfucker to go kill people you 've never met just because we say so The General then resumes his motivational speech to what he referred to as the rest of you shit stains You 'll most likely spend your deployment sitting on a FOB , manning guard towers , or waiting to go on patrols that get cancelled I have a reality check for you all Not everyone in this room is a hero I do n't give a shit what the beer commercials say You drag your buddy out of a grape hut after you 've stabbed two Taliban in the eyes with a broken MRE spoon then you 're a motherfucking American Hero You clear a trench with nothing but a sack of hand grenades and your giant brass balls , then you 're a motherfucking hero ! But walking through the desert for three months without hearing a shot fired in anger and posting pictures in your combat gear does n't make you a goddamned hero ! I do n't care what your family says They 're not heroes Neither are your fucking wives Hardest job in the Army , my ass ! Damn it , I'm too old for this shit Fuck you all Gen Brown then threw up his middle finger to the crowd and stormed off the stage , hustling into his waiting staff car The silence after his speech was soon broken by wild applause from the assembled Drill Sergeants and Officers responsible for training the young soldiers over the previous ten weeks Less enthusiasm was displayed by the families and the new graduates , who stormed the stage and attempted to destroy the auditorium to express their displeasure The ensuing riot caused over a half million dollars in damage , and Drill Sergeants were forced to kill 11 Privates in self defense An Army spokesman has said that General Brown will not be scheduled as the keynote speaker for next week 's graduation ceremony",false

"Matt Taibbi , the star magazine writer hired earlier this year to start a satirical website for billionaire Pierre Omidyar 's First Look Media , is on a leave of absence from the company after disagreements with higher ups inside Omidyar 's organization , a source close to First Look confirmed today \( UPDATE Taibbi has left the company Taibbi 's abrupt disappearance from the company 's Fifth Avenue headquarters has cast doubt on the fate of his highly anticipated digital publication , reportedly to be called Racket , which First Look executives had previously said would launch sometime this autumn When he was hired , amid much fanfare , Taibbi 's website was meant to be the second in an envisioned fleet of titles to be published by First Look , an ambitious digital journalism company funded by Omidyar , the founder of eBay and one of the richest tech moguls in America Like its counterpart the Intercept , launched earlier this year by Glenn Greenwald and others to pursue investigations of NSA surveillance and the intelligence world , it was a venture centered around a brand name polemicist without much management experience Prior to joining First Look , Taibbi made his name by gleefully skewering fat targets for Rolling Stone most famously , he described Goldman Sachs as a great vampire squid wrapped around the face of humanity and he said at the time of his departure that he was lured away by the chance to lampoon the financial industry in the simultaneously funny and satirical voice associated with the legendary magazine Spy Over the succeeding months , the mission of the publication broadened to encompass political satire as well , and it brought on a number of high profile names from the New York digital scene , including deputy editor Alex Pareene , formerly of Salon Laura Dawn , a digital video producer who formerly worked with Moveon org and Edith Zimmerman , editor of the Hairpin Journalists should be dark , funny , mean people , Taibbi told New York in an interview in March Omidyar originally conceived of First Look as a network of interlinking sites run by independent journalists , many of whom took a similarly adversarial approach to journalism Over the last year , however , the center of gravity of the organization has shifted , as Omidyar and his Silicon Valley braintrust have exerted control over budgets and vacillated over the journalistic mission Over the summer , Omidyar appointed a longtime confidante , John Temple a former newspaper editor who previously led an Omidyar financed civic journalism venture in Hawaii to be the president for audience and products , putting him in a position above Eric Bates , the former Rolling Stone editor who was brought on as a First Look editorial director , who is close to Taibbi The confrontational approach that made Taibbi 's name at Rolling Stone and before that , as a co founder of the gonzo Moscow expatriate magazine The eXile appears to have contributed to internal trouble at First Look Sources confirmed that Taibbi has been absent from the office for several weeks , only returning on one brief occasion to address the staff Although those hired have been reassured that the project would continue on during the unspecified term of Taibbi 's absence , the launch date for Racket which Taibbi indicated in September would be coming in a month now appears to have been pushed off We have a target date but I would n't make a launch date public , said Temple , who is based in San Francisco , when reached by phone this morning I do n't comment about internal matters and I do n't comment on personnel matters Taibbi 's absence is only the latest in a series of shifts inside First Look , which Omidyar founded last year , originally in response to the disclosures of NSA surveillance leaked by Edward Snowden to Greenwald and his Intercept colleague Laura Poitras Omidyar initially committed 250 million to the project and began laying plans for a large general interest website and a number of more narrowly focused digital magazines In July , the billionaire announced he was scaling back the plan for the time being , choosing instead to focus on Racket and the Intercept as prototypes for a new technological model of journalism The Intercept has lately been publishing vigorously , breaking several major stories federal investigators are reportedly pursuing the alleged leaker responsible for a story on the site about the government 's voluminous terrorist watch list But Racket has been much slower to materialize , leading to rumors of staff anxiety In August , Temple told me Taibbi 's site was experimenting with a variety of journalistic approaches not just satire and humor but also investigative journalism For instance , Ellen Miller , head of the campaign finance watchdog the Sunlight Foundation a nonprofit also heavily financed by Omidyar met with the staff over the summer to discuss how it might dig into issues of money in politics We 're supporting Matt in creating something unique and it 's Matt 's , Temple told me Taibbi 's clashes with those at the top are likely to drive further speculation about the fate of the long incubating project and about the journalist 's own continued involvement Nonetheless , the site is apparently still hiring UPDATE Omidyar announced on Tuesday night that Taibbi has left the company I regret to announce that after several weeks of discussions , Matt Taibbi has left First Look We wish him well Our differences were never about editorial independence We have never wavered from our pledge that journalistic content is for the journalists to decide , period We 're disappointed by how things have turned out I was excited by Matt 's editorial vision and hoped to help him bring it to fruition Now we turn our focus to exploring next steps for the talented team that has worked to create Matt 's publication I remain an enthusiastic supporter of the kind of independent journalism found at The Intercept and the site we were preparing to launch As a startup , we 'll take what we 've learned in the last several months and apply it to our efforts in the future Above all , we remain committed to our team and to the First Look mission",true

"For those of you that are evacuating from the coast , I just heard a great tip It 's called the one cup tip You put a cup of water in your freezer Freeze it solid and then put a quarter on top of it and leave it in your freezer That way when you come back after you 've been evacuated you can tell if your food went completely bad and just refroze or if it stayed Frozen while you were gone If the quarter has fallen to the bottom of the cup that means all the food defrosted and you should throw it out But if the quarter is either on the top or in the middle of the cup then your food may still be ok It would also be a great idea to leave this in your freezer all the time and if you lose power for any reason you will have this tip to fall back on If you do n't feel good about your food , just throw it out The main thing is for all to be safe Please SHARE this on your page",false
"Here come the autonomous robot security guards What could possibly go wrong \? Here come the autonomous robot security guards What could possibly go wrong \? By Sebastian Anthony on November 17 , 2014 at 8 58 amCommentThis site may earn affiliate commissions from the links on this page Terms of use Showing a rather shocking disregard for the long term safety of human civilization , Microsoft has become one of the first companies to deploy autonomous robot security guards Dubbed the K5 , Microsoft 's Silicon Valley campus was being policed last week by five of these roughly human sized 300 pound \( 136 kg \) robots , each equipped with enough cameras , sensors , artificial intelligence , and alarms that they can replace most human security patrols Fortunately , despite looking like uncomfortably like a Dalek from the Doctor Who universe , the K5 is not \( yet \) equipped with a ray gun or any other method for harming or detaining humans Updated Microsoft contacted ExtremeTech to tell us that the robots were only temporarily deployed at its Silicon Valley campus , as part of a demonstration put on by Knightscope Microsoft PR says it is n't aware of any future plans to deploy such robots The K5 , built by the Californian company Knightscope , is billed rather euphemistically as an autonomous data machine that provides a commanding but friendly physical presence Basically , it 's a security guard on wheels Inside that rather large casing \( it 's 5 foot tall ! \) there are four high def cameras facing in each direction , another camera that can do car license plate recognition , four microphones , gentle alarms , blaring sirens , weather sensors , and WiFi connectivity so that each robot can contact HQ if there 's some kind of security breach situation For navigating the environment , there 's GPS and laser scanning \( LIDAR I guess \) And of course , at the heart of each K5 is a computer running artificial intelligence software that integrates all of that data and tries to make intelligent inferences like , should I tell HQ about that large gathering of teenagers , or should that man be climbing in through that window \? K5 security robot The lights can change color \( red for trouble , orange for caution , etc \) If a K5 decides that there 's a situation , it can use one of its built in sirens to try and diffuse things or it can message HQ to summon a human If you step in front of the K5 , or otherwise interfere with it , it will gently warn you with some chimes but if you do n't move , an ear piercing alarm is triggered Other than its sirens and its rather imposing design , the K5 is n't equipped with any weapons or other tools for resolving situations \( Does anyone else think it looks like the lovechild of a Dalek and EVE from WALL E \? \) A slightly odd photo of a US sheriff holding a gun to the head of a K5 robotK5 is n't just for catching criminals , either If you find yourself in trouble danger , there 's also a button on the top of the robot that summons help from HQ Read Microsoft wants to be part of Judgment Day , tooThe purpose of the K5 , like most robots , is straightforward To replace expensive human workers The K5 can run for around 24 hours on a single battery charge , automatically navigates back to the charging point when it 's running low , and only takes 15 20 minutes to recharge Obviously , in the long run , this is cheaper and more efficient than a human security guard plus , as technology improves , the K5 will probably be more vigilant and capable of spotting smaller discrepancies than a human In theory , because of the lower cost , you could also field lots of K5 robots , reducing the number of potential holes in security coverage It goes without saying , though , that deploying a fleet of roughly human sized , autonomous robots is just a little bit scary At the very least , a 300 pound robot would cause a lot of damage if it ran into something a car , a shop window , a child In all likelihood , though , if these robotic security guards are popular , they 'll eventually be equipped with weapons perhaps a taser for subduing a suspect , and a tear gas launcher for clearing groups of people At that point , you need to be really sure that the AI is free of bugs",false

"Young Thomas Edison NPS PhotoThomas Alva Edison was born on February 11 , 1847 in Milan , Ohio the seventh and last child of Samuel and Nancy Edison When Edison was seven his family moved to Port Huron , Michigan Edison lived here until he struck out on his own at the age of sixteen Edison had very little formal education as a child , attending school only for a few months He was taught reading , writing , and arithmetic by his mother , but was always a very curious child and taught himself much by reading on his own This belief in self improvement remained throughout his life Edison began working at an early age , as most boys did at the time At thirteen he took a job as a newsboy , selling newspapers and candy on the local railroad that ran through Port Huron to Detroit He seems to have spent much of his free time reading scientific , and technical books , and also had the opportunity at this time to learn how to operate a telegraph By the time he was sixteen , Edison was proficient enough to work as a telegrapher full time The development of the telegraph was the first step in the communication revolution , and the telegraph industry expanded rapidly in the second half of the 19th century This rapid growth gave Edison and others like him a chance to travel , see the country , and gain experience Edison worked in a number of cities throughout the United States before arriving in Boston in 1868 Here Edison began to change his profession from telegrapher to inventor He received his first patent on an electric vote recorder , a device intended for use by elected bodies such as Congress to speed the voting process This invention was a commercial failure Edison resolved that in the future he would only invent things that he was certain the public would want Edison moved to New York City in 1869 He continued to work on inventions related to the telegraph , and developed his first successful invention , an improved stock ticker called the Universal Stock Printer For this and some related inventions Edison was paid 40 , 000 This gave Edison the money he needed to set up his first small laboratory and manufacturing facility in Newark , New Jersey in 1871 During the next five years , Edison worked in Newark inventing and manufacturing devices that greatly improved the speed and efficiency of the telegraph He also found to time to get married to Mary Stilwell and start a family In 1876 Edison sold all his Newark manufacturing concerns and moved his family and staff of assistants to the small village of Menlo Park , twenty five miles southwest of New York City Edison established a new facility containing all the equipment necessary to work on any invention This research and development laboratory was the first of its kind anywhere the model for later , modern facilities such as Bell Laboratories , this is sometimes considered to be Edison 's greatest invention Here Edison began to change the world Edison 's first phonograph 1877 NPS PhotoThe first great invention developed by Edison in Menlo Park was the tin foil phonograph The first machine that could record and reproduce sound created a sensation and brought Edison international fame Edison toured the country with the tin foil phonograph , and was invited to the White House to demonstrate it to President Rutherford B Hayes in April 1878 Edison next undertook his greatest challenge , the development of a practical incandescent , electric light The idea of electric lighting was not new , and a number of people had worked on , and even developed forms of electric lighting But up to that time , nothing had been developed that was remotely practical for home use Edison 's eventual achievement was inventing not just an incandescent electric light , but also an electric lighting system that contained all the elements necessary to make the incandescent light practical , safe , and economical After one and a half years of work , success was achieved when an incandescent lamp with a filament of carbonized sewing thread burned for thirteen and a half hours The first public demonstration of the Edison 's incandescent lighting system was in December 1879 , when the Menlo Park laboratory complex was electrically lighted Edison spent the next several years creating the electric industry In September 1882 , the first commercial power station , located on Pearl Street in lower Manhattan , went into operation providing light and power to customers in a one square mile area the electric age had begun An early sketch from a laboratory notebook of an electric lightbulb NPS PhotoThe success of his electric light brought Edison to new heights of fame and wealth , as electricity spread around the world Edison 's various electric companies continued to grow until in 1889 they were brought together to form Edison General Electric Despite the use of Edison in the company title however , Edison never controlled this company The tremendous amount of capital needed to develop the incandescent lighting industry had necessitated the involvement of investment bankers such as J P Morgan When Edison General Electric merged with its leading competitor Thompson Houston in 1892 , Edison was dropped from the name , and the company became simply General Electric This period of success was marred by the death of Edison 's wife Mary in 1884 Edison 's involvement in the business end of the electric industry had caused Edison to spend less time in Menlo Park After Mary 's death , Edison was there even less , living instead in New York City with his three children A year later , while vacationing at a friends house in New England , Edison met Mina Miller and fell in love The couple was married in February 1886 and moved to West Orange , New Jersey where Edison had purchased an estate , Glenmont , for his bride Thomas Edison lived here with Mina until his death When Edison moved to West Orange , he was doing experimental work in makeshift facilities in his electric lamp factory in nearby Harrison , New Jersey A few months after his marriage , however , Edison decided to build a new laboratory in West Orange itself , less than a mile from his home Edison possessed both the resources and experience by this time to build , the best equipped and largest laboratory extant and the facilities superior to any other for rapid and cheap development of an invention The new laboratory complex consisting of five buildings opened in November 1887 A three story main laboratory building contained a power plant , machine shops , stock rooms , experimental rooms and a large library Four smaller one story buildings built perpendicular to the main building contained a physics lab , chemistry lab , metallurgy lab , pattern shop , and chemical storage The large size of the laboratory not only allowed Edison to work on any sort of project , but also allowed him to work on as many as ten or twenty projects at once Facilities were added to the laboratory or modified to meet Edison 's changing needs as he continued to work in this complex until his death in 1931 Over the years , factories to manufacture Edison inventions were built around the laboratory The entire laboratory and factory complex eventually covered more than twenty acres and employed 10 , 000 people at its peak during World War One \( 1914 1918 \) After opening the new laboratory , Edison began to work on the phonograph again , having set the project aside to develop the electric light in the late 1870s By the 1890s , Edison began to manufacture phonographs for both home , and business use Like the electric light , Edison developed everything needed to have a phonograph work , including records to play , equipment to record the records , and equipment to manufacture the records and the machines In the process of making the phonograph practical , Edison created the recording industry The development and improvement of the phonograph was an ongoing project , continuing almost until Edison 's death While working on the phonograph , Edison began working on a device that , does for the eye what the phonograph does for the ear , this was to become motion pictures Edison first demonstrated motion pictures in 1891 , and began commercial production of movies two years later in a peculiar looking structure , built on the laboratory grounds , known as the Black Maria Like the electric light and phonograph before it , Edison developed a complete system , developing everything needed to both film and show motion pictures Edison 's initial work in motion pictures was pioneering and original However , many people became interested in this third new industry Edison created , and worked to further improve on Edison 's early motion picture work There were therefore many contributors to the swift development of motion pictures beyond the early work of Edison By the late 1890s , a thriving new industry was firmly established , and by 1918 the industry had become so competitive that Edison got out of the movie business all together The success of the phonograph and motion pictures in the 1890s helped offset the greatest failure of Edison 's career Throughout the decade Edison worked in his laboratory and in the old iron mines of northwestern New Jersey to develop methods of mining iron ore to feed the insatiable demand of the Pennsylvania steel mills To finance this work , Edison sold all his stock in General Electric Despite ten years of work and millions of dollars spent on research and development , Edison was never able to make the process commercially practical , and lost all the money he had invested This would have meant financial ruin had not Edison continued to develop the phonograph and motion pictures at the same time As it was , Edison entered the new century still financially secure and ready to take on another challenge Edison 's new challenge was to develop a better storage battery for use in electric vehicles Edison very much enjoyed automobiles and owned a number of different types during his life , powered by gasoline , electricity , and steam Edison thought that electric propulsion was clearly the best method of powering cars , but realized that conventional lead acid storage batteries were inadequate for the job Edison began to develop an alkaline battery in 1899 It proved to be Edison 's most difficult project , taking ten years to develop a practical alkaline battery By the time Edison introduced his new alkaline battery , the gasoline powered car had so improved that electric vehicles were becoming increasingly less common , being used mainly as delivery vehicles in cities However , the Edison alkaline battery proved useful for lighting railway cars and signals , maritime buoys , and miners lamps Unlike iron ore mining , the heavy investment Edison made over ten years was repaid handsomely , and the storage battery eventually became Edison 's most profitable product Further , Edison 's work paved the way for the modern alkaline battery By 1911 , Thomas Edison had built a vast industrial operation in West Orange Numerous factories had been built through the years around the original laboratory , and the staff of the entire complex had grown into the thousands To better manage operations , Edison brought all the companies he had started to make his inventions together into one corporation , Thomas A Edison Incorporated , with Edison as president and chairman Edison was sixty four by this time and his role with his company and in life began to change Edison left more of the daily operations of both the laboratory and the factories to others The laboratory itself did less original experimental work and instead worked more on refining existing Edison products such as the phonograph Although Edison continued to file for and receive patents for new inventions , the days of developing new products that changed lives and created industries were behind him In the 1915 , Edison was asked to head the Naval Consulting Board With the United States inching closer towards the involvement in World War One , the Naval Consulting Board was an attempt to organize the talents of the leading scientists and inventors in the United States for the benefit of the American armed forces Edison favored preparedness , and accepted the appointment The Board did not make a notable contribution to the final allied victory , but did serve as a precedent for future successful cooperation between scientists , inventors and the United States military During the war , at age seventy , Edison spent several months on Long Island Sound in a borrowed navy vessel experimenting on techniques for detecting submarines Edison 's role in life began to change from inventor and industrialist to cultural icon , a symbol of American ingenuity , and a real life Horatio Alger story In 1928 , in recognition of a lifetime of achievement , the United States Congress voted Edison a special Medal of Honor In 1929 the nation celebrated the golden jubilee of the incandescent light The celebration culminated at a banquet honoring Edison given by Henry Ford at Greenfield Village , Ford 's new American history museum , which included a complete restoration of the Menlo Park Laboratory Attendees included President Herbert Hoover and many of the leading American scientists and inventors The last experimental work of Edison 's life was done at the request of Edison 's good friends Henry Ford , and Harvey Firestone in the late 1920s They asked Edison to find an alternative source of rubber for use in automobile tires The natural rubber used for tires up to that time came from the rubber tree , which does not grow in the United States Crude rubber had to be imported and was becoming increasingly expensive With his customary energy and thoroughness , Edison tested thousands of different plants to find a suitable substitute , eventually finding a type of Goldenrod weed that could produce enough rubber to be feasible Edison was still working on this at the time of his death During the last two years of his life Edison was in increasingly poor health Edison spent more time away from the laboratory , working instead at Glenmont Trips to the family vacation home in Fort Myers , Florida became longer Edison was past eighty and suffering from a number of ailments In August 1931 Edison collapsed at Glenmont Essentially house bound from that point , Edison steadily declined until at 3 21 am on October 18 , 1931 the great man died Last updated February 26 , 2015",false

scene could just be one more bit of proof that the state is becoming a global mecca for marijuana After all , the state 's legalized marijuana experiment has so far been an unqualified success Despite the surprisingly limited number of recreational pot shops that opened their doors on Jan 1 and the hefty crowds waiting in line to patronize them the state has n't experienced widespread product shortages or weed prices high enough to trigger an Uber style backlash Yes , there was that story about 37 deadly marijuana overdoses on the first day of sales , but it turned out to be an obvious hoax The few pundits who 've complained about Colorado 's legalized pot , like David Brooks and Nancy Grace , have found their arguments blasted full of holes , not to mention lambasted on Saturday Night Live The Justice Department is looking into ways to help banks play nice with marijuana businesses a very serious problem and even President Obama in a recent New Yorker profile conceded it 's important for the experiment to go forward Soon enough , then , Colorado 's small scale experiment should spread far and wide , with controversial drug laws getting the boot , millions of clandestine tokers coming out of the closet , and governments reaping the benefits in taxes and fees That is unless something goes terribly wrong , derailing the whole legalization movement AdvertisementSuch a gloomy outcome is n't out of the question The only reason that Colorado is enjoying fame as the first place to legalize pot is thanks to a combination of fortunate timing , plucky advocates , forward thinking lawmakers , and a remarkable lack of snafus Colorado 's 2012 legalization attempt very well could have floundered if the effort had n't enjoyed remarkably positive media coverage Considering the precipitous rise of the state 's medical marijuana industry and lawmakers' keen efforts to moderate it , all it could have taken was the right bad headline a high profile crime or a boneheaded political move to set the endeavor back considerably Recall that alcohol prohibition was built on the temperance movement 's carefully crafted tales of woe and violence As Salvation Army Commander

state and with the world watching , such calamities could have an international impact So what are the biggest potential risks \? A major concern is diversion , taking Colorado 's legal pot and offloading it to the black market or selling it out of state While Colorado has established an extensive tracking system to prevent this from happening , there will always be tourists trying to take home a pot infused souvenir Beyond diversion , there 's the menace of crime not just the threat of burglaries and organized crime in a largely cash based industry , but also the distant possibility of banks or other financial institutions getting slapped with federal money laundering charges if they accept any of that free flowing marijuana cash Finally , there 's the prospective collateral damage , such as kids accidentally eating pot brownies something that 's already in the news or a violent pot related car crash If any of these calamities do occur , Colorado 's red hot dabbing scene could in fact be the source of the problem Dabbing certainly appears on the surface to be dangerous Kids are freebasing marijuana !

But it 's important to remember that there 's no evidence that it 's possible to overdose on pot \( Compared to say , acetaminophen , overdoses of which killed more than 1 , 500 Americans during the past decade \) So you can smoke the strongest dab imaginable or even , if you 're a showboat , smoke 50 dabs in a row and science says it wo n't kill you It will just get you really , really high Mars OG ISO dab , an isopropyl alcohol extraction made by Pink House Labs in Denver Courtesy of Ry Prichard CannabisEncyclopedia comAdvertisementBut just because something wo n't poison you the way alcohol can does n't mean it ca n't lead you to do something stupid enough that will kill you And there seem to be enough disconcerting variables associated with dabbing culture a production process laden with volatile chemicals a highly concentrated , easily transportable final product and incredibly stoned kids with blowtorches it seems only a matter of time until somebody in the scene does something very stupid and possibly fatal Yes , dabbing might not be as inherently dangerous as , say , a bar full of binge drinkers But it 's important to remember that recreational marijuana is n't necessarily replacing alcohol use it 's just adding a new legal vice to the options people already have While some researchers predict legalized marijuana will decrease alcohol use , others predict it could lead to heavy drinking and carnage on our highways So will folks really reach for a dabbing pipe instead of a shot glass or will they reach for both \? Top CommentNobody tell these fellows about vaporizers They 're going to worry about them detonating the atmosphere , or causing glaciers to melt , or something More J P McMahonJoin InQuestions like this have led California and Washington to outlaw the production of smokeable marijuana concentrates Colorado , however , has gone the opposite route In November it released a draft of proposed concentrate production rules , positioning itself to become the only place in the world where marijuana concentrate production is both legal and regulated The idea is to police the blooming subculture , to stay on top of it , so it ends up more akin to tattooing than meth If we outlaw concentrates , people will make them in their basements and blow themselves up , says Norton Arbelaez , co owner of the Denver dispensary RiverRock Wellness , which operates a concentrate production facility But just because a concentrate extraction system is certified by a third party industrial hygienist , as will likely be required by Colorado 's concentrate rules , does n't mean that system ca n't still accidentally blow up It makes sense that Colorado is at the vanguard of legalized dabbing It 's made a habit of taking risks when it comes to marijuana Colorado ca n't regulate away the chance that dabbing or some other marijuana related endeavor will lead to a spectacular accident , either industrial or personal But so far its legalization effort has taken pains to thoughtfully minimize such risks and so far , it 's working",false

"Updated NIH says cancer study also hit by fetal tissue ban Update , 13 December , 11 45 a m A third laboratory at the National Institutes of Health \( NIH \) is also affected by the agency 's temporary ban on acquiring new human fetal tissue , an agency spokesperson confirmed last night Initially , NIH said only research projects run by staff scientists at the National Eye Institute \( NEI \) and the National Institute of Allergy and Infectious Diseases \( NIAID \) would be affected The third laboratory is at the National Cancer Institute \( NCI \) , which is pursuing a project on cancer immunotherapy , which will need tissue by January 31 , the agency said in a statement We are determining appropriate next steps to obtain tissue so that the NIAID project can begin and to avoid interruption of the NCI project NEI does not have an immediate need to procure new fetal tissue \( they have frozen stores \) Here is our story from 7 December U S President Donald Trump 's administration has ordered scientists employed by the U S National Institutes of Health \( NIH \) to stop acquiring new human fetal tissue for experiments , Science Insider has learned The suspension , imposed this past September without a public announcement , came as the government launched a review of all fetal tissue research funded by the federal government The pause affects two laboratories run by the Bethesda , Maryland based agency , NIH officials say In one case , it disrupted a study probing how the virus that causes AIDS initially colonizes human tissues We were all poised to go and then the bombshell was dropped , says HIV researcher Warner Greene , director of the Gladstone Center for HIV Cure Research in San Francisco , California , who was collaborating with an NIH laboratory that received the order The decision completely knocked our collaboration off the rails We were devastated The order expands the scope of the Trump administration 's interventions into federally funded research that uses human fetal tissue from elective abortions , which is legal but fiercely opposed by antiabortion groups In September , it canceled a Food and Drug Administration \( FDA \) contract for acquiring human fetal tissue for testing candidate drugs This week , the Department of Health and Human Services \( HHS \) , which oversees NIH , told researchers at the University of California \( UC \) , San Francisco , that it would be extending a contract for work involving human fetal tissue for just 90 days instead of the usual 1 year , prompting media reports that the department was preparing to cancel the contract HHS denied those reports , saying it has made no decisions regarding federal funding for human fetal tissue research pending the outcome of the ongoing review of all such work Today , however , an NIH spokesperson confirmed that the agency asked staff scientists to pause procurements of fetal tissue pending the outcome of the HHS review The suspension applies only to scientists who work directly for NIH 's intramural program , and not extramural researchers who typically work at universities and receive grants from the government It affects two laboratories , NIH officials say One is operated by the National Eye Institute \( Fetal retinal tissue is used to study eye diseases \) The other is run by the National Institute of Allergy and Infectious Diseases \( NIAID \) Yes , we have instituted a pause of further procurements of human fetal tissue pending the audit review that HHS is undertaking , an NIAID spokeperson confirmed The HIV experiment disrupted by the suspension was being conducted at NIAID 's Rocky Mountain Laboratories \( RML \) in Hamilton , Montana , which focus on infectious diseases Researchers there use fetal tissue donated by women who have had legal abortions to create so called humanized mice , which have immune systems that behave like a human 's Humanized mice have played a key role in testing and developing treatments for HIV AIDS The NIH lab had , for several years , obtained the human fetal tissue from Advanced Bioscience Resources \( ABR \) , based in Alameda , California According to emails provided to Science Insider by Greene , RML researcher Kim Hasenkrug had prepared humanized mice for a trial of an antibody that the researchers believed based on promising lab dish studies might prevent HIV from establishing reservoirs in the human body \( Hasenkrug could not be reached for comment \) On 11 September , Hasenkrug informed Greene and Thomas Packard , a postdoctoral student of Greene 's , that he had obtained needed reagents and the mice were ready Packard responded that they were excited at the prospect of getting the study started , and would immediately send Hasenkrug a batch of the antibodies I 'll not be able to get the antibodies on the 3 PM FedEx today , but I 'll ship the antibodies to you tomorrow , so you should have it on Thursday , Packard wrote in an email On 28 September , however , Greene received a message from Hasenkrug that left him stunned The email , which bore the subject line HHS directive , read in part HHS has directed me to discontinue procuring fetal tissue from ABR , the only source for us I think that they are the only provider of fetal tissue for scientists in the nation who do n't have direct access to aborted fetal tissue This effectively stops all of our research to discover a cure for HIV Hasenkrug had not yet launched the experiment , Greene says , and his supplies of existing mice were too small to conduct the repeated experiments required to reach convincing scientific conclusions The order to Hasenkrug came just as HHS launched its review of human fetal tissue research , and at the same time that the department killed the FDA contract , which was with ABR \( The department wrote at that time that it was not sufficiently assured that the contract included the appropriate protections applicable to fetal tissue research , but provided no evidence of violations \) It is unclear whether HHS will next place restrictions on the grants of NIH funded investigators at universities who do n't work for NIH but whose projects also rely on access to new fetal tissue Science Insider posed this question and others to Assistant Secretary of Health Brett Giroir , who is heading the review , but did not receive a response by press time Some extramural scientists are concerned Everything I am doing involves humanized mice It would shut my lab down if we were not able to use fetal tissues , says Jerome Zack , a virologist who studies HIV at UC Los Angeles , and has been using humanized mice for 25 years Such mice are particularly valuable for HIV drug testing in part because tissue from a single human fetus can readily generate a group of 40 to 50 genetically identical mice , and because the animals can , unlike monkeys , be infected with the human virus , HIV Potential drugs can then be tested in such a group , with ample mice as controls , giving the studies robust statistical power Packard calls the HHS review and its attendant constraints really just a travesty for the outlook for HIV research Mice made with human fetal tissue are critical to moving from discoveries in the lab to clinical treatments Blocking this significantly hurts our chances of finding an HIV cure Greene adds that even if the HHS order is eventually lifted , the lost time would be consequential If we were given the green light right now to resume acquiring fetal tissue , he says , it would probably take us a year to get back in the position we were in when the ban was put in place After this story was published , NIH emailed an additional statement It said the agency in September put a pause in place for staff scientists procuring new human fetal tissue , an action NIH thought was prudent given the examination of these procurements Research with tissue already on hand could proceed , and NIH leaders asked to be notified by intramural investigators if new procurement would be necessary NIH leadership was not informed that new procurement was necessary for the study you reference in your story We are looking into why this did not occur Update , 8 December , 10 p m This story has been updated to clarify a quote from Thomas Packard Update , 9 December , 9 30 a m This story is updated with an additional statement that NIH provided after the story was published Update , 10 December , 11 30 a m The story has been updated to clarify what kinds of treatments have benefited from research involving humanized mice",true

"According to nonpartisan experts , the new health care reform lawwill extend coverage to 32 million Americans and cut the deficit by 143 billion over 10 years But as with any major new law , thereare many reasonable questions people have about how it affects themand their families And , unfortunately , there are also many questions and concernsabout the new law based on misinformation For example , I have beenasked a number of times why senators and their staff will not becovered by the law The answer is , they will be That is just oneof the many questions about the new law that I hear at my listeningsessions and from constituents So to help answer these questions and correct some of themisinformation I hear about the bill , here are some frequentlyasked questions along with answers I currently purchase my own insurance Will this bill force meinto a public plan \? No The health care law does not create a public plan If you likethe plan you purchase , the health care reform bill does not forceyou to change it Now that the health care bill has become law , what about myhealth care coverage will change \? The most immediate change as a result of the new health carereforms is that people will be able to enjoy new consumerprotections like not being dropped from coverage if you get sick , no lifetime limits on benefits and yearly caps on what insurancecompanies can charge you for out of pocket expenses If you arelike the majority of Americans who get their health care coveragethrough work , you will not see any big changes If you havespecific questions , you may want to discuss them with yourinsurance company or your employer What will this do to the cost of my private insuranceplan \? For Wisconsinites who purchase health care on the individual market \( i e , people who do not get insurance through their employer \) , experts believe this reform will lower premiums by 14 percent to 20percent compared to what the same plan would cost without healthcare insurance reform by 2016 If I ca n't afford to purchase insurance will I be fined \? No The new law includes subsidies to help individuals to purchasehealth insurance through exchanges In the rare occasion it isstill unaffordable , even with the subsidies , you will not be fined The law extends coverage to 32 million Americans who do n't haveinsurance Can I keep both my private insurance and my Medicare \? Under the new law , anyone can keep Medicare and a privatesupplemental plan Some people are saying that this new law would add trillions ofdollars to our debt and raise taxes on families and smallbusinesses by more than 500 billion Is that true \? The nonpartisan Congressional Budget Office has stated the new lawwill reduce our national deficits by 143 billion over the first 10years and as much as 1 2 trillion over the next 10 years Thoseare the facts Middle class families will benefit from the largestmiddle class tax cut ever by receiving subsidies to purchase healthinsurance and new consumer protections against health insuranceabuses More than 77 , 000 small businesses in Wisconsin alone willbenefit from tax credits to purchase health insurance for their ownfamilies and employees Do these new exchanges give Americans the same health carechoices as members of Congress \? Yes A number of Wisconsinites have expressed concern about theidea that members of Congress may be exempted from health carereform I am pleased that that is not the case Currently , membersof Congress , like other federal employees including everyone frompostal workers to custodial staff have access to affordableinsurance purchased through a federal exchange The healthinsurance exchanges set up by this new law will operate in asimilar manner to make sure that all Americans in the exchangeshave access to good , affordable , health care choices Under the newlaw , Sen Russ Feingold and his staff will be required to purchasetheir health insurance in the new state exchanges once thoseexchanges are operating \( Sec 1312 of PPACA , pages 157 and158 \) How does the new law make health care affordable \? Because of this new law , 541 , 000 Wisconsinites who are uninsuredand 320 , 000 Wisconsinites who purchase health insurance through theindividual market will have access to better and more affordableinsurance Furthermore , this bill provides tax credits for up to358 , 000 Wisconsinites to help make health insurance moreaffordable , bringing 5 8 billion in premium and cost sharing taxcredits into Wisconsin during the first five years of the healthinsurance exchange Will this new law cost jobs \? Actually , it could create thousands of new jobs By slowing thegrowth rate of health care costs , it will be more profitable forbusinesses to expand employment The state exchanges set up by thisnew law also help ensure that entrepreneurs are not prevented fromlaunching a new business because they ca n't afford the cost ofcare One analysis predicts that this slowing of the growth ratewill lead to anywhere between 5 , 600 and 9 , 000 new jobs each year inWisconsin I 've been told this new law is terrible for small businesses Isthat true \? Where small businesses make up 76 percent of Wisconsin businesses , less than 38 percent of them are able to offer health insuranceright now Because of this new law , more than 77 , 000 smallbusinesses in Wisconsin could receive a tax credit making healthcare coverage for employees more affordable I keep hearing that this new law will be paid for through endingwaste , fraud and abuse in our health care system What does thatmean \? According to the non partisan experts at the Congressional Budget Office , because ofthis new law , over the next 10 years , our national deficit willdecrease by 143 billion and up to 1 2 trillion in the following10 years Those savings come from a number of cost containmentprovisions A major one is reimbursing physicians based on thequality of care they provide rather than the quantity of care Thisis called value based health care purchasing , and it will helpreward some of the high quality care provided by hospitals andmedical groups around Wisconsin such as the Marshfield Clinic , Gundersen Lutheran and Franciscan Skemp Hospitals will be held accountable to reduce preventable hospitalreadmissions and preventable health care acquired infections Increasingly , their payments will be linked to improving theirquality and the outcomes of their care Physicians will also bepaid based on quality of care and not on the volume of servicesthey provide This will curb the ordering of unnecessary tests andprocedures that can be very expensive A new Independent PaymentAdvisory Board will identify ways to lower costs , improve outcomes , promote quality and expand access to evidence basedcare We will also save billions over the next decade through cutting thecost of drugs purchased through Medicaid One example is aprovision of Feingold 's Control Spending Now Act , included in thenew health care bill The government is able to purchase drugsincluded under the fee for service component of Medicaid at adiscounted price The new health care law extends the ability topurchase discounted drugs to managed care organizations to providetreatment to Medicaid beneficiaries CBO estimates this change willsave 11 billion over 10 years I'm a Medicare beneficiary with high prescription drug costs howdoes this new law help me \? Beginning this year , if a Medicare beneficiary spends more than 2 , 830 on prescription drug costs in the Part D doughnut hole , heor she will receive a 250 rebate check in the mail Starting in2011 , a 50 percent discount on any brand name drug costs incurredwhile in the doughnut hole will be available Subsidies for genericdrug costs will also begin to be phased in starting in 2011 Thesesubsidies will increase year by year , until the doughnut hole isfully closed in 2020 My child just graduated from college and does n't have healthinsurance Does this new law provide any new options \? Effective six months after enactment , both group health plans andplans in the individual market that provide dependent coverage forchildren must continue to make that coverage available until thechild turns 26 years of age Who is eligible for the exchanges \?
