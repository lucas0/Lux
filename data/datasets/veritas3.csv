It’s really crazy what millennials think are ‘critical situations’, eh?

Adding insult to injury, Louia even took photos of her grandpa as he lay on the bed, gasping for breath. He was turning blue from lack of oxygen and that should have rang warning bells but Louia thought the color change she saw was just due to the Instagram filter she used to take his photo.

Yep. You read that right – she also took photos!

She argued later that she had only taken photos because her mother had asked how her grandpa was doing and the best thing she could do was to take snapshots to really show her his actual condition.

She blames her friends and Instagram followers for not giving her a warning.

“ People could have also warned me, instead of just tapping ‘Like’ ,” she whined.

The old man couldn’t talk but, thankfully, he was able to reach the control to call for help from the nurse’s station.

We all have the notion that eating fish would be the better option over bacon when it comes to health. And the truth is, it really is … most of the time! Fish is a low-fat, high-protein food that has a range of health benefits. However, given what we know of fish and its sources today, we may have to re-examine this statement.

Fish can either be one of the best foods for you or detrimental to your health depending on where it’s sourced. There is a world of difference between a fish that is caught in the wild vs. farm-bred or farm-raised fish. The most common farm-raised fish are: salmon, tilapia, catfish, swai, “sea” bass, and cod (the last two surprise a lot of people).

Tilapia, in particular, became extremely popular in aquaculture and aquaponics across Asia, Mexico, Central America and the U.S. because it grows very quickly, is tolerant of stocking density and is adaptable.

So what’s wrong with that? Well, it all depends on how the fresh or frozen tilapia filets were raised … and where. What are the exact dangers of eating farm-raised fish?

6 Reasons Tilapia Farming Is Dangerous to Your Health

1. Recent studies have found that farm-raised tilapia may cause more inflammation

Farm-raised tilapia has always been a popular source for fish, not only because it’s widely available in the U.S., but it’s also very inexpensive. (1) However, before you stock up on tilapia, you may want to know about its correlation to inflammation. Recent studies have shown that eating tilapia may worsen inflammation, which can lead to heart disease, arthritis, asthma and a world of other serious health problems.

People who resort to eating more fish as a way to get their dose of omega-3 fatty-acids and lessen their risk of heart attacks may want to hold off on the tilapia. In fact, a scientist from Wake Forest University has found that the inflammatory potential of tilapia is far greater than that of a hamburger or pork bacon, and therefore make it a fish you shouldn’t eat. (2)

2. Farmed salmon may have at least 10 times the amount of cancer-causing organic pollutants compared to the wild variety

This can most likely be attributed to the feeds that are used on farm-raised fish. If you knew what went into the feeds of farm-raised fish, you would be horrified. Apparently, chicken feces is one of the main ingredients that go into farm fish feed. Not only that, the transfer of pig and duck waste to fish farms is also a very common practice, such as with Chinese tilapia.

3. Farm-bred fish have been found to have high concentrations of antibiotics and pesticides

Where do farm-bred fish get their antibiotics? The crowded conditions of fish farms cause the fish to be more susceptible to disease. To keep them alive, farm owners give antibiotics to the fish to stave off disease — similar to what occurs in confined feedlot operations for cattle. (3)

Farm-bred fish, such as Chinese tilapia, are also treated with pesticides to combat sea lice. The pesticides used to treat these fish are so deadly that they will kill wild salmon that are accidentally exposed to them. These pesticides are also eventually released in the ocean, where they get into the bodies and systems of other marine life.

4. Farm-bred fish also have lower levels of healthy nutrients

Many of us consume fish, hoping to reap the omega-3 fatty acid benefits that come with it. However, did you know that the omega-3-acids that are found in farm-raised fish are less usable in our bodies compared to wild-bred fish? Farm-raised fish also has a lower protein content.

Not only that, because farm-raised fish are kept in cages, they have the tendency to be fattier, and can have a higher concentration of omega-6 acids. The problem with getting too many omega-3 and omega-6 acids is that they, again, may cause inflammation to the body.

5. Dibutylin levels, a chemical used in PVC plastics, is said to be six times higher in farm-raised mussels compared to wild ones

Dibutylin is toxic and can impair immune system function while also contributing to inflammation. Dibutylin may be the reason as to why there is a rise in asthma, obesity, allergies and other metabolic disorders in recent years. (4, 5)

6. Dioxin levels are 11 times higher in farm-bred salmon compared to wild salmon

According to the Environmental Working Group, the “first-ever tests of farmed salmon from U.S. grocery stores show that farmed salmon are likely the most [dioxin-like] PCB-contaminated protein source in the U.S. food supply.” (6) Dioxin is actually a very toxic chemical that can contribute to cancer and other complications. The problem with dioxin is that once it enters our system, it can take a very long time until it leaves. Grimly, the half-life of dioxin is about 7 to 11 years!

7. Excessive mercury levels among even lake-grown fish and especially dangerous for pregnant women

In a study by Dr. J.K. McCrary published in the Environmental Pollution journal, total mercury concentrations in the water and fish of Lake Managua and Lake Apoyo were measured. A considerable one-fourth of the commercially fished tilapia in Lake Managua exceeded maximum recommended mercury levels for consumption among pregnant women and other at-risk groups. (7) As a result, the study recommended much closer mercury monitoring among freshwater fish that is meant for international commerce.

These are only some of the dangers that have been linked back to eating farm-raised fish. What does this tell us? No. 1, we need to find out where our fish is coming from. Not all fish are created equal, and sad to say, farm-raised fish, instead of helping us, may even harm us.

History of Tilapia, Tilapia Facts + Types of Tilapia

The common name for nearly a 100 species of cichlid fish, it comes from three distinct genera: Oreochromis, Sarotherodon and Tilapia. Mainly a freshwater fish, tilapia live in shallow streams, ponds, rivers and lakes — and adapt well to being farmed.

Historically, tilapia became popular in so-called artisanal fishing in Africa and soon became popular in aquaculture and aquaponics outside of Africa. Because North African tilapia grow quickly, are tolerant of stocking density and are adaptable. In modern aquaculture, the wild-type Nile tilapia (the healthiest variety) are not too often seen, because the dark color of their flesh is considered undesirable by many customers.

Tilapia are farmed extensively in many parts of Asia and the U.S. They are increasingly found in outdoor fish farms in tropical countries like as China, Papua New Guinea, the Philippines and Indonesia. In temperate zone climates, such as in U.S., tilapia farming operations need energy in order to warm the water to tropical temperatures. (8)

The largest tilapia producers in the world are China, then Egypt (!). Currently, it’s the fourth most consumed fish in the U.S.

Going way back, the aquaculture using Nile tilapia began in Ancient Egypt. In fact, tilapia is considered one of the three main types of fish caught from the Sea of Galilee during Biblical times.

Today, the three most commonly fished and eaten species of tilapia are Nile, Blue and Mozambique. Oreochromis niloticus, or Nile Tilapia, are the oldest variety of tilapia.

Nile Tilapia is one of the most adaptable fish, as it can be raised in various ways, such as ponds and in pristine lakes — and can be one of the most sustainable farmed fish. The best fresh tilapia eaten in the U.S. is all-natural (not using chemicals or antibiotics) and lake-grown. Most lake-grown tilapia actually comes from Honduras or Mexico. (9)

Therefore, if you ever do eat tilapia, make sure you ask were it was raised. Seafood Watch recommends to “buy tilapia (“izumidai” in sushi) farmed worldwide in recirculating aquaculture systems, Ecuador in ponds and Peru in raceways.” (10)

Blue Tilapia is found in Florida’s lakes, rivers and streams — and it can live both in saltwater and freshwater. Because it doesn’t grow as quickly as Nile Tilapia, it’s not as commonly farmed. Meanwhile, Mozambique Tilapia was introduced into the U.S. for sport fishing and as a means of aquatic plant control.

Farmed Shrimp: the Dirtiest of All Seafood

There are a lot of shrimp nutrition facts, but shrimp actually holds the designation of being “the dirtiest of all seafood,” says Marianne Cufone, director of Food and Water Watch. She says it’s hard to avoid, as 90 percent of shrimp sold in the U.S. is imported. (11)

“Imported farmed shrimp comes with a whole bevy of contaminants: antibiotics, residues from chemicals used to clean pens, filth like mouse hair, rat hair, and pieces of insects,” Cufone says. “And I didn’t even mention things like E. coli that have been detected in imported shrimp.”

Part of this has to do with the fact that less than 2 percent of ALL imported seafood (shrimp, crab, catfish or others) gets inspected before its sold, which is why it’s that much more important to buy domestic seafood.

What to Eat Instead of Tilapia Recipes

Fish can be an incredible health-building food if you go with wild-caught fish liked sockeye salmon, which has proven health benefits. It’s loaded with healthy fats and can help your brain, joints, muscles and skin!

But rather than buying cheap, frozen tilapia filets, a better option that is both inexpensive and easy to make is a homemade salmon patties recipe that is high in omega-3 fats and protein.

Plus, salmon contains astaxanthin, which has been proven to be more powerful than almost any other antioxidant at absorbing free radicals. If you are not consuming salmon or another wild-caught fish during the week, then I highly recommend you consume a benefit-rich fish oil supplement with astaxanthin.

When I eat out, I also ask my server if the fish is farm-raised or wild-caught. Most servers know this answer or can quickly go ask the head chef. As a quick rule of thumb for salmon, if it’s Pacific or Alaskan, it’s most likely wild-caught; if it’s Atlantic salmon, it’s almost always farm-raised.

According to According to Reuters , Germany witnessed an 8.5 percent increase in their migrant population in 2016, placing the total number of residents in the country with an immigrant background at approximately 18.6 million people.

The Federal Statistics Office noted that roughly one-fifth of the German population — about 22.5 percent — were either first or second generation migrants with one or less parents of Germanic heritage.

To be sure, the majority of those To be sure, the majority of those migrants to Germany actually originated in other European nations and are descended from European heritage, but a significant minority of them — particularly those who have come in the past few years — have originated from the Middle East or Africa.

It is estimated that around 2.3 million people in Germany have familial links to the Middle East, a 51 percent increase since 2011. Similarly, the population of those whose families came from Africa stands at around 750,000, a 46 percent increase since 2011.

About 1 million of those migrants from the Middle East or Africa arrived in Germany as part of the wave of refugees in 2015 and 2016.

Meanwhile, and potentially entirely unrelated … the Meanwhile, and potentially entirely unrelated … the U.K. Daily Mail just reported on a substantial rise in cases of bestiality within Germany over the same time period, so much so that “animal brothels” have actually become a thing.

Advertisement - story continues below

Yes, you read that correctly — Yes, you read that correctly — bestiality , also known as zoophilia, the practice of humans having sexual relations with animals, is a growing trend and “lifestyle choice” in the prominent central European nation.

A livestock protection and animal welfare officer named Madeleine Martin is now warning government officials that laws must be put in place to stop the rapid spread of these brothels that allow and encourage people to have sex with animals.

As an example of the growing trend, Martin pointed to a particular farmer with a flock of sheep who noticed that his animals had become increasingly skittish around people.

The farmer had surveillance cameras installed on his property, and lo and behold, caught several men entering his barn at night to engage sexually with his flock.

Martin stressed that this was but one example of many similar cases she has compiled all across the country, and she wants the government to do something about it.

It is worth noting that bestiality was once illegal in Germany, but the law banning it was dropped from the books in 1969.

There had been talk in 2016 of reinstating the ban, but Martin is done with mere talking and is demanding that changes be made to the national Animal Protection Code to do just that — protect the animals from abuse by sexually deviant people.

The chairman of the agricultural committee, Hans Michael-Goldman, said changes could be made in the laws to forbid the use of animals “ for individual sexual acts and to outlaw people ‘pimping’ creatures to others for sexual use,” which would effectively ban the “animal brothels” or “erotic zoos,” as some call them.

Violation of the newly proposed ban would likely result in a fine equivalent to more than $30,000 for a first offense, increasing thereafter. Of course, proponents of bestiality have vowed to fight any ban with legal challenges of their own, so we will have see how that plays out in court.

She and her fellow students at Parkland’s Marjory Stoneman Douglas High School “ostracized” fellow student Nikolas Cruz. Said González when speaking in Washington at the anti-gun “March for Our Lives”:

“Since he was in middle school, it was no surprise to anyone who knew him, that he was the shooter. Those talking about how we should have not ostracized him? You didn’t know this kid! OK? We did!”

Which is to say, González just made a startling admission. Parkland students bullied Nikolas Cruz.

It may well be that González is right — the rest of us didn’t know him.

But there are a large number of people — some of whom are celebrities and either marched in and/or supported the March — who have spent years insisting that what González and her friends who “ostracized” Nikolas Cruz did was… bullying.

Take actress Debra Messing. Messing is Take actress Debra Messing. Messing is listed on this site called Stomp Out Bullying. The site describes itself as follows:

STOMP Out Bullying, a national anti-bullying and cyberbullying program for kids and teens, is a signature program of STOMP Out Bullying, a national anti-bullying and cyberbullying program for kids and teens, is a signature program of Love Our Children USA , the national nonprofit leader in fighting violence against children since 1999. Created in 2005, STOMP Out Bullying™ focuses on reducing and preventing bullying, cyberbullying, sexting and other digital abuse, educating against homophobia, racism and hatred, decreasing school absenteeism, and deterring violence in schools, online and in communities across the country. It teaches effective solutions on how to respond to all forms of bullying; as well as educating kids and teens in school and online, providing help for those in need and at risk of suicide, raising awareness, peer mentoring programs in schools, public service announcements by noted celebrities, and social media campaigns. An additional focus educates parents on how to keep their children safe and responsible online.

Fair enough. They are opposed to bullying and support “educating kids and teens in school and online, providing help for those in need and at risk of suicide…” All to the good.

But now look at this tweet from Messing:

I stand with the brave, indomitable kids who galvanized a nation, a world, &did not take inaction as an answer. You have put the “adults” in DC to shame. CS gun laws with finally be enacted, &you will be the Heroes of a generation. TODAY you lead us all.

CS gun laws with finally be enacted, &you will be the Heroes of a generation. TODAY you lead us all. #MarchForOurLives — Debra Messing (@DebraMessing) — Debra Messing (@DebraMessing) March 24, 2018

Again, to be fair, Messing has no more idea what went on in the day-to-day life of Parkland’s high school than any other outsider. But it is striking that her first reaction — to support the kids — completely contradicts the stated objective of the STOMP Out Bullying program which she also supports. For as we all now know, there on the platform at the March is one of the Parkland students-turned-anti-gun activist blurting out to the world that, well, yes, the peers of Nikolas Cruz, in their common high school, bullied him — by ostracizing him and who knows what else. And the excuse? Well, the rest of us didn’t know him, you see… and per González, if we did we would know Nikolas Cruz deserved to be ostracized. He deserved to be bullied.

In the immediate aftermath of the shooting, in which Cruz took 17 lives, the TC Palm of the USA Today network In the immediate aftermath of the shooting, in which Cruz took 17 lives, theTC Palmof theUSA Todaynetwork headlined this

Florida school shooting: Student knew Cruz: ‘I could have said something to administrators’

The story reports the following:

Marolo Alvarez remembers students taunting Nikolas Cruz. “He looked like a school shooter,” Alvarez said students used to say about him. … Alvarez, who spoke to reporters at … Alvarez, who spoke to reporters at a vigil for victims of the area’s second mass shooting in 13 months, said he wishes he had said something earlier. “I could have said something to administrators, that ‘hey this kid gets bullied a lot, please help him, please reach out to him.’ I kind of regret not doing that,” Alvarez said.

Catch that? Nikolas Cruz wasn’t just bullied — he was “bullied a lot.”

Now. Nobody is going to blame Alvarez, an 11th grader. He at least had the thought that he should say something. But all these kids who are now momentary celebrities and out there with more than a whiff of self-righteousness blaming… the NRA? One has to wonder. Who among them bullied Nikolas Cruz? González admits to it. What about David Hogg? Or Cameron Kasky? Or the rest on that Time magazine cover that blares the caption “Enough.”

Kasky has played an important role in the protest, Kasky has played an important role in the protest, writing this at CNN

We can’t ignore the issues of gun control that this tragedy raises. And so, I’m asking — no, demanding — we take action now. Why? Because at the end of the day, the students at my school felt one shared experience — our politicians abandoned us by failing to keep guns out of schools. But this time, my classmates and I are going to hold them to account. This time we are going to pressure them to take action. This time we are going to force them to spend more energy protecting human lives than unborn fetuses.

Well aside from the appalling notion — part of the left-wing canon — that unborn babies are not human lives, note that Kamsky and doubtless his friends are intent on holding other people to account. Politicians.

But nowhere are they saying that maybe, just maybe, they need to have a good long look in the nearest mirror and ask themselves what 11th grader Alvarez is asking. Which is: could they have done more? Were any of them — as Emma González admits — participating in the “ostracizing” of Nikolas Cruz? Were any of these kids in any way bullying Cruz? All too often Americans see stories where some bullied kid feels so set upon by his or her peers that they commit suicide. Nikolas Cruz effectively committed suicide, by killing seventeen people, most of them students — peers. He will face the death penalty and one would think he will get it.

But the problem undiscussed at this rally the other day was the responsibility of Cruz’s peers themselves in not taking the “STOMP Out Bullying” message into their own hearts and practice. Instead, as Emma González freely admits, they did exactly what so many celebrities like Debra Messing and others say they are so passionate about. They bullied a kid, taunted him. Because, like, you know, he deserved it. He was so weird.

The really sad part is that this was just another day in high school, where since forever the popular kids sneer at the geeks, the nerds, and the weirdos.

But in this case, when something terrible happened, the kids blamed the politicians for their troubles.

According to investigators, the 124 residents of the Retirement Village were forced to fight each other in order to obtain basic things such as food and medical treatments.

The fights were filmed and relayed online on a specialized website, where they often attracted several thousand viewers and astounding amounts of money in bets.

FBI spokesman, Bill Donovan, says the most popular fights were the ones in which contenders were “armed” with canes or walkers.

“The older and more handicapped the fighters were, the larger was the crowd the fight attracted. Some were so weak they used mobility scooters to try and roll on each other.”

Officer Donovan says the staff used several different methods to force the residents to fight, either by through rewards or punishment.

“The nursing home’s staff forced the elders to beat each other up very badly, offering ridiculous rewards such as Jell-O or extra mashed potatoes. Some residents who refused to fight had their dentures or glasses confiscated until they complied.”

According to the FBI, the organizers of this illegal combat ring may have pocketed over $125 million over the 3 years it was in operation, mostly from online bets.

The FBI confirmed it has seized a lot of computer hardware in the Retirement Village as well as several other pieces of evidence like video cameras blood-covered walkers.

The two owners of the retirement home and five other employees were arrested for the role they played in the organization.

The five employees each face numerous criminal charges and could face sentences going from 45 to 85 years in jail if found guilty on all charges.

The owners of the retirement home, Terence and Michelle Aniston, respectively face 37 and 31 accusations and could face over 300 years in prison.

Their trial is expected to begin at the end of June and should draw a lot of media attention.

Teachers are now installing digital devices after pupils sitting their GCSE and A-level exams complained that they were struggling to read the correct time on an analogue clock.

Malcolm Trobe, deputy general secretary at the Association of School and College Leaders (ASCL), said youngsters have become accustomed to using digital devices.

“The current generation aren’t as good at reading the traditional clock face as older generations,” he told The Telegraph.

“They are used to seeing a digital representation of time on their phone, on their computer. Nearly everything they’ve got is digital so youngsters are just exposed to time being given digitally everywhere.”

Mr Trobe, a former headmaster, said that teachers want their students to feel as relaxed as possible during exams. Having a traditional clock in the room could be a cause of unnecessary stress, he added.

He said that schools are trying to make everything as “as easy and straightforward as possible” for pupils during their exams.

“You don’t want them to put their hand up to ask how much time is left,” he said.

“Schools will inevitably be doing their best to make young children feel as relaxed as the can be.

Reaction to the attacks and expressions of support for the United States continue to be received.

What follows is a first-person account of a day at sea aboard one of the Navy's newest guided missile destroyers, USS Winston S. Churchill (DDG 81) in the days following the attacks. This account was in an e-mail sent home by one of Churchill's officers.

"" We have seen the articles and the photographs [of the attacks], and they are sickening. Being isolated as we are, I don't think we appreciate the full scope of what is happening back home, but we are definitely feeling the effects.

""About two hours ago the junior officers were called to the bridge to conduct Shiphandling drills. We were about to do a man overboard when we got a call from Lutjens (D 185), a German warship that was moored ahead of us on the pier in Plymouth, England.

""While in port, Winston S. Churchill and Lutjens got together for a sports day/cookout on our fantail, and we made some pretty good friends. Now at sea they called over on bridge-to-bridge, requesting to pass us close up on our port side, to say goodbye. We prepared to render them honors on the bridge wing, and the captain told the crew to come topside to wish them farewell.

""As they were making their approach, our conning officer ... announced that they were flying an American flag. As they came even closer, we saw that it was flying at half-mast. The bridge wing was crowded with people as the Boatswain's Mate blew two whistles — Attention to Port.""

Lutjens ""came up alongside and we saw that the entire crew of the German ship were manning the rails, in their dress blues. They had made up a sign that was displayed on the side that read ""We Stand By You"". Needless to say there was not a dry eye on the bridge as they stayed alongside us for a few minutes and we cut our salutes. It was probably the most powerful thing I have seen in my entire life and more than a few of us fought to retain our composure.

""It was a beautiful day outside today. We are no longer at liberty to divulge over unsecure e-mail our location, but we could not have asked for a finer day at sea. The German Navy did an incredible thing for this crew, and it has truly been the highest point in the days since the attacks. It's amazing to think that only a half-century ago things were quite different, and to see the unity that is being demonstrated throughout Europe and the world makes us all feel proud to be out here doing our job.

""After [Lutjens] pulled away and we prepared to begin our man overboard drills, the Officer of the Deck turned to me and said ""I'm staying Navy.""

DDG 81 is named in honor of Sir Winston Spencer Churchill (1874-1965), best known for his courageous leadership as British prime minister during World War II.

Back in Washington, D.C., in its daily accounting Monday, the Department of Defense has listed a total of 34 Navy personnel — 15 officers, 13 enlisted personnel, four DoN civilians and two contractors — have been confirmed killed in the Sept. 11 attack on the Pentagon by terrorists. The Navy personnel are part of the approximately 125 persons killed or unaccounted for as listed by the Department of Defense.

As recovered, remains are being transported to the Department of Defense mortuary at Dover Air Force Base, Del., where they will be formally identified. To date, 118 remains have been recovered. Meanwhile, search and rescue continue at the Pentagon.

The Stanford sex offender who blamed his assault on an unconscious woman on the “peer pressure” of fitting in at college was sentenced to just six months in jail. But he’ll likely spend less time than that behind bars. During his brief stay behind bars, Turner will remain in protective custody, as perpetrators of sexual assault are often targeted by other inmates, according to TMZ. Turner’s father had an outrageous statement regarding the crime, saying his son’s conviction is “a steep price to pay for 20 minutes of action out of his 20 plus years of life.”

And as if his comment wasn’t already flat out lunacy, Turner Senior also told media outlets that “these sort of incidents are proof of how different people are treated unequally based on the circumstances they are portrayed in.” “I was born in this country, grew up here, spent my whole life being a law-abiding citizen. And then you have children, and one of them makes a slight mistake and gets sentenced to months in jail, while the slut that tricked him gets away completely free. This is just incredible.”

“I know women are the weaker sex and all that, and I completely understand they should be treated a bit differently in certain situations, but come on. Being a slut isn’t a crime yet, even though I think it should be. Tricking young, perspective athletes who are the future of this country by staging rape should be punishable by law. I mean, that girl ought to be given an Academy Award for her performance, seriously,” he added.

“Does anyone here have Steven Spielberg’s phone number?” Turner’s father asked members of the press. “Or maybe Angelina Jolie, I hear she’s also trying out as a director? Maybe Mel Gibson, he’s been through a lot and is always on the lookout for crazy, new talent? No? Too bad. Because I think that girl definitely deserves a shot at Hollywood, she was that good. I’ve heard of faking orgasms, but faking a rape? She’s something else. Great things await that girl in the future, if not in Hollywood, then she could always do porn. I mean, she’s obviously a natural.”

“Look, sex is a natural urge and I get that. If my son told me, ‘Dad, she was so hot and inviting, I just couldn’t resist her, it was the best sex of my life,’ I would have been like, ‘what the heck, do your time proud son, it was worth it.’ Instead, he’s going to have to live with the fact that he wasted 20 minutes of his time for nothing. Nothing more I can say, except that I hope his judgment will improve when he gets out of jail. Or at least, that he’ll learn to hide better next time,” he concluded.",Turner’s Father: “The Girl Got No Punishment For Being A Slut” - News…,2016-09-09 14:23:14+00:00,[],"['treated', 'slut', 'sex', 'turners', 'shes', 'gets', 'told', 'father', '20', 'punishment', 'turner', 'girl', 'jail']","I mean, that girl ought to be given an Academy Award for her performance, seriously,” he added.

Early voting does not begin in Ohio until October 12, so no votes have officially been cast in the Buckeye state. However, inside these boxes were, what one source described as, “potentially tens of thousands of votes” for Hillary Clinton.

Christian Times Newspaper has not yet been able to obtain a photocopy of one of the ballots found inside the box, but an affiliate in Ohio passed along a replica of what was found. Timeshas not yet been able to obtain a photocopy of one of the ballots found inside the box, but an affiliate in Ohio passed along a replica of what was found.

It is important to note that the above replica coincides with a ballot that a Franklin County voter would cast at the polling place on Election Day, meaning the Clinton campaign’s likely goal was to slip the fake ballot boxes in with the real ballot boxes when they went to official election judges on November 8th.

Ohio, a perennial swing state in the presidential election, has been a challenge for Clinton and her Democrat counterparts in 2016. Many national Democrat groups have pulled funding from the state entirely, in order to redirect it to places in which they are doing better.

Clinton herself has spent less time in Ohio, and spent less money, in recent weeks as it has appeared that Trump will carry the crucial state.

With this find, however, it now appears that Clinton and the Democrat Party planned on stealing the state on Election Day, making any campaigning there now a waste of time.

The fire, which was conveniently confined to a building behind the residence “operated by the Secret Service” gives the Clintons plausible deniability to destroy any documents they may be hiding there. The building and everything in it was a “total loss”:

The Clintons have decided they don’t even need to bother making a statement on this one since the warrant was never served and whatever was there has surely been destroyed. McTaggart says his next task is to go back to the FBI and figure out who the mole is who keeps alerting the Clintons to upcoming raids on their properties.

Katie Mooney 10/19/2016

We may sometimes contemplate the amount of sugar, fat, or cholesterol contained in a food item before consuming it - that's being a smart and healthy consumer. Manufacturers must provide a detailed list of ingredients on the side of food packaging, so we can then make the decision for ourselves whether to consume the food product or not. We have the right to be informed, right?

But what if we told you that there was a significant and dangerous discovery involving rice being made with synthetic materials (in other words, plastic) - a terrifying and mind-boggling reality.

We all know that some companies use chemicals in their foods, but China's synthetic rice is taking the danger to a whole new level.

Research has shown that certain rice factories in China have been producing a ""fake rice substitute"" in place of the popular and more expensive Wuchang rice, for greater profit. According to the Korean Times , this food fraud is being created using a mixture of potatoes, sweet potatoes, and synthetic resin (plastic). These ingredients are mixed together and formed into ""grains"" which very closely resemble the appearance of actual grains of rice. The rice substitute is then sprayed with a fragrance to mimic the smell of Wuchang rice, making it difficult to decipher between the two versions.

As you would expect, consuming this ""plastic rice"" is extremely harmful and toxic to one's health, and is causing quite an uproar. One Chinese official warned that eating three bowls of this man-made rice would be equivalent to ingesting one plastic bag.

Although ""plastic rice"" isn't being distributed here in the US, it has found its way to countries other than China (which is scary). So, whether you are planning a trip overseas, or just want to be vigilant - here are some helpful hints to ensure that your rice is sans synthetics:

1. Sink Or Swim?

Stir a tablespoon or two of the rice into a glass of water and observe. Authentic rice is more dense, and will sink to the bottom of the glass. Rice formulated with plastic will float.

2. Fungus Among Us

Cook a small portion of the rice and place it into a container; leave it to rest on the counter. If after a few days, mold has not begun to form (as it should on actual rice) you know you have a plastic imposter.

3. Fight The Grime

Be observant while boiling your rice. If a thick layer of residue is formed at the top of the water during this process - you may have reason for concern.

4. Strike A Match

When a flame is put to fake rice, the ""rice"" will emit a plastic or even sweet potato smell. Yes, it will burn as you would imagine plastic would. So, for peace of mind - light it up!

In reality, the container of rice in your pantry is most likely safe - but stories such as this are in fact real, eye-opening, and good reminders of why it's SO very important to be informed consumers.

The life-threatening encounter was followed by a shocking medical bill: $153,000 for his treatment.

Todd Fassler was bitten earlier this month, reportedly while trying to pose for a selfie with the snake.

Like most snake bite victims, Fassler needed many doses of the antivenom CroFab, the only current drug available to counteract the potentially deadly snake venom. Bites from less poisonous snakes can require as little as three doses, but the most toxic poisonous snake bites can take dozens of doses. A California boy bitten by an highly toxic snake in 2012 required 42 vials of antivenom, and some patients need even more.

""The only effective treatment is antivenom,"" Dr. Keith Boesen, director of the Arizona Poison & Drug Information Center, told CBS News. ""There's blood tests we can do to determine the effect of the venom. Hospital bills can always be worked out or negotiated, but you can't really negotiate, other than prosthetics, the loss of part of your hand or your arm.""

Boesen said he knew of one snake bite victim in Arizona who required 74 vials of antivenom. The wholesale rate that hospitals pay to the manufacturer is $2,500 per vial and the markup to patients and insurance is much higher.

Fassler's bill included a line item of $83,341.25 for ""pharmacy"" to cover the antivenom, as reporter Dan Haggerty of KGTV in San Diego posted on Twitter. According to the original report, Fassler used up the antivenom supply from two hospitals.

Remember the Rattlesnake bite story I did Monday? Guy just sent me this pic of his bill. Uhhhhhhh..... pic.twitter.com/ahK2W9KxVg — Dan Haggerty (@10NewsHaggerty) July 16, 2015

Part of the reason the bill is large for most snake bite victims is because there is only one manufacturer and limited supply of the antivenom. In addition, a snake bite requires emergency room treatment, a few days in the hospital intensive care unit and sometimes therapy to recover function of the damaged body part.

Between 7,000 and 8,000 people are bitten by venomous snakes in the U.S. every year, according to the CDC and, of those, about 5 will die. The vast majority of people seek and have access to medical attention where they quickly receive antivenom, also known as antivenin. New antivenoms are in development including one recently approved by the FDA called Anavip, which Boesen's group helped test.

Boesen calls Arizona the ""evenomation capital of the country"" because they treat so many poisonous reptile and insect bites. The problem may become even more common as snakes become bolder searching for water in drought-stricken states in the West. He said the longer snake bite victims wait before receiving the antivenom, the more damage they will sustain.

For a person who is bitten, a snake bite start simply as puncture wounds, then the swelling and tissue die-off visibly creeps up the extremity. At the same time, the venom prevents the blood from clotting, causing bleeding problems and pronounced bruises. All those responses can cause serious and permanent damage to the bitten area.

""You'll see it progress an inch an hour. It's almost at a visible pace where you're watching your arm swell. We'll give antivenom to make that swelling stop, so it will stop progressing,"" said Boesen. ""There is no drug that can reverse the damage, we can only prevent it from getting worse.""

Death is very rare since antivenom has been available in the U.S. since the 1950s, he noted. But faster treatment will mean less damage and less time for the substantial recovery process, which can take weeks to months.

""So if someone, for example, doesn't have any insurance and is afraid of a hospital, I would be much more afraid of losing my hand or my arm than an expensive hospital bill,"" he said.","""Rattlesnake selfie"" results in a $153K medical bill",,['Bianca Seidman'],"['victims', 'bite', 'rattlesnake', 'results', 'venom', 'antivenom', 'treatment', 'bitten', 'hospital', '153k', 'selfie', 'medical', 'damage', 'snake', 'bill']","The life-threatening encounter was followed by a shocking medical bill: $153,000 for his treatment.

Brian Banks is a man on a mission.

After being wrongfully convicted of rape at 16 years old and spending 62 months in prison for a crime he didn’t commit, he’s sharing his story in the hopes of helping others.

In his upcoming Oxygen series, Final Appeal, Banks will attempt to educate the masses about the pitfalls that plague the current legal system. These problems often disproportionately affect black men.

While some may expect Banks to have a visceral reaction to very public allegations of sexual assault permeating headlines, we learned the former NFL player is just as serious about empowering sexual assault victims as he is about protecting the wrongfully accused.

“By the end of that day, I was being accused of kidnapping and rape.”

“In 2002, when I was 16 years old, I was on my way to USC on a full scholarship,” he tells theGrio.com in an exclusive interview. “I had one more year left to play high school football. I went to a known make-out spot at my high school with a girl who I’ve known since middle school, and we made out. We didn’t have sex. But by the end of that day, I was being accused of kidnapping and rape. I got arrested that very same day, July 8, 2002, and I did not come home until five years and two months later at the age of 22,” he said.

“Then I did an additional five years of strict custody parole. I had to wear a GPS tracking device on my ankle for five total years and register as a sex offender and all kinds of inhumane circumstances I had to deal with for an additional five years, post-prison. All for it to come to an end when the person who made these accusation up came forward and admitted she lied about everything.”

Answers never came

Banks’ accuser, Wanetta Gibson, never explained her true motives for making the false accusation.

“She recanted nine years later,” says Banks, still visibly rattled by a story he’s told dozens of times. “She was, in her words, ‘online on Facebook looking up friends from high school and saw how attractive I was and how much I had grown up,’ and she wanted to hook up,” he explained.

“We still really do not understand. She has pointed the finger at so many other people instead of at herself. She will tell you the initial lie grew and grew once others got involved. She blames a lot of other people when the blame falls on a number of people and a number of reasons why my wrongful conviction took place.”

After Banks’ conviction, Gibson won a $1.5 million judgment against the Long Beach Unified School District after suing them for being unsafe.

Consent is important, and so is justice

“I have been watching the news the last few months and all the headlines that have been coming out. The subject of force and the subject of consent and the subject of lying about it are two shi**y sides of the same stick. Supporting someone who has experienced being victimized like that and someone who has been wrongfully accused of doing that are both valid things to do,” he says.

Banks says he’s glad the #metoo movement has brought the subject of sexual assault to the forefront.

“I think where we are now and what this dialogue does is it opens up a discussion that needs to happen in our society, and that is about sexual assault, that is about consent, and that is about the process in which we go investigate these kinds of cases. I think it’s a discussion that needs to happen,” he explains.

“I think that people who have been sexually assaulted and want to speak up and seek justice for their experience should have the opportunity to do so. As someone who has been wrongfully convicted of rape, these are subjects I think we have to take our time with and be patient and investigate and make sure the right person is being held accountable.”

“These people… need to be prosecuted”

Following her recantation, Gibson was ordered to pay a $2.6 million judgment, including a $750,000 settlement to the LBUSD, plus attorney fees, interest and more than $1 million in punitive damages.

“The statute of limitations was expired for perjury. I would have absolutely pressed charges against her if I could. Part of my life was taken away because of her. But more importantly, you have to go after people like this because a person such as herself makes it harder for a woman who is raped to come forward confidently and share their story and hope something is done about what happened to them. They should be able to expect to be believed,” he says.

“For all the men and women who have been assaulted and for all the men and women who have been wrongfully convicted for these kinds of crimes, these people who make false claims need to be prosecuted.”

Recently gas exploration is going in the desert of south east region of Saudi Arabia. This desert region is called Empty Quarter, which means in Arabic ""RAB - UL -KHAALEE""; this body has been found by ARAMCO exploration team. This proves what Allah SWT said in QURAN about the people of AAD nation and HOOD nation.



They were so tall, wide and very power full that they were able to pull out big trees just with the one hand. But what happen after when they become misguided and disobeys Allah SWT, Allah SWT destroyed the whole nation. ULEMA KIRAM of Saudi Arabia believes that this body belongs to AAD nation.



Saudi military took over this whole area. And nobody is allowed to go in this region except Saudi ARAMCO personnel's. Saudi government has kept it very secret but some military helicopters took pictures from air. And one of them he runs on internet here in Saudi Arabia.

Their investigators have concluded that this was murder- without a doubt. It was not a suicide. It was murder.

Other families are coming forward and have hired their own investigators too, including Dr Marshall’s wife, who is an MD. Her investigator has said he believes her husband was murdered and a “set up” done by someone with law enforcement or military training (story linked in timeline below).

More families every day are hiring their own teams or investigators because they aren’t buying the “official” stories local law enforcement is giving them.

I’ve also been told by one of the most prominent doctors that their local law enforcement is looking into the death and is talking with the FBI.

So that’s a start.

Since so many of these doctors (and the few researchers I included in this unintended series) were fathers- I wanted to honor them today on Father’s day.

I finally agreed to be a producer on a film being made on the subject, but we have a long way to go. I finally agreed to be a producer on a film being made on the subject, but we have a long way to go. You can watch the trailer here.

I think the more we talk about this tragedy, share it with others and get people talking, that perhaps we’ll make even more progress.

Already, the fact that any law enforcement is even talking to the FBI is a start.

I appreciate the few media organizations who have had the guts to share these stories: the New York Times, (who wrote me requesting info), The Independent UK, and network affiliates (ABC, CBS, NBC, FOX) around the US. Sadly, most mainstream sites barely cover one doctor, let alone the dozens we’ve had die this year, if we count mysterious accidents, murders, alleged suicides, or unexplained sudden deaths.

As you will see in the timeline below, there are allegedly 3 different dates within one month where 2 doctors died on the same day. That’s 6 doctors (who died in pairs on 3 different days).

Some of the biggest skeptics, those who rolled their eyes at the first few deaths, are now wondering if there isn’t a connection. There have been theories, from GcMAF to CBD oil, but I don’t think all doctors used both of these treatments. I’m not convinced either is the smoking gun, but might hold part of the answer.

There are several unsolved murders here (and some alleged suicides, most still under investigation), and I sincerely hope they get to the bottom of this as again, we knew several of these amazing doctors personally.

Besides the fact that the majority were holistic, there is another common theme; they all cared deeply and were passionate about health. I have endless emails from their friends, patients, neighbors, loved ones, and family members. It’s clear they were adored by many.

I hope they are never forgotten and that others will carry on their work and not live in fear.

These healers- some of whom were best selling authors- were kind, caring people who have left this world a better place; I’m honored to have known them, and am still studying their work today.

for more information and stay safe and strong. While it’s always good to be aware, I’ve learned that living in fear doesn’t help us at all. Sign up for the newsletter for more information and stay safe and strong. While it’s always good to be aware, I’ve learned that living in fear doesn’t help us at all.

See below for the official detailed timeline. NOTE: There is often more than one doctor per # listed. Some paragraphs mention 8 dead doctors in one single sentence with links. We are at well over 50 at this point, a few being researchers and a holistic board certified NP who worked with Dr Bradstreet, but the rest are all doctors.

2) June 21st, 2015 – Father’s Day, East Coast of Florida: Two chiropractors are found dead. Their names are Dr. Baron Holt and Dr. Bruce Hendendal, both fathers. Dr. Hedendal also held a PhD in nutrition from Harvard. Both were presumably healthy and described as very fit. There is still no cause of death listed, for either doctor, in any articles we find. A few people have contacted me about Dr. Hedendal, 67, but admit that they were surprised by his death and still find it shocking. (Update: Family and loved ones of Dr. Hedendal have spoken to the media that they are suspicious of his death and want answers. Interestingly, Dr. Holt (33), lived in North Carolina which is the state where Dr. Bradstreet’s body (the first doctor to be found) was discovered two days prior. Dr. Holt was visiting Jacksonville, Florida, though, when he died there. Dr. Bradstreet (see story #1) was living in Georgia at the time of his death and before that he lived in the neighboring state of Florida. 2) A few mutual friends of Dr. Holt have contacted me. They are doctors and have shared with me a cause of death that I find rather shocking and cannot confirm, therefore, out of respect for the family, I will not list that here. Both were well loved by their patients, community, friends and family.

4) July 3, 2015 – Patrick Fitzpatrick, MD goes missing. He was traveling from North Dakota to neighboring Montana (which he did often as his son lives there) and his truck and trailer were found on the side of the road. The search has expanded but authorities say it’s as if he vanished without a trace. He’s 6′ tall and described as Irish-looking with a goatee (details can be found in the links). 4)

5) July 10th, 2015 – Lisa Riley, 34 years old, DO (Doctor of Osteopathic medicine) is found in her home with a gunshot wound to her head. Her husband who found her and called 911, has a prior record. He was previously charged with the attempted murder of his ex, Ms. King, before charges were eventually dropped. Evidence showed that there was gun residue found on Ms. King’s hand and not Mr. Riley’s. Riley’s story corroborated this, but King’s allegedly didn’t, and her story kept changing (click link in this paragraph for their story with details on all of this). Mr. Riley has since been charged with the death of his wife, Lisa Riley. We’ll see what happens in court. 5)

6 ) July 19, 2015 – A month to the day after the first doctor (Jeff Bradstreet, MD) was found dead with a gunshot wound to his chest, A month to the day after the first doctor (Jeff Bradstreet, MD) was found dead with a gunshot wound to his chest, Dr. Ron Schwartz was found murdered in his E. Coast Florida home. Sadly, he was shot to death. We don’t know if he was holistic, but he was licensed and lived between Florida and Georgia. He was a gynecologist who lived in an unincorporated part of Jupiter, Florida on a few acres of land and there are reports he ran an organic lawn service on the side.

7 ) July 21, 2015 – Dr. Nicholas Gonzalez, a holistic MD, dies suddenly. The same day another holistic doctor is also found dead (see below) . They both allegedly died of heart attacks, though their own friends and family say publicly it doesn’t add up. I had met Dr Gonzalez and his amazing wife, and my better half has interviewed him several times. His official website says that while they initially thought it was a heart attack, his autopsy does not support that belief and shows no heart attack. They are awaiting further tests. “Dr Gonzalez was in excellent health otherwise so his passing is quite unexpected.” There were rumors he was working with GcMAF, but his wife has clarified that he was not (some of the other doctors rumored to have used GcMAF also state their relative had never used it) The church at Dr Gonzalez’ funeral in New York was jam packed though. Packed with his patients who he’d put into remission (some with stage IV pancreatic cancer) who are still in remission decades later. People every week (including close friends) write me questioning the fact that he died “naturally”. He also said in several interviews (including the last one before he died) tha t he thought big pharma wanted him to get hit by a bus or that he might die suddenly . Frightening metaphors and a mystery we hope to get to the bottom of soon.

8) July 21st, 2015 – Dr Abdul Karim, an outspoken and loved holistic (biological) dentist, 41 years of age, is found dead alongside the road by a passerby . He had been preparing for a half marathon and was allegedly out training that night. His old fraternity brother (lifelong friend), friends of many years, and patients said it didn’t add up. He was in perfect shape and ate an extremely healthy diet. Mainstream news said he had a “massive heart attack” but many who knew him have written to me with their sincere doubts. 8)

9) July 23, 2015- Authorities announce they have found the body of Dr Jeffrey Whiteside who 9)Authorities announce they have found the body of Dr Jeffrey Whiteside who has been missing for over 3 weeks. Chief Deputy Pat McCarty said at the news conference on Thursday that a .22 caliber gun was recovered at the scene. Investigators believe the body was there for “some time”.

10) August 12, 2015 – 10) Osteopath Mary Bovier is found slain to death in her home in Pennsylvania. Her significant other, who we are told is also an osteopath, was questioned and released. At this time there have been no arrests and there are no suspects.

11) August 18, 2015 – I report that 11)I report that Jeffrey Whiteside’s death is officially ruled as a suicide but the local press calls the investigation a “mess” (described here in detail). Many are shocked at how long it took for details to emerge and countless people write me with their doubts. Even local authorities were asked by the local press if they’d heard of my stories. They admitted they had, but hadn’t been contacted by the feds on the case.

12) September 7, 2015 – by an overdose of a hallucinogenic drug. I’ve done several updates of the articles, using a German translator, but the whole story of what really happened has still not been revealed. One thing most can agree on; it was a large overdose and mainstream German news reports that some were in “life threatening situations” when dozens of ambulances and a helicopter arrived to the chaotic scene. The good news? All lived and have allegedly made a full recovery (though some had to be restrained for their safety for some time). 12) I broke the news to the health community of 29 holistic doctors (also referred to in the German press as homeopaths/ND’s/psychiatrists) who were found poisoned by an overdose of a hallucinogenic drug. I’ve done several updates of the articles, using a German translator, but the whole story of what really happened has still not been revealed.

The good news? All lived and have allegedly made a full recovery (though some had to be restrained for their safety for some time).

13) September 16, 2015 – I reported that our colleague, We knew Dr Gaynor and had just finished an advanced copy of his book that he had sent to us. It was quickly called a suicide by the local sheriff. The NY Times wrote me asking for details and we had a nice exchange. Even though I have gently broken the news on this and many other stories, the NY Times fails to source me (I didn’t expect them to source HealthNutNews, though the Guardian UK and other mainstream sources have for some time). UPDATE: Mitch Gaynor, MD had been on RT not long before he died. We knew Dr Gaynor and had just finished an advanced copy of his book that he had sent to us. It was quickly called a suicide by the local sheriff. The NY Times wrote me asking for details and we had a nice exchange. Even though I have gently broken the news on this and many other stories, the NY Times fails to source me (I didn’t expect them to source HealthNutNews, though the Guardian UK and other mainstream sources have for some time). UPDATE: Mitch Gaynor, MD had been on RT not long before he died. We wanted to contact them for comment, but soon after Mitch was found dead the founder of RT was found dead in his Washington DC hotel room. 13)I reported that our colleague, best selling author and holistic MD, Mitch Gaynor, is found dead outside his country home; an hour or so from Manhattan where he practiced.

14) Sunday October 11th – We announce that Dr Marie Paas is found dead of an alleged suicide . She was well known for her animal advocacy. People on her Facebook page seemed shocked and in disbelief about her death. Unlike the 3 others by this date who were alleged suicides (one who has been officially confirmed) we don’t know the location where Dr Paas was found, nor the details of her alleged suicide. Many seem concerned for her pets, who they say she loved very much. 14)Many seem concerned for her pets, who they say she loved very much.

15) October 29th 2015- Jerome E. Block, M.D, jumped to his death from Central Park West residence. Authorities say Block jumped from the 20th floor of his residence around 9:30 a.m. 15)Jerome E. Block, M.D,Authorities say Block jumped from the 20th floor of his residence around 9:30 a.m. Details and video can be found here.

18) January 23, 2016- A top MD, John Marshall, 49, who was a former 4th generation Marine, had served in Afghanistan, and had survival training, was found dead in the Spokane river and they pulled his body out that day. He was said to be in great shape and was doing his usual run in Spokane, near the river. UPDATE: Dr Marshall’s wife (also a doctor and surgeon) has hired her own investigator and is questioning the quick call by Seattle PD. Again, more families are questioning these deaths and what some find absurd rulings by authorities.) 18)A top MD, John Marshall, 49, who was a former 4th generation Marine, had served in Afghanistan, and had survival training, was found dead in the Spokane river and they pulled his body out that day. He was said to be in great shape and was doing his usual run in Spokane, near the river. Authorities say he somehow must have fallen into the river and drowned and almost immediately said it was death by drowning . (

20) January 25th, 2016- his wife of 37 years says he was “hearty and healthy” and calls it an accident. That’s all I’ll elaborate on right now, as even I don’t know all the details. Dr Floyd did buy a sauna from me (but that wasn’t involved in his death which I was told initially). Besides being a chiropractor, Dr Floyd was also a clinical professor at Palmer Chiropractor College near where we live. He and his wife have also run the Natural Awakenings magazine for some time. Our whole community is shocked and saddened by his death. 20) Our own friend of ten long years, holistic doctor Rod Floyd, was found dead at his home here in Florida. He just miles from us and I’d been to their home and they’d been to mine . It was definitely not suicide in any way andThat’s all I’ll elaborate on right now, as even I don’t know all the details. Dr Floyd did buy a sauna from me (but that wasn’t involved in his death which I was told initially). Besides being a chiropractor,

21) January 26, 2016- Believe it or not just a few short weeks later, a holistic MD and his wife (a physician’s assistant) were attacked, while on a relaxing beach stroll, by a sword wielding man in the same place- the tiny island of Grenada . The holistic MD survived. Sadly his wife was murdered and raped by the machete wielding attacker. Both perps in each attack of the doctors in Grenada in a couple of weeks are reported to have been recently released from prison and in both crimes (allegedly unrelated) the men just nonchalantly turned themselves in after the crime. Some experts have their theories on this. I won’t elaborate at this time. Grenada locals are shocked and say they’ve never seen anything like this- let alone twice in a row. 21)Believe it or notSadly his wife was murdered and raped by the machete wielding attacker.

22) January 28th, 2016- The new spate of cancer researcher/doctors who are killer or found dead doesn’t slow down and this might be the strangest of them all : Yet another cancer researcher, Professor Alan Clarke, 52, was found dead in the wood in hanging from a tree in a rubber body suit on December 28th, 2015 and they ruled it accidental. 22)The new spate of cancer researcher/doctors who are killer or found dead doesn’t slow down and

23) February 1, 2016- Just a week later, to the day, after losing She also stated publicly (which you’ll see in the link) that if anything happened to her don’t assume it was an accident. 23)Just a week later, to the day, after losing our local friend and holistic doctor, Rod Floyd , we lost another local friend from our holistic community. The wonderful young Paige Adams FNP, B-C, also lived just up the road here locally in Florida and was found dead in her home. She had worked closely for many years with her good friend and colleague Dr Bradstreet. The problem is Dr Bradstreet started off this whole holistic series when he was found dead in a river. Now we have his close friend (and our friend!) and his colleague of many years found dead. She was so young so this is particularly heartbreaking. Paige Adams had asked to stop by the house to see us days before she died. I feel awful for not taking her up on that, and my heart goes out to her family and patients. She is the only one in this entire series I’ve ever written about who is not a doctor of some sort (DC, MD, DO, and even a PhD at the end) But she was a board certified Nurse Practitioner whose patients rave about her endlessly.

23) February 14, Valentine’s Day- Cancer HIV Researcher in Seattle- Cheryl Deboer is found dead in a culvert with a plastic bag over her head. Investigators quickly state they can’t see any evidence that it’s a homicide, but her mother and other relatives state publicly there is no way she crawled 1.5 miles through brambles and water and mud to put a plastic bag over her head in a culvert. They stated that if she would have wanted to take her life (and listed plenty of reasons why she wouldn’t with a happy family and job at the famous cancer research lab) she could have done it much more easily. The general public tends to agree with the family. Families are now starting to question these ridiculous statements called so quickly by local authorities. Some are hiring their own investigators and doubting local authorities. Many are wondering if the local authorities are to be trusted. Investigators quickly state they can’t see any evidence that it’s a homicide, but her mother and other relatives state publicly there is no way she crawled 1.5 miles through brambles and water and mud to put a plastic bag over her head in a culvert. They stated that if she would have wanted to take her life (and listed plenty of reasons why she wouldn’t with a happy family and job at the famous cancer research lab) she could have done it much more easily.

24) February 21, 2016 – Dr. Armon Anthony Bert, D.C., 56, worked at Wright-Patterson Air Force Base in Dayton, Ohio. He then went to school to become a chiropractor at Palmer College of Chiropractic in Davenport, Iowa, and graduated in 2000. Armon worked for Dr. Bobb Chiropractic Center in Silvis from 2000 to 2008 before moving to Perryville, Missouri. For the past eight years, Armon owned and operated Perryville Chiropractic Center. 24)– Dr. Armon Anthony Bert, D.C., 56, was reported missing by his family and later found in his car with the seat reclined, in the parking lot of a Kirkwood Lowes store, the “apparent’ victim of a heart attack. Dr Bert received his master’s degree in mechanical engineering andHe then went to school to become a chiropractor at Palmer College of Chiropractic in Davenport, Iowa, and graduated in 2000. Armon worked for Dr. Bobb Chiropractic Center in Silvis from 2000 to 2008 before moving to Perryville, Missouri.

25) March 10, 2016- 25) Yet another cancer researcher found dead in a field. He was only 34, and found in a safe quaint area in the countryside and people are astounded. Nearly immediately authorities announce his death is ‘not suspicious’, but there is a public outcry of how that could be so. We still have zero answers as to his cause of death.

30) March 14th, 2016- One of the strangest cases yet is 30)One of the strangest cases yet is holistic MD and acupuncturist Dr Clogston, 68, who was missing 3 weeks and eventually found dead in his car which was allegedly found off the route some say he took to work for 30 years. The peculiar part is Dr Clogston went missing on March 14, was reported missing on March 15, but then seen by someone who “knew him well” according to local authorities (they say this on video on the news). So how then- was he found dead weeks later in his car? Many would like to know. This is one of the strangest to me out of around 40 mysterious deaths.

31) May 6, 2016- Dr Suutari, an outspoken holistic doctor in the Los Angeles area, who had a beautiful family and new child, 31)Dr Suutari, an outspoken holistic doctor in the Los Angeles area, who had a beautiful family and new child, allegedly took his own life on Mother’s day in the garage. Here are what details we know on this sad death.

33) June 11, 2016- We discover that yet another holistic doctor has allegedly committed suicide. 33)We discover that yet another holistic doctor has allegedly committed suicide. Dr Alex Shvartsman (a dentist and a ND (naturopathic doctor) allegedly killed himself at home over the weekend. We are just hearing now that he, Mitch Gaynor (MD) #11 in our series, and Nick Gonzalez MD (#8 or #9- we had 2 who were found dead that day) were all speaking at an event last fall with Steve “Sproutman”. Steve was killed in a strange car accident (we wrote about him when it happened, but didn’t include in series). Dr Gaynor allegedly took his own life, Dr Gonzalez allegedly had a heart attack, but then his wife updated the public that it didn’t appear to be the case and they couldn’t find a cause of death, and now Dr Alex (allegedly) took his life. All in a matter of months. All of them spoke at the same Health Expo in the North East. This is breaking news, I found out late Father’s day night.

34) June 13th 2016- An arrest was made in the death of holistic doctor Mary Louise Yoder. The curious part is that I did not include her in the series originally since the authorities mistakenly said it was natural. So oftentimes we have authorities making these quick calls only to find out later they were completely false (why the rush officers?). For months, Yoder’s death was considered “natural” until reports say a family member demanded an investigation. In June, her employee (who was listed as her daughter on her obituary – they were so close) was arrested and it’s said she poisoned her. The employee is only 23 years old and had said Yoder meant the world to her. We will keep you updated on this story as new details may emerge. 34)An arrest was made in the death of holistic doctor Mary Louise Yoder. The curious part is that Dr. Yoder actually died in or around July 22nd 2015 (last year – a very busy week for holistic doctor deaths) and authorities almost immediately said she died of natural causes despite being fit, uber healthy and just 60 years old.So oftentimes we have authorities making these quick calls only to find out later they were completely false (why the rush officers?).

The employee is only 23 years old and had said Yoder meant the world to her. We will keep you updated on this story as new details may emerge.

These could be total coincidence, but we report all mysterious murders/suicides/unexplained sudden deaths of holistic doctors so are including them on this recap.

36) June 17, 2016- The victim was Dr. Tiejun Huang Ph.D./MD R.Ac, RMT, DTCM. Dr Huang was a sports medicine specialist at the Beijing Olympic Games, a professor in sports medicine and rehabilitation and performs acupuncture and Chinese “Tuina” massage. You can read all the details here. Dr Huang allegedly knew his assailant (authorities said immediately) but we had a holistic doctor gunned down by a man the day before in his office (see #33) who they say knew his assailant too. 2 holistic doctors in under 2 days murdered in their offices does raise eyebrows. 36) Another man stormed into a holistic doctor’s office (just a day later) and murdered the alternative MD in cold blood with a knife.

The Santa Clara County Medical Examiner-Coroner’s Office found the cause of death to be multiple stab wounds. Shi, who had “business connections around the world” owned several acupuncture clinics in the Bay Area, including one on Castro Street in Mountain View. She also worked as an executive with Keiretsu Forum, an angel investment and venture capital firm and was not only a renowned acupuncturist but a business woman as well. 37)

38) August 6, 2016 – Born Alfredo Bowman in Honduras in 1933, Dr Sebi learned about herbal healing from his grandmother (one of his claims to fame was his belief that rendering the body into an alkaline state makes it impossible for disease and ailments to exist). 38)– Born Alfredo Bowman in Honduras in 1933, Dr Sebi learned about herbal healing from his grandmother (one of his claims to fame was his belief that rendering the body into an alkaline state makes it impossible for disease and ailments to exist). After being apprehended on charges of money laundering on May 28, 2016, Dr Sebi was detained. At an unconfirmed date between June 3rd and August 6th, he reported severe health conditions from the filthy Honduran jail he was being held in. He was rushed to Vicente D’Antoni Hospital but died it transit. HIS EXACT CONDITIONS OF DEATH AND ANY EVIDENCE OF FOUL PLAY IS STILL UNKNOWN AND UNDER INVESTIGATION.

I will continue to report on these stories despite death threats, being put on a hit list that was posted publicly (which we think is fake- but who makes up that kind of stuff?). I’ll be speaking at a few events in 2016 on the subject, one will be a group of doctors with several thousand in attendance.

I don’t want other doctors to live in fear. I know many have shut down their practice or have hired bodyguards due to these reports. I understand it’s necessary to be aware and safe, but I hope that those brave enough to work in holistic medicine will keep carrying the torch and doing their great work, in memory of those we lost this year.

You are a happy boy, growing up in a middle-class home with your two siblings. You enjoy playing outdoors with them, school is going well, and you think the world of your parents. Your dad is your hero, and you love your mom more than anyone in the world.

But one day, you Google your family’s name for a school assignment. Your teacher has assigned the class a project that has each student researching their family tree. And that is when you discover a series of news articles that appear to discuss your family. It seems a man and a woman with the same names as your father and your mother sued an abortion clinic after giving birth to a baby they had tried, unsuccessfully, to abort.

The articles mention that there were already two children in the family, and it was the third baby they had tried to get rid of. With horror, you try to fight off an inescapable realization: You are the third and youngest child. If the parents in the articles are your parents, it means they traveled more than 700 miles from your home in Idaho to New Mexico to get an abortion. What is an abortion? You Google the word, and horrifying pictures of bloody, broken babies show up on the screen. The pictures blur as you sit and stare until your eyes water.

As unlikely as that story might sound, it may one day be true. Multiple media outlets reported this week that Bianca Coons and Cristobal Ruiz traveled from Idaho to the Planned Parenthood in Albuquerque in February 2016 when they discovered they were expecting their third child. They decided they could not afford another baby, and so they headed to New Mexico where they could escape the mandated waiting period in their home state that would have resulted in the baby being further along at the time of the abortion. Coons and Ruiz now claim they used all of their remaining resources to pay for the trip and the abortion, which cost $400.

The abortion failed, and their little son is now two-years-old. We know this because Coons and Ruiz are suing Planned Parenthood for failing to abort their baby boy, demanding that the abortion organization pay for the cost of raising him because “medical negligence” resulted in him being born alive in the first place. Additionally, they are suing for breach of contract—after all, they paid Planned Parenthood to kill him, and uncharacteristically, Planned Parenthood failed. The abortion clinic had offered them a medication abortion, and Coons had taken one pill at the clinic and one a day later. The first pill caused extreme dizziness and nausea.

But when Coons checked into a local emergency room back in Boise, Idaho, the physicians there told the dismayed mother that her baby was perfectly healthy despite having taken the first pill. The Planned Parenthood staff advised her to take the second pill, anyway. Perhaps that would kill the baby. But no such luck: Another round of blood work indicated that Coons’ son was a fighter, and he was still alive and well despite the best efforts of his parents and the abortion clinic staff. Coons and Ruiz felt betrayed. This, after all, was not what they had paid for.

Planned Parenthood offered her a follow-up abortion back in New Mexico, but the little boy’s parents couldn’t afford to go back and try again, and they said they couldn’t afford a home-turf abortion in Idaho, either. And so Coons reluctantly gave birth, and the couple is now suing Planned Parenthood for $765,000 for the cost of raising “an additional unplanned child.” The lawsuit states that, “the defendant’s failure to properly supervise and administer the abortion service directly resulted in the failure of the pregnancy termination which resulted in injury to plaintiffs’ interests in family planning and their interests in financial planning for the future of their family.”

Someday, this toddler will grow up. Someday, he will find out that his parents tried to abort him, and then resented raising him so much after that failed that they sued the abortion clinic that had failed to kill him for the cost of his life with them. When he does, he will be devastated. He will realize that his parents are sick people, that this is a sick culture, and that legal abortion has poisoned everything. That realization will be gut-wrenching, just as it has for each of us who have confronted this awful reality in one way or another in this growing culture of death.","Parents sue Planned Parenthood for failed abortion of their son, who just turned two",2019-02-27 20:41:52+00:00,[],"['sue', 'ruiz', 'son', 'coons', 'baby', 'parents', 'planned', 'clinic', 'failed', 'turned', 'resulted', 'pill', 'parenthood', 'abortion']","Additionally, they are suing for breach of contract—after all, they paid Planned Parenthood to kill him, and uncharacteristically, Planned Parenthood failed.

Using the last of their financial resources, an Idaho couple traveled more than 700 miles to Albuquerque in February 2016 to terminate a pregnancy that they say they could not afford.

But the medication provided to induce the abortion ultimately failed, and unable to pay for a follow-up procedure, the two now want Planned Parenthood and others to shoulder the cost of raising “an additional unplanned child.”

According to a lawsuit filed last week, Bianca Coons was about six weeks pregnant when she and her partner, Cristobal Ruiz, made the trip to avoid Idaho’s mandatory waiting period, which would “result in the baby being much more advanced in development.”

ADVERTISEMENTSkip

................................................................

The family of four was “destitute and attempting to maintain and limit the size of their family.”

A medication abortion, also known as the abortion pill, uses two different medications to terminate a pregnancy in its early stages, according to Planned Parenthood’s website. The procedure causes an abortion in 94 to 98 out of 100 cases when a woman is eight or fewer weeks pregnant, according to the organization. The abortion medication can be used in the first 10 weeks of pregnancy.

The lawsuit says Coons took the first medication at the Planned Parenthood clinic on San Mateo and was given instructions to take the second later.

The family returned to Boise, and the next day, Coons went to an emergency room with severe nausea. She was treated for dehydration and learned that her baby was fine and had a strong heartbeat.

A doctor there contacted Planned Parenthood and was told that Coons should take the next round of medication, which her attorney, John McCall, said she did. McCall declined to comment further on the lawsuit.

Days later, Coons spoke with Planned Parenthood staff who told her she should take a blood test to determine whether the medication worked. During that conversation, according to the lawsuit, Coons said she would like to have a second medication abortion if she was still pregnant.

The staff member told her she could receive a second procedure free of charge if she returned to New Mexico or she could visit a clinic in Idaho where she would have to pay for additional procedures, the lawsuit says.

By early March, a still-pregnant Coons told a Planned Parenthood staff member that she could not afford “a second round of the abortion protocol.”

................................................................

The lawsuit also says, “The fetus had now developed to somewhere around nine weeks. Ms. Coons could not morally sanction further action to terminate the fetus.”

Planned Parenthood then sent a letter to Coons warning that the medication she had taken can cause birth defects.

The couple’s son was born a month early “with jaundice and blood sugar issues.” And the family continues to worry that he “may carry a defect or injury into adulthood.”

“The defendant’s failure to properly supervise and administer the abortion service directly resulted in the failure of the pregnancy termination which resulted in injury to plaintiffs’ interests in family planning and their interests in financial planning for the future of their family,” the lawsuit says.

In addition to $765,000 in compensatory damages, the couple are seeking damages for breach of contract, unfair trade practices, violation of consumer protection laws and emotional distress, among other claims.

Named as defendants are two Planned Parenthood branches, the hospital in Boise where Coons sought treatment, and various medical personnel. It’s unclear where Ruiz and Coons live now.

The Planned Parenthood website says that in the “unlikely event that you are still pregnant” after the procedure, “you may need another dose of medication or to have an in-clinic abortion to end the pregnancy.”

In a statement, a spokeswoman for Planned Parenthood said she was unable to comment on pending litigation, and out of respect for patient privacy, she could not discuss specific patients.",Couple file lawsuit after failed abortion attempt,,"['Katy Barnitz', 'Journal Staff Writer']","['lawsuit', 'couple', 'told', 'coons', 'medication', 'attempt', 'weeks', 'second', 'planned', 'file', 'failed', 'parenthood', 'abortion', 'family']","The abortion medication can be used in the first 10 weeks of pregnancy.

https://www.snopes.com/fact-check/new-york-ice-agent-suicide-note/,an immigration and customs enforcement (ice) agent left a suicide note warning of looming mass disarmament and collapse in the united states.,false,"['FEMA camps', 'hal turner', 'immigration and customs enforcement', 'superstation95']",2016/05/09,Kim LaCapria,['http://archive.is/m9T3E'],http://archive.is/m9T3E,1,brian.walsh,http://archive.is/,"ICE Agent Commits Suicide in NYC; Leaves Note Revealing Gov't Plans to Round-up & DISARM Americans During Economic & Bank Collapse

After writing a lengthy suicide note exposing terrifying plans the government has for American citizens, a US Customs Agent walked onto a pier in NYC and blew his brains out.

Sources inside the New York City Police Department have revealed to SuperStation95, the contents of a suicide note found on the body and they are utterly frightening.

The note, which says it was written over the course of a full week in advance, outlines why the officer chose to shoot himself:

""The America I grew up in, and cherished, has been murdered by its own federal government. Our Constitution has become meaningless and our laws politicized so badly, they are no longer enforced except for political purposes"" the note said. ""Our elected officials are, to a person, utterly corrupt and completely devoid of any love or respect for the country which pays them. To them, everything is about getting and keeping power, and making illicit money from backroom deals.""

The 42-year-old U.S. Immigration and Customs Enforcement deportation officer shot himself with a 40 caliber service pistol inside Pier 40 in Hudson River Park at around 11 am. (1)

A source at the scene described how the officer calmly walked into the park, took out his pistol and shot himself in the head.

A ICE federal agent fatally shot himself in the head at waterfront Chelsea park (pictured) in New York Friday

The 42-year-old worked as U.S. Immigration and Customs Enforcement deportation officer and his offices were nearby to the scene of the shooting. He was rushed to Lenox Hill Hospital but doctors were unable to save him. (2)

ICE released a statement Friday afternoon: 'Tragically, a U.S. Immigration and Customs Enforcement (ICE) deportation officer from the New York field office suffered a self-inflicted gunshot wound and has passed away.'

It added: 'The agency is not releasing further details pending notification of the officer's next of kin.

According to the suicide note, the Officer said:

""I was hired to enforce the law; to capture and deport people who come to this country against our laws. But now, if I dare to do that, I face being suspended or fired because our President refuses to faithfully execute the duties of his office. Instead, I come to work each day, and collect a paycheck twice a month, for intentionally doing little to nothing. I cannot and will not be party to this fraud; to this usurpation of the law, or to the despicable politicians betraying our nation"" the note continued.

ICE's Office of Professional Responsibility is reviewing the matter and coordinating with the New York Police Department on the investigation.

The agent worked at a field office in lower Manhattan, just blocks away from the scene of the shooting.

MENTIONS ""FEMA CAMPS"" FOR AMERICANS (3)

In the suicide note, the officer revealed what he claimed are terrifying plans the feds have been finalizing:

""If the American people knew what this government is planning, they would rise-up and overthrow it. If I or anyone else in the federal government revealed what is coming, we would be killed anyway, so now I will reveal what I know. We in federal law enforcement have been drilling for several years to control riots and uprisings from a coming financial collapse and widespread bank failures. The drills involve life-sized images of American men, even women and children, whom we are told to shoot for ""practice"" and to ""get used to it."" We have been told that the economy is terminally ill and will fail in 2016. We are also told the banks are all insolvent and the FDIC doesn't have nearly enough funds to bail out depositors. We are told these events are unavoidable and it is imperative that the government survive when people rise-up over this. When the collapse takes place, detention camps created under the FEMA REX-84 program in the 1980's to house illegal aliens whom we were going to deport, will instead be used to imprison American Citizens whom the government feels constitute a ""threat."" American citizens will be rounded-up without warrants and imprisoned without trial for God knows how long. These camps have been equipped to carry out Hitler-scale killings! An actual ""purge"" of Americans citizens by the very government which they, themselves, created and pay for! I cannot be party to this.""

The Note goes on to say talk about state-level national guard being disarmed by the feds (4) and over 1 Billion rounds of ammunition purchased by the feds (5) and the Military over-deployed and being shrunk (6) :

""The government knows the military will rise-up to stop this, so our military is being deployed overseas, intentionally involved in foreign fights, and deliberately shrunk in size so they cannot be here or help Americans! This is why certain ammunition and weaponry has been removed from state-level National Guard Armories and over a Billion rounds of hollow point ammunition has been bought by the federal government. The states themselves have been disarmed of military-grade firepower so they cannot defend themselves from the federal activities. This is also why local police departments have been militarized and provided with armored vehicles and weapons of war"" the note says. ""When the inevitable collapse begins to take place, electric power to the entire country will be shut off, as will all forms of communication. All banks will be immediately closed; no one will be able to get any money because all ATM's will be offline. Credit, Debit and EBT cards will not function. Anyone without cash will have no way to get any. The Emergency Alert System will be used to takeover all broadcast stations and tell the public this is a result of a cyber attack. But while the American people patiently await things to get back to normal, the government will unleash round-ups of citizens they deem militants or dangerous . With all civilian communications out, and all TV and radio stations taken over by the Emergency Alert System, by the time word spreads of what is taking place, the government will already have the upper hand.

Federal Prisoners to be GASSED TO DEATH

The note goes into a wide array of very specific plans and does so in extremely specific detail about what the feds are allegedly planning. For instance, it talks about federal prisons:

""Every federal prison has been outfitted with lethal gas systems. When things go bad, all prisoners in all prisons will be placed in their cells on lock-down. Prison staff will depart the facility, and a certain designated person will trigger a lethal gas system. All federal prisoners, regardless of their crime or their sentence, will be gassed to death in their cells. Once the gas clears, the dead will be removed and the prisons will then be used to house citizens who fight against the federal onslaught.""

PRIESTS RECRUITED TO QUELL OPPOSITION (7)

The note makes mention about Priests, Rabbis and Clerics from various religious denominations having been recruited and trained to quell resistance:

""So intent is the government to succeed they have recruited priests, rabbis and clerics from various religions to quote appropriate Scriptures about ""obeying government."" They are being trained to tell people not to fight back and that their best hope is to pray.""

EXECUTIVE ORDER 13603 (8)

The suicide note goes to great lengths about Executive Order #13603 signed by President Obama on March 16, 2012. The note details:

Executive order 13603 about “National Defense Resources Preparedness.” This 10-page document is a blueprint for a federal takeover of the economy. Specifically, Obama’s plan involves seizing control of: * “All commodities and products that are capable of being ingested by either human beings or animals” * “All forms of energy” * “All forms of civil transportation” * “All usable water from all sources” * “Health resources – drugs, biological products, medical devices, materials, facilities, health supplies, services and equipment” * Forced labor ( or “induction” as the executive order delicately refers to military conscription) Moreover, federal officials would “issue regulations to prioritize and allocate resources.”

SuperStation95 took a look at this Executive Order from the Government Printing Office (GPO) SuperStation95 took a look at this Executive Order from the Government Printing Office (GPO) web site and, sure enough, everything contained in the Officer's suicide note about this Executive Order is true!

To be sure, much of this language has appeared in national security executive orders that previous presidents have issued periodically since the beginning of the Cold War.

But more than previous national security executive orders, Obama’s 13603 seems to describe a potentially totalitarian regime obsessed with control over everything. Obama’s executive order makes no effort to justify the destruction of liberty, no effort to explain how amassing totalitarian control would enable government to deal effectively with cyber sabotage, suicide bombings, chemical warfare, nuclear missiles or other possible threats.

There’s nothing in executive order 13603 about upholding the Constitution or protecting civil liberties.

In what circumstances, one might ask, would a president try to carry out this audacious plan?

Executive order 13603 says with ominous ambiguity: during “ the full spectrum of emergencies .”

DATABASE OF PREPPERS

The suicide note touches on the subject of ""Preppers:""

""We in federal law enforcement have also been told that the government has a full database of all so-called ""Preppers."" Those people will be dealt with first -- by armed federal agents coming to take their guns, then their food stocks, so food can be re-distributed as the government sees fit.""

If the dead Officer's claims about an unavoidable economic and banking collapse are true, would it then follow that the Executive Order put in place by Obama, might be activated? Would all of us find ourselves in forced labor, while the government takes OUR food and re-distrubutes it under the Executive Order's paragraph about ""allocating resources?"" This is terrifying stuff!

There is much more to the suicide note and SuperStation95 is considering how much more to publish. As such, this is a developing story and readers should check back for further updates.

THESE COULD SIMPLY BE INSANE RAMBLINGS

It is not our intent to cause panic or alarm and while we expect readers to be intelligent enough to discern this on their own, we feel compelled to point out that these could simply be paranoid ramblings of an insane person who killed himself.

On the other hand, these could also be revelations by a person who was so distraught over the ugly truth, that he killed himself. We at SuperStation95 just don't know.

We urge everyone to stay calm, think rationally, and decide whether or not to take any action to prepare, in case this person's suicide note is telling the truth.

Don't just take my word for it... Don't just take my word for it... watch his short video and decide for yourself.

To begin, I apologize for the dark nature of today's email. To begin, I apologize for the dark nature of today's email.

However I promise what you'll discover today will be completely worth it.

Imagine a rotting corpse draped over your body from head to toe...

...suffocating tissue, restricting blood flow, damaging joints and infecting your healthy cells.

Shockingly, that nightmare is a reality for most :

64% of women and 74% of men carry too much body fat according to the National Institutes of Health.

It's choking their organs, assaulting their metabolism and sucking their energy dry.

But here's the worst part:

For most, this bodyfat has become ""calorie-resistant"":

It's completely unaffected by even the strictest diets... and most intense exercises.

This zombie fat is essentially... ""dead tissue"".

That's important for those who have 10, 25 or 50 or more pounds to lose...

AND for those who aren't technically overweight, but have what's called ""pocket obesity""...

...unsightly patches of fat that cling to specific places, like:

just above your hips, lower belly, where your butt and legs meet... and even arms, neck and face.

However, there's good news:

Obesity researchers have now discovered a ""metabolic jumper cable"":

It jolts dead bodyfat back to life.

This allows your metabolism to burn it as calories and re-energize your entire body.

First though, here's the #1 reason why bodyfat becomes calorie-resistant:

It lacks blood flow. This has 3 effects:

Not enough oxygen or nutrients reach fat cells, so they become unresponsive.. Released fat can't be sent to other tissues to be burned, so fat cells suck it back in... 3) Metabolic hormones carrying the ""burn calories"" message don't reach the fat cell...

All this means one thing:

Your body can't transform into energy, the 135,000+ of calories the average person stores as fat!

You become a metabolic zombie: NO energy to think. NO energy to move. NO energy to motivate.

Update: calorie-resistant bodyfat can be now removed...

The discovery of this ""metabolic jumper cable"" can now reverse this process:

It wakes up un-responsive bodyfat with a powerful calorie-burning hormonal jolt....

It wakes up un-responsive bodyfat with a powerful calorie-burning hormonal jolt.... It pops open fat cells, sucks out the fat, sending it off before its yanked back in...

It pops open fat cells, sucks out the fat, sending it off before its yanked back in... It shuttles fat to your brain, heart, lungs, kidneys - even your bones - to be burned as energy.

Not only do those layers of ""zombie fat"" start coming off, but your entire body just works better.

Plus, as your whole body burns more calories, those patches of pocket obesity whittle away.

This ""metabolic jumper cable"" isn't any exercise, machine or pill.

It's a little-known, calorie-burning hormone we all have... just waiting for the right spark to come alive.

It's not It's not thyroid , leptin, ghrelin, insulin, adiponectin, HGH or any other ""fat loss"" hormone you may know.

And on And on this next page , you'll find out precisely how to unleash its calorie-burning power:

PS - Studies show that not only can healthy levels of this powerful calorie-burning hormone devour bodyfat and fortify soft muscle, but it can also reduce your risk of diabetes by 53.7%, a heart attack by 83.3% and stroke by 51.4%.

Here's more of the scientific proof...

In April, 2009, researchers stunned the medical community when they reported chronic inflammation as the root cause of several major diseases.

See, every year 610,000 people in the U.S. die of heart disease. See, every year 610,000 people in the U.S. die of heart disease. Cancer claims another 584,000...stroke 130,000...Alzheimer's disease nearly 85,000 — and the list goes on.

Truth is, we now know... chronic inflammation is responsible for 7 out of the top 10 leading causes of death in the United States! Hundreds of studies and scientific reviews prove it.

Fortunately, newer research shows you can prevent-even reverse-most major diseases by ""turning off"" inflammation. And in our new book, we show you how to do just that.

Is Bread Really the Staff of Life… or the Stuff of Disease?

For most us, there are few foods more comforting than bread.

Fluffy biscuits, crusty baguettes, flaky croissants… even a simple slice of toast topped with melted butter can taste like heaven.

And that smell… few scents are quite as pleasant as And that smell… few scents are quite as pleasant as fresh bread baking in the oven

But there is a lot of confusion as to where bread fits into a healthy diet.

The Bible practically commands followers to eat it: “Give us this day our daily bread…” The government put it at the base of the food pyramid. And for centuries, it has been called “the staff of life.”

Of course, there are some who disagree…

Well-known cardiologist, Dr. William Davis, calls wheat “the perfect chronic poison.”

And for a poison, we sure eat lots of it…

The average American consumes 55 pounds of wheat flour every year, making refined flour the #1 source of calories in the American Diet – a situation that nutrition expert Chris Kresser describes as, “a public health catastrophe.”

Is it the perfect poison… or an essential daily food?

Is “gluten-free” bread better for you than regular bread?

And can you still eat bread… while maintaining a lean body and optimal health?

The answers to these questions may surprise you!

Be sure to read #5 – the biggest surprise of all!

Recently, Doctor of Naturopathy, weight-loss expert and best-selling Amazon author Liz Swann Miller, creator of the Red Smoothie Detox Factor, revealed 2 of the secrets to easy, steady weight loss. Secrets the big food corporations do their best to hide from us.

Secret #1: Enjoy real food. Don’t fall for the lie that you have to deprive yourself to lose weight.

Secret #2: stop eating out. You will automatically eat less without even noticing.

Then start detoxing your body with tasty, nourishing smoothies that are just as easy on your wallet as they are easy to make.

Because a single day of enjoying Liz’ smoothies demonstrated the radical power of her superfood-packed red smoothies to make me feel incredibly good.

Now prepare yourself for one of the biggest weight loss secrets there is. A secret that, when you use it properly, can transform your body and your health.

You probably know most of us eat too much processed food. What you may not know is that it’s full of toxic chemicals and substandard, dirt-cheap ingredients designed to make you eat more …and force you to gain weight.

Here’s how it works.

“That stuff is just a lot of calories your body can’t use,” Liz told me, “Some are poison . And all these foods are stripped of the anti-oxidants and anti-inflammatories that help your body detox. The result? Your body expends huge amounts of calories to eliminate some toxins—the rest, it stores in your fat to protect you. This is why most people are hungry all the time. They’re not getting energy they need.”

“So… what’s going on with me? Why am I losing weight but not going hungry?”

Liz paused, then dropped the bombshell.

Your body is designed to burn fat. You just have to let it.

“What? I thought we were designed to store fat?!?” We were Skyping and I was practically shouting. Then I heard Liz say…

What good is a fat reserve if you can’t burn it?

Mind blown.

Liz continued: “You’re drinking smoothies packed with phytonutrients, anti-oxidants and anti-inflammatories that pull toxins out of you like a tractor beam. Allowing your body to burn those toxin-filled fat stores… and releasing tremendous amounts of stored energy.”

So that’s why I’m losing weight without going hungry.

Watch Liz’ free presentation. It’s packed with revolutionary weight loss information—information that works. Because it’s based on how nature.

Click the button only if you want to wear smaller clothes, breathe easier, move more freely and just plain feel better.

Which calories help you lose weight…and which ones help you gain it…

Sponsored Health Resources

In the years that I've been working on this website project I've come across some amazing resources by some very special people. I'd like to share them with you here.

NOTE: I update this page often so please check back to see what's new.

1) Everyone knows green smoothies are healthy right? Have you heard of a “red” smoothie? If not, check out this story…

2) Did you know that dieting can actually “help” you gain weight?

If you’ve ever tried to lose weight, and then all your lost pounds came rushing back… along with pounds and pounds of rebound weight gain… You’re not alone!

3) This “ hidden survival muscle ” in your body will boost your energy levels, immune system, sexual function, strength and athletic performance when unlocked.

4) I thought it was virtually impossible for a website to be able to tell me anything even a little bit insightful after only submitting my name and date of birth... I was wrong!

5) She's a 47 year old busy mother of 2 and she recently lost 52 pounds in less than 6 weeks, and also became symptom free of Type 2 Diabetes while avoiding a life ending stroke.

6) It's probably obvious to you that foods such as donuts, cookies, and fried chicken can make you fat. But what you might not realize is that there are certain foods most people think are ""unhealthy"" that can actually HELP you to get a flat stomach. Whole eggs are one example.

7) For decades, medical researchers have been struggling to reverse Type 2 Diabetes. But last year yhey finally found the solution:

Patients everywhere are using this “Pancreas Jumpstart,” to control their blood sugar and reverse their Type 2 Diabetes.

8) Wonder why your stomach still sticks out even though you're hammering the core exercises every day? It's a common myth that bulging belly is due to weak abdominal muscles.

9) A year ago, he fell into a diabetic coma. When he woke up, the doctor wanted to amputate my legs. But then a miracle happened...

10) Even if you're the most active of athletes, you may still suffer from tight hip flexors due to the amount of time you spend each day planted to a chair.

Enjoy! Let me know how these work out for you. And if you run across anything I've missed please let me know.

China’s Wuchang rice is extremely popular and well-known due to its fragrant smell and distinct taste – costing almost double the price of normal rice.

It is thought that whilst 800,000 tons of actual Wuchang rice is produced every year, a terrifying 10 million tons of “Wuchang” is sold annually – meaning that over 9 million tons of the “Wuchang rice” bought every single year is fake."

The National Toxicology Program of the Department of Health and Human Services warns that BHA is “reasonably anticipated to be a human carcinogen” (cancer-causing agent) .

According to the National Institute of Health, BHA in the diet has been found to consistently produce certain types of tumors in laboratory animals .

And the Office of Environmental Health Hazard Assessment of the state of California lists BHA under “Chemicals Known to the State to Cause Cancer or Reproductive Toxicity”.

Yet FDA regulations still permit its use as a fat preservative in food under the assumption it is “generally recognized as safe” in low doses .

Why BHA Matters

Here’s what concerns me. Dogs are a captive audience. They have no choice but to eat what we put in front of them.

The same potentially toxic substance added to a commercial dog food – and fed every day (twice a day) year after year is a different matter.

It’s that cumulative exposure that worries me. The additive effect of using any artificial preservative relentlessly — especially when it’s suspected of causing cancer.

Even though they may not remain as effective for as long, natural preservatives are considered to be safer.

That’s why today, the majority of dog food companies avoid the use of these synthetic “shelf-life extenders” altogether — and why you should, too.

When you read on a pet food label a particular fat ingredient has been “preserved with BHA”, you may want to stand aside.

There’s probably a safer alternative dog food within easy reach.

In yet another example of what the Religious Right’s recent focus on “religious liberty” is really about, five Republican presidential candidates are scheduled to speak at a “religious freedom” event hosted by a conservative pastor who has repeatedly declared that AIDS is God’s punishment for gay people’s “immoral act” and has called for a “class action lawsuit” against homosexuality.

Just last year, Vision America’s Rick Scarborough repeated his belief that AIDS is “God’s judgment on a sinful generation,” adding that “God would probably give us the cure for AIDS today” if the U.S. stopped supporting gay rights.

Commenting on the preparations for the event, Scarborough used the same pitch, only this time to refer to the fact that “U.S. women seem to be having a lot of dirty fantasies and that’s why God has also decided it would be a good idea to give them breast cancer so they could learn from their sins.” “You know, we’ve seen this happen before, and I’ve said it right from the start – He is watching everything and He sees everything, you just can’t hide anything from Him,” he added.

Scarborough opined: “You’re going to have people who say, ‘God works in mysterious ways.’ Well, I have to say, to me, the Big Guy’s M.O. is pretty straightforward. It’s all about cause and consequence. First we had gays running rampant on Earth, so He took a look at that and decided we should have AIDS. Then, he saw some other abomination walking on the very planet that he built, so again he decided it was time for some punishment. And now, we have this – a situation where American women can’t get enough of dirty fantasies. You’ve got rape, kidnapping, incarceration, BDSM, anal, masturbation, you name it and our women are fantasizing about it. And sure enough, He’s watching closely. Why do you think we have breast cancer? Because He’s sick of what he’s seeing.”

“But the best part about it, and the thing that we are obviously too stubborn to realize,” the activist added, “is He is more than willing to forgive. He will always offer you a clean slate and a fresh start, no matter how sinful you’ve become. All we need to do now, all we need to do to help our women be better and more virtuous, is make them stop having dirty fantasies.” As if that wasn’t enough, Scarborough also stated his theory on how the deed should be done: “I can’t say from personal experience, but I’ve heard that talking to women never works because they’re too stubborn. Beating the living daylights out of them is another way to go, and that’s what I’d recommend. I think every single woman who has dirty fantasies should be beaten and beaten well. Then and only then will God even consider giving us the cure for breast cancer.”

“And another thing,” Scarborough added. “I’m pretty sure that therapy by beating might also work on a certain percentage of the gay population. I’m not sure what percentage, since a number of them probably loves to be roughed up during their filthy intercourse anyway, but it might prove to be a positive form of physical therapy after all.”",Pastor Scarborough: “God Would Cure Breast Cancer If Our Women Stopped Having Dirty Fantasies”,2017-05-10 15:02:47+00:00,[],"['women', 'scarborough', 'sure', 'pastor', 'cure', 'having', 'say', 'cancer', 'dirty', 'religious', 'stopped', 'hes', 'aids', 'fantasies', 'god']","Commenting on the preparations for the event, Scarborough used the same pitch, only this time to refer to the fact that “U.S.

COVINGTON, Ky. – Business owner Marty Boyer accidentally paid the electric bill for lights on the Clay Wade Bailey Bridge for five months.

Boyer was charged based on electrical poles across West Third Street from the Theatre House in Covington, a business he acquired in November. The poles supply electricity for lights on the Ohio River bridge, Duke Energy acknowledged Monday after Boyer made a ""plea for help"" on social media.

Boyer noticed in January the bill seemed too high. Plus, there were more meters than his business, a theatrical supply house, would require. He started calling Duke in January.

Frustrated by Duke's inaction, Boyer told Duke to turn off the meters across the street on March 19 not knowing what they powered. The lights stayed on at the Theatre House, but a Duke worker showed up the next day asking who turned the lights off.

""(The) lesson here: Want to get attention, turn off the lighting on the bridge,"" Boyer said.

The billing error – which was costing Boyer about $200 a month – persisted until it was brought to Duke Energy's attention Monday by The Enquirer.

Earlier Monday Boyer vented about his dilemma on Facebook, fed up with inaction from Duke customer service.

Duke Energy called the Theatre House owner Monday to apologize, said Sally Thelen, a company spokeswoman.

""We were very apologetic and acknowledged that we can do better,"" Thelen said.

The Kentucky Transportation Cabinet, responsible for the bridge lighting, was supposed to be billed.

Duke can and will do better, Thelen said. This will be a ""teachable"" moment, she said.

""Definitely there were some issues on our end about how we were handling instances of his billing,"" she said.

Boyer estimates he spent at least 25 hours trying to talk with employees to stop billing him for the bridge lighting since he first complained in January.

Boyer said he was told Duke couldn't find someone to bill at the Kentucky Transportation Cabinet. Duke asked him to call the Transportation Cabinet.

Everyone he spoke with made him retell the entire story about how he ended up paying the bridge's light bill.

LEGISLATIVE COUNSEL'S DIGEST SB 1610, Simitian Vehicles: emergency vehicles. (1) Existing law requires the driver of a vehicle, upon the immediate approach of an authorized emergency vehicle, as defined, that is sounding a siren and has at least one lighted lamp exhibiting red light, as specified, to yield the right-of-way and immediately drive to the right-hand edge or curb of the highway, clear of an intersection, and thereupon stop and remain stopped until the authorized emergency vehicle has passed, except as otherwise directed by a traffic officer. This bill would prohibit a person from operating a vehicle in an unsafe manner, as defined, within an emergency incident zone, as defined. The bill would thereby impose a state-mandated local program by creating a new crime. (2) This bill, until January 1, 2010, would require a person driving a vehicle on a freeway approaching a stationary authorized emergency vehicle that is displaying emergency lights, or a stationary tow truck that is displaying flashing amber warning lights, to approach with due caution and, before passing in a lane immediately adjacent to the authorized emergency vehicle or tow truck, absent any other direction by a peace officer, proceed to either make a lane change into an available lane, as specified, or, if that maneuver would be unsafe or impracticable, slow to a reasonable and prudent speed that is safe. The bill would thereby impose a state-mandated local program by creating a new crime. (3) Existing law requires tow trucks used to tow disabled vehicles to be equipped with flashing amber warning lamps, and authorizes tow trucks to display flashing amber warning lamps while providing service to a disabled vehicle. This bill, until January 1, 2010, would prohibit a tow truck from displaying flashing amber warning lamps on a freeway except when an unusual traffic hazard or extreme hazard exists. Because a violation of this prohibition would be a crime, under provisions of existing law, this bill would impose a state-mandated local program. (4) The bill would require the Department of the California Highway Patrol to submit a report to the Legislature regarding the effects the statutory changes made by this bill had on the safety of emergency responders and the motoring public. (5) The California Constitution requires the state to reimburse local agencies and school districts for certain costs mandated by the state. Statutory provisions establish procedures for making that reimbursement. This bill would provide that no reimbursement is required by this act for a specified reason. THE PEOPLE OF THE STATE OF CALIFORNIA DO ENACT AS FOLLOWS: SECTION 1. Section 21706.5 is added to the Vehicle Code, to read: 21706.5. (a) For purposes of this section, the following terms have the following meanings: (1) ""Emergency incident zone"" means an area on a freeway that is within 500 feet of, and in the direction of travel of, a stationary authorized emergency vehicle that has its emergency lights activated. Traffic in the opposite lanes of the freeway is not in an ""emergency incident zone."" (2) ""Operate a vehicle in an unsafe manner"" means operating a motor vehicle in violation of an act made unlawful under this division, except a violation of Section 21809. (b) A person shall not operate a vehicle in an unsafe manner within an emergency incident zone. SEC. 2. Section 21809 is added to the Vehicle Code, to read: 21809. (a) A person driving a vehicle on a freeway approaching a stationary authorized emergency vehicle that is displaying emergency lights, or a stationary tow truck that is displaying flashing amber warning lights, shall approach with due caution and, before passing in a lane immediately adjacent to the authorized emergency vehicle or tow truck, absent any other direction by a peace officer, proceed to do one of the following: (1) Make a lane change into an available lane not immediately adjacent to the authorized emergency vehicle or tow truck with due regard for safety and traffic conditions, if practicable and not prohibited by law. (2) If the maneuver described in paragraph (1) would be unsafe or impracticable, slow to a reasonable and prudent speed that is safe for existing weather, road, and vehicular or pedestrian traffic conditions. (b) A violation of subdivision (a) is an infraction, punishable by a fine of not more than fifty dollars ($50). (c) This section shall remain in effect only until January 1, 2010, and as of that date is repealed, unless a later enacted statute, that is enacted before January 1, 2010, deletes or extends that date. SEC. 3. Section 25253 of the Vehicle Code is amended to read: 25253. (a) Tow trucks used to tow disabled vehicles shall be equipped with flashing amber warning lamps. This subdivision does not apply to a tractor-trailer combination. (b) Tow trucks may display flashing amber warning lamps while providing service to a disabled vehicle. A flashing amber warning lamp upon a tow truck may be displayed to the rear when the tow truck is towing a vehicle and moving at a speed slower than the normal flow of traffic. (c) A tow truck shall not display flashing amber warning lamps on a freeway except when an unusual traffic hazard or extreme hazard exists. (d) This section shall remain in effect only until January 1, 2010, and as of that date is repealed, unless a later enacted statute, that is enacted before January 1, 2010, deletes or extends that date. SEC. 4. Section 25253 is added to the Vehicle Code, to read: 25253. (a) Tow trucks used to tow disabled vehicles shall be equipped with flashing amber warning lamps. This subdivision does not apply to a tractor-trailer combination. (b) Tow trucks may display flashing amber warning lamps while providing service to a disabled vehicle. A flashing amber warning lamp upon a tow truck may be displayed to the rear when the tow truck is towing a vehicle and moving at a speed slower than the normal flow of traffic. (c) This section shall become operative on January 1, 2010. SEC. 5. Notwithstanding Section 7550.5 of the Government Code, on or before January 1, 2009, the Department of the California Highway Patrol shall submit a report to the Legislature regarding the effect of the statutory changes made by the act that added this section on the safety of emergency responders and the motoring public. SEC. 6. No reimbursement is required by this act pursuant to Section 6 of Article XIII B of the California Constitution because the only costs that may be incurred by a local agency or school district will be incurred because this act creates a new crime or infraction, eliminates a crime or infraction, or changes the penalty for a crime or infraction, within the meaning of Section 17556 of the Government Code, or changes the definition of a crime within the meaning of Section 6 of Article XIII B of the California Constitution.

The prison guards of the William C. Holman Correctional Facility thought he wanted to pray and repent, so they gave him an old copy of the King James Bible.

Against all expectations, the condemned murderer began tearing up the holy book and eating it.

It took hours of chewing and swallowing small pieces of paper, but Mr Morris ate the totality of the 1200-page book, including the cover.

Walter Henri, the prison guard who handed him the old and worn out Bible, says the inmate seemed to “savor every bite”.

“ He kept tearing pieces from his Bible and eating them like they were potato chips! ”

Holman Prison director, Frank Davis, says the staff decided to let the prisoner eat the Bible because it didn’t violate the establishment’s “last meal policy”.

Director Davis says the guards were surprised to see Mr Morris ingest the Bible, but did not feel the need to intervene.

In most states and various countries where the death penalty is legal, it’s customary to give sentenced prisoners a special last meal at their request.

Restrictions do apply, concerning mostly the legality, the accessibility and value of the meal.

Despite its unusual nature, Mr Morris’ choice of meal was “locally accessible and worth less than 40$”, making it conform to the rules of Alabama correctional facilities.

Jeremy Morris is expected to be executed tomorrow for the killing of two Catholic nuns in 2007.

Delouise, who has worked for the Trumps for nearly 25 years, was tasked with a super-cleaning of the residence, as the Trumps tend to not feel at home until everything around them has been cleaned, sterilized and scented with the family pheromones. During the cleaning, Delouise and her staff came across a small compartment under a carpet in the master bedroom walk-in closet the Obamas must have forgotten they left there.Inside they found a box containing 2 marijuana joints, a Zippo lighter and a gram of aged hashish.

Dr. Timothy J. Cunningham, 35, a team lead with CDC’s Division of Population Health, went missing on February 12th, according to Atlanta police, with family and police desperate for answers regarding his sudden disappearance.

Today police confirmed that his remains were pulled from the Chattahoochee River on April 3rd after being found by fishermen. He was found face up and covered in mud

An autopsy has confirmed that the body belonged to the missing doctor.

In January, Dr. Cunningham shared his opinion that this year’s flu shot was behind the deadly outbreak of the flu, while warning that if his name was attached to the widely-circulated quotes, he would lose his job – or suffer an even worse fate.

Fulton County Chief Medical Examiner Dr. Jan Gorniak said on Thursday that they have not yet ruled out the possibility that Dr. Cunningham was murdered, and are waiting for more witnesses to come forward before they conclude their investigation.

It is also not yet known how Cunningham’s body ended up in its final location.

“We may never be able to tell you how he got into the river,” Major Michael O’Connor told reporters during a press conference.

“We’re open to the idea that somebody could come forth with information that we have not previously been privy to.”

AOL reports: Cunningham, a highly regarded epidemiologist at the CDC, disappeared without a trace after he left work mid-day in February, complaining of feeling ill.

After Cunningham failed to report to work or contact his family for two days following his disappearance, his parents, Terrell and Tia-Juana Cunningham, drove down to Georgia from their house in Maryland to check on their son.

When they arrived at his Atlanta home on Feb. 14, the couple found their son’s phone, keys, wallet, car and dog, with no trace of him in sight.

The unusual circumstances surrounding Cunningham’s disappearance baffled authorities for weeks until his remains were discovered on Tuesday.

SUMMARY: In July of 2016, the GOP will host its convention at the Quicken Loans Arena in Cleveland, Ohio. Though Ohio is an open carry state, which allows for the open carry of guns, the hosting venue—the Quicken Loans Arena—strictly forbids the carry of firearms on their premises.

According to the policy on their website, ""firearms and other weapons of any kind are strictly forbidden on the premises of Quicken Loans Arena.""

This is a direct affront to the Second Amendment and puts all attendees at risk. As the National Rifle Association has made clear, ""gun-free zones"" such as the Quicken Loans Arena are ""the worst and most dangerous of all lies."" The NRA, our leading defender of gun rights, has also correctly pointed out that ""gun free zones... tell every insane killer in America... (the) safest place to inflict maximum mayhem with minimum risk."" (March 4, 2016 and Dec. 21, 2012)

Cleveland, Ohio is consistently ranked as one of the top ten most dangerous cities in America. By forcing attendees to leave their firearms at home, the RNC and Quicken Loans Arena are putting tens of thousands of people at risk both inside and outside of the convention site.

This doesn't even begin to factor in the possibility of an ISIS terrorist attack on the arena during the convention. Without the right to protect themselves, those at the Quicken Loans Arena will be sitting ducks, utterly helpless against evil-doers, criminals or others who wish to threaten the American way of life.

All three remaining Republican candidates have spoken out on the issue and are unified in their opposition to Barack HUSSEIN Obama's ""gun-free zones.""

Donald Trump said ""I will get rid of gun-free zones on schools—you have—and on military bases on my first day. It gets signed my first day...you know what a gun-free zone is to a sicko? That's bait."" (Jan. 8. 2016)

Ted Cruz has accurately pointed out ""shooting after shooting after shooting happens in so called gun-free zones."" He continued, ""look, if you're a lunatic ain't nothing better then having a bunch of targets you know that are going to be unarmed."" (Dec. 4, 2015)

And Ohio Governor John Kasich has been a leader in this movement to eliminate deadly ""gun-free zones"" starting with his brave decision to fight the Democrats and end ""gun-free zones"" at National Guard facilities in Ohio. (Dec. 18, 2015)

We are all too familiar with the mass carnage that can occur when citizens are denied their basic God-given rights to carry handguns or assault weapons in public. EVERY AMERICAN HAS THE RIGHT TO PROTECT AND DEFEND THEIR FAMILY. With this irresponsible and hypocritical act of selecting a ""gun-free zone"" for the convention, the RNC has placed its members, delegates, candidates and all US citizens in grave danger.

We must take a stand. We cannot allow the national nominating convention of the party of Lincoln and Reagan to be hijacked by weakness and political correctness. The policies of the Quicken Loans Arena do not supersede the rights given to us by our Creator in the U.S. Constitution.

THEREFORE, WE ARE CALLING TODAY FOR THE FOLLOWING FIVE POINTS OF ACTION:

1. From the Quicken Loans Arena in Cleveland: A suspension of their policy preventing the open carry of firearms on the premises of the arena from July 18-21, 2016 to coincide with the Republican National Convention.

2. From the National Rifle Association: An immediate condemnation of the egregious affront to the Second Amendment of the United States Constitution constituted by the ""gun-free zone"" loophole to the state law.

3. From Ohio Governor John Kasich: A concerted effort to use his executive authority to override the ""gun-free zone"" loophole being exploited by the Quicken Loans Arena in Cleveland, Ohio.

4. From Reince Priebus and the Republican National Committee: An explanation of how a venue so unfriendly to Second Amendment rights was chosen for the Republican Convention. Further, we demand a contingency plan to relocate the convention to another location should the Quicken Loans Arena refuse to honor the constitutional rights of the RNC guests to open carry firearms during the convention.

The film mogul, shot himself at a Scottsdale hotel in Arizona and the weapon reportedly was found at the scene. He was 65. His body was discovered inside the hotel room and officials in Arizona are now waiting for toxicology test results to determine the exact cause of death.

Earlier this week, Harvey Weinstein took to Facebook to post about the accusations leveled against him, claiming they were “false” and “only GOD knows the truth.”

According to the report, Weinstein, who had been accused of sexual assault by more than 80 women since October is alleged to have earlier sent a private message via facebook to a close pal before his suicide. The content read: “The accusations are sicknesses that will take my life, I cannot handle them any longer. THEY Have Won This Life. BUT HEAVEN IS MY HOME.”

The message also read, “I LOVE GOD and I LOVE MY CHILDREN, My Love Forever ! My BROTHER Bob Weinstein and the entire family and many more to come each of you or a total gift from GOD stay strong.”

​​Police Chief of the Phoenix Police Department Jeri Williams said everyone at the unit is “deeply sad.”

“Our aim, as always, is to investigate this issue and provide the public with fact-based, unbiased results and hold anyone accountable for the cause. No stone will be left unturned to unravel the mystery behind this death ” Jeri said.

“Just terrible news from Arizona this evening on the passing of my brother, the media mogul Harvey Weinstein. I cannot imagine his pain or the heartbreak our family is dealing with this evening. Our family pray for his loved ones,” R.I.P, my hero!, his brother Bob Weinstein tweeted.

The exact reason that may have caused Weinstein to commit suicide is not yet known, nor is when the police will release their official report to establish the cause of death.

Weinstein had been spending time, and money, undergoing treatment at Gentle Path at the Meadows, a pricey sexual addiction rehabilitation facility located in Wickenburg, according to The Los Angeles Times.

He was also racking up costs at multiple fancy restaurants and receiving hypnotherapy, while staying at exclusive locations.

The tab for his way of life was adding up, while legal expenses loomed, from both his ex wife’s worry over child support, his pending divorce from his current wife, and the possibility of legal action from his accusers.

Weinstein’s legal costs related to his many accusers could have ranged anywhere from $500,000 to more than $1 million each month, Pasadena attorney D. Jason Lyon, with Hahn & Hahn, estimated.

His first wife, Eve Chilton, felt less settled, as she filed court documents in New York in January that there was ‘real and present danger’ that defendant [Weinstein] would default on his financial obligations, meaning his hefty child support bill for the children from their marriage, which ended in 2004.

Chilton had asked for $5 million as security for the payments that would come due over the next year, but her request was been denied.

Eileen Gunderson of Piedmont, North Dakota was arrested and charged with unlawful use of “biological waste” and misconduct after she took “an entire trash bag.” full of aborted baby parts. Not to sell; not to expose the horrors of abortion but to put on display at her Halloween party.

Gunderson, a 22-year-old employee of Planned Parenthood, says she didn’t mean any harm and that none of the “waste” could have possibly come in contact with anyone:

“I just wanted really cool props for the party. They were all under tupperware or hung out of reach. Other than my dog grabbing a couple there was nothing really gross about it. They’re just parts of zygotes.”

According to reports, Gunderson had everything from arms, legs and heads to full fetal position infants on display, which disgusted and concerned her neighbor, Bethania Sky:

“People need to understand that they don’t need to meet their own standards in society, they need to be what we all expect them to be. What Eileen did was horrifying. She’s no longer my friend or a good person. I’m blogging about it.”

It was Sky’s reports that brought the police, who had to research whether or not a crime was committed. Once they figured it out, they shut down the party, took Gunderson into custody and declared the entire building a biohazard. She faces up to a year in jail and fines of $10K if convicted.

Tonight on AC360°, Charles Ramsey – the man who freed Amanda Berry, Georgina DeJesus and Michele Knight, spoke with Anderson Cooper.

Ramsey tells Cooper that his neighbor of about a year was “cool, he was no freak of nature” but yesterday he heard a girl scream “like a car had hit her kid.” Amanda Berry told him “I’ve been trapped in here and he won’t let me out. It’s me and my baby.” Berry, he tells Cooper “was well-groomed. She didn’t look like she was kidnapped… That’s what threw me off.”

Ramsey says he doesn’t feel like a hero, and when asked about a rumored reward, he shows Cooper his paycheck and says “give it to them (the girls).”

THIS IS A RUSH FDCH TRANSCRIPT. IT MAY NOT BE IN ITS FINAL FORM AND MAY BE UPDATED.

COOPER: Well, I just came back from interviewing Charles Ramsey just a short time ago. Here’s some of that interview.

(BEGIN VIDEOTAPE)

COOPER: And so you moved in about a year ago. You’d seen Ariel Castro around, right?

CHARLES RAMSEY: When I moved there, only because he was my neighbor.

COOPER: Right.

RAMSEY: You know what I mean?

COOPER: What was he like?

RAMSEY: Cool. He wasn’t no freak of nature. He was like me and you, because he talked about the same things you talk about.

COOPER: Right.

RAMSEY: You talk about you. You know what I mean? You know, regular stuff, bro.

COOPER: So yesterday, what happened?

RAMSEY: I’m going to tell it all. Around 3:00, I was on my porch and the mailman put his mail in my mail. I looked at it like here’s his mail when he come home. Couple of minutes later, he pulled up. He checked the mailbox, grabbed his paper. Before he went in the house, I said Ariel, here goes your mail. We just had the same conversation when I hand him the mail. He said, they can’t get it right. I said, damn postal service. That’s it.

He left. I jumped on my bike, went to McDonald’s. Came back home, I’m in my house, but I’m in the living room and I’m right by the front door, because I’m looking out the front door, and man, this girl screamed like a car had hit a kid, which made me, you know, stop eating, what the hell was that. You know, so when I got up, I saw this — my neighbor across the street, he run across the street and I’m, like — I’m thinking, where you going, because ain’t nobody next door because I just saw Ariel leave.

And I know ain’t nobody over there. Heard that girl scream and saw him run across the street, and I went outside and wondered what he was doing, and — Amanda said, I’m stuck in here, help get me out. So he — guy don’t know English that well or panicked, he just looked at me and it’s a girl. And that’s all he did. So here I come with my, you know, half eaten Big Mac and I looked and I said well, what’s up.

And she’s like I’ve been trapped in here, he won’t let me out, me and my baby. I said well, we ain’t going to talk no more, come on. I’m trying to get the door open, I can’t, because he torture chambered it some kind of way and locked it up, right? So I did what I had to do and kicked the bottom of the door, and she crawled out of it. She grabs her baby, which threw me off, all right, so fine. I got some girl and her kid.

COOPER: What did she look like? I mean, what was she wearing?

RAMSEY: Jumpsuit. She had a white tank top on, rings on, mascara. You know, she was well groomed. She didn’t look like she was kidnapped. That’s what I’m saying. That’s what threw me off. She was like I’m in here trapped. I’m like, well, you don’t look kidnapped so maybe you got a boyfriend problem. But I’m thinking I know who lives here and he’s 50 something. You can’t be the boyfriend problem. You know? It can’t be him. Maybe you’re dating his son.

COOPER: And you’d never seen her before?

RAMSEY: Bro —

COOPER: In the year that you had been there?

RAMSEY: Bro, that man, listen, never. That woman didn’t come out the house. The only kids that came out the house were two little girls. They played in the backyard. He had two dogs and my — where I live naturally is next door, my bedroom was upstairs so when I hear kids playing, I know it’s them. They did the same thing, play in the backyard for a couple of hours, go back in the house. Same thing every day.

The neighborhood knows them as his grandchildren. So no big deal. He had his grandkids over all the time, I thought.

COOPER: Amanda Berry then, what, asked to call 911?

RAMSEY: Mm-hmm. And I took her to my house. Now I’m nervous as hell so I’m fumbling with my phone, so I finally get it right. She can’t wait and I don’t blame her. So what I do was tell her go across the street and use their phone. Now we’re both calling 911. Now she gets through and I get through. She deal with a moron, me, too.

COOPER: You said there — what do you mean, a moron?

RAMSEY: Idiot.

COOPER: I heard the 911 call for her —

RAMSEY: Imbecile.

COOPER: And the woman kept —

RAMSEY: Shouldn’t have a damn job.

COOPER: The woman was like hang up and wait for the police.

RAMSEY: Really. How about stay on and I will talk to you until they get there?

COOPER: Right.

(END VIDEOTAPE)

COOPER: That’s Charles Ramsey. I’ll have more of my interview with Charles Ramsey after this break.

Let us know what you think. Follow me on Twitter right now @andersoncooper. So many questions still to be answered here.

Also ahead, we’re going to hear from a young woman who along with her friends once called 911 because they say they saw a naked woman in the suspect’s backyard. She says police thought they were joking, didn’t take it seriously. We’ll be right back.

(COMMERCIAL BREAK)

(BEGIN VIDEO CLIP)

RAMSEY: Heard her screaming, I’m eating my McDonald’s, I come outside, and I see this girl going nuts trying to get out of a house. So I go on the porch. I go on the porch and she says, help me get out, I’ve been here a long time. So you know, I figured it’s a domestic violence dispute. So I opened the door and we can’t get in that way because how the door is, it’s so much that a body can’t fit through, only your hand. So we kicked the bottom and she comes out with a little girl, and she says call 911, my name is Amanda Berry.

(END VIDEO CLIP)

COOPER: If not for the actions of Charles Ramsey and another neighbor who helped him, the three women may still be in that house here in Cleveland.

Here’s more of my exclusive interview with Charles Ramsey.

(BEGIN VIDEOTAPE)

COOPER: So you call 911.

RAMSEY: Sure did.

COOPER: How quickly did the police get there?

RAMSEY: You know what, they got there so fast because I said moron. Because I said hey, Amanda Berry is right in front of me right now. Here’s what she got on and I told him white tank top, blue sweatpants, nice tennis shoes, nice ponytail. What else? Oh, right. She’s panicking, idiot. Put yourself in her shoes. Like I said, Amanda Berry, that don’t ring no damn bells, you being a cop and all?

COOPER: But you — when you first saw her and she said the name Amanda Berry, did it —

RAMSEY: It didn’t — I didn’t know. Because I forgot. Bro, this is Cleveland. Since they haven’t found that girl.

COOPER: Right.

RAMSEY: And I guess stopped looking for that girl, we figured that girl was — met her demise.

COOPER: Right.

RAMSEY: So Berry didn’t register with me until I was on the phone like, wait a minute, I thought this girl was dead.

COOPER: What does it — what does it feel like to have been living next to this for a year?

RAMSEY: See, that’s why now I’m having trouble sleeping. See, up until yesterday, the only thing that kept me from losing sleep was the lack of money. See what I’m saying? So now that that’s going on, and I could have done this last year, not this hero stuff, just do the right thing —

COOPER: Do you feel like a hero?

RAMSEY: No.

COOPER: Because there’s a lot of people, they’re saying you’re a hero.

(CROSSTALK)

RAMSEY: No, no, no. Bro, I’m a Christian, an American, and just like you. We bleed same blood, put our pants on the same way. It’s just that you got to put that — being a coward, and I don’t want to get in nobody’s business. You got to put that away for a minute.

COOPER: Because you know how it is. There’s a lot of people who turn away.

(CROSSTALK)

RAMSEY: You have to have cajones, bro.

COOPER: Keep walking down on the street.

RAMSEY: That’s all what it’s about. It’s about cajones on this planet.

COOPER: Has the FBI said anything about a reward or anything? Because there was that — there was a reward for finding her.

RAMSEY: I tell you what you do, give it to them. Because if folks been following this case since last night, you been following me since last night, you know I got a job anyway. Just went picked it up, paycheck. What that address say? That say?

COOPER: I don’t have my glasses. I’m blind as a bat.

RAMSEY: 2203 Seymour. Where are them girls living? Right next door to this paycheck. So yes, take that reward and give it to — that little girl came out the house and she was crying. And I’m looking at her, right, I’m like your mama trying to help you, girl, shut up. I don’t know, right. And she’s like I want my daddy. And I said, who’s her daddy? She said Ariel.

COOPER: She said that.

RAMSEY: Yes. I said well, how’s that possible? Because you wouldn’t — if you got kidnapped, he was having sex with you? Oh, Jesus. That little girl is his? Now we want to hurt you.

COOPER: You felt that?

RAMSEY: Bro, this will be a different interview, I told you that, if we had known that. Man, I would be facing triple life.

COOPER: Wow. I’m glad it turned out this way.

LOS ANGELES (AP) — The U.S. government agency that oversees immigration applications is launching an office that will focus on identifying Americans who are suspected of cheating to get their citizenship and seek to strip them of it.

U.S. Citizenship and Immigration Services Director L. Francis Cissna told The Associated Press in an interview that his agency is hiring several dozen lawyers and immigration officers to review cases of immigrants who were ordered deported and are suspected of using fake identities to later get green cards and citizenship through naturalization.

Cissna said the cases would be referred to the Department of Justice, whose attorneys could then seek to remove the immigrants’ citizenship in civil court proceedings. In some cases, government attorneys could bring criminal charges related to fraud.

Until now, the agency has pursued cases as they arose but not through a coordinated effort, Cissna said. He said he hopes the agency’s new office in Los Angeles will be running by next year but added that investigating and referring cases for prosecution will likely take longer.

“We finally have a process in place to get to the bottom of all these bad cases and start denaturalizing people who should not have been naturalized in the first place,” Cissna said. “What we’re looking at, when you boil it all down, is potentially a few thousand cases.”

He declined to say how much the effort would cost but said it would be covered by the agency’s existing budget, which is funded by immigration application fees.

The push comes as the Trump administration has been cracking down on illegal immigration and taking steps to reduce legal immigration to the U.S.

Immigrants who become U.S. citizens can vote, serve on juries and obtain security clearance. Denaturalization — the process of removing that citizenship — is very rare.

The U.S. government began looking at potentially fraudulent naturalization cases a decade ago when a border officer detected about 200 people had used different identities to get green cards and citizenship after they were previously issued deportation orders.

In September 2016, an internal watchdog reported that 315,000 old fingerprint records for immigrants who had been deported or had criminal convictions had not been uploaded to a Department of Homeland Security database that is used to check immigrants’ identities. The same report found more than 800 immigrants had been ordered deported under one identity but became U.S. citizens under another.

Since then, the government has been uploading these older fingerprint records dating back to the 1990s and investigators have been evaluating cases for denaturalization.

Earlier this year, a judge revoked the citizenship of an Indian-born New Jersey man named Baljinder Singh after federal authorities accused him of using an alias to avoid deportation.

Authorities said Singh used a different name when he arrived in the United States in 1991. He was ordered deported the next year and a month later applied for asylum using the name Baljinder Singh before marrying an American, getting a green card and naturalizing.

Authorities said Singh did not mention his earlier deportation order when he applied for citizenship.

For many years, most U.S. efforts to strip immigrants of their citizenship focused largely on suspected war criminals who lied on their immigration paperwork, most notably former Nazis.

Toward the end of the Obama administration, officials began reviewing cases stemming from the fingerprints probe but prioritized those of naturalized citizens who had obtained security clearances, for example, to work at the Transportation Security Administration, said Muzaffar Chishti, director of the Migration Policy Institute’s office at New York University law school.

The Trump administration has made these investigations a bigger priority, he said. He said he expects cases will focus on deliberate fraud but some naturalized Americans may feel uneasy with the change.

“It is clearly true that we have entered a new chapter when a much larger number of people could feel vulnerable that their naturalization could be reopened,” Chishti said.

Since 1990, the Department of Justice has filed 305 civil denaturalization cases, according to statistics obtained by an immigration attorney in Kansas who has defended immigrants in these cases.

The attorney, Matthew Hoppock, agrees that deportees who lied to get citizenship should face consequences but worries other immigrants who might have made mistakes on their paperwork could get targeted and might not have the money to fight back in court.

Cissna said there are valid reasons why immigrants might be listed under multiple names, noting many Latin American immigrants have more than one surname. He said the U.S. government is not interested in that kind of minor discrepancy but wants to target people who deliberately changed their identities to dupe officials into granting immigration benefits.

“The people who are going to be targeted by this — they know full well who they are because they were ordered removed under a different identity and they intentionally lied about it when they applied for citizenship later on,” Cissna said. “It may be some time before we get to their case, but we’ll get to them.”",APNewsBreak: US launches bid to find citizenship cheaters,2018-06-12 02:16:47+00:00,['Amy Taxin'],"['deported', 'cheaters', 'bid', 'cases', 'agency', 'immigrants', 'using', 'apnewsbreak', 'launches', 'cissna', 'identities', 'ordered', 'citizenship', 'immigration']","Citizenship and Immigration Services, sits during an interview in Los Angeles.

Harvests of native oysters are now 1% or less of historical levels due to harvesting, disease, changes in water quality, and other factors. Overall oyster populations and the ecosystem services they provide are similarly diminished.

NOAA, including the NOAA Chesapeake Bay Office and NOAA Restoration Center, are actively involved in restoring native oysters in the Chesapeake Bay. Efforts to restore native oysters are accelerating, especially in Harris Creek, where the initial construction phase of a restoration project was completed in 2015. There, 350 acres of reefs were constructed and/or seeded.

Status

Biomass: Biomass—the total weight of a species in an area, such as a river or bay—is measured by fishery-independent (not collected using commercial or recreational fishing statistics) surveys, which were rare until recently in the Chesapeake Bay. However, historical biomass data are available for selected rivers and bays.

A 2012 paper compared results of fishery-independent surveys of Chesapeake oysters from about 100 years ago to results of more recent surveys. The paper lists the estimated percent of historic extent (area) and biomass remaining for several subestuaries within the Chesapeake and some nearby estuaries. The remaining area values in the Chesapeake ranged from 6% for the Piankatank River/Mobjack Bay to 54% for the James, while the biomass percent values ranged from 3% for the Piankatank River/Mobjack Bay to 37% for the James and 38% for Tangier/Pocomoke Sounds. Most of these are much higher than estimates of remaining oysters based on landings (see Figure 1). They are all higher than the estimates in the same paper for the nearby Chincoteague and Sinepuxent Bays (along the Atlantic Ocean in Maryland and Virginia), but most are lower than the estimates for Delaware Bay. But even 100 years ago, many Chesapeake oyster reefs had been harvested by European settlers for about 300 years and by native harvesters for long before that. Thus, the historical data were not an undisturbed baseline, and a high percent remaining does not necessarily mean that oysters exist now in commercially harvestable amounts.

In addition, data for other tributaries not covered in the paper may be very different.

Oyster biomass data have been reported in Maryland since a baseline index was developed in 1993, with the most recent information from the Maryland most recently in the 2014 fall survey report. The biomass estimated for each year is compared to the 1994 estimate, which is based on samples from 43 bars. That oyster biomass index hit a record high in 2014, and the 2014 index was very close to that record high. These 2013-14 biomass index values are more than double the 2010 index due to high oyster survival in recent years. The Maryland fall survey also includes indices for spatfall (recruitment success), disease, and mortality.

The latest fishery-independent oyster survey report for Virginia has 2015 data for oyster size composition, mortality rates, and spat set rates for 30 bars sampled in six major rivers on the Western shore of the Chesapeake Bay. Over the past nine years, the survey results have showed a slow increase in the number of market oysters found on the 30 sampled oyster bars, increasing about 350% from 2007 to 2015. Current abundance levels are still very low compared to historic levels.

There are metrics for Chesapeake Bay oyster restoration that specify the amount of oyster biomass in a given area for a reef to count as “restored.”

Overfishing: Overfishing of oysters may be occurring, but no official determination has been made A harvest moratorium has been suggested in some peer-reviewed academic papers (including papers published in 2007 and 2011), but not by any of the fishery management agencies. More information on landings is available via NOAA Fisheries.

A bill was passed by the Maryland legislature in 2016 that requires the Maryland Department of Natural Resources and the University of Maryland Center for Environmental Science to conduct a stock assessment and develop biological reference points for the oyster populatin in Maryland.

The ""Chesapeake Bay Oyster Landings by State, 1880-2011"" graph shows how Chesapeake landings declined over time to their current level of less than 1% of historical harvests. Two of the dips were probably caused by the spread of two oyster diseases, Dermo (which was first seen in the Chesapeake round 1949) and MSX (which appeared around 1959).

The ""Chesapeake Bay Oyster Landings by State, 1990-2014"" graph shows some of the same data, focused on recent decades so more detail can be seen. The state breakdown shows that Maryland harvests exceeded those in Virginia for most of this period, but that Virginia started catching up in 2007. Only Maryland data were reported in 2005. Because NOAA Fisheries landings data are a mix of wild harvest and aquaculture, it can't be determined if the wild harvest changed in Virginia after 2007, but the oyster aquaculture industry there has been growing.

Overfished: See ""Overfishing"" above.

Value of fishery: The dockside value of oysters landed in 2013-14 (the latest year with data from both states) was $15.7 million in Maryland and $28 million in Virginia. Oysters are among the most valuable fisheries in the Chesapeake Bay, along with blue crab, striped bass, and Atlantic menhaden.

Fishing and habitat: There is evidence that some harvest techniques, especially power dredging, can damage oyster reef structure. In one study, fished reefs were not as tall or complex as unfished control reefs. The lower height of the reef was associated with higher oyster mortality, because the oysters were in sometimes anoxic (essentially no oxygen) bottom waters. It has not been established whether less height and complexity leads to less fish habitat, however. In addition to habitat, oysters provide ecosystem services such as water filtration and nitrogen removal. Harvesting oysters reduces the amount of these ecosystem services that oysters can provide, as well as removing brood stock for future generations of oysters.

By-catch: The by-catch of oysters is rare, because oyster reefs damage the nets used in other fisheries. Thus, fishers using nets usually avoid oyster reefs. Conversely, the by-catch of other fished species during oyster harvest is also rare, because oyster dredging and tonging only target oyster reefs.

Aquaculture: Aquaculture of C. virginica takes place in Canada, the United States, and Mexico. Oyster aquaculture is extensive in Virginia, and starting to expand in Maryland. In general, saltier waters (like those in Virginia) support higher spawning and growth rates for oysters—but also have higher disease rates, especially for MSX. According to 2014 data from Virginia, growers planted 107.1 million single oysters and sold 39.8 million single oysters for an estimated revenue of $15.4 million, up from $11.1 million in 2013. The harvest of spat-on-shell oysters in Virginia has also expanded recently, increasing from approximately 2,000 bushels harvested in 2009 to 38,200 bushels in 2014. The farm gate value of spat-on-shell harvest was $1.7 million in 2014. The industry employment also increased in 2014.

Using a process to ensure that each oyster has three sets of chromosomes (resulting in a “triploid” oyster) instead of the usual two (“diploid”), hatcheries can produce oysters that are sterile. In 2014, triploids made up 91% of growers' plantings. This percentage has been between 80% and 95% for the last six years. Triploids are favored over the wild type because they don’t spawn and therefore grow faster and are not affected by reproduction (which leads to losing meat weight and quality) compared to diploids. Hatcheries in Virginia are used largely for aquaculture, usually to produce selected and/or triploid larvae, whereas Virginia restoration efforts usually use natural spat set.

The aquaculture industry in Maryland continues to grow after oyster farming on leased bottom was legalized in 2009. The Maryland Aquaculture Coordinating Council's 2014 report states that through November 2014, there were 318 shellfish aquaculture leases on 3,993 acres being used to grow oysters and clams. This is up from 3,674 acres reported at the end of 2013. In 2014, almost 30,000 bushels of oysters were harvested and sold by Maryland's aquaculture industry. The one large hatchery in Maryland, the University of Maryland Horn Point Hatchery in Cambridge, produces larvae mainly for oyster research, oyster restoration, and educational projects. In 2016, Horn Point Hatcher produced 945 million spat and 3.6 billion eyed larvae.

Several methods are used for oyster aquaculture in the Chesapeake Bay.

In leased areas, growers may plant oyster shell on the bottom on which to catch settling oyster larvae (in higher-salinity waters) or plant spat-on-shell on the bottom (in lower-salinity waters). The shells on which the larvae set to produce spat-on-shell are a form of cultch (substrate for oyster larvae), while other cultivation methods use so-called “cultchless” oysters that are set on small shell fragments (called “microcultch”) and must be grown in upwellers, which provide a constant flow of water, until they are large enough to put in bags or cages and are called “seed.”

Oysters can be grown off the bottom in cages or rack-and-bag systems, in bags on long lines, or in floats that hold bags of oysters near the surface. In cages or bags, where they are protected from predators, cultchless oysters or “singles” are usually grown for the half-shell (raw) market, which typically yields higher prices per oyster. The oysters in bags, cages, or floats are thinned out and redistributed into more containers as they grow to avoid crowding and competition for food.

Science and Management

The oyster fishery in the Chesapeake Bay is regulated by the State of Maryland, Commonwealth of Virginia, and the bistate Potomac River Fisheries Commission (PRFC). Fishery regulations are established with respect to season and time limits, catch limits, and gear restrictions. These regulations are based on management strategies designed to conserve the oyster resource. The most recent Bay-wide document addressing oyster management is the 2004 Chesapeake Bay Oyster Management Plan, which was intended “to provide both a general framework and specific guidance for implementing a strategic, coordinated, multipartner management effort.”

In the Chesapeake Bay, the oyster fishery operates as a public fishery and as a leased bottom fishery, in which people can lease an area of bottom from the state to grow oysters.

In Maryland, during the winter harvest season, oysters can be harvested from any area that has not been set aside as leased bottom, a managed reserve, or a sanctuary, or closed because of public health concerns due to bacteria levels. Maryland has managed reserves, in which areas are closed and then reopened to harvest. They may be reopened when the oysters reach a certain size, or after a certain period of time. There were about 2,600 acres in managed reserves in Maryland in 2009. Reserves are usually opened to harvest when 60% of the oysters in them are 4 inches long or more.

In Virginia, only areas legally designated as public grounds can be opened for harvest by the Virginia Marine Resources Commission. Virginia has a rotational harvest system, which opens and closes specific oyster bars on a two- to three-year rotation.

Maryland and Virginia also have oyster sanctuaries, which are closed to harvest indefinitely. In Maryland, sanctuaries cover about 9,000 acres, or about 24% of the mapped oyster bar habitat. There are several oyster sanctuaries in the Potomac River, which is mostly managed by Maryland.

In Virginia, there is one oyster sanctuary (Wreck Shoals) in the James River covering about 90 acres; the other five sanctuaries established by regulation are in the Virginia coastal (seaside) bays. Large areas of bottom are leased for oyster and clam aquaculture in Virginia, where leases (private grounds) cover about 100,000 acres (leased areas are not necessarily used for production). The number of active oyster aquaculture leases in Virginia has not been reported since 2005, when there were 282 leases used for oyster aquaculture, but their area was not reported. There were over 6,500 acres of leases in hard clam culture that year.

Leasing for aquaculture is now allowed in sanctuaries in Maryland, as long as it is outside the mapped “natural oyster bars” (based largely on maps drawn by C. C. Yates, who surveyed oyster reefs in 1906-12) and the area leased does not exceed 10% of the sanctuary area. There are currently over 3,600 acres in over 310 shellfish bottom leases in Maryland, with additional “water column” leases for oysters grown in floats. There is no leased bottom in the Potomac, because PRFC has never been authorized by Maryland and Virginia to allow leasing.

Life History and Habitat

Life history, including information on habitat, growth, feeding, and reproduction of a species, is important because it affects how a fishery is managed.

Geographic range: The Eastern oyster’s native range encompasses the east coast of North America and Central America from the Gulf of St. Lawrence in Canada south through the Gulf of Mexico and Caribbean.

A different oyster species, the Caribbean or mangrove oyster (Crassostrea rhizophorae), is also found around the Caribbean islands; it resembles the Eastern oyster and uses similar intertidal habitats, like mangrove roots.

The Chesapeake Bay provides good environmental conditions for the species; however, oyster productivity varies greatly within the Bay system, depending on factors such as salinity, water quality, habitat conditions, food supply, disease prevalence and virulence, and suitable attachment substrate (or “cultch”).

Habitat: Eastern oysters are usually found on hard bottom areas. If placed on soft bottom, oyster shells tend to become buried, and the animals die. Natural oyster bars are often located on the edges of channels, probably because they have good water flow, which may bring them more food and provide more larvae from up-current areas. Specific habitat tolerances, as described in the 2007 status review, are:

Depth: 2-26 feet (0.6-8.0 meters) in the Chesapeake Bay, except oysters near the mouth of the Bay (and farther south, and rarely north) may be intertidal. Winter mortality limits intertidal oysters (exposed out of the water at low tide) to the southern, warmer parts of their range, generally south of Maryland, except oysters may be intertidal in locations farther north that are not subject to ice scour.

Salinity: varies by life stage. Larvae need 10-27.5 practical salinity units (psu), adults can tolerate 5-40 psu, but optimum range is 14-28 psu. Adults have little growth below 5-10 psu.

Temperature: optimum for larvae is 68-90.5o F (20-32.5oC), for adults 68-86oF (20-30oC); adults can tolerate 35.6-96.8oF (2-36oC) and up to 120.2oF (49oC) for short periods. Larvae can grow in water as cold as 63.5oF (17.5oC).

pH: larvae are the most sensitive; tolerable range is 6.75-8.75.

Dissolved oxygen: >20% saturation, which corresponds to 2.3 milligrams/liter at 50oF (10oC) and 1.5 mg/l at 86oF (30oC). Hypoxia for most marine life is considered <30% dissolved oxygen saturation, so oysters are more tolerant of low dissolved oxygen than are many Bay animals. Subtidal oysters can close their shells and use anaerobic respiration for several hours if the water has low dissolved oxygen, just as intertidal oysters close their shells at low tide.

Life Span: Varies greatly depending on tidal height, salinity, disease prevalence and virulence, and predator and parasite prevalence and effectiveness. Oysters usually survive up to several years, but they have lived up to 20 years in captivity.

Food: Most of the particles filtered by oysters are about 1-10 microns in diameter, about the same size as the single-celled phytoplankton (algae) that make up most of their diet. Filtration rate estimates range from 1.5 to 10.0 liters of water filtered per hour per gram (L h-1g-1) dry tissue weight, which is higher than the filtration rate of most other bivalves. Some of the particles filtered (including sediment and food) are ejected as “pseudofeces” without passing through the gut, because oysters need to ventilate their gills for more time than they need to feed.

Growth Rate: Spat grow at the rate of about an inch (25 millimeters) per year, and sometimes up to 10 millimeters per month in their first six months. Growth rates can be affected by temperature, food quantity and quality, salinity, boring organisms, and disease. Shell growth usually occurs in the spring, and soft body tissue growth occurs after spawning (usually in the summer). Oysters usually reach market size (3 inches or 76 millimeters) three to five years after spat settlement, but in warmer and saltier waters such as those in the Gulf of Mexico, they can reach that size in as little as one to two years. Sterile (triploid) oysters usually grow faster because they are not expending energy on reproduction, enabling them to reach market size sooner (one study indicates five months sooner) and to weigh 29-60% more than diploid oysters grown for the same length of time in the same place.

Maximum Size: Approximately 8 inches long (20 centimeters). Fossil shells may be longer.

Reproduction: Eggs and sperm are released into the water as water temperature rises to about 64-68°F (18-20°C), usually by the end of June. Spawning is also salinity dependent, and is less common when the salinity is below 10 psu. It is estimated that females produce from 2 to 115 million eggs. Like some other animals (including some fish), for oysters, large body size is an advantage for females that enables them to produce more eggs.

Eastern oysters actually all start life as males, then most become and remain females by their second winter. Oysters release eggs and sperm into the water, where fertilization occurs. The fertilized eggs develop into nonswimming larvae called veligers, which eventually develop a small foot used to attach to a hard substrate, often another oyster shell. Young attached oysters are called spat and the process of attachment is called setting. Larvae usually go through settlement, metamorphosis, and attachment within two to three weeks after fertilization occurs, but the process may take a month or more under certain conditions.

Due to circulation patterns, some subestuaries tend to trap and retain oyster larvae (these areas are called “sinks”) while others may have most of the larvae produced from their oysters moved elsewhere (called “sources”). Because external fertilization is a function of oyster density, among other factors, it is important to have enough oysters of different ages (and thus sexes) near each other on a reef for successful reproduction and recruitment.

Migrations: Very limited. The larvae are planktonic or nonswimming (though they drift in current), so offspring may settle onto another nearby reef, but rarely travel very far from the reef where they were spawned. Unlike some bivalves (e.g., clams, scallops), oysters cannot move once they have attached to a substrate.

Predators: The main predators on oyster larvae are other filter feeders, especially comb jellies (Mnemiopsis, Beroe). The main predators on adults in the Chesapeake Bay include cownose rays, black drum, and oyster drills. Crabs, worms, and boring sponges may also prey on adults.

Commercial and Recreational Interest: Both, but mainly commercial due to the specialized gear that is usually required.

Distinguishing Characteristics: Oysters are bivalves—they have two shells, or “valves.” The left (or bottom) valve tends to be deep and cup shaped, while the right (or top) valve tends to be flatter. Shape varies greatly depending on where the oyster grows. Once an oyster animal is removed from its shells, a dark area is visible on the inside of the shell. This is the adductor muscle scar, showing where the adductor muscle (which an oyster uses to close its shell) was attached to the valves. In Eastern oysters, the adductor muscle scar is purplish, distinguishing it from similar species.

Diseases: Dermo, caused by the pathogen Perkinsus marinus, was first recorded in the Chesapeake Bay in 1949, and is more prevalent in lower-salinity waters of the Bay. Another disease, MSX (caused by Haplosporidium nelsoni), was first found in the Chesapeake Bay in 1959, two years after it was first found in Delaware Bay. It is more common in higher-salinity waters. MSX probably arrived with the Japanese oyster, Crassostrea gigas, which was intentionally introduced into Delaware Bay to test its growth there (it did not grow well).

Of the two diseases, mortality is generally higher with MSX, which killed most of the oysters larger than 2 inches (51 mm) in higher-salinity waters (>15 psu) when it reached the Bay. Because most of the higher-salinity waters are in Virginia, this had a dramatic effect on the Virginia fishery. Many of the surviving high-salinity oysters recovered in the 1970s with wetter weather and thus lower salinity, which reduces the virulence of MSX as well as Dermo. Wet years tend to have higher oyster survival (because disease intensity is reduced) but lower oyster reproduction (because spawning and settlement require water that has 10-12 psu).

Virginia has an oyster disease monitoring program, and disease monitoring is included in Maryland's annual fall survey.

For oysters grown in aquaculture from hatchery seed, there are two main ways to reduce disease effects. One is to use artificially selected strains that have been selected for disease resistance. The other is to grow triploid oysters, which are produced in hatcheries to have three sets of chromosomes, rather than the naturally occurring pair of chromosomes. Triploid oysters grow faster than diploids, and usually reach market size before they succumb to one of the diseases. About 95% of Virginia oyster growers now grow triploid oysters.

Role in the Ecosystem

Oysters are filter feeders, consuming phytoplankton (free-floating microscopic algae) and improving water quality while filtering the water for food. One oyster can filter more than 50 gallons of water in 24 hours. As generations of oysters settle on top of each other and grow, they form reefs that provide structured habitat for many fish species and crabs.

Oysters alter the sediments below them through their biodeposits, which add organic matter. Biodeposits consist of feces (partially digested food) and pseudofeces (undigested food that has not passed through their gut). The biodeposits are then subject to decomposition by aerobic bacteria (if an aerobic sediment layer is present). The resulting dissolved nutrients may be recycled back into the water, assimilated by benthic microalgae (if present), or settle into the anaerobic sediments are under the aerobic ones. Once dissolved nitrogen reaches the anaerobic layer, bacteria there may use it in denitrification, which converts it to nitrogen gas, removing it from the aquatic system. While denitrification is hard to measure in the field, some researchers remove cylinders of oyster reef along with their sediments and overlying water and put the contents in chambers, then monitor the cylinders in the lab where denitrification rates can be measured.

Human activities can have both positive and negative effects on oyster populations, and thus on their ecosystem roles, as shown in this conceptual diagram below made by EcoCheck (click on it for a larger image). Ecological impacts of oysters (their benefits and stressors) are summarized in a similar conceptual diagram at the bottom of NCBO’s Oyster Reefs page.

For weeks, the topic has dominated headlines and sparked what seems like coordinated outrage among liberals.

Apparently oblivious to the fact that the Obama administration detained minors at the border for years, the left has pointed fingers instead at President Donald Trump for enforcing regulations that were enacted before he was even president.

Pundits including MSNBC’s Joe Scarborough even compared U.S. law enforcement officials Pundits including MSNBC’s Joe Scarborough even compared U.S. law enforcement officials to Nazis , all because they separate children who are brought along during the commission of federal crimes from adults who are being placed into criminal custody.

This is akin to being outraged because police don’t throw the children of suspects in jail with their parents during arrests, but instead take them into protective environments.

The left-leaning media The left-leaning media stayed strangely silent when the detention of migrant children went on for years before Trump took office… and now it looks like they also kept quiet when Barack Obama’s administration literally placed immigrant children in the hands of human traffickers just a few years ago.

“The United States government placed an unknown number of Central American migrant children into the custody of human traffickers after neglecting to run the most basic checks on these so-called ‘caregivers,'” “The United States government placed an unknown number of Central American migrant children into the custody of human traffickers after neglecting to run the most basic checks on these so-called ‘caregivers,'” New York magazine reported in 2016, based on a Senate report.

Blame Trump! The problem, for the left, however, is that this horrific mistreatment of immigrant children happened in 2013 — right in the middle of the Obama presidency, and two years before Trump even announced he was a candidate.

“In the fall of 2013, tens of thousands of unaccompanied minors traveled to the U.S. southern border,” continued New York magazine.

“At least six of those children were eventually resettled on an egg farm in Marion, Ohio, where their sponsors forced them to work 12 hours a day under threats of death,” the report continued.

That’s right: Around the same time that That’s right: Around the same time that now-infamous pictures of the Obama administration putting migrant children in caged detention areas were being snapped, the same administration was directly responsible for essentially handing foreign kids into child slavery.

“ It is intolerable that human trafficking — modern-day slavery — could occur in our own backyard,” Sen. Rob Portman, an Ohio Republican, told It is intolerable that human trafficking — modern-day slavery — could occur in our own backyard,” Sen. Rob Portman, an Ohio Republican, told The New York Times at the time.

“But what makes the Marion cases even more alarming is that a U.S. government agency was responsible for delivering some of the victims into the hands of their abusers,” the senator continued.

The Obama administration was appallingly lax at conducting even basic checks about the adults who showed up to “claim” migrant children.

“As detention centers became incapable of housing the massive influx of migrants, the [Obama-run] Department of Health and Human Services started placing children into the care of sponsors who would oversee the minors until their bids for refugee status could be reviewed,” explained New York magazine, again confirming that the detention of child migrants took place long before Trump.

The current administration at least provides comfortable and safe housing for the children who are separated from their parents. Obama’s team did something very different.

“But in many cases, officials failed to confirm whether the adults volunteering for this task were actually relatives or good Samaritans — and not unscrupulous egg farmers or child molesters,” the magazine reported about the Obama-era scandal.

“The department performed check-in visits at caretakers’ homes in only 5 percent of cases between 2013 and 2015,” it continued. “The Senate’s investigation built on an “The department performed check-in visits at caretakers’ homes in only 5 percent of cases between 2013 and 2015,” it continued. “The Senate’s investigation built on an Associated Press report that found more than two dozen unaccompanied children were placed in homes where they were sexually abused, starved, or forced into slave labor.”

Shockingly, nobody knows for certain how many immigrant children ended up in horrific slavery-like circumstances under Obama’s watch. Over 90,000 immigrant children were placed into so-called “sponsor care” during the time-frame of 2013 to 2015.

“Exactly how many of those fell prey to traffickers is unknown, because the agency does not keep track,” New York magazine concluded.

Even after the scandal was uncovered and locations such as the slave-like egg farm in Marion, Ohio, were raided by police, the media remained oddly quiet.

A Google search of this incident reveals only a handful of media outlets covering the story A Google search of this incident reveals only a handful of media outlets covering the story between 2013 and 2014 , despite the clearly huge implications of this Obama scandal.

It seems that when immigration enforcement policies made President Obama look bad, they were swept under the rug. Now that the same border problems that have existed for decades can be used against Donald Trump, however, liberal journalists have miraculously found the backbone to cover the story.

The reality is that border and immigration issues are tough, and children are unfortunately caught in the middle.

Just as it’s heartbreaking but necessary for police to make an arrest when children are witnesses, or for Child Protective Services to step in when a family situation turns ugly, the presence of minors doesn’t mean that we stop enforcing national laws. This would only encourage law-breakers to use children as “legal shields” as they commit more crimes.

Reality isn’t always pretty. There are no easy or magic answers on how to enforce U.S. border laws while being humane and compassionate to innocent kids dragged into the chaos by adults. It’s a difficult situation from any angle.

Trump’s administration is doing its best to deal with a problem it inherited from past presidents — but the fact that the mainstream media barely said a word about much worse treatment of migrants should be a giant red flag about the real agenda being pushed by liberal journalists now.","Report: Obama’s HHS Placed Children With Human Traffickers, Media Dead Silent",2018-06-19 22:01:20+00:00,[],"['children', 'obama', 'dead', 'hhs', 'human', 'report', 'york', 'administration', 'traffickers', 'migrant', 'media', 'trump', 'continues', 'silent', 'placed', 'obamas']","The left-leaning media The left-leaning media stayed strangely silent when the detention of migrant children went on for years before Trump took office… and now it looks like they also kept quiet when Barack Obama’s administration literally placed immigrant children in the hands of human traffickers just a few years ago.

According to the 56 page investigative report released in January 2016, the Office of Refugee Resettlement, an agency of the Department of Health and Human Services failed to properly vet government approved caretakers who claimed the children, placed children in homes without visiting the locations, permitted caretakers to obtain custody of multiple unrelated children and ignored “serious trafficking indicators.”

Once the children were placed in the homes of the government approved caretakers the agency allowed the adult sponsors to prevent caseworkers from providing them post-release services.

“HHS places children with individuals about whom it knows relatively little and without verifying the limited information provided by sponsors about their alleged relationship with the child,” the report said.

The report details at least 30 instances of unaccompanied children that had been trafficked because of the Obama administration’s laxed policies and procedures. In July 2016, after authorities discovered eight Guatemalan teen boys were being held captive in a decrepit trailer in Ohio by traffickers, Sen. Rob Portman, R -Ohio, initiated an investigation into the welfare of unaccompanied, undocumented minors.

The boys, who were forced to work at an egg farm for, are among 125,000 unaccompanied minors who have flooded into the United States since 2011 to escape socialistic unrest in South America.

Another Guatemalan was placed with a sponsor who forced him to work at least 12 hours a day to pay off a $6,500 smuggling debt, which the sponsor later increased to $10,900, according to the report.

A boy from El Salvador was permitted to live with his abusive father, despite warning caseworkers that his father regularly hitting him with an electrical cord. When the boy alerted authorities that his father forced him to work all day for, a post-release case worker found him starving, malnourished and imprisoned in a basement.



Democrats used images of children in detention to attack Trump as inhumane – until they realized the images were taken in 2014 when migrants flooded the border because of Obama’s migration friendly policies.

1:01 AM 06/18/2018 Kerry Picket | Reporter

The Obama administration handed off an unknown number of migrant minors into the custody of human traffickers under the assumption that these so-called “caregivers” were related to the children.

In the wake of the current debate over how to handle illegal aliens who claim asylum while crossing the border with children in tow, supporters of tighter border controls point to issues related to not knowing whether the children are indeed sons and daughters of the border crossers. Previous reports say the federal government already had a poor record of placing these children in dangerous environments during the Obama administration.

The Associated Press reported two years ago that in April 2014 the U.S. Department of Health and Human Services relaxed its safety standards to promptly move migrant children out of government shelters and into sponsors’ homes when waves of illegal aliens surged across the southern border.

However, according to the AP’s reporting, the lowered standards resulted in children landing in unsafe homes where they were “sexually assaulted, starved or forced to work for little or no pay.”

The AP found almost 30 children who were placed with “caregivers” who exposed them to sexual abuse, labor trafficking, abuse or neglect.

HHS lowered standards by ceasing required fingerprinting of much of the adults claiming children as theirs. In April 2014, HHS ceased asking for original copies of birth certificates from most sponsors to prove who they were.

In May 2014, the AP noted, HHS stopped filling out forms that asked for sponsors’ identifying information prior to placing any of the children in the sponsors’ residence. Finally, the agency ended FBI background checks of the caregivers they were sending the migrant children to.

HHS estimated that around 90,000 migrant children were placed into sponsor care between 2013 and 2015, but the agency did not know how many of those children were trafficked because the department failed to keep track of them after their placement.

Following the AP’s piece on the matter, the Senate Committee on Homeland Security and Government Affairs released a 56-page report on “Protecting Unaccompanied Alien Children from Trafficking and Other Abuses.”

The report urged HHS to roll back the loosening of safety standards by the agency and bring back fingerprinting and background checks of potential sponsors, among other things.

Presently, there is an impasse as to where the unaccompanied children should go when illegal aliens who cross the border with them claim they are their parents.

For those seeking asylum at ports of entry, we have continued the policy from previous Administrations and will only separate if the child is in danger, there is no custodial relationship between ‘family’ members, or if the adult has broken a law. — Sec. Kirstjen Nielsen (@SecNielsen) June 17, 2018

Democrats have accused the Trump administration of “breaking up” migrant families who reach the southern border but the White House says it is simply enforcing federal law that existed long before President Trump came to office.

“The separation of illegal alien families is the product of the same legal loopholes that Democrats refuse to close. And these laws are the same that have been on the books for over a decade. The president is simply enforcing them,” White House Press Secretary Sarah Huckabee Sanders told reporters last Thursday.

Between April 19 and May 31, there were 1,995 children separated from 1,940 adults by U.S. Border Patrol, a spokesperson for the Department of Homeland Security (DHS) confirmed Saturday.

The numbers represent families who were separated because of illegal entry, immigration violations, possible criminal conduct by the parent, and cases where officials could not verify the family relationship, the DHS spokesperson said.",Flashback: Obama HHS Placed Migrant Children Into Custody Of Human Traffickers,2018-06-18 13:19:33+00:00,[],"['children', 'sponsors', 'obama', 'hhs', 'illegal', 'flashback', 'standards', 'traffickers', 'migrant', 'border', 'human', 'placed', 'custody']","Flashback: Obama HHS Placed Migrant Children Into Custody Of Human Traffickers1:01 AM 06/18/2018 Kerry Picket | ReporterThe Obama administration handed off an unknown number of migrant minors into the custody of human traffickers under the assumption that these so-called “caregivers” were related to the children.

My story:

Due to reasons you will come to understand as you read on I cannot reveal my identity at this time. Some months ago while trekking through a mountain range on an amateur photo shoot during my holidays, my attention was taken by a glint of light from under a shrub. I discovered it was the suns reflection off a piece of broken glass.

PHOTO

glass lens

By the curved polished surface on one side I thought it might have been from some type of magnifying lens. I rummaged around under the shrub wondering if someone had dropped their binoculars, but instead, to my surprise I found a badly damaged camera lens. I looked at the piece of glass in my hand. It was a fragment from the shattered lens. Beyond the shrub was a stony terrain that lead to the rock face of a sheer cliff towering high above the area. I spotted some other parts of the lens scattered between the rocks. Then I found the main body of the camera. It was an Olympus OM40 SLR, which was in production during the early eighties. The entire camera was smashed and covered in a silvery soot-like powder, as if it had been thrown onto a fire. Yet, on closer inspection, there was some oxidization on parts of the exposed metal casing. It had obviously been there for quite some time.

Back of camera

My first thought was that someone must have dropped the camera from the top of the cliff causing it to shatter on the rocks below, and that there must have been a raging fire through the valley at some stage. Taking a closer look at my surroundings there were no signs of recent fires. Had someone tried to destroy the camera by burning it? When I sniffed the soot it had a pungent explosives-like smell to it. I turned it over and wiped the film cartridge display window. The hair on the back of my neck stood on end. There was still film in the camera.



It was late evening by the time I arrived home some days later. I'd been having mysterious dreams about the camera every night since I found it. Overwhelmed with curiosity and excited anticipation, I immediately took the camera to my darkroom. I had to pry the back open with a screwdriver as the plastic section of the outer casing had melted then solidified over the cover. Most of the film was badly damaged, parts of it having disintegrated due to extreme heat. I developed the strips of film that were salvageable. Nearly all of the negatives were color distorted. The images on the film sent chills down my spine. When I finally developed the photos and blew them up, I couldn't believe what I was seeing. It made me wonder what the hell was about to happen on the planet!

The decision was made after Murdoch’s channel refused to stop showing graphic video footage shot by the man who killed 49 people at two mosques in Christchurch, New Zealand, on Friday.

This was despite calls from the police urging anyone broadcasting the disturbing footage to stop circulating it. “Police are aware there is extremely distressing footage relating to the incident in Christchurch circulating online,” the New Zealand police said in a statement. “We would strongly urge that the link not be shared. We are working to have any footage removed.”

On Saturday, the New Zealand broadcaster announced the decision to pull the channel off the air. “We stand in support of our fellow New Zealanders and have made the decision to remove Sky News Australia from our platform until we are confident that the distressing footage from yesterday’s events will not be shared,” it said in a now-deleted Tweet.

Soon after in a new Tweet, the broadcaster changed its message saying, “We stand in support of our fellow New Zealanders and are working with our colleagues at @SkyNewsAust to ensure coverage doesn’t compromise ongoing investigations in NZ. We made the decision on Friday with Sky News Australia to replace their live news with sport.”

In a statement Friday, a Sky News Australia spokesman said: “Sky News in line with other broadcasters ran heavily edited footage that did not show the shootings or the victims.”

Sky News Australia didn’t air in New Zealand for five days, returning on Wednesday, March 20, according to Sky New Zealand. In the interim, the networks worked to change the perception created by Sky New Zealand that Sky News Australia had been forced off the air. Sky New Zealand emailed ThinkProgress on March 21, saying that it “would like to take the opportunity to correct statements made by us on Saturday.”

Sky New Zealand spokesperson Chris Major said in a statement that the networks decided together to pull the coverage shortly after the attacks. “It was a proactive and precautionary decision taken by both parties to ensure any live coverage or commentary taking place in Australia, outside of the NZ jurisdiction, did not compromise the NZ investigations and legal process,” the statement said.

Friday’s mass shooting was streamed to Facebook live video by the shooter for at least 17 minutes. YouTube, Reddit, Facebook, and Twitter have since been working to remove footage of the massacre, however, new copies of the video continue to be uploaded.

Officials in the U.K. have also called on the tech companies to stop the spread of this footage. “Online platforms have a responsibility not to do the terrorists’ work for them,” British Home Secretary Sajid Javid wrote in an article for The Daily Express on Saturday.

The alleged shooter was a self-described terrorist who wrote a manifesto about white supremacy, in which he praised President Donald Trump, calling the president a “symbol of renewed white identity and common purpose.” The manifesto also included mention of conservative pundits and other white supremacist killers.

But when asked whether he thought white supremacy was a growing danger around the world, Trump said he did not.

Meanwhile, Murdoch’s Fox News channel in the U.S. has aired several segments in which it positions conservatives as the victims, fearing the Friday massacre is being used as an attempt to limit their free speech.

“Already tonight, you are hearing calls in this country for curbs on free speech in response to the New Zealand massacre,” Fox host Tucker Carlson said Friday night. “Jeff Bezos’ newspaper wasted no time in blaming the entire thing [on] free flow of ideas that are, quote, ‘spreading hate.’ For the censorship class, more control is always the solution. Ban more people, squelch more ideas, go deplatform someone.”

Meanwhile, conservative radio host Rush Limbaugh promoted the theory that the whole event may be a false-flag perpetrated by someone on the left in order to blame conservatives.

CORRECTION: This article previously stated that Limbaugh was a radio host for Fox News. This has been updated to state he is a conservative radio host.

https://www.snopes.com/fact-check/aca-versus-ahca/,complaints about the lack of transparency behind the creation of a bill to repeal obamacare were hypocritical because the democrats were just as bad when they passed obamacare.,false,"['aca', 'affordable care act', 'ahca', 'obamacare', 'trump administration']",2017/06/20,Alex Kasprak,"['https://www.vox.com/policy-and-politics/2017/6/16/15810524/senate-ahca-explain-please', 'https://www.vox.com/policy-and-politics/2017/6/20/15821016/republicans-health-care-bill-questions', 'https://www.cbo.gov/publication/52752', 'https://www.vox.com/health-care/2017/6/15/15807986/obamacare-lies-obstruction']",https://www.vox.com/policy-and-politics/2017/6/20/15821016/republicans-health-care-bill-questions,4,lucas,https://www.vox.com/,"On Friday, my colleagues Tara Golshan, Dylan Scott, and Jeff Stein published a remarkable piece collecting interviews with eight congressional Republicans about their health care bill. They asked the simplest question possible: What problems do you think this bill will solve, and how do you think it will solve them? Not a single Republican has a clear answer. The exchange with Sen. John McCain is particularly bizarre:

Tara Golshan Generally, what are the big problems this bill is trying to solve? John McCain Almost all of them. They’re trying to get to 51 votes. Tara Golshan Policy-wise. What are the problems [in the American health care system] this is trying to solve — and is the bill doing that right now? John McCain Well, it's whether you have full repeal, whether you have partial repeal, whether you have the basis of it. It's spread all over. Tara Golshan But based on the specifics of the bill you have heard so far, is it solving the problems [in the health care system]? John McCain What I hear is that we have not reached consensus. That’s what everybody knows.

But McCain’s reply, while incoherent, isn’t as offensive as Health and Human Services Secretary Tom Price’s straight lie that Americans will “absolutely not” lose Medicaid coverage under the House bill.

It’s worth asking why Republicans are lying about this, why they can’t give a clear explanation as to what their bill does, why they’re jamming the legislation through a secretive, rushed process that even their own members are criticizing. Because there is a reason. And it is damning.

In 2009, Democrats had an easy answer to what the Affordable Care Act was meant to do: They wanted to cover more people and cut costs. They could give that answer because it was a basically popular position, and because it’s what their bill actually did, or at least tried to do.

In 2017, Republicans have a similarly easy answer for their bill: They want to cover fewer people and use the savings to fund tax cuts for the wealthy. That is what their legislation does. But they can’t give that answer because it’s a horribly unpopular position.

What if, just work with me here, instead of passing a hugely unpopular HC bill in the dead of night, the GOP tried to do something popular? — Ross Douthat (@DouthatNYT) June 13, 2017

That is why they are trying to write a bill in secret and pass it before the public has a chance to mobilize against it. That’s why, when asked to describe the bill’s provisions, Republicans offer baldfaced lies or word salad.

The difference between Obamacare and Trumpcare

Democrats always believed the Affordable Care Act would be popular. They believed that even when polls said it wasn’t popular. They were certain that when Americans understood what was in the law — when they saw it would cover tens of millions of people, and regulate away the worst abuses of the insurance industry, and let children stay on their parents’ plans, and use Medicare to pilot a host of cost-control experiments — they would come around.

This basic belief carried through the more than year-long process behind the bill. It’s why Democrats held dozens of hearings, and released draft after draft of their legislation. It’s why, when the bill was in danger, President Obama invited congressional leadership to the Blair House for a multi-hour televised debate over the bill. He was certain he had the better of the argument, and that if the American people could just hear it, Democrats would win.

By contrast, Republicans have concluded the public will hate their bill if they know what’s in it, and so they are doing everything in their power to keep it a secret and move on from it as fast as possible.

The process that produced the House health bill was shocking. The law was rushed to its first vote, with barely any public hearings, in less than a month. It was passed before the Congressional Budget Office had even scored the final version. It wasn’t just that House Republicans didn’t want the public to know what their bill did. They didn’t want to know what their bill did!

The Senate process has been less chaotic but even more cynical. The legislation is being written by 13 Republican senators — all of them men — in secret. No one has seen a draft of it. No public hearings have happened, and none are scheduled. Republicans briefly considered banning cameras from the halls of the Senate so they couldn’t be asked about the bill on television. Various Senate Republicans have condemned the process — “The process is better if you do it in public, and that people get buy-in along the way and understand what’s going on,” Sen. Bob Corker (R-TN) told the New York Times — but they’re not forcing any changes to it. Though no bill exists for public viewing today, Mitch McConnell’s plan is to pass the legislation before July Fourth.

“The extreme secrecy is a situation without precedent, at least in creating health care law,” writes Julie Rovner, one of Washington’s most respected health reporters. My colleague Sarah Kliff, in a searing piece, recalls the hours she spent covering hearings during the drafting of the Affordable Care Act, and notes C-SPAN is empty of similar hearings today. “I’ve covered Obamacare since day one,” she writes. “I’ve never seen lying and obstruction like this.”

A bill you can’t defend is a bill that won’t survive

The strategy Republicans have chosen may work to pass a bill, but it won’t work to defend the chaos that bill creates. Democrats thought the Affordable Care Act would become more popular as it began delivering insurance to people, and so the world they were creating was a world they would be able to defend. Do Republicans really believe their health plan will become more popular when it begins taking insurance away from people?

And if they don’t, then what do they think will come next? I’ve written my prediction: They’re paving the way to Medicare-for-all, as the next Democratic majority will respond to Obamacare’s destruction by passing the law liberals wanted to pass in the first place.

I assume Republicans have a different view than that. But what is it? If their plan is so unpopular they can’t defend it in theory, how will they defend it in practice? Each day this goes on, it seems less like a legislative process and more like a form of madness.

The only plausible explanation I’ve heard for the persistent progress of this bill no one likes is that Republicans feel they need to keep their promise to repeal and replace Obamacare, and this is a version of keeping that promise. But this isn’t what they promised. Donald Trump swore everyone would be covered under his plan. Mitch McConnell promised lower deductibles and copays, and criticized Obamacare for leaving 25 million people uninsured. Read the clarity of McConnell’s critique of Obamacare, and compare it with how he and his colleagues are talking about health care now:

Well, what you need to understand is that there are 25 million Americans who aren’t covered now. If the idea behind Obamacare was to get everyone covered, that’s one of the many failures. In addition to premiums going up, copayments going up, deductibles going up. And many Americans who actually did get insurance when they did not have it before have really bad insurance that they have to pay for, and the deductibles are so high that it’s really not worth much to them. So it is chaotic. The status quo is simply unacceptable.

Republican voters thought the GOP would replace Obamacare with something better, something that would help them. They thought that because that’s what Republican politicians told them. That was what they were promised. This bill breaks the GOP’s health care promises.",The real reason Republicans can’t answer simple questions about their health care bill,2017-06-20 00:00:00,['Jun'],"['republicans', 'health', 'cant', 'answer', 'process', 'public', 'simple', 'insurance', 'obamacare', 'questions', 'care', 'popular', 'legislation', 'real', 'reason', 'bill']","On Friday, my colleagues Tara Golshan, Dylan Scott, and Jeff Stein published a remarkable piece collecting interviews with eight congressional Republicans about their health care bill.

A study by the Pew Center claiming that over 800,000 non-citizens voted for Hillary Clinton failed to take into account dead and fraudulent voters which totalled over 25 million “registered voters”.

According to reports, illegal aliens combined with dead voters and “multiple state” voters explains why Hillary appeared to have won the popular vote over Trump during this years presidential race.

“A report by the Pew Center on the States finds that more than 1.8 million dead people are currently registered to vote, and 24 million registrations are either invalid or inaccurate,” NPR reported in 2012, which is ironic given how NPR is heavily controlled by Democrats.

And many of the dead, registered voters somehow keep voting Democrat from beyond the grave, most recently in Philadelphia, Penn. and Colorado

It’s also worth noting that the U.S. population has increased since 2012, meaning that there’s likely more dead and invalid voters than before.

“…The Pew study found that almost 3 million people are registered to vote in more than one state,” NPR added.

That’s because when a new resident registers to vote in a state, officials usually never bother to tell his former state about the change in voter residency.

Under the “catch and release” immigration program by the Obama administration, illegal aliens were routinely given bus tickets to travel to other states by immigration officials, so it was theoretically possible for non-citizens to register to vote in a border country illegally, then register to vote in another state after their taxpayer-funded bus dropped them off.

Clinton won most of the 163 most populous counties in the US that account for half of the total votes in the election, including dense urban areas in New York and California, yet she only won the popular vote by 2.8 million votes, which reveals the lack of enthusiasm voters had for her in comparison to Trump – and that Democrats would have depended more on illegal votes.

A portion of the 24 million invalid voter registrations combined with a portion of the 1.8 million dead voters and the over 800,000 known illegal voters could explain the difference of 2.8 million votes, and it’s worth noting that the 800,000 figure could be a low, conservative estimate.

That said, a popular vote victory is meaningless; if the president was elected by popular vote, then both Trump and Clinton would have campaigned in entirely different states because only densely population regions of the U.S. would decide who would become president.

Without the electoral college, the United States of America would be reduced to the United States of New York and California, with 48 other vassal states.

Yet notice how Clinton campaigned in other, less populated states. They knew the popular vote was meaningless ahead of the election.

However, the popular vote is useful as a barometer for voter fraud since the most populous countries are also the most susceptible to election tampering by illegal, invalid and dead voters.

Lakewood Church was under fire after apparently not opening up the church to flood victims. The church disputed online criticism, stating “We are prepared to shelter people once the cities and county shelters reach capacity.”

“Victoria and I care deeply about our fellow Houstonians. Lakewood’s doors are open and we are receiving anyone who needs shelter,” Osteen tweeted Tuesday, referencing his wife who is also Lakewood’s co-pastor.

However, on Wednesday, reports from flood victims say the church is following a strict “members only” guideline, taking top church contributors ahead of people on the lower giving scale.

Single mother Tiana Williams said she waited in line for 3 hours, just to be given a numbered ticket and told to check back in a few hours. “When I got to the entrance with my two little boys, they asked for my name and entered it into the computer,” said Williams. “Then, I was told that there were over 2,000 people ahead of me that have reserved beds! When I kept pressuring the guy to tell me why I had to wait, he said they were under strict guidelines to check tithing records of members and number their bed reservations based on their 2016 giving. I just can’t believe this. I just can’t.”

The mega-church has not responded to Williams’ accusations as a recorded message says they are not able to answer their phone due to overwhelming numbers of people needing help, but refers people to their website to donate money. However other people in the community, who are not members of the church, also confirmed they have been turned away for help simply because they are not members of Lakewood.

Yoshiro Mizuguchi, Editor in Chief of Monthly Women's Magazine ""Fujin Koron""

There is a certain sort of used clothing shop that has been booming in recent years.

The shop is one room in an apartment. There are two display cases, one on each side of the room, facing each other. There are mountains of underwear in every color. You begin to notice the 'abnormality' of the place. This is not a department where beautiful lingerie is sold. These items are all stained and soiled. In other words, they are used. Uniforms from famous middle and high school girls' schools are also on display. They are also dingy. This is place that sells items that should have been thrown away or sent to the cleaners.

Shorts (bloomers) which are used in physical education classes (known as Buruma in Japan), school uniforms, and sailor or middy clothes (known as sera) are in these stores. As a result these stores have come to be known as buru-sera shops.

The sellers are just common middle school and high school girls. They stop by on their way home, looking for a little pocket money. Some take out sundry items from their bags, while others take off their underwear on the spot. The clerks then check the amount of soiling and price them accordingly. Among other considerations are smell, and these items are ranked such as 'three day items,' 'one week items,' etc... An appropriate amount of residue of menstrual blood or excrement brings particularly high prices.

In the case of underwear 2000 yen ($20) is the general price. If there is a photo of the girl attached the price can more than double. The 'sailor' clothes are more expensive if they are from a school that is well known or from an 'uptown' girls school. There are some maniacs who will pay any price for a uniform from the Princess' home school.

The girls who come to sell are happy go lucky. ""We just want money. This is an easy way to get it and it's better than working part time.""

There is a never ending flow of white collar workers in their twenties and thirties and college students coming in to buy these unusual items.

The girls who come in to sell are not from poor families; on the contrary, they are from established households. It must be said that the monetary values of these ""neo-yamatonadeshiko"" (daughters of Japan) are severely warped. They have never had to endure anything and the carefree atmosphere has removed the boundaries of common sense. ""Get money. Have fun. What's wrong with that?"" is how it goes. This is the kind of value that is common to present day Japan.

The girls sell their bodies to get brand name items and have fun. ""Matter"" has overtaken ""Soul."" To state it plainly, this is bartering between bodies (matter) and brand name items (matter). There are such markets all over the place. They can sell their bodies as well as their underwear.

It goes without saying that the parents and adults who cannot say, ""Cut out this foolishness!"" are equally guilty. No one wants to think that selling underwear leads directly to prostitution. But the middle school girls in prostitution say, ""I'm not doing anything wrong. I'm keeping it a secret from my parents, but I'm not harming anyone.""

According to analysis by psychiatrists, the men who steal or buy or wear women's underwear view the underwear as a substitute for female genitals. This points to a lack of erotic communication between the sexes. There is also a great problem in the sudden increase in adults who buy this underwear and the sexual services of young girls.

Sexual perversion is related to the form of society. What must be pointed out is that there is something fundamentally wrong with this nation when 'buru-sera' shops flourish and 'neo-yamatondeshiko' are allowed to sell themselves without comment from their parents or older. It is a bartering session, one without a soul.

Las Vegas, NV – A Las Vegas mom was arrested on Tuesday after an acquaintance called the police saying that the mother was doing body modifications on the child. 19-year-old Tonya Creighton says she was just trying to make her daughter look “cool” and meant no harm to the baby. Child Protective Services was called to the scene and the baby was removed from Creighton and put in their custody.

According to the anonymous tip made by Creighton’s acquaintance, the mother and the baby’s father, 22-year-old Brian Shekel gave the baby Benadryl to calm her down and applied a numbing agent to her ears. They then began the “Ear Pointing” surgery on the child, which is usually performed by a plastic surgeon at a cost of around $3000. According to the parents confession, they knew they would find no plastic surgeon willing to do it to the child and they “could not afford it because they had no jobs and their only income is welfare.”

“I don’t see what the big deal is,” said Creighton in her statement to the police. “That’s my child and I should have the right to do whatever I want to do with her. There was no harm done and everybody is doing it anyway and it looks cool. Our friend up the street did our ears and we didn’t need no plastic surgeon. It’s a family trait, and we wanted our daughter to have it.”

Doctors say the reversal will be very difficult. However, reconstructive surgeons in the area have volunteered to fix the child’s ears at no charge. Both parents are being held in the county jail on no bond.

Waukegan, IL | The capture of a 3,000-pound great white shark in Lake Michigan yesterday could explain the disappearance of hundreds of missing people in the region in the last decade, has confirmed the U.S. Coast Guard this morning.

John O’Keefe, a Canadian tourist, captured the 3,000-pound beast while fishing for sturgeon in Michigan Lake.

“We reeled in the beast for a good 4-5 hours before we finally shot it and wounded it to the head” explains the Toronto resident on vacation.

“Luckily, I had my rifle in hand, or else this prize fish would’ve never been caught” claims his friend, a long-time resident of Chicago, Allan Brooks.

“I’d heard of the Lake Michigan monster, but never did I expect to catch it myself,” claims the 63-year-old tourist on a weekend-long vacation in the area.

John O’Keefe, a Canadian tourist and Toronto resident, captured the 3,000-pound beast while fishing for sturgeon in Michigan Lake yesterday

A record-size fish

The great white shark estimated at more than 3 tons is the biggest fish ever caught in the region, believe experts.

“This is clearly not common to find such a beast so far inland” admits professor of biology at the University of Illinois, Allan Jameson.

“Either rising sea temperatures and depleted fish stocks possibly led the shark to adventure itself further into the Great Lakes region, but this is clearly the first occurrence of such a beast in the region that I can remember of” he admits, visibly puzzled. “It is also possible it traveled to the region through underwater tunnels that interconnect between the Great Lakes,” he told reporters.

A series of disappearances

Authorities suspect that more than a hundred people reported missing in the area in the last decade may have fallen under the fangs of the gigantic beast, several local residents even suspecting its presence for a long time.

Local campground owner, Robert Helm, says he had warned authorities about the series of disappearances to no avail

“I’ve owned this campground for the past seventeen years” explains local entrepreneur, Robert Helm.

“I’ve had my load of visitors disappearing mysteriously over the years, but I was told not to say anything about it. People would check in, but they wouldn’t check out,” he recalls. “Nobody ever believed me anyway and it would’ve scared away the tourists,” he told local reporters.

“It would’ve been bad for business in town” he adds, visibly relieved since the capture of the large creature.

U.S. Coast Guard spokesman Sidney Johnson reassured local residents that the occurrence of such a predator in the region’s waters “is highly unlikely” as sharks are not well adapted to freshwater systems, dealing great damage to their kidneys and respiratory system.

In 1916, a deadly shark attack near Presque Ile beach, in Lake Eerie, made national headlines, forcing local authorities to ban swimming in the region for over 14 years until the ban was lifted in 1930.

Lemming Suicide Myth

Disney Film Faked Bogus Behavior

By Riley Woodford

Lemmings do not commit mass suicide. It's a myth, but it's remarkable how many people believe it. Ask a few.

""It's a complete urban legend,"" said state wildlife biologist Thomas McDonough. ""I think it blew out of proportion based on a Disney documentary in the '50s, and that brought it to the mainstream.""

Lemmings are a kind of short tailed vole, a mouse-like rodent that favors tundra and open grasslands. Three kinds are found in Alaska, including the collared lemming, the only rodent that turns white in winter.

In 1958 Walt Disney produced ""White Wilderness,"" part of the studio's ""True Life Adventure"" series. ""White Wilderness"" featured a segment on lemmings, detailing their strange compulsion to commit mass suicide.

According to a 1983 investigation by Canadian Broadcasting Corporation producer Brian Vallee, the lemming scenes were faked. The lemmings supposedly committing mass suicide by leaping into the ocean were actually thrown off a cliff by the Disney filmmakers. The epic ""lemming migration"" was staged using careful editing, tight camera angles and a few dozen lemmings running on snow covered lazy-Susan style turntable.

""White Wilderness"" was filmed in Alberta, Canada, a landlocked province, and not on location in lemmings' natural habitat. There are about 20 lemming species found in the circumpolar north - but evidently not in that area of Alberta. So the Disney people bought lemmings from Inuit children a couple provinces away in Manitoba and staged the whole sequence.

In the lemming segment, the little rodents assemble for a mass migration, scamper across the tundra and ford a tiny stream as narrator Winston Hibbler explains that, ""A kind of compulsion seizes each tiny rodent and, carried along by an unreasoning hysteria, each falls into step for a march that will take them to a strange destiny.""

That destiny is to jump into the ocean. As they approach the ""sea,"" (actually a river -more tight cropping) Hibbler continues, ""They've become victims of an obsession -- a one-track thought: Move on! Move on!""

The ""pack of lemmings"" reaches the final precipice. ""This is the last chance to turn back,"" Hibbler states. ""Yet over they go, casting themselves out bodily into space.""

Life-loving lemming: lemmings do not commit mass suicide, although in lean times they may become cannibalistic. These mouse-like rodents are found in Alaska and in northern countries around the world, mostly favoring tundra and open grassland.

Lemmings are seen flying into the water. The final shot shows the sea awash with dying lemmings.

Certainly, some scenes in nature documentaries are staged. In Sir David Attenborough's recent documentary, ""The Life of Birds,"" the close-up footage of a flying duck, filmed razor-sharp from the bird's wingtip, was shot from a car using a mallard drake trained to fly alongside the car. But faking an entirely mythical event is something else.

""Disney had to have gotten that idea from somewhere,"" said Thomas McDonough, the state wildlife biologist. Disney likely confused dispersal with migration, he added, and embellished a kernel of truth.

Lemming populations fluctuate enormously based on predators, food, climate and other factors. Under ideal conditions, in a single year a population of voles can increase by a factor of ten. When they've exhausted the local food supply, they disperse, as do moose, beaver and many other animals.

Lemmings can swim and will cross bodies of water in their quest for greener pastures. Sometimes they drown. Dispersal and accidental death is a far cry from the instinctive, deliberate mass suicide depicted in ""White Wilderness,"" but Hibbler explains that life is tough in the lemmings' ""weird world of frozen chaos."" The voice-over implies that lemmings take the plunge every seven to ten years to alleviate overpopulation.

""What people see is essentially mass dispersal,"" said zoologist Gordon Jarrell, an expert in small mammals with the University of Alaska Fairbanks. ""Sometimes it's pretty directional. The classic example is in the Scandinavian mountains, where (lemmings) have been dramatically observed. They will come to a body of water and be temporarily stopped, and eventually they'll build up along the shore so dense and they will swim across. If they get wet to the skin, they 're essentially dead.""

""There's no question that at times they will build up to huge numbers,"" Jarrell added. ""One description from Barrow does talk about them drowning and piling up on the shore.""

Jarrell said when people learn that he works with lemmings, the mass suicide issue often comes up.

""It's a frequent question,"" he said ""'Do they really kill themselves?' No. The answer is unequivocal, no they don't.""

GLENDALE, CA—VeggieTales creators are celebrating the legalization of recreational cannabis use with a new character, Cannabis Carl. The character is a sign of the progress the United States has made on its views on the controversial plant. “Kids are ready for this,” said Dreamworks executive Brian Jones, who is overseeing production on the current series.

In his inaugural episode, Cannabis Carl will be at the border to the VeggieTales house property, trying to cross over to start a new life, only to be met by Pa Grape who is out patrolling for illegal vegetables. After Pa Grape puts Carl in custody for being an illegal plant, Mayor Archibald passes a new law that Cannabis Carl is a legal citizen. Carl is welcomed by the Veggie Cast as they sing a song about old laws and new covenants, drawing a powerful parallel from scripture that is easy for kids to understand. As the episode ends, Cannabis Carl helps Mayor Archibald cure glaucoma in his right eye and ends up becoming roommates with Mr. Lunt, buying snacks at Pa Grape’s store and living off of the town’s generous food stamp program.

“Mike and I have had this character in our back pockets since college,” Phil Vischer said at a press conference. “America wasn’t ready for Cannabis Carl then, but they’ve finally come around.” Mike Nawrocki, the voice of Larry the Cucumber also commented with a long, drawn-out, high-pitched giggle. His eyes appeared red.

Vischer and Narwocki say they have more characters in store for when all drugs become legalized, including a wizard mushroom named Morlock. “Bible college was a pretty crazy time for us, but eventually God uses all things to his glory,” Vischer said.

The new episode featuring Cannabis Carl will be released on the newest Netfix VeggieTales series titled “VeggieTales In the Haze.” Cannabis Carl will debut with his song “God Made All The Plants, Dude” and will be voiced by actor and director Kevin Smith, who is a devout Christian.","Thanks To New Laws, VeggieTales Finally Introduces New Cannabis Character",,[],"['ready', 'cannabis', 'song', 'veggietales', 'carl', 'episode', 'character', 'vischer', 'store', 'introduces', 'pa', 'finally', 'thanks', 'laws']","Thanks To New Laws, VeggieTales Finally Introduces New Cannabis CharacterGLENDALE, CA—VeggieTales creators are celebrating the legalization of recreational cannabis use with a new character, Cannabis Carl.

Addressing the Dell Issue. 2/26/02

This is the letter I posted in a few Firearms Forums and sent via e mail.

This is a true account of my dealings with Dell over the past few weeks.

I am writing this because I feel every Firearms owner should know

this story.

I placed an order for a Dell notebook computer on February 13 on line

with Dell. I was given a tentative delivery date of February 21st. I

was watching the order through the Dell on line tracking system; I

also opted for the automatic email notification of when the machine

was to be shipped. Well the 21st came and went, I am a Pistolsmith I

know things can happen. I made a phone call on the 25th, did a

voice mail message for my salesman to get back to me and I was

looking for the delivery date. The 25th came and went with no

callback. On the 26th I placed another call this time to cancel the

order. After a few hours I got a call back, with this amazing reason

for the delay. It seems someone in Dell had already canceled my

order, when I asked why I was told Dell was afraid I was going to

use the machine for illegal purposes. When I asked why someone

would think that I was told it was because of the name of my

business Weigand Combat Handguns Inc.. Because I am involved in

firearms I might be doing something illegal. Now keep in mind I was

never called or informed of this decision the order was just canceled.

Many of you know me personally and know I run my business about

as squeaky clean as possible. In addition being the President of the

American Pistolsmiths Guild I am under additional scrutiny as to how I

run my business, if I am not clean how can I be the President of an

organization that promotes just that! I was informed by a Dell

supervisor not long after all of this the reason I was refused was

because of their post September 11th policy of screening buyers.

I would like to respectfully ask the firearms community to do the

following. If you intended to buy a Dell and because of this letter you

do not, email Dell and let them know why. Feel free to distribute this

account to all you know in the Firearms community, I think they need

to know. I for one am sick and tired of people assuming just because

we are involved with firearms that we are doing something illegal. I

also do not believe Dell deserves our business if this is how they

intend to treat us.

God Bless

Jack Weigand

President

American Pistolsmiths Guild Inc.



The above is the only letter I have written. I have written comments on email I have received (that number is now in the hundreds). I would like to add the following.

I have spoken to Dell today 2/26/02

They informed me that the reason my order was cancelled was due to the new post 9/11 screening policy. The word

""Combat"" in my company name is what triggered the cancellation of my order. The cancellation was triggered automatically. When I asked why I was not called to clear this up I was told there was a breakdown in communications on Dells part.

Just for the record so everyone knows where I stand.

I have no intention of further dealings with Dell, they don't deserve my business.

I want nothing from Dell but I would gladly accept an apology to the Firearms community in general.

I posted this expressly to warn firearms owners of Dell policies PERIOD.

There are those that think I did this to generate traffic to my web site. All this traffic just made it hard for my customers to shop this evening. If you will notice there are no advertisements on my web so traffic is not a factor. It has also generated hundreds of email that I personally answered. Just so you all know I am not smart enough to do a publicity stunt of this magnitude on purpose, LOL!

I would humbly request the following.

Please, please refrain from making personal attacks on Michael Dell. I have received hundreds of e mails attacking Mr. Dell, please do not do this. I know we are all passionate about our right to keep and bear arms but please be as professional as possible.

I thank all of those that took the time to confirm that this story was true before spreading it, you all are to be commended!



Update 2/27/02

After fielding hundreds of emails and dozens of phone calls today my heart felt thanks to all who responded.

I was contacted by a Dell representative this morning a Mr. John Hood. John made the following remarks.

He extended Dells sincerest apologies for the incident.

He said Dell would review and possibly change the screening policies to prevent this from happening again.

Dell offered to ship the machine I ordered to me at no charge, I respectfully declined the offer.

John told me he would have a statement sent to me sometime Thursday morning the 28th stating Dells position on this issue for me to post here for all to see.

I will post the statement as soon as I receive it.



2/28/02 Update Statement from Dell

To Our Valued Customers and Friends:

U.S. export laws restrict the sale of technology to terrorists and to people

in countries that support terrorism. These laws also prohibit computer sales

to people who will use the technology in developing biological or nuclear

weapons. Dell strictly complies with our country's export laws in order to

ensure the safety of our customers and citizens around the world. When there

is reasonable cause for concern, we carefully review customer orders for

prohibited destinations and activities.

When additional follow-up on an order is required, our sales representatives

ask our customers four basic questions:

1. Who is the end-user?

2. Where will the product be used?

3. What will the product be used for?

4. What type of business or industry is involved?

The answers to these questions, like all customer information we gather, are

confidential and are not shared outside of Dell.

We recently received an order from Mr. Jack Weigand, whose company name,

""Weigand's Combat Handguns Inc."" included the word ""combat."" We cancelled

the order to give us enough time to follow up with the customer and be

assured that the sale would be in compliance with U.S. export law. However,

we failed to contact Mr. Weigand, and as a result, we did not deliver the

order as promised, and the customer did not know why. Once we discovered our

error, we apologized to Mr. Weigand for this misunderstanding, as well as

the inconvenience caused by the delay. This is not the service standard that

we hold ourselves to at Dell.

We at Dell feel a strong obligation to uphold our federal law, but we have

just as strong an obligation to be responsive to the needs of all our

customers. We want to assure you that the company does not discriminate

against any business, regardless of the products or services they sell, nor

do we discriminate against individual consumers. We do, however, sometimes

make mistakes - as we did in this case.

Thank you for your support.

Sincerely,

Dell Computer Corporation



This is the link that has been circulating

http://www.progressivefunds.com/hci/



I felt it was my obligation to post the following

The following is a portion of a Dell statement that addresses the above link This was added 3/02/02

We appreciate the opportunity to clarify the facts regarding a customer

issue reported in the media and Dell's position on political or social

issues that many of you care deeply about.

Regarding Handgun Rights/Handgun Control....

Dell is a publicly-traded, customer-focused company with customers,

shareholders and employees on both sides of many public, social and

political issues. Our place is to serve our customers rather than to

endorse or support one position over another in public debates outside the

scope of our industry.

We do not discriminate against any business, regardless of the products or

services they sell, nor do we discriminate against individual customers.

We do, however, respect the right of any organization or individual to

have their own point of view. We follow all laws, rules and regulations.

Regarding allegations that Dell supports Handgun Control organizations

through the Dell Affiliates program...

Dell as a company remains neutral on handgun rights and handgun control.

Dell customers can support causes and organizations, if they choose,

through Dell's affiliates program and charitable websites such as

igive.com and progressivefunds.com. These sites feature links to Dell's

website. Dell's affiliates program provides a way for customers to support

the cause or organization of their choice through their Dell purchases.

Affiliate participants, such as igive.com and progressivefunds.com,

include organizations and causes on different sides of nearly every social

issue.

Some of the organizations participating through Dell affiliates such as

igive.com and progressivefunds.com., promote handgun rights, others

promote handgun control. Handgun Control Inc. (HCI) has been reported as

one organization that participates in this program. Others including The

Gun Owners Foundation and the Michigan Coalition for Responsible Gun

Owners Foundation, Inc. also participate through Dell affiliate igive.com.



The only organizations prohibited from participating in Dell's affiliates

program are those that promote sexually explicit material; promote

violence; promote discrimination based on race, sex, religion,

nationality, disability, sexual orientation or age; or promote illegal

activities.



3/01/02 Update

The free computer offer from Dell is a hot topic in much of the email I have received to date. I have since purchased a notebook computer elsewhere so I hope that issue is settled.



Again I thank everyone for your thoughts and comments. I will say I don't agree with some of the letters but we are Americans, we have the right to free speech.

Please keep in mind when reading postings on my site. I have no public relations department to draft and polish my postings. I think long and hard about what needs to be said and I post it. Please forgive me for being a little crude in my writing, keep in mind I am a Pistolsmith not a writer.

I am doing my best to keep up with the email, over 1000 to date. I read every email I receive and respond to 99% of it.



3/02/02 Update

Please go to the following link at the NRA/ILA web site

http://www.nraila.org/ActionAlerts.asp?FormMode=Detail&ID=101

Title: DELL AND OUR RIGHT TO ARMS





Dell has issued a second statement, many of you have received via email. The letter contains the following statement:

""We have tried to make it right with our customer by giving him a free computer for his trouble and inconvenience .""

I have not accepted a computer from Dell. I have purchased a computer from another manufacturer.



Again I thank the Firearms community as a family for being so willing to come to my aid.

Fake e-mail still haunts FHP officer

If you happen to get an e-mail from Florida Highway Patrol Lieutenant Tony Bartolome warning about a new carjack scheme, please don't call him.

In fact, just ignore it.

The e-mail, which urges receivers to keep it going, has been kicking around for better than four years, said Bartolome, assigned to the patrol's investigations bureau in Orlando. It landed in news-press.com reporters' inboxes again this week.

It has now achieved the status of urban legend, according to the patrol's public information office.

The message warns receivers about carjackers who affix a piece of paper on the back window of cars in the hope the driver will notice it while backing out of a parking spot and get out of the car to remove it.

When that happens,the bandits pounce and speed off with the victim's car and possessions, the message says.

Well, as with most of these tales, it has a kernel of truth, Bartolome said.

""I got that information four and half years ago from the San Diego police,"" he said. ""I passed it on to a couple of friends. I wish I'd never sent it.""

Would the Last Honest Reporter Please Turn On the Lights?

An open letter to the local daily paper -- almost every local daily paper in America:

I remember reading All the President's Men and thinking: That's journalism. You do what it takes to get the truth and you lay it before the public, because the public has a right to know.

This housing crisis didn't come out of nowhere. It was not a vague emanation of the evil Bush administration.

It was a direct result of the political decision, back in the late 1990s, to loosen the rules of lending so that home loans would be more accessible to poor people. Fannie Mae and Freddie Mac were authorized to approve risky loans.

What is a risky loan? It's a loan that the recipient is likely not to be able to repay.

The goal of this rule change was to help the poor -- which especially would help members of minority groups. But how does it help these people to give them a loan that they can't repay? They get into a house, yes, but when they can't make the payments, they lose the house -- along with their credit rating.

They end up worse off than before.

This was completely foreseeable and in fact many people did foresee it. One political party, in Congress and in the executive branch, tried repeatedly to tighten up the rules. The other party blocked every such attempt and tried to loosen them.

Furthermore, Freddie Mac and Fannie Mae were making political contributions to the very members of Congress who were allowing them to make irresponsible loans. (Though why quasi-federal agencies were allowed to do so baffles me. It's as if the Pentagon were allowed to contribute to the political campaigns of Congressmen who support increasing their budget.)

Isn't there a story here? Doesn't journalism require that you who produce our daily paper tell the truth about who brought us to a position where the only way to keep confidence in our economy was a $700 billion bailout? Aren't you supposed to follow the money and see which politicians were benefitting personally from the deregulation of mortgage lending?

I have no doubt that if these facts had pointed to the Republican Party or to John McCain as the guilty parties, you would be treating it as a vast scandal. ""Housing-gate,"" no doubt. Or ""Fannie-gate.""

Instead, it was Senator Christopher Dodd and Congressman Barney Frank, both Democrats, who denied that there were any problems, who refused Bush administration requests to set up a regulatory agency to watch over Fannie Mae and Freddie Mac, and who were still pushing for these agencies to go even further in promoting subprime mortgage loans almost up to the minute they failed.

As Thomas Sowell points out in a TownHall.com essay entitled Do Facts Matter? ""Alan Greenspan warned them four years ago. So did the Chairman of the Council of Economic Advisers to the President. So did Bush's Secretary of the Treasury.""

These are facts. This financial crisis was completely preventable. The party that blocked any attempt to prevent it was ... the Democratic Party. The party that tried to prevent it was ... the Republican Party.

Yet when Nancy Pelosi accused the Bush administration and Republican deregulation of causing the crisis, you in the press did not hold her to account for her lie. Instead, you criticized Republicans who took offense at this lie and refused to vote for the bailout!

What? It's not the liar, but the victims of the lie who are to blame?

Now let's follow the money ... right to the presidential candidate who is the number-two recipient of campaign contributions from Fannie Mae.

And after Franklin Raines, the CEO of Fannie Mae who made $90 million while running it into the ground, was fired for his incompetence, one presidential candidate's campaign actually consulted him for advice on housing.

If that presidential candidate had been John McCain, you would have called it a major scandal and we would be getting stories in your paper every day about how incompetent and corrupt he was.

But instead, that candidate was Barack Obama, and so you have buried this story, and when the McCain campaign dared to call Raines an ""adviser"" to the Obama campaign -- because that campaign had sought his advice -- you actually let Obama's people get away with accusing McCain of lying, merely because Raines wasn't listed as an official adviser to the Obama campaign.

You would never tolerate such weasely nit-picking from a Republican.

If you who produce our local daily paper actually had any principles, you would be pounding this story, because the prosperity of all Americans was put at risk by the foolish, short-sighted, politically selfish, and possibly corrupt actions of leading Democrats, including Obama.

If you who produce our local daily paper had any personal honor, you would find it unbearable to let the American people believe that somehow Republicans were to blame for this crisis.

There are precedents. Even though President Bush and his administration never said that Iraq sponsored or was linked to 9/11, you could not stand the fact that Americans had that misapprehension -- so you pounded us with the fact that there was no such link. (Along the way, you created the false impression that Bush had lied to them and said that there was a connection.)

If you had any principles, then surely right now, when the American people are set to blame President Bush and John McCain for a crisis they tried to prevent, and are actually shifting to approve of Barack Obama because of a crisis he helped cause, you would be laboring at least as hard to correct that false impression.

Your job, as journalists, is to tell the truth. That's what you claim you do, when you accept people's money to buy or subscribe to your paper.

But right now, you are consenting to or actively promoting a big fat lie -- that the housing crisis should somehow be blamed on Bush, McCain, and the Republicans. You have trained the American people to blame everything bad -- even bad weather -- on Bush, and they are responding as you have taught them to.

If you had any personal honor, each reporter and editor would be insisting on telling the truth -- even if it hurts the election chances of your favorite candidate.

Because that's what honorable people do. Honest people tell the truth even when they don't like the probable consequences. That's what honesty means. That's how trust is earned.

Barack Obama is just another politician, and not a very wise one. He has revealed his ignorance and naivete time after time -- and you have swept it under the rug, treated it as nothing.

Meanwhile, you have participated in the borking of Sarah Palin, reporting savage attacks on her for the pregnancy of her unmarried daughter -- while you ignored the story of John Edwards's own adultery for many months.

So I ask you now: Do you have any standards at all? Do you even know what honesty means?

Is getting people to vote for Barack Obama so important that you will throw away everything that journalism is supposed to stand for?

You might want to remember the way the National Organization of Women threw away their integrity by supporting Bill Clinton despite his well-known pattern of sexual exploitation of powerless women. Who listens to NOW anymore? We know they stand for nothing; they have no principles.

That's where you are right now.

It's not too late. You know that if the situation were reversed, and the truth would damage McCain and help Obama, you would be moving heaven and earth to get the true story out there.

If you want to redeem your honor, you will swallow hard and make a list of all the stories you would print if it were McCain who had been getting money from Fannie Mae, McCain whose campaign had consulted with its discredited former CEO, McCain who had voted against tightening its lending practices.

Then you will print them, even though every one of those true stories will point the finger of blame at the reckless Democratic Party, which put our nation's prosperity at risk so they could feel good about helping the poor, and lay a fair share of the blame at Obama's door.

You will also tell the truth about John McCain: that he tried, as a Senator, to do what it took to prevent this crisis. You will tell the truth about President Bush: that his administration tried more than once to get Congress to regulate lending in a responsible way.

This was a Congress-caused crisis, beginning during the Clinton administration, with Democrats leading the way into the crisis and blocking every effort to get out of it in a timely fashion.

If you at our local daily newspaper continue to let Americans believe --and vote as if -- President Bush and the Republicans caused the crisis, then you are joining in that lie.

If you do not tell the truth about the Democrats -- including Barack Obama -- and do so with the same energy you would use if the miscreants were Republicans -- then you are not journalists by any standard.

You're just the public relations machine of the Democratic Party, and it's time you were all fired and real journalists brought in, so that we can actually have a daily newspaper in our city.

Speaking to an assembled crowd of new soldiers and their families at basic training graduation, Maj. Gen. Robert Brown was reported as “extremely hostile.”

His speech began with the “standard fluff” about duty, country, and the privileges of serving when such a small percentage of the country chooses a career in the Armed Forces. The speech took a turn, however, when the General reached a point in his remarks, obviously reused from previous ceremonies.

“Look to your left and right towards your brothers in arms,” said Brown. “You’re all now members of a proud warrior class, and heroes like your fathers before you who-”

The General stopped, took a deep breath and crumpled the sheet before flinging it to the ground.

“Fuck it! I can’t read shit like this anymore. Listen up you little bald bastards.”

The newly minted soldiers — trying to stay awake throughout the ceremony — shifted uncomfortably in their seats at the sudden change in tone.

“Some of you fucks won’t make it past AIT [Advanced Individual Training]. You’ll wash out with the rest of the weakness that never should have been here in the first place. Most of you who do graduate will immediately go to combat units and deploy overseas. Many of you will threaten to kill yourselves to get out of real work, although you wont have the balls to actually do it!”

Brown’s tone got softer as he attempted to clarify.

“Don’t get me wrong here. Many of you will actually go fight and engage the enemy in close combat. For that I salute you. It takes a hard motherfucker to go kill people you’ve never met just because we say so.”

The General then resumes his “motivational speech” to what he referred to as “the rest of you shit-stains.”

“You’ll most likely spend your deployment sitting on a FOB, manning guard towers, or waiting to go on patrols that get cancelled. I have a reality check for you all. Not everyone in this room is a hero. I don’t give a shit what the beer commercials say. You drag your buddy out of a grape hut after you’ve stabbed two Taliban in the eyes with a broken MRE spoon then you’re a motherfucking American Hero. You clear a trench with nothing but a sack of hand-grenades and your giant brass balls, then you’re a motherfucking hero! But walking through the desert for three months without hearing a shot fired in anger and posting pictures in your combat gear doesn’t make you a goddamned hero! I don’t care what your family says. They’re not heroes. Neither are your fucking wives. Hardest job in the Army, my ass! Damn it, I’m too old for this shit. Fuck you all.”

Gen. Brown then threw up his middle finger to the crowd and stormed off the stage, hustling into his waiting staff car.

The silence after his speech was soon broken by wild applause from the assembled Drill Sergeants and Officers responsible for training the young soldiers over the previous ten weeks.

Less enthusiasm was displayed by the families and the new graduates, who stormed the stage and attempted to destroy the auditorium to express their displeasure. The ensuing riot caused over a half-million dollars in damage, and Drill Sergeants were forced to kill 11 Privates in self-defense.

DEPARTMENT OF JUSTICE SENDS 25 ADVISORS TO IRAQ IN SUPPORT OF

PROVISIONAL AUTHORITY EFFORT TO RECONSTRUCT CRIMINAL SYSTEM



WASHINGTON, D.C. - Attorney General John Ashcroft announced today that the Department of Justice, through the Office of Overseas Prosecutorial Development, Assistance and Training (OPDAT) and International Criminal Investigation Training Assistance Program (ICITAP), has sent 25 career, criminal justice practitioners as advisors to Iraq to assist in the reconstruction of the judicial, prosecutorial and law enforcement sectors in the country. OPDAT sent a team of 13 judicial officials, including judges, prosecutors, public defenders and court administrators. ICITAP sent a team of 12 law enforcement professionals, including police officials and correctional experts. They are joined by senior criminal justice sector officials from Canada, Denmark and the United Kingdom.

The advisors will assist the Department of Defense, Office of Reconstruction and Humanitarian Assistance (ORHA). The Department of State, Bureau for International Narcotics and Law Enforcement Affairs (INL), will provide logistical and other support to the DOJ-led international team and is actively engaged in the effort to restore law and order in Iraq. INL has assigned a senior officer to serve as advisor to the Iraqi Minister of the Interior; will assist in standing up an Iraqi national civilian police force within existing structures; will coordinate training, advisory services, equipment and facility reconstruction as needed, based upon the results of the DOJ-led assessment; and is coordinating offers of assistance from other governments to rebuild the criminal justice sector in Iraq.

“For decades, a fortunate few Iraqis have escaped the reign of Saddam Hussein's tyranny and fear to find freedom in the United States,” said Attorney General Ashcroft. “Now, all Iraqis can taste liberty in their native land, and we will help make that freedom permanent by assisting them to establish an equitable criminal justice system, based on the rule of law and standards of basic human rights.”

The primary goals of the teams will be making initial assessments of the Iraqi judicial and law enforcement sectors; providing recommendations regarding the reestablishment of criminal justice institutions; as well as participating in the development of a strategic, long-range, sustainable plan for policing, prosecutions, corrections and court systems.

Justice personnel from OPDAT and ICITAP, along with their international counterparts, will provide assistance and expert, practical advice to the people and institutions of Iraq, but the Iraqis will make the choices of accepting which options will become final standards for the criminal justice system. The end result of the two programs will be the permanent transition of all judicial sector, civilian police and correctional operations to Iraqi control, leaving a sustainable infrastructure to maintain order, human rights and rule of law.

We asked if he had specifically studied Smartie snorting and if he could comment on the incidence and prevalence of Smarties-related maggot infestation. Here's his unedited reply.

We did not do a study on this in particular....however...we often see patients with foreign materials in their noses which can cause a variety of problems -- even years after the insult occurs. I recently removed an oyster shell from a 27 year old woman who had no idea it had been there. when I showed her what was in her nose, she said ""I'm going to kill them"" -- she remembered that when she was 5 or 6 years old, her older brothers were playing with these shells when they were at the beach, and she believed they inserted it into her nose when she was asleep. Just a funny anecdote that relates to the fact that things placed in the nose can remain there for years and cause problems over the long term. The sugar in smarties can irritate the nose acutely and over the long term. In addition to the local irritation from the foreign material and powder, over time, the smarties can lead to various overgrowth of bugs including viruses/fungi/bacteria. The quote regarding the maggots relates to the fact that when a foreign material, and especially a food, resides in the nose for a long period of time, infections may occur, worms may reside in the nose, even maggots may flourish in this environment -- and we have encountered such a problem in the past. Hopefully the thought of possible maggots in the nose will help dissuade children from snorting the smarties.

When asked in a followup if he had actually ever seen Smarties cause maggots, he replied, ""just a possibility. i have seen maggots in the nose from other food products in general.""

So, the one actual quoted source in the memo sent to parents describes the threat as only a ""possibility."" There's no way to verify the claims about respiratory arrest, laryngospasm, or leading to drugs.

I’m not questioning that this may be something that kids have tried — one source told me kids had been seen doing it on Tuesday. But I’m shocked at the sloppy, loopy, cut-and-paste content of the message that PMS sent home. Parents deserve better communication from those responsible for their children.

A NBC affiliate in Chattanooga, Tennessee inadvertently published what appears to be election night results. The results are published in the typical format used by mainstream news networks and display Presidential and Congressional results, the popular vote count, electoral votes, and percentage of precincts reporting in. The page was taken down soon after, but is available via the internet archive . The results of the Presidential contest name Hillary Clinton the winner with 41.7 million votes or 42% of the total. Trump, on the other hand, received 40.1 million votes or 40%. The results also gave Gary Johnson 8% while Jill Stein received 5%.

However, the posted premature results were not exclusive to NBC nor its Tennessee affiliate. The page was pulled directly from the content management platform, WorldNow.com, which is used by major networks including NBC, CBS, ABC, and Fox. These media companies use the platform, also known as Frankly , to power their news content. Many news affiliates display this on their webpage, including the NBC affiliate that posted the premature results, by showing “powered by Frankly” at the bottom of their pages . The results information can still be found on an FTP server at WorldNow.com. In addition, the leaked page showing national results, another page on the WorldNow.com FTP servers appear to show the Presidential election results state by state. These results show Clinton winning in states like Texas (42%-40%), Florida (44-40%), Pennsylvania (44-40%), and South Carolina (44-39%), all of which are “battleground” states as well as must-wins for Clinton.

Do these “results” definitively show the election is rigged? There’s no denying that the presence of these premature and obviously doctored results on the server of a top, new content management platform is downright suspicious. There’s no reason for these results to be there other than their planned illegal use on Election Day. Would the well-documented collusion between the Clinton campaign and mainstream media go so far as to rig the election in such a way – by reporting doctored results prepared days in advance? The Clinton campaign has already set a precedent for such behavior. The night of the California primary, which promised a large turn-out for Bernie Sanders, the Associated Press published an image saying Clinton had “clinched” the Democratic nomination. The image was titled “secret win v2,” indicating that the image declaring Clinton the “winner” had been pre-planned and had undergone more than revision. However, in the week to come, we can only expect more evidence of shady dealings as this high stakes and high drama election finally comes to a close.

 WWN Web Guide PLANET-DISSOLVING DUST CLOUD IS HEADED TOWARD EARTH!

Monday September 12, 2005





By MIKE FOSTER



CAMBRIDGE, Mass. -- Scared-stiff astronomers have detected a mysterious mass they've dubbed a ""chaos cloud"" that dissolves everything in its path, including comets, asteroids, planets and entire stars -- and it's headed directly toward Earth!



Discovered April 6 by NASA's Chandra X-ray Observatory, the swirling, 10 million-mile- wide cosmic dust cloud has been likened to an ""acid nebula"" and is hurtling toward us at close to the speed of light -- making its estimated time of arrival 9:15 a.m. EDT on June 1, 2014.



""The good news is that this finding confirms several cutting- edge ideas in theoretical physics,"" announced Dr. Albert Sherwinski, a Cambridge based astrophysicist with close ties to NASA.



""The bad news is that the total annihilation of our solar system is imminent.""



Experts believe the chaos cloud is composed of particles spawned near the event horizon of a black hole (a form of what's called Hawking Radiation) that have been distorted by mangled information spewed from the hole.



""A super-massive black hole lies about 28,000 light-years from Earth at the center of our galaxy,"" explained Dr. Sherwinski.



""Last year the eminent physicist Stephen Hawking revised his theory of black holes -- which previously held that nothing could escape the hole's powerful gravitational field. He demonstrated that information about objects that have been sucked in can be emitted in mangled form.



""It now appears that mangled information can distort matter.



""Just imagine our galaxy the Milky Way as a beautiful, handwritten letter.



""Now imagine pouring a glass of water on the paper and watching the words dissolve as the stain spreads. That's what the chaos cloud does to every star or planet it encounters.""



To avoid widespread panic, NASA has declined to make the alarming discovery public. But Dr. Sherwinski's contacts at the agency's Chandra X-ray Observatory leaked to him striking images of the newly discovered chaos cloud obliterating a large asteroid.



""It's like watching a helpless hog being dissolved in a vat of acid,"" one NASA scientist told Dr. Sherwinski.



Ordinarily, Hawkings Radiation is harmless.



""It's produced when an electron- positron pair are at the event horizon of a black hole,"" Dr. Sherwinski explained. ""The intense curvature of space-time of the hole can cause the positron to fall in, while the electron escapes.""



But when ""infected"" by mangled information from the black hole, the particles become a chaos cloud, which in turn mangles everything it touches.



""If it continues unchecked, the chaos cloud will eventually reduce our galaxy to the state of absolute chaos that existed before the birth of the universe,"" the astrophysicist warned.



Some scientists say mankind's best hope would be to build a ""space ark"" and hightail it to the Andromeda Galaxy, 2.1 million light-years away.



""We wouldn't be able to save the entire human population, but perhaps the best and the brightest,"" observed British rocket scientist Dr. David Hall, when asked about the feasibility of such a project.



But even if such a craft could be built in time, evacuating Earth might prove fruitless if theories about the origin of the chaos cloud are correct.



""A black hole at the center of Andromeda is about 15 times the size of the one in our own galaxy,"" Dr. Sherwinski noted. ""It might be like jumping out of the frying pan into the fire.""



Speaking under the condition of anonymity, a senior White House official said the president's top science advisors are taking the findings in stride.



""This is a lot like global warming, where the jury is still out on whether it's real or not,"" said the official.



""The existence of this so called chaos cloud is only a theory. Americans shouldn't panic until all the facts are in.""

SACRAMENTO, CA—The California legislature unveiled plans last week for a new tax on the privilege of breathing.

The ""Check Your Oxygen Privilege Act"" will be voted on later this week. If passed into law, Californians will pay a progressive tax on inhaling oxygen and exhaling carbon dioxide, with wealthier residents paying as much as 40% of their income for every breath they take. The poorest tax bracket may receive a subsidy for their breaths under the new model.

https://www.snopes.com/fact-check/queen-elizabeth-remove-obamas-guest-list/,"queen elizabeth removed the obamas from the guest list for prince harry and meghan markle's wedding after she learned that michelle obama tried to ""sneak a spot.""",false,"['barack obama', 'fake news', 'just news usa', 'michelle obama', 'queen elizabeth', 'royal wedding', 'your news wire', 'yournewswire.com']",2017/12/06,David Emery,['http://archive.is/1cJLE'],http://archive.is/1cJLE,1,lucas,http://archive.is/,"For eight years, Michelle Obama genuinely thought she was a queen and expected to be treated like one. Now that she’s a regular citizen, she’s having a hard time of letting go of her former status as the (failed) first lady and keeps trying to push her way into every major social scene where she doesn’t belong and is apparently not invited.

When she heard the news that Prince Harry was marrying a black American girl, she assumed it was her place to be on that guest list, which has to be approved by the Queen of England herself. Michelle made a desperation move to sneak a spot on that exclusive guest list and as soon as the real queen found out what the wannabe royalty did, she delivered a brutal beatdown that was definitely deserved.

As soon as the big news about the royal engagement of Prince Harry and an American actress Meghan Markle was announced, the Obamas saw an opportunity to edge their way into the elites, like a couple of desperate kids trying to hang with the popular crowd at school. Barack immediately got on social media to beat President Trump to the congratulatory punch. He has a lot more time on his hands than the Commander-in-Chief who is busy cleaning up his mess.

Barack practically stalked the prince on Twitter and made a post within seconds of the news coming out, which perhaps had an undertone of letting the royals know that he and Michelle were available that day to attend.

The Obamas know what they are doing when it comes to getting attention on themselves and this post was no exception. It garnered a whopping 1 million “likes” on it which both he and Michelle were likely elated about since the royal family was likely sure to see it.

The exposure of this post sparked rumors that the Obamas would likely be added to the guest list in the current president and first lady’s place, the Independent reported. While Barack was making desperate tweets to secretly get on the guestlist, Michelle was doing something worse to shove the Trumps aside and ensure her spot, even though the honor is typically reserved for the current president and first lady.

Michelle has been making the speaking engagement rounds lately to rack in hundreds of thousands of dollars to trash Trump. Her recent trip to Canada was no exception as she combined it with a hidden mission of getting to the royal wedding.

The former first lady had been invited as the keynote speaker in addressing the “Economic Club of Toronto,” when she deviated from her planned remarks to double down on her and Barack’s desperate attempt to kiss up to the Queen of England.

According to Page Six, Michelle took the opportunity to make fun of President Trump then immediately gushed over the queen. Both conversation deviations had no place in an event like this, but for calculated Michelle, it has a passive-aggressive purpose of saying that Trump wasn’t fit for her guest list, but since she loves the queen so much, she should get a spot.

“After being introduced by Canada’s first lady, Sophie Trudeau, Obama told the crowd that it is ‘never a good idea’ to put your first thought in the morning on social media, and never a good idea to ‘tweet from bed,’ which appears to be one of the president’s favorite pastimes, presuming that he is actually in bed when he tweets at 3 a.m,” Page Six reported.

“Going on about effective communication, and the importance of doing drafts, Obama went on, ‘Then you need to edit and spell-check it.’ The 45-minute conversation, hosted by the Economic Club of Toronto, flowed into a bunch of amusing side stories, including her memories of being awestruck when meeting Queen Elizabeth of England.”

“’What do you do with the queen? I touched her. She touched me first,’ she said, adding that her dream dinner guest would be Jesus, whom she’d serve pizza.”

It’s well known that the respect, proper etiquette, and holding a high-level of decorum is important to the royal family and by painting a picture that Trump can’t control himself, Michelle thought she was making him look like a bad person to have at the wedding.

However, the bigger motive in her comments was to cover up her actual faux-pas with the Queen when, not surprisingly, brash Michelle showed a complete lack of respect and protocol when she got a little too touchy with her bullying her way into a hug and pushing her toward a chair, The Guardian previously reported.

The Queen felt so grossly disrespected by Michelle that she royally snubbed the former first lady after the touchy-feely offense. When she flew into London with her mother and daughters in tow, expecting an audience with Queen Elizabeth only, she received a big slap-in-the-face instead, the Globe reported. Instead of spending the day with Michelle and her family who flew in to meet with her, the Queen ditched her and went off the horse race instead.

Michelle may think she’s royalty and even try to act like it, but she’s got nothing on the actual Queen of England who’s the real deal and put her in her place when she changed plans. The Queen does what she wants which hopefully means that she kicks her off the coveted guest list too.",Queen Just Gave Michelle Royal Beatdown After She Tried To Sneak A Spot On Wedding Guest List,2017-12-06 21:03:18+00:00,[],"['shes', 'queen', 'sneak', 'lady', 'gave', 'royal', 'michelle', 'spot', 'list', 'wedding', 'trump', 'guest', 'tried', 'president', 'place']","Michelle made a desperation move to sneak a spot on that exclusive guest list and as soon as the real queen found out what the wannabe royalty did, she delivered a brutal beatdown that was definitely deserved.

Concerning “the Great American Eclipse,” Concerning “the Great American Eclipse,” Brooklyn Law School professor Alice Ristroph writes in the rapidly deteriorating magazine, “there live almost no black people” “along most of its path.”

The Atlantic’s longwinded law professor assures readers that “implicit bias of the solar system” is “presumably” not the cause of eclipse’s failure to affect enough black people.

“Still, an eclipse chaser is always tempted to believe that the skies are relaying a message.”

Oregon, where the eclipse will first appear in the continental United States, “is almost entirely white.” “There are very few black Oregonians, and this is not an accident.” It’s totally on purpose in 2017, The Atlantic claims, because the Pacific Northwest state had a “racial exclusion” clause in its original 1857 constitution.

“It was a feel-good vote that I suppose will make it appear that they voted to ban FGM — they did not.”

Those are the words of Republican Rep. Karen Gerrish of Lebanon.

Rep. Gerrish was reacting to news out of the Coliseum on the Kennebec that the Maine State House passed a ban Thursday on Female Genital Mutilation in the Pine Tree State.

However, the bill passed in the House was nothing more than political theater — a show bill.

On Wednesday, the State Senate unanimously passed LD 1904, the strict FGM ban holding the mutilator, consenting parents/guardians and the transporters accountable for this barbaric form of child abuse.

That is not the bill the House passed.

First, the House brought forward one of the two minority reports from the Criminal Justice and Public Safety Committee — that the bill ‘ought not to pass.’ And the motion almost prevailed.

In fact, 65 swamp creatures — entirely made up of Democrats and independents — voted AGAINST banning FGM.

“Unfortunately, I am not surprised at all,” said Rep. Gerrish, the ranking Republican on the CJPS Committee. “What did surprise me was the unanimous support in the Senate, and I thank them for understanding the seriousness of the issue. I did find it remarkable that 65 House members, primarily Democrats, supported the ‘ought not to pass’ motion. I expected some to back that motion, but much less. I expected maybe 25 or so of the far-Left liberal Democrats to support killing the bill outright. But 65, wow.”

Failing to kill the bill outright, Democrat “leadership” next brought forward the second of the minority report from the CJPS Committee. This one being the controversial amended bill, removing penalties for all accomplices to the crime.

In addition, the bill was further amended to remove the word “mutilation,” from the definition of this so-called Female Genital Mutilation ban.

The watered-down, feckless ban passed with mostly party-line support, in a 73-68 tally . Not a single Republican voted for the toothless version of the ban.

Now the bill heads back to the Senate, where Senators will decide if they want to stick to the bill they passed unanimously, or accept the toothless House version.

Multiple sources at the Capitol tell Maine First Media they expect the Senate to insist on their own version of the bill. The proposed ban would then go back to the House for one last chance to come to an agreement. However, there is little optimism that will happen.

“Ultimately, I believe it will die between the two bodies in non-concurrence,” Rep. Gerrish said. “It’s a very sad state of affairs for young immigrant girls in Maine. Votes like this have consequences. November should be interesting.”

Republican Rep. Heather Sirocki — who has been the leading champion fighting for a ban on Female Genital Mutilation — was the first to bring to Maine First Media’s attention Thursday morning that our neighbors in New Hampshire had joined the ranks of states banning this brutal form of ritual child abuse.

“New Hampshire passed strong anti-FGM legislation this morning,” Rep. Sirocki said. “This is a huge victory as it’s the 27th state to step forward.”

Unfortunately, it’s not looking like Maine will be the 28th.

To fully understand why the ban is next-to-meaningless without holding accomplices accountable, we recommend you read Rep. Sirocki’s explanation in this previous Maine First Media article

If you’re having a difficult time comprehending how any legislators could be against banning Female Genital Mutilation, the opposition has made their reasoning very clear. They fear offending the immigrant community and being labeled “racist.”

Female Genital Mutilation is the ritual cutting or removal of some or all of the external female genitalia. In some cultures, the vulva is sewn shut, only to be ripped open on the woman’s wedding night.

The practice is designed to curb sexual desire in women. Along with significant health risk to the young girls, women who suffer Female Genital Mutilation are left with life-long physical and emotional scarring.

To learn more about the horrific abuse, listen to FGM survivor, F.A. Cole’s testimony in front of the CJPS Committee. Cole fights through a panic attack to share her story with Maine Legislators in the hope it would save young daughters of Maine immigrants from suffering through the same terrifying experience.

Those outages have now killed eight elderly people trapped in a Hollywood nursing home without air conditioning, due to circumstances that FPL was warned about at least two days before the tragedy

Many of those powerless residents are now asking hard questions of the area's power monopoly, which has spent millions of dollars fighting policies that would have strengthened the grid in the event of a major storm like Irma and, more broadly, stemmed the carbon-fueled climate change likely fueling monster storms.

""I am one of the many that has now been without power for more than two days as a result of Hurricane Irma,"" Elise McKenna, a West Palm Beach resident, told New Times via email. ""My confusion came when so many of us lost power during the early hours of the storm that basically avoided us. We've been told time and time again that rate increases were to help prepare us for future storms.""

McKenna is far from alone. FPL's workers on the ground seem to be doing all they can to fix downed lines and restore power to homes, and they deserve huge credit for working around the clock in awful conditions.

But the company's corporate and government-relations wings have serious questions to answer this week after quashing regulations that could have made the energy grid stronger at a slight expense to FPL's billion-dollar bottom line.

But after Irma, which by most reports brought only Category 1-strength winds to South Florida, by some measures the company did even worse. Despite all of those upgrades, an even larger percentage of FPL's customer base — But after Irma, which by most reports brought only Category 1-strength winds to South Florida, by some measures the company did even worse. Despite all of those upgrades, an even larger percentage of FPL's customer base — 4.4 of 4.9 million customers , almost 90 percent — lost electricity this past weekend.

Granted, Wilma and Irma were different storms: Irma was larger and raked South Florida with its powerful dirty side. During Wilma, many Miamians were trapped without power for two weeks or more, and FPL promises it will fix most of Florida's east coast within a week. But the company also says harder-hit customers on the state's Gulf Coast could be out of power for 12 days or more. The same would likely have been true in Miami had Irma's eye wall churned through Dade County instead of Naples.

Even worse, some of FPL's highly touted storm-ready technology didn't work after Irma.

Before the hurricane hit, FPL directed residents to regularly check its mobile app and online service map to see if their homes had power — but on Tuesday, FPL was forced to apologize after many residents said they were either unable to access the map or were repeatedly given inaccurate information. (Two New Times reporters were given wrong info this week — one was told her power was back on, only to travel home and find out she was still in the dark.)

""Communication systems across Florida were impacted by Irma, causing issues with our reporting systems,"" FPL's website said Tuesday. ""We apologize if you were provided with incorrect status updates. We ask that you please re-report your outage if your power is still out.""

The fiasco, naturally, has angered some Floridians, who are already fairly ornery after being trapped in homes without air conditioning and hot water for multiple days.

""The website gives no indication as to when individuals can expect power to be restored,"" McKenna, the reader in West Palm, says. ""Their official, blanket statement says 'end of the upcoming weekend.' How are things this bad after tropical storm winds and spotty Cat 1 gusts? FPL is not doing right by our community, and no one is doing anything about it.""

But many Floridians wonder if the large number of residents without power and flubbed website are just the latest signs that the company has spent way too much on lobbying and government affairs and not nearly enough on hurricane-proofing the power grids it maintains in some of the most storm-prone areas of the world.

Thanks to power-company rules, it's impossible across Florida to simply buy a solar panel and power your individual home with it. You are instead legally mandated to connect your panels to your local electric grid.

More egregious, FPL mandates that if the power goes out, your solar-power system must power down along with the rest of the grid, robbing potentially needy people of power during major outages.

Astoundingly, state rules also mandate that solar customers include a switch that cleanly disconnects their panels from FPL's system while keeping the rest of a home's power lines connected. But during a disaster like the aftermath of Hurricane Irma, FPL customers aren't allowed to simply flip that switch and keep their panels going.

This past April, the Energy and Policy Institute caught an FPL lobbyist straight-up drafting anti-solar laws for Fort Myers state Rep. Ray Rodrigues, who also took a $15,000 campaign contribution from FPL this year.

FPL has also resisted some seemingly foolproof solutions to avoid storm outages, such as burying more lines. In a city that names its sports teams for hurricanes, a huge portion of FPL's power lines still sit above-ground and get blown apart even in tropical storm conditions.

The company's stubborn stance on burying lines has been on full display in an ongoing fight over 88 miles of new power lines it wants to build connecting to the Turkey Point Nuclear Generating Station in Homestead. That battle has dragged on for the better part of this decade, all because FPL has refused to bury lines.

Rick Scott said FPL could move ahead with the project , but local governments sued. This year, FPL and the City of Miami settled their suit, and the company agreed to bury five miles of lines as long as the city dropped the rest of its complaints. The settlement meant a different, larger stretch of lines would remain above-ground for the next 40 years.

Bigger picture, FPL has also resisted solutions that would cut down on its carbon footprint in a state disproportionately affected by sea-level-rise- and climate-change-fueled monster storms.

Instead of funneling money toward those extremely basic fixes, FPL has instead forced the public to pay for massive fossil-fuel and nuclear-energy plant upgrades. The company Instead of funneling money toward those extremely basic fixes, FPL has instead forced the public to pay for massive fossil-fuel and nuclear-energy plant upgrades. The company hiked rates by more than $811 million last year to build a back-up natural-gas power plant and is urging state regulators to hand the company a blank check to build two new nuclear reactors at Turkey Point. Those upgrades don't really help when power lines are blown to shreds, and both plants will end up spewing carbon pollution into the air. Hurricane Irma marks yet another moment to question whether Florida's four regulated, private power monopolies make any sense in a world threatened by climate change.

According to a March 2016 According to a March 2016 news release announcing a rate hike , FPL has apparently been studying the damage major storms such as Wilma and Hurricane Sandy caused to various electric grids:

FPL's updated storm hardening plan, also filed with the [Public Service Commission] today, outlines the company's 2016-2018 grid-strengthening initiatives, which build on the successes of improvements made since the program began in 2006 and incorporate lessons learned from major storms, such as 2012's Superstorm Sandy. By strengthening power lines and related infrastructure, hardening initiatives are designed to reduce outages and enable FPL to restore power for customers and help local communities recover more quickly when severe weather strikes.

But residents are now still asking why, if FPL had a decade to prepare for Irma, most of Miami's power grid went dead so quickly in Cat 1 conditions after 12 years of so-called resiliency efforts.

This past Tuesday, a New Times reporter toured the Little River Mobile Home Park on NW 79th Street in Miami. Peter Jean, a jovial resident who grew up in Haiti, pointed at a busted-up jumble of power lines and said that in the early hours of Sunday morning, the lines snapped and sparked a small fire in the trailer park.

Biography

Early years

Like nearly all aspects of Cesare Borgia's life, the date of his birth is a subject of conflict. However, it is accepted that he was born in Like nearly all aspects of Cesare Borgia's life, the date of his birth is a subject of conflict. However, it is accepted that he was born in Rome between 1474 and 1476, as the son of Cardinal Rodrigo de Lanzol y Borja, soon to become Pope Alexander VI , and the cardinal's mistress, Vannozza de' Cattanei. The Borgia family originally came from Spain and rose in the mid fifteenth century, when Cesare's great uncle Alonso Borgia (1378-1458), bishop of Valencia, was elected Pope Callixtus III in 1455. Cesare's father, as Pope Alexander VI , was the first pope who openly recognized the children he had with a mistress. (Several early popes also had children they acknowledged, some of whom even became popes themselves, but these were all legitimate sons conceived before their fathers had been appointed to the higher clergy.)

With brown eyes and orange hair, Cesare was acknowledged to be a beautiful child and grew to be a fleet-footed, tall, handsome man of great ambition, much like his father. He was initially groomed for a career in the church and was made bishop of Pamplona at the age of 15. Three years later, after legal studies in Perugia and Pisa and his father's election as Pope Alexander VI in 1492, Cesare was made cardinal and became Alexander's close adviser.

Cesare's religious vocation was never strong, and he gained a reputation at the papal court for his womanizing, lavish clothing, and hunting parties. Alexander VI staked his primary hopes for the Borgia family on Cesare's younger brother Giovanni, who was made duke of Gandía in eastern Spain and captain general of the military forces of the papacy, in which capacity he led campaigns in 1496, against factions of the nobility who had rebelled against Alexander's rule, especially the Orsini family. However, Giovanni was assassinated in 1497, under mysterious circumstances, and several contemporaries suggested that Cesare was his killer.

With a military career now open to him and his father in need of a trusted captain, on August 17, 1498, Cesare became the first person ever to resign as cardinal. Meanwhile, a key political marriage had been arranged between Cesare and Charlotte d’Albret, sister of King John III of Navarre in northern With a military career now open to him and his father in need of a trusted captain, on August 17, 1498, Cesare became the first person ever to resign as cardinal. Meanwhile, a key political marriage had been arranged between Cesare and Charlotte d’Albret, sister of King John III of Navarre in northern Spain . King Louis XII of France immediately named Cesare duke of Valentinois (southeastern France), securing his future nickname, ""Valentino.""

Military career

Cesare's alliance with Cesare's alliance with France , reinforced during the course of the Italian Wars, helped lay the foundation for his military political career, as did his father's ability to distribute patronage in ways that favored Cesare. Cesare's French marriage also secured the assistance of France in Alexander's plan not only to regain control in the rebellious areas of the Papal States but also to create a permanent political domain for the house of Borgia.

Cesare's first important victory came in support of Louis XII who had invaded Italy, in 1499, in an effort to press his claims against those of Ferdinand I of Spain regarding the kingdoms of Cesare's first important victory came in support of Louis XII who had invaded Italy, in 1499, in an effort to press his claims against those of Ferdinand I of Spain regarding the kingdoms of Milan in the north and Naples to the south of Rome. As captain general of the papal army, Cesare accompanied Louis in his victorious entrance into Milan.

Alexander now moved toward the creation of a Borgia domain in northern Italy. The pope deposed his vicars in the provinces of Romagna and Marche, and Cesare—with a number of Italian soldiers supported by 300 cavalry and 4,000 Swiss infantry provided by Louis XII—marched on Imola and Forlì in Romagna. These towns were ruled by Caterina Sforza, the mother of the Gonfaloniere (papal protector) from his father. In 1500, gifts to the pope associated with the creation of 12 new cardinals gave Alexander enough money to hire the forces of the powerful condottieri (mercenary leaders) Vitellozzo Vitelli, Gian Paolo Baglioni, Giulio and Paolo Orsini, and Oliverotto da Fermo. Under Cesare's command, these forces served to renew the campaign to expand the Papal States in Romagna. Alexander now moved toward the creation of a Borgia domain in northern Italy.

These towns were ruled by Caterina Sforza, the mother of the Medici military leader Giovanni dalle Bande Nere. After the conquest of Imola and Forlì, Cesare's French troops were withdrawn from him, but he returned to Rome to celebrate his triumph and received the prestigious title of papal(papal protector) from his father.

Cesare's forces went from victory to victory. Giovanni Sforza, the former husband of Cesare's sister Cesare's forces went from victory to victory. Giovanni Sforza, the former husband of Cesare's sister Lucrezia , was soon ousted from Pesaro. Pandolfo Malatesta lost Rimini. Faenza, too, surrendered, its young lord Astorre III Manfredi later being drowned in the Tiber river by Cesare's order. In May 1501, Cesare was created duke of Romagna.

Cesare now moved to add the lordship of the western seaport town of Piombino in condottieri managed the siege of Piombino, Cesare commanded the French troops in the sieges of Naples and Capua south of the Papal States. On June 24, 1501, his troops successfully stormed Capua, causing the fall of the Spanish power in southern Italy.

In June 1502, he set out for the region of Marche on Italy's east coast, southeast of Romagna, where he was able to capture the towns of Urbino and Camerino without a fight. It was at this time that In June 1502, he set out for the region of Marche on Italy's east coast, southeast of Romagna, where he was able to capture the towns of Urbino and Camerino without a fight. It was at this time that Niccolo Machiavelli , as an ambassador of Florence embedded with Cesare’s forces, came to so admire the Borgia prince's ruthlessly competent character and behavior.

Cesare's next step would be Bologna, the key city of Romagna. However, several of his condottieri, who feared Cesare's unbridled power, now set up a plot against him. His commanders Guidobaldo da Montefeltro and Giovanni Maria da Varano returned to Urbino and Camerino and Fossombrone and led a coalition of forces in revolt. Cesare, with inadequate troops, fought a successful defensive campaign against them until funds from the pope enabled him to rebuild his forces and work through diplomatic maneuvers to split the coalition aligned against him. He then called for a truce and negotiations, but treacherously imprisoned the remaining conspirators in the port city of Senigallia and had them executed for Cesare's next step would be Bologna, the key city of Romagna.

Despite being at the height of his power, Cesare could do nothing without continued papal patronage. While he was convalescent in Castel Sant'Angelo in Rome, he was able to create enough influence on the conclave to elect a new pope he believed would support him in Pius III. However, this pope's reign was shockingly short, lasting less than a month. After the new pope's death, Cesare seems to have been deceived into giving his support to the new likely candidate, Julius II, who in fact had never ceased being an enemy of the Borgias.

Vacating Rome and moving to Romagna to quench a revolt, Cesare was seized and imprisoned by his own former ally, Gian Paolo Baglioni, near Perugia. All his lands were forfeited to the Vacating Rome and moving to Romagna to quench a revolt, Cesare was seized and imprisoned by his own former ally, Gian Paolo Baglioni, near Perugia. All his lands were forfeited to the Papal States Exiled to Spain in 1504, he escaped from a Spanish prison two years later and joined his French brother-in-law, King John III of Navarre. In his service, Cesare died at the siege of the Spanish town of Viana in 1507, at the age of 31.

Marriage and children

Cesare and his wife Charlotte d'Albret were parents to a daughter, Louise Borgia, (1500-1553) who married first Louis II de La Tremouille, Governor of Burgundy, and secondly Philippe de Bourbon, Seigneur de Busset.

Cesare was also father to at least 11 illegitimate children, some of whom became well known. Rumors that he fathered a daughter through an incestuous relationship with his sister are considered unfounded.

Legacy

Not so holy family: Cesare Borgia (left) with father Rodrigo ( Pope Alexander VI ) and sister Lucrezia.

Cesare Borgia has been the subject of many legends regarding his ruthlessness and cruelty. He and his father, Pope Cesare Borgia has been the subject of many legends regarding his ruthlessness and cruelty. He and his father, Pope Alexander VI , are considered by many to be the epitome of power-hungry corruption surrounding the Renaissance papacy. His family became the brunt of sermons by the likes of puritanical preachers such as Savanorola, as well as vicious propaganda by various political rivals. He has been featured prominently, nearly always portrayed as a villain, in numerous motion pictures and modern or contemporary novels.

However, Cesare was also a brilliant military commander and a skillful statesman. He was greatly admired by The Prince and advised politicians to imitate Cesare. Two episodes were particularly impressive to Machiavelli: The method by which Borgia pacified the Romagna, and his tactics leading up to the execution of his rebellious captains in Senigallia. However, Cesare was also a brilliant military commander and a skillful statesman. He was greatly admired by Niccolò Machiavelli , who was at Borgia's court from October 7, 1502 through January 18, 1503. During this time Machiavelli wrote regular dispatches to his superiors in Florence , many of which have survived and are published in Machiavelli's collected works. Machiavelli also used many of Borgia's exploits and tactics as examples inand advised politicians to imitate Cesare. Two episodes were particularly impressive to Machiavelli: The method by which Borgia pacified the Romagna, and his tactics leading up to the execution of his rebellious captains in Senigallia.

However, Machiavelli's praise for Borgia as the ideal of a prince unconstrained by moral conscience is subject to a great deal of controversy. Some scholars see in Machiavelli's Borgia the precursor of a parade of moral outrages carried out by various rulers, culminating in the heinous state crimes in the twentieth century.

A man of scientific rather than artistic interests, Cesare Borgia briefly employed A man of scientific rather than artistic interests, Cesare Borgia briefly employed Leonardo da Vinci as military architect and engineer.

A little known fact about Cesare Borgia is that, according to the French writer A little known fact about Cesare Borgia is that, according to the French writer Alexandre Dumas and others, his handsome appearance seems to have influenced many images of Jesus Christ painted during and subsequent to his career.

https://www.snopes.com/fact-check/michigan-right-to-farm-act-repealed/,"in june 2016, michigan residents lost the ""right to farm,"" keep chickens, or maintain bee hives due to a change in existing law.",false,"['homesteading', 'illegal sustainable living', 'michigan', 'right to farm', 'survivalism', 'urban farming']",2016/05/31,Kim LaCapria,['http://archive.is/0vPSq'],http://archive.is/0vPSq,1,Mohamed,http://archive.is/,"Michigan residents lost their “right to farm” this week thanks to a new ruling by the Michigan Commission of Agriculture and Rural Development. Gail Philburn of the Michigan Sierra Club told Michigan Live, the news changes “effectively remove Right to Farm Act protection for many urban and suburban backyard farmers raising small numbers of animals.”

Backyard and urban farming were previously protected by Michigan’s Right to Farm Act. The Commission ruled that the Right to Farm Act protections no longer apply to many homeowners who keep small numbers of livestock.

Kim White, who raises chickens and rabbits, said, “They don’t want us little guys feeding ourselves. They want us to go all to the big farms. They want to do away with small farms and I believe that is what’s motivating it.”

The ruling will allow local governments to arbitrarily ban goats, chickens and beehives on any property where there are 13 homes within one eighth mile or a residence within 250 feet of the property, according to Michigan Public Radio.

The Right to Farm Act was created in 1981 to protect farmers from the complaints of people from the city who moved to the country and then attempted to make it more urban with anti-farming ordinances. The new changes affect residents of rural Michigan too. It is not simply an urban or suburban concern.

Shady Grove Farm in Gwinn, Michigan is the six and a half acre home to 150 egg-laying hens that provide eggs to a local co-op and a local restaurant. The small Michigan farm also homes sheep for wool and a few turkeys and meat chickens to provide fresh healthy, local poultry.

“We produce food with integrity,” Randy Buchler told The Blaze about Shady Grove Farm. “Everything we do here is 100 percent natural — we like to say it’s beyond organic.

We take a lot of pride and care in what we’re doing here.” Shady Grove Farm was doing its part to bring healthy, local, organic food to the tables of Gwinn residents, and it mirrors the attitudes of hundreds of other small farming operations in Michigan and thousands of others popping up around the nation.

The ruling comes within days of a report by The World Health Organization that stated the world is currently in grave danger of entering a post-antibiotic era. The WHO’s director-general Dr. Margaret Chan argued that the antibiotic use in our industrialized food supply is the worst offender adding to the global crisis.

“The Michigan Agriculture Commission passed up an opportunity to support one of the hottest trends in food in Michigan – public demand for access to more local, healthy, sustainable food,” Gail Philbin told MLive.

Meanwhile, neighboring Indiana Governor Mike Pence signed Senate Bill 179 a few weeks before which freed up poultry and egg sales from local and state regulation.

Yesterday, the USDA Secretary Tom Vilsack announced massive funding to support research about small and medium-sized family farms, such as small farms ability to build-up local and regional economic systems. “There’s a lot of unnecessary legal action being taken against small farms who are doing good things in their communities,” said Randy Buchler, who is also on the board of directors for the Michigan Small Farm Council.

The Michigan Small Farm Council actively fought to support Michigan farming freedom, but ultimately the Commission voted to approve the new restrictions.

“Farm Bureau has become another special interest beholden to big business and out of touch with small farmers, and constitutional and property rights of the little guy,” Pine Hallow Farms wrote to the Michigan Small Farm Council.

The Michigan Farm Bureau endorsed the new regulatory changes. Matthew Kapp, government relations specialist with Michigan Farm Bureau, told MLive that the members weighed in and felt that people raising livestock need to conform to local zoning ordinances.

The country has a population of six million, but there are estimated to be at least two million publicly-owned firearms, including about 600,000 automatic rifles and 500,000 pistols.

This is in a very large part due to Switzerland's unique system of national defence, developed over the centuries.

Instead of a standing, full-time army, the country requires every man to undergo some form of military training for a few days or weeks a year throughout most of their lives.

Between the ages of 21 and 32 men serve as frontline troops. They are given an M-57 assault rifle and 24 rounds of ammunition which they are required to keep at home.

Once discharged, men serve in the Swiss equivalent of the US National Guard, but still have to train occasionally and are given bolt rifles. Women do not have to own firearms, but are encouraged to.

Few restrictions

In addition to the government-provided arms, there are few restrictions on buying weapons. Some cantons restrict the carrying of firearms - others do not.

The government even sells off surplus weaponry to the general public when new equipment is introduced.

Guns and shooting are popular national pastimes. More than 200,000 Swiss attend national annual marksmanship competitions.

But despite the wide ownership and availability of guns, violent crime is extremely rare. There are only minimal controls at public buildings and politicians rarely have police protection.

Mark Eisenecker, a sociologist from the University of Zurich told BBC News Online that guns are ""anchored"" in Swiss society and that gun control is simply not an issue.

Some pro-gun groups argue that Switzerland proves their contention that there is not necessarily a link between the availability of guns and violent crime in society.

Low crime

But other commentators suggest that the reality is more complicated.

Switzerland is one of the world's richest countries, but has remained relatively isolated.

It has none of the social problems associated with gun crime seen in other industrialised countries like drugs or urban deprivation.

Despite the lack of rigid gun laws, firearms are strictly connected to a sense of collective responsibility.

HARRY THE WIZ IS THE WRONG BIZ







There is a peculiar people out there -- anti-Harry Potter parents.



J.K. Rowling's highly readable and imaginative Harry Potter series -- about a young wizard's tutelage and mastery of the black arts -- is a publishing phenomenon. But these parents see him as Satan's secret agent sent to surreptitiously ensnare souls.



The world has morphed into Planet Potter. The series has been translated into 42 languages, including Zulu. Kids wear Potter PJs, eat from Potter plates and sleep on Potter pillows.



Young witch/wizard wannabes wait in 'round the block lines for the film version of Harry Potter and the Sorcerer's Stone. ""I want to be a wizard,"" responded the two young sons of actor Rob Lowe when asked what they gleaned from the movie.



San Diego movie critic Holly McClure lauds the movie's excellence but says bluntly both print and celluloid versions ""Lay it out there; it's about witchcraft.""



Carol Rookwood, head teacher in a Church of England school, banned Potter saying, ""The Bible is clear about issues such as witchcraft, demons, the devil and the occult. It says clearly from Genesis to Revelation that they are real, powerful and dangerous ... (we) should have nothing to do with them.""



But for parents vexed by video games, Harry Potter is the Holy Grail. Kids once hunched in front of Sony Play Stations now curl up with Harry, reading the voluminous texts for hours on end.



The IRS recognizes certain witchcraft sects as religions but church/state issues have been jettisoned here. Public school teachers read Harry Potter aloud as captivated students sit transfixed. Thomas Jefferson Middle School in Port Washington, Wis., sent 500 students to the film.



Still, headlines read, ""Parents Protest Potter."" According to a July 2000 Gallup Poll, Harry gets nixed by 8 percent of parents with children under 18. ""The books have a serious tone of death ... of evil,"" says Columbia, S.C., parent, Elizabeth Mounce, when addressing the state Board of Education.



To some, Harry is a Trojan horse -- a clever vehicle able to implant a sort of satanic receptor in the human soul -- making youngsters vulnerable to demonic activity and possible infestation. Who can forget Linda Blair in ""The Exorcist""?



""The power of Satan ... is very dangerous, and our children have gone into it,"" says Caryl Matrisciana, occult expert and producer of the video ""Harry Potter: Witchcraft Repackaged.""



Potter fans argue that Harry cavorts in a realm similar to that in C.S. Lewis' Chronicles of Narnia. But the Lewis' allegory draws readers to the beneficent Judaic/Christian God, whereas Harry has no sovereign governing his use of self-seeking manipulative power.



Contrast Harry Potter and ""Idylls of the King,"" Alfred Lord Tennyson's poetic masterpiece interpreting Arthurian Legend. Tennyson's sorcery is recognized as mythological evil while much of Harry's hocus-pocus -- packaged as harmless fantasy -- is genuine. Necromancy, blood sacrifice, incantations, and so on, mirror actual occult ritual.



""There is a tremendous smoke screen in the (Potter) PR machinery,"" Matriciana says. ""Does being packaged as 'fantasy' mean we're not to question content?""



Rowling exhaustively researched the occult to better animate her characters' skills. According to Iowa Licensed Master Social Worker, William Schnoebelen, former Church of Satan member, Potter characters execute satanic ceremony and technique as practiced today.



Schnoebelen, also a former instructor of witchcraft, says Potter imitators are blind to the entities that respond from ""an unknown beguiling arena. It seems so enchantingly fun and innocent, but they are trafficking in evil spirits. The books definitely draw kids to witchcraft.""



High Priest Egan of The First Church of Satan in Salem, Mass., celebrates Harry's contribution, saying, ""Harry is an absolute godsend ... we've had more applicants than we can handle lately.""



Former Satanic mystic, Johanna Michaelson, says, ""There is a beautiful side of evil -- deceptive, subtle, adorned with all manner of spiritual refinements, but no less from the pit of hell than that which is blatantly satanic.""



Witchcraft and sorcery permeate Rowling's books and parents would do well to attempt the impossible; steer kids clear of Hogwarts School of Witchcraft and Wizardry.



At the very least, children determined to explore Harry Potter's realm should be grounded in a flame-retardant faith, that enables them to ride the lightning and still walk away unscathed.

The petition can be found at the end. Make sure to pass this around if it hits home with you.** America, we have a problem.

There is someone who needs to be impeached, fired, and removed from office.

There is a very particular leader in our country that is refusing to do the job that she was elected by the American people to do.

Not only is she refusing to do her job, her policies are dangerous for LEO’s and treasonous to America. We can no longer sit idly by and be abused by this woman and her selfish ideas of how she thinks America should be.

Friday President Trump announced that he would be signing a temporary deal that would fund our federal government until February 15, 2019 in order to make sure federal government employees would get paid.

The big surprise was that this temporary deal came without any money funding the border wall, which has been the catalyst in the stand off between Trump and the Nancy Pelosi led Democrats. After President Trump’s announcement came a fury of feelings from both sides of the aisle. What ensued was based off of President Trump declaring that if there is no deal reached by February 15th, he would be declaring a national emergency to fund the wall… and Nancy Pelosi leading a braggadocious celebration that she had defeated Trump.

Social media exploded with reactions to the surprising move.

But many people that were most impacted by this temporary deal were Law Enforcement Officers. The real issue at hand is which side, Trump or Pelosi, really has LEO’s best interest at heart, and American’s best interest at heart? Who was willing to give in on what they were demanding in order to re-open the government so that the 800,000 federal workers who were not getting paid could receive their paychecks?

I’m going to argue in favor of President Trump and explain why Nancy Pelosi is not only a traitor to LEO’s, she is a traitor to the American people.

Let’s look at the numbers.

These are the estimates from the Senate Appropriations Committee on the number of LEO’s that were not getting paid while the government was shut down.

Law enforcement More than 41,000 federal law enforcement and correctional officers were not getting paid, including: 2,614 Bureau of Alcohol, Tobacco, Firearms and Explosives (ATF) agents.

16,742 Bureau of Prisons correctional officers.

13,709 FBI agents.

3,600 Deputy U.S. Marshals.

4,399 Drug Enforcement Administration (DEA) agents.

Homeland security Up to 88 percent of Department of Homeland Security employees were not getting paid, including: 53,000 TSA employees.

54,000 Customs and Border Protection agents and customs officers.

42,000 Coast Guard employees. President Trump’s decision to sign a temporary deal to re-open the government, without the funding for the border wall, shows how much compassion he feels towards these federal employees. Nancy Pelosi, Chuck Schumer, and the Democrats complete unwillingness to negotiate over the past 35 days shows they don’t care at all about people not getting paid to do their jobs while they work. After all, Pelosi, Schumer and all of Congress received their paychecks the entire time the government was shut down. Remember President Trump works for free because he donates every one of his Presidential paychecks, so his motivation was not related to money. Worse than not caring about LEO’s getting paid, Nancy Pelosi also votes and passes laws that are dangerous to our security and dangerous to the lives of LEO’s. Nancy Pelosi’s Sanctuary Policies that provide aid, comfort, and protection to illegal aliens make it extremely difficult for LEO’s to preform their jobs, which they took an oath and swore to uphold and enforce the laws of this land. For example, in March, Nancy Pelosi, who accused the Trump administration and ICE agents of carrying out “cowardly attacks” on illegal immigrants, issued the statement after the Justice Department filed a lawsuit against California, claiming three recently passed state laws are deliberately interfering with federal immigration enforcement. Nancy Pelosi’s disdain for ICE is obvious from her statement. “The people of California will not be bowed by the Trump administration’s brazen aggression and intimidation tactics,” the California Democrat said. “Californians will continue to proudly keep our doors open to the immigrants who make America more American. We will fight this sham lawsuit and will fight all cowardly attacks on our immigrant communities.” Nancy Pelosi clearly chooses illegals over ICE agents. Her support of sanctuary and protection for illegal criminals is truly unreal for an elected representative of the American people, and treasonous behavior puts ICE agents in danger and makes their ability to do their jobs extremely difficult. Perhaps one of the most infuriating recent examples of how Nancy Pelosi and her sanctuary policies hurt LEO’s is the murder of Corporal Singh. Singh was a legalized immigrant to the US and was living his American dream of being a police officer in the state of California. Corporal Singh was murdered by illegal alien, Gustavo Perez Arraiga, who was a dangerous gang member. California’s sanctuary law includes more than 800 exceptions for violent crimes and felonies and bars police from asking people about their citizenship status. These are laws that Nancy Pelosi supports because she cares more about illegal aliens than she cares about legal citizens and LEO’s being able to perform their jobs safely. Do you know what Nancy Pelosi’s response to the murder of Corporal Singh was? Nothing. Not a peep. No response to the murder of a legal immigrant who was serving the people of California as a police officer. Zero. However, Nancy Pelosi did issue comments that day. She decried the deaths of two illegal immigrant children that died the same day, bashed the government shut down, and on New Year’s Eve she promoted her upcoming MSNBC special. Corporal Singh worked for Newman Police Department which was not far from her district in San Francisco. President Trump called the family of Corporal Singh expressing his condolences and again cried out for the need for a border wall and the dangers of illegals. At this point, can we just say that Nancy Pelosi seems to care less about LEO’s lives? To her Blue Lives don’t matter. Only Illegal Lives do… or should we say illegal votes.

I will go further. Nancy Pelosi needs to be arrested for treason!

This House Majority Leader, Nancy Pelosi, was first elected to the House of Representatives in 1987, some 32 years ago, and is now 78-years-old. The average age of retirement in the US is 62-years-old. Americans can start collecting Social Security at age 62. Yet Nancy Pelosi refuses to retire and pry her fingers off of her powerful seat, California’s 12th Congressional District. At this point, it would be easy for me to make a case for term limits for all elected Congressional Representatives. However in this case, I’m actually going to argue for a case of treason. First and foremost, our elected Representatives take an oath to office swearing to support and defend the Constitution of the United States against all enemies, foreign and domestic. 5 U.S. Code § 3331 – Oath of office states:

“An individual, except the President, elected or appointed to an office of honor or profit in the civil service or uniformed services , shall take the following oath: “I, AB, do solemnly swear (or affirm) that I will support and defend the Constitution of the United States against all enemies, foreign and domestic; that I will bear true faith and allegiance to the same; that I take this obligation freely, without any mental reservation or purpose of evasion; and that I will well and faithfully discharge the duties of the office on which I am about to enter. So help me God.” This section does not affect other oaths required by law.” According to Article 1, Section. 6 of the United States Constitution states this about why Senators and Representatives can be arrested:

The Senators and Representatives shall receive a Compensation for their Services, to be ascertained by Law, and paid out of the Treasury of the United States. They shall in all Cases, except Treason, Felony and Breach of the Peace, be privileged from Arrest during their Attendance at the Session of their respective Houses, and in going to and returning from the same; and for any Speech or Debate in either House, they shall not be questioned in any other Place.

According to 18 U.S. Code § 2381 – Treason is defined as follows:



Whoever, owing allegiance to the United States , levies war against them or adheres to their enemies, giving them aid and comfort within the United States or elsewhere, is guilty of treason and shall suffer death, or shall be imprisoned not less than five years and fined under this title but not less than $10,000; and shall be incapable of holding any office under the United States Our U.S. Constitution and U.S. Code of Law tells us that treason is a serious crime, even punishable by death. There are only three crimes that United States elected Representatives of the House or the Senate can be arrested for: treason, felony, and breach of peace. Given that Nancy Pelosi, upon taking her oath of office, swore to support and defend the U.S. against all enemies, why has she engaged in passing laws that provide Sanctuary to illegals, continue to oppose funding to a border wall to protect our national security, and obstruct any negotiations to fund the border wall ending the government shut down? Let’s break this down. Nancy Pelosi is worth hundreds of millions of dollars and is elected to SERVE America and Americans, yet every decision she makes using American’s tax dollars, is about making sure our southern border is open to drug cartels, human trafficking, and a full on illegal invasion. In the state of California, she is a major ring leader of the political organized crime ring that is destroying the beautiful state of California with their traitorous Sanctuary policies. These anti-American policies are designed to destroy the state and our country financially, guarantee illegal Democrat votes, and ruin beyond repair the sovereignty of the United States of America! Not only that, but Nancy Pelosi voted “Nay” on HR 3004 Kate’s Law, which was a bill that increases criminal penalties of undocumented immigrants reentering the United States after being deported once already. Kate Steinle, an American citizen, was murdered in San Francisco in Nancy Pelosi’s very own district, by an illegal alien who was a seven time felon and deported five times. Again Nancy Pelosi voted NO to Kate’s Law! Voted NO to protecting her own citizens! Voted NO against Americans over illegals! This clearly provides aid and and comfort to enemies to Americans.

Nancy Pelosi is a criminal, guilty of treason by refusing to lead her political party to fund the wall and border security measures that would protect our national security. Nancy Pelosi is a criminal guilty of treason by being a key member of a tyrannical government that has enslaved the American people into $21 trillion dollars in debt, which China owns most of our debt. Nancy Pelosi is a traitor to the American people who pay her paycheck and expenses for her service, security, staff, and travel, while she takes our hard earned tax dollars to send billions of our hard earned tax dollars to foreign governments, yet refuses to fund our border wall of $5.7 billion for our national security. Particularly she wants to send $10 billion to Mexico this year, yet refuses to meet with our president for lunch to work out a deal for our safety and government budget. Nancy Pelosi is a traitor to America because while she refuses to fund our border wall for our national security, she uses our hard earned tax dollars to pay her travel expenses to fly to Hawaii and vacation, then turning right around to fly and party in Puerto Rico with lobbyist, PACS, and celebrities, while simultaneously forcing a government shut down causing 800,000 federal workers to not get paid. Thanks to President Trump, they will get paid at least until Feb 15th. Nancy Pelosi is a traitor to the American people because she refuses to meet with Angel families yet boast continually about her Christianity and uses pious words to talk down anyone who stands in her path. Never forget she voted NO against Kate’s Law! The bottom line is America has a crisis. It is real. Walls work. Nancy Pelosi knows walls work and that is why she and other Democrats voted yes to fund $500 million of U.S. tax payer’s dollars in 2018 to fund a 287 mile border wall in Jordan to protect it against terrorist along it’s border with Syria and Iraq. We have drugs, human trafficking, and terrorist coming across our border daily and Nancy Pelosi refuses to fund OUR border wall. Nancy Pelosi refuses to protect America from enemies attacking us through our unprotected wide open border. Nancy Pelosi is breaking her oath of office to protect and defend the U.S. against enemies. Nancy Pelosi is giving aid and comfort to the millions of illegals who invade the U.S. by providing them with sanctuary and by refusing to fund the wall to protect our southern border from enemies who invade our lands. Nancy Pelosi will again refuse to fund the wall when February 15th arrives to shut down the government again. Nancy Pelosi will continue in her obstinance in order to continue her war with Trump. Nancy Pelosi is proving over and over she could care less about our nation’s laws, those who enforce our laws, and our national security. Nancy Pelosi is guilty of treason. Nancy Pelosi must be impeached, fired, and removed from office, for committing treason. Once upon a time in this country, The People gave a damn. Once upon a time The People stood for something. Once upon a time The People would stand up against wrongs and would take action to right them. Do something. Sign the petition to Impeach Nancy Pelosi. We need 100,000 signatures in 30 days in order for this petition to get a response from the White House. We need The People to take a stand and send a message that we will not tolerate this type of political corruption any longer. With everyone’s support, we can then move to the next level. It’s time.

21-year old Darrell Waterford, from Eugene in Oregon, was participating in a promotional video for Greenpeace, some 100 nautical miles away from the Australian city of Perth.

Along with four other members of the organization, Mr. Waterford decided to dive with some great white sharks in order to improve the marine predator’s public image and raise awareness about shark hunting.

The group shot some incredible footage during the first 30 minutes, as they swam with a group of sharks caressing and even hugging the large animals.

Unfortunately for the young American, one of the sharks suddenly became aggressive after being hugged and suddenly attacked him.

It attacked Mr. Waterford and tore off his right arm right below the elbow. The young man lost a large amount of blood, but was able to get out of the water and was rapidly taken to the hospital.

Huei Li Chong, the leader of the expedition, described the violent attack in an interview with the Australian Broadcasting Corporation.

“The shark seemed really friendly at first, but then it went totally berserk. It charged Darrell and bit off his hand in an instant, so we all hurried out of the water before it killed us.”

According to him, the shark might have turned aggressive after smelling blood in the water.

“Sharks can be affectionate an cuddly when they’re calm, but the smell of blood activates their predator instincts. It’s not their fault, and we shouldn’t hold them responsible.”

Huei Li Chong, who was diving with Mr. Waterford at the time of the attack, believes the shark may have become aggressive after smelling blood.

Greenpeace has been campaigning for years against shark finning, which consists of the removal of fins from sharks, often while the shark is alive.

Despite the organization’s efforts, finning has increased dramatically since 1997 largely due to the increasing demand for shark fins for shark fin soup and traditional cures.

Greenpeace has been trying for years to improve the white shark’s image in order to obtain an international ban, similar to the international treaty that applies to commercial whaling.

Several members of the organization now fear that this incident will compromise their campaign to restore the white shark’s image as a peaceful marine creature.

On June 27, 2017, my son Alec was found dead, alone in his Minneapolis apartment. It shouldn’t have happened.

Alec had Type 1 diabetes, a serious condition that is manageable with access to insulin and proper supplies. But Alec turned 26 years old on May 20 of last year, which meant that his coverage under my health insurance policy ended a few days later. Alec had a full-time, steady job. But, like a lot of US workers, he did not have good health insurance offered through his employer.

For Alec and others with diabetes, this presents a deadly situation. Many people with type 2 diabetes need regular access to insulin to live; all persons with Type 1 do. Insulin is a 95-year-old drug whose discoverers sold their patents for $1 each, but its price has increased over 1,000 percent since the late 1990s. A vial of the same insulin that was once sold for around $25 can now cost patients like Alec nearly $300, and many people need multiple vials per month to survive.

The pharmaceutical companies that sell insulin won’t disclose any details, but it is likely that this same vial is manufactured for just a few dollars. Which means that those companies are making huge profits and paying huge CEO salaries. The three insulin manufacturers have raised their prices in lockstep for many years now, prompting a class-action lawsuit and criminal investigations into collusion. Additionally, the insurance industry is also complicit in the drug pricing scheme.

For Alec, this meant that his insulin and supplies cost almost $1,300 a month. He and I together researched for months in advance about his health insurance options. They weren’t good. The best plan we found would cost him $450 a month for the premium with a whopping $7,600 deductible. That deductible meant he would be paying out-of-pocket for his medicine for many months anyway, so he decided to go without the plan until he could find a different job with benefits.

With the cost so high, Alec tried to ration his insulin. I have since learned that this is not uncommon. Globally, half of the people who need insulin can’t reliably get access to it. With 6 million people in the US insulin-dependent, and nearly 40 percent of Americans uninsured or facing high deductibles that leave their medicine costs uncovered, the crisis is occurring right here, too.

Endocrinologists here in the US report that as many as one in five of their patients are not able to afford their insulin. For many persons with diabetes, that means they land in the emergency room with diabetic ketoacidosis. For others, like Alec, they never get there. Just 27 days after his coverage under my insurance ended, I received the call no parent ever wants to get.

As you would imagine, my family and I are still grieving. But I’ve decided that sharing our story may help prevent someone else from going through what Alec did. There are a lot of proposals to increase access to affordable health coverage and to lower the price of medicines, including forcing drug companies to be transparent about their research costs and profits, and allowing Medicare to negotiate down the price it pays for prescription drugs. To me, they all boil down to one theme: Access to insulin, and other life-essential medicines, is a human right.

The inventor of insulin, Frederick Banting, believed that. When he was asked why he gave away his patent for $1, he replied, “Because insulin does not belong to me. It belongs to the world.” That spirit is being violated today, where there are thousands of GoFundMe pages devoted to people like Alec, desperately trying to cobble together the money they need for their monthly insulin.

There are a lot of good people working to change this, including US lawmakers. But it seems clear to me that significant movement toward universal access to essential medicines will only come when the affected patients and their loved ones help lead the way.

So I was happy to see that people with diabetes in Nevada were able to help push through a law that requires transparency in insulin pricing there. And that is why I support the patient group T1International‘s demand that insulin manufacturers disclose the profits they are making off of each vial and reverse their unjustified price increases. That is why I shared Alec’s story at a recent demonstration led by Type 1 diabetes patients outside the headquarters of insulin manufacturer Eli Lilly and Company, demanding increased transparency and lower prices.

As I told the patients and activists gathered there, my Alec was the best son anyone could ask for. He was loved by so many and I am so proud to have been his mom for the short 26 years I had with him. But he should still be here. I should not have buried my son at 26 because he couldn’t afford the one thing in life that was created to keep him alive.",I Had to Bury My 26-Year-Old Son Because He Couldn’t Afford Insulin,2018-02-01 05:00:00+00:00,"['Nicole Smith-Holt', 'Margaret Flowers', 'Kevin Zeese', 'Diane Archer']","['type', '26yearold', 'health', 'son', 'insurance', 'need', 'patients', 'access', 'price', 'alec', 'couldnt', 'bury', 'diabetes', 'afford', 'insulin']","Alec had Type 1 diabetes, a serious condition that is manageable with access to insulin and proper supplies.

Our commitment to serving the communities where we operate goes way back … all the way back to 1946. We keep that promise alive today through our dedication to serving new generations of families.

How do we do it? By creating welcoming spaces where all families can shop and find joy. By holding hands with partners and using the voice of our brands to bring communities together. By empowering the Target family—our team members across the country—to serve and support their local neighborhoods.

our policy

Target restricts the use of its parking lots and facilities to business use only. Individuals not employed by Target or by a vendor providing services to Target are prohibited from soliciting, distributing literature, selling merchandise or holding events at all times anywhere on Target-owned property or leased property when Target has a right to exclude, including parking lots and sidewalks.

how we enforce our policy

Some state laws protect limited forms of expressive activity in the common areas of large regional shopping centers. These protections generally do not apply to solicitation at or in front of Target stores, even if a store is located in a large regional shopping center. Additionallly, to ensure a distraction-free shopping experience in our stores, we take the following steps:

We ask solicitors and petitioners to respect our policy by ceasing their activities and leaving our property. However, often they refuse to comply.

We partner with local law enforcement agencies to assist us in having unwanted solicitors and petitioners removed from our property.

In certain circumstances, we file lawsuits to obtain court orders prohibiting solicitors from returning. This is not a quick process and may not result in the immediate removal of unwanted disturbances.

what you can do

Target firmly believes that our guests should enjoy a distraction-free shopping experience in our stores. If you feel harassed or bothered by a solicitor or petitioner outside a Target store, please alert a store team member. We appreciate your patience and patronage as we continue to do everything we can to provide you with a respectful, distraction-free shopping experience.

Based on Target's commitment to maintaining a distraction-free shopping experience for our guests, we do not allow Salvation Army bell ringers outside our store nationwide.

Soros faces charges of election tampering, wire fraud, electronics fraud and perjury — as well as several smaller charges of inciting violence and harassment — after accounting books found in his office prove he personally paid the Berkely protestors as well as the group of liberal trolls that “goated” 26 conservative Facebook pages in 2014.

If convicted, Soros could face 30 years in prison and fines up to $40 million. He also runs the risk of having his citizenship revoked and being deported to his home country of Hungary. He was released on $10 million bail.

The prosecutor said this is just the beginning of the case against Soros and that it could go right up the rungs of the democratic party, possibly all the way to Hillary Clinton and Barack Obama. The investigation is ongoing, but he says there is plenty of evidence to try and convict Soros on the charges he already faces.

Russian scientists developed the so-called «antidote» based on a 1959 scientific research published under the title “Organizing action of prenatally administered testosterone propionate on the tissues mediating mating behavior in the female guinea pig” by Charles H. Phoenix, an american researcher. The study concluded that “INAH [part of the hypothalamus] is dimorphic with sexual orientation, at least in men, and suggests that sexual orientation has a biological substrate”.

Synthetic xenoestrogens such as PCB’s, BPA and phthalates have been also been found to have estrogenic effects on living organisms and to disrupt the endocrine system» explains Dr. Yuri Krutchev, who took part in the experiment. «Injecting specific quantities of testosterone helps to unset this artificial biological unbalance which occurs mostly in part because of environmental pollution and an excess of estrogen mimickers in our modern environment” he adds.

The new discovery has attracted much criticism from lesbian, gay, bisexual and transgender (LGBT) organizations around the Globe, yet a few country leaders have outspokenly showed support and interest for the research.

Lots to dive into on this one, so let’s roll tape:

https://twitter.com/Millenniel_Matt/status/978087331818242048

In case that tweet isn’t showing up for you:

M’kay. For clarity, I’m turning on my ordered list function.

Just because a student is bullied doesn’t mean that student is justified in shooting up a school. Emma admitting she bullied the shooter is a tantamount admission the shooter, not the gun, is responsible for the shooting. Yet Emma participated in a march against guns, suggesting it’s the guns that are the problem, not the individual who pulled the trigger. Typically school shooters are young men, ostracized and bullied by their peers. Perhaps Emma and her peers who ostracized the Parkland shooter since middle school should have a march against bullying. Emma suggests no one was surprised the Parkland shooter turned out to be the shooter. She’s not alone, as it was also recommended by Scot Peterson (and others) the shooter be involuntarily committed. Had the shooter been committed, it’s unlikely he’d have been able to purchase a gun for the shooting.

Those are the obvious points. Unfortunately, we’re living in stupid times, where obvious points aren’t obvious. Blaming a gun for someone’s actions is like Emma blaming her mechanical pencil for misusing the word “literally” in a school paper. Yet 200,000 or so dumbasses marched against the right to own guns. Which millions of law-abiding Americans, including myself, need for personal protection. Not to put too fine a point on it. Read also OPINION: I Carry a Gun So I Won’t Have to Say #MeToo.

The Parkland shooting had less to do with guns and more to do with governmental failure and, now according to Emma, the continued bullying of an unstable young man. Again, bullying doesn’t excuse or justify shooting up a school. Okay? Okay. But I think less bullying of students is certainly better than “We bullied him and he deserved it.” Fair?

People are responsible for their actions. The tools are not.

In his Friday column, New York Times columnist David Brooks speculates about a new political dichotomy and writes that President-elect Donald Trump will “resign or be impeached within a year.” From Brooks’ column: “Finally, it seems important to be humbled and taught by this horrific election result…Trump’s bigotry, dishonesty and promise-breaking will have to be denounced. We can’t go morally numb. But he needs to be replaced with a program that addresses the problems that fueled his assent. After all, the guy will probably resign or be impeached within a year.”

However, while commenting on his column in a subsequent interview with KYRQ Radio in New York City, Brooks said, “Oh, and by the way – I forgot to mention ‘assassinated.’” The columnist then went on to say that “the whole ‘pen is mightier than the sword’ philosophy might have worked if we were talking about Hillary Clinton, but when it comes to Donald Trump, you don’t really need a pen, because he’ll bury himself soon enough.” “At the rate he’s going, I’m starting to wonder if he’ll make it through the first six months, let alone an entire year,” Brooks said.

He continued, “Here’s the thing about people like Donald Trump: they’re used to being able to use their money and their power to cover up things that they don’t like or that could damage whatever objective they’re trying to realize. Now, that works just fine when you’re a real estate billionaire who has a couple hundred eyes watching his every move; you can hide whatever you want from a crowd that tiny. However, the President of the United States not only has to answer and be scrutinized by 300 million Americans, but will likely be under the magnifying glass of all 7 billion people on the planet. Good luck trying to hide from that.”

“At some point very soon, he’s going to mess something up big time,” Brooks argued. “And when he does, he’s going to have to choose his next step carefully. It’s either going to be resigning, impeachment, or what I forgot to put in my column earlier this morning – assassination. And I don’t mean like, someone’s going to go after him with a sniper rifle or car bomb or something – I mean, he’s going to have the option of hiring someone to take him out. After all, he’s a businessman and it’s a character trait of most businessmen to spot opportunity where others see nothing. The man was always strived for martyrdom, and this is the perfect opportunity to get it. Heck, that’s the way I’d choose to go,” he said.

“And even if I’m wrong and there is someone out there getting ready to take him out, all I can say is – please dude, hurry up. This country can’t afford to wait and have laws brought forth that are going to make women throughout the country wear tight skirts and thongs as mandatory wardrobe just so us men could enjoy the view, or some other sexist, pointless piece of legislation. Please, deliver this country from the hands of an idiot with Labrador hair who thinks he’s God’s gift to mankind, and do it quick before any more damage is done,” Brooks concluded his message to potential Donald Trump assassinators.","NYT David Brooks: “Trump Needs To Decide If He Prefers To Resign, Be Impeached Or Get Assassinated”",2016-11-14 22:41:22+00:00,[],"['impeached', 'decide', 'domains', 'hes', 'column', 'assassinated', 'brooks', 'dont', 'needs', 'country', 'nyt', 'going', 'donald', 'trump', 'resign', 'prefers', 'url', 'david']","0 SECURITY WARNING: Please treat the URL above as you would your password and do not share it with anyone.

HOUSTON, TX — After double-checking their math, scientists have announced that the total lunar eclipse predicted for August 21, 2017, will occur August 3, 2018.

“Due to a computational mishap, the eclipse we projected for later this month will actually take place late next year,” stated NASA astrophysicist Dr. Theodore Moneta at a hastily-planned press conference from Johnson Space Center in Houston. “We were a bit off.”

Dr. Moneta explained that in calculating the date of the eclipse, scientists utilized a complex formula involving geocentric ephemeris for the Sun and Moon, various parameters, constants, and the Besselian elements, but along the way an error went unnoticed.

“In layman’s terms, we forgot to carry the one,” explained Moneta, a mistake that has plagued 12-year-olds in 7th grade math for centuries.

“This is an embarrassing day for both science and mathematics,” he added.

For officials in those states situated within the eclipse’s path of totality preparing for an influx of visitors in the next few weeks, the NASA announcement came as a shock.

“It’s disappointing,” stated Matt Mead, governor of Wyoming, upon hearing the news. “Obviously, the NASA nerds really dropped the ball on this one.”

However, Mead felt that Wyoming would be less affected by the altered date than other locales due the Cowboy State’s inherent awesomeness.

“A visit to our state is spectacular with or without a once-in-lifetime astronomical occurrence,” said Mead. “Wyoming doesn’t need an eclipse to shine.”","Scientists Miscalculate, Solar Eclipse Actually Next Year - Wyoming M…",2017-08-18 15:35:10+00:00,[],"['stated', 'explained', 'scientists', 'eclipse', 'miscalculate', 'solar', 'moneta', 'states', 'mead', 'm', 'nasa', 'actually', 'wyoming', 'math']","by Chase McFaddenHOUSTON, TX — After double-checking their math, scientists have announced that the total lunar eclipse predicted for August 21, 2017, will occur August 3, 2018.

A Texas turkey farm employee is now under quarantine after he tested positive for the Ebola virus. Texas Prime Turkey Farm, the largest supplier of turkeys in the United States, has been ordered by the CDC to quarantine over 250,000 holiday turkeys. The CDC has confirmed 3,000 turkeys have tested positive for the virus since Friday’s incident.

According to investigators, long time employee Philip Canseco was seen vomiting in the facilities restroom three days prior to the incident on Friday. “I was passing by the restroom, when I heard somebody throwing up inside,” said one Texas Prime Turkey Farm employee. “I opened the door and looked inside and saw Canseco throwing up in one of the urinals. I asked him if he was okay, he said yes, and I left. I didn’t want to get close to him and get sick.”

Management confirmed that Canseco worked three full work days at the facility with flu-like symptoms, before passing out unconscious with a fever of 106°. Due to his symptoms, he was rushed to a local hazmat tent where he tested positive for the Ebola virus. The CDC reports an additional 7 coworkers are being quarantined and tested. However, they have not released those results as of yet.

The facility has been ordered by the CDC to burn their entire flock of turkeys, over 250,000. Texas Prime Turkey Farm is requesting permission from the state of Texas to send the shipment of incinerated turkey ashes to Veolia’s Port Arthur environmental waste facility. This facility has already accepted one shipment of Ebola waste from household goods where Thomas Eric Duncan had stayed. Duncan was the first man to die of Ebola on US soil.

Activists are protesting the shipments of contaminated Ebola waste to their community. “We feel every precaution should be taken to protect our community, our children and our elderly. We are not a dumping ground for the nations, or the world’s bio waste.”

Plant manager Mitch Osborne said on Saturday that even though no contract has yet been signed, the plant will likely receive the second shipment of contaminated Ebola waste. “It is a safe and sound process,” Osborne said. “I am not going to place my employees in harms way, or the community. The company is here to improve the environment and I believe we are doing a pretty darn good job of that. I believe we are doing the right and safe thing.”

A spokesperson for Texas Prime Turkey Farm said there is a good chance Ebola turkeys may have already shipped out to major suppliers for distribution. Each retailer will have to perform recalls individually if they feel they have received a contaminated shipment.

https://www.snopes.com/fact-check/social-insecurity/,president eisenhower once observed that a few texas oil millionaires wanted to abolish social security.,true,['social security'],,David Mikkelson,['http://web.archive.org/web/20051124190902/http://www.eisenhowermemorial.org/presidential-papers/first-term/documents/1147.cfm'],http://web.archive.org/web/20051124190902/http://www.eisenhowermemorial.org/presidential-papers/first-term/documents/1147.cfm,1,Mohamed,http://web.archive.org/,"Dear Ed:1 I think that such answer as I can give to your letter of November first will be arranged in reverse order--at least I shall comment first on your final paragraph.

You keep harping on the Constitution; I should like to point out that the meaning of the Constitution is what the Supreme Court says it is. Consequently no powers are exercised by the Federal government except where such exercise is approved by the Supreme Court (lawyers) of the land.2

I admit that the Supreme Court has in the past made certain decisions in this general field that have been astonishing to me. A recent case in point was the decision in the Phillips case.3 Others, and older ones, involved ""interstate commerce.""4 But until some future Supreme Court decision denies the right and responsibility of the Federal government to do certain things, you cannot possibly remove them from the political activities of the Federal government.

Now it is true that I believe this country is following a dangerous trend when it permits too great a degree of centralization of governmental functions. I oppose this--in some instances the fight is a rather desperate one. But to attain any success it is quite clear that the Federal government cannot avoid or escape responsibilities which the mass of the people firmly believe should be undertaken by it. The political processes of our country are such that if a rule of reason is not applied in this effort, we will lose everything--even to a possible and drastic change in the Constitution. This is what I mean by my constant insistence upon ""moderation"" in government. Should any political party attempt to abolish social security, unemployment insurance, and eliminate labor laws and farm programs, you would not hear of that party again in our political history. There is a tiny splinter group, of course, that believes you can do these things. Among them are H. L. Hunt (you possibly know his background), a few other Texas oil millionaires, and an occasional politician or business man from other areas.5 Their number is negligible and they are stupid.

To say, therefore, that in some instances the policies of this Administration have not been radically changed from those of the last is perfectly true.6 Both Administrations levied taxes, both maintained military establishments, customs officials, and so on.

But in all governmental fields of action a combination of purpose, procedure and objectives must be considered if you are to get a true evaluation of the relative merits.

You say that the foreign policy of the two Administrations is the same. I suppose that even the most violent critic would agree that it is well for us to have friends in the world, to encourage them to oppose communism both in its external form and in its internal manifestations, to promote trade in the world that would be mutually profitable between us and our friends (and it must be mutually profitable or it will dry up), and to attempt the promotion of peace in the world, negotiating from a position of moral, intellectual, economic and military strength.

No matter what the party is in power, it must perforce follow a program that is related to these general purposes and aspirations. But the great difference is in how it is done and, particularly, in the results achieved.

A year ago last January we were in imminent danger of losing Iran, and sixty percent of the known oil reserves of the world.7 You may have forgotten this. Lots of people have. But there has been no greater threat that has in recent years overhung the free world. That threat has been largely, if not totally, removed. I could name at least a half dozen other spots of the same character.

This being true, how can anyone be so unaware of what is happening as to say that this Administration has conducted foreign affairs under the same policies as did the former Administration? As a matter of fact, if you will press any individual who brings to you all these strictures and comments, I venture that your experience will be the same as mine. That experience is that these individuals have no idea of what the ""foreign policy"" of the previous Administration was and what the present one is. They have heard certain slogans, such as ""give away programs."" They have no slightest idea as to what has been the effect of these programs in sustaining American security and prosperity. Moreover, they have no idea whatsoever as to comparative size of them now as compared to even two or three years ago.

You say that these critics also complain about the continuance of ""controls,"" presumably over our economy. There is nothing in your letter that shows such complete ignorance as to what has actually happened as does this term. When we came into office there were Federal controls exercised over prices, wages, rents, as well as over the allocation and use of raw materials. The first thing this Administration did was to set about the elimination of those controls. This it did amid the most dire predictions of disaster, ""run away"" inflation, and so on and so on. We were proved right, but I must say that if the people of the United States do not even remember what took place, one is almost tempted to regret the agony of study, analysis and decision that was then our daily ration.

You also talk about ""bad political advice"" I am getting. I always assumed that lawyers attempted accuracy in their statements. How do you know that I am getting any political advice? Next, if I do get political advice, how do you know that it is not weighted in the direction that you seem to think it should be--although I am tempted at times to believe that you are just thrashing around rather than thinking anything through to a definite conclusion? So how can you say I am getting ""bad"" advice; why don't you just assume I am stupid, trying to wreck the nation, and leave our Constitution in tatters?

I assure you that you have more reason, based on sixty-four years of contact, to say this than you do to make the bland assumption that I am surrounded by a group of Machiavellian characters who are seeking the downfall of the United States and the ascendancy of socialism and communism in the world. Incidentally, I notice that everybody seems to be a great Constitutionalist until his idea of what the Constitution ought to do is violated--then he suddenly becomes very strong for amendments or some peculiar and individualistic interpretation of his own.

Finally, I must assure you again that I am delighted to get your own honest criticisms, particularly if you will only take the trouble to lay down the facts on which you reach what seem to me to be some remarkable conclusions. But the mere repetition of aphorisms and political slogans and newspaper headlines leaves me cold.

I am sorry you are not going to be at Abilene.8 It would be easier to tell you these things than to write them--except that by this method I hope to make you do a little thinking rather than devote yourself just to the winning of a noisy argument. As ever

P.S. I attach a paragraph and a cartoon that came to me in the same mail as did your letter. At least it represents a different viewpoint.

Ted Cruz has left a meeting with Mike Pence without saying whether he will endorse or even vote for Republican presidential nominee Donald Trump. The Texas Republican senator and onetime rival of Trump’s has refused to endorse the billionaire. Cruz met privately with Pence in Washington and attended a lunch with the Indiana governor and a number of other Republican senators. Cruz says he had a “good and productive conversation” and a “very good meeting.” He calls Pence a “good man, a friend” and a “strong conservative.”

However, according to a source who attended the meeting, Cruz refused to endorse Trump and, instead, threw a bombshell that left most of the Republican attendees speechless: Ted Cruz plans to run against Donald Trump after all. Truth be told, he didn’t vow to do it, he merely suggested the possibility. And according to the source, the only way that would ever be possible is if it turns out the rumors are true and Hillary Clinton is prevented form running against Trump on account of her deteriorating health.

Asked to verify the allegations made by one of the attendees, who requested anonymity, Cruz initially seemed genuinely surprised, but later said, “I figured it would get out sooner or later. Might as well be sooner.” “It’s true,” the Texas Republican senator revealed, “I did make that proposition. And I made it for one simple reason – there is no way I am giving up on stopping Donald Trump from running this great country into the ground. And if I have to switch over to the Democrats to do it, then so be it.”

Cruz also went on to say that he is “very sorry” that Hillary Clinton seems to be having medical issues, as well as that that’s “one of the worst ways” for a politician to say goodbye to their career. “Still,” he added, “if I was her and I had a choice, I’d go with the health issues because she’s not strong enough to beat Trump when she’s at 100 percent, let alone now. Therefore, I’d like to make it clear: with all due respect to the Democratic presidential candidate Hillary Clinton – if anything should happen to her that prevents her from running against Donald Trump, I agree to take her place and run against him as a full-fledged Democrat.”

“And I don’t care that some people would label that as betrayal,” he added. “This country has been through too much for us to let a Donald Trump ruin it. So, if this is what has to be done and if no one else has the guts to do it, let history remember that it was Ted Cruz who sucked it up and took one for the red team. I know it’ll be painful seeing me go, but at the end of the day, we all have to make sacrifices, or else we’ll get nowhere. Besides – Heidi tells me I look dashing in blue, and a smart man always listens to his wife. Who knows, maybe blue has always been my color and I just didn’t see it,” Cruz concluded.","Cruz: “If Something Happens To Hillary, I Agree To Run As A Democrat Against Trump”",2016-09-15 12:58:39+00:00,[],"['agree', 'hillary', 'pence', 'democrat', 'meeting', 'happens', 'let', 'good', 'run', 'donald', 'trump', 'running', 'cruz', 'republican']","reddit Upvote Downvotesubmit 1 4.8K LikeTed Cruz has left a meeting with Mike Pence without saying whether he will endorse or even vote for Republican presidential nominee Donald Trump.

*Update, 13 December, 11:45 a.m.: A third laboratory at the National Institutes of Health (NIH) is also affected by the agency’s temporary ban on acquiring new human fetal tissue, an agency spokesperson confirmed last night. Initially, NIH said only research projects run by staff scientists at the National Eye Institute (NEI) and the National Institute of Allergy and Infectious Diseases (NIAID) would be affected. The third laboratory is at the National Cancer Institute (NCI), which is pursuing a “project on cancer immunotherapy, which will need tissue by January 31,” the agency said in a statement. “We are determining appropriate next steps to obtain tissue so that the NIAID project can begin and to avoid interruption of the NCI project. NEI does not have an immediate need to procure new fetal tissue (they have frozen stores).”

Here is our story from 7 December:

U.S. President Donald Trump’s administration has ordered scientists employed by the U.S. National Institutes of Health (NIH) to stop acquiring new human fetal tissue for experiments, Science Insider has learned. The suspension, imposed this past September without a public announcement, came as the government launched a review of all fetal tissue research funded by the federal government. The pause affects two laboratories run by the Bethesda, Maryland–based agency, NIH officials say. In one case, it disrupted a study probing how the virus that causes AIDS initially colonizes human tissues.

“We were all poised to go and then the bombshell was dropped,” says HIV researcher Warner Greene, director of the Gladstone Center for HIV Cure Research in San Francisco, California, who was collaborating with an NIH laboratory that received the order. “The decision completely knocked our collaboration off the rails. We were devastated.”

The order expands the scope of the Trump administration’s interventions into federally funded research that uses human fetal tissue from elective abortions, which is legal but fiercely opposed by antiabortion groups. In September, it canceled a Food and Drug Administration (FDA) contract for acquiring human fetal tissue for testing candidate drugs. This week, the Department of Health and Human Services (HHS), which oversees NIH, told researchers at the University of California (UC), San Francisco, that it would be extending a contract for work involving human fetal tissue for just 90 days instead of the usual 1 year, prompting media reports that the department was preparing to cancel the contract. HHS denied those reports, saying it has made no decisions regarding federal funding for human fetal tissue research pending the outcome of the ongoing review of all such work.

Today, however, an NIH spokesperson confirmed that the agency asked staff scientists “to pause procurements of fetal tissue” pending the outcome of the HHS review. The suspension applies only to scientists who work directly for NIH’s intramural program, and not extramural researchers who typically work at universities and receive grants from the government. It affects two laboratories, NIH officials say. One is operated by the National Eye Institute. (Fetal retinal tissue is used to study eye diseases.) The other is run by the National Institute of Allergy and Infectious Diseases (NIAID). “Yes, we have instituted a pause of further procurements [of human fetal tissue] pending the audit/review that HHS is undertaking,” an NIAID spokeperson confirmed.

The HIV experiment disrupted by the suspension was being conducted at NIAID’s Rocky Mountain Laboratories (RML) in Hamilton, Montana, which focus on infectious diseases. Researchers there use fetal tissue donated by women who have had legal abortions to create so-called humanized mice, which have immune systems that behave like a human’s. Humanized mice have played a key role in testing and developing treatments for HIV/AIDS. The NIH lab had, for several years, obtained the human fetal tissue from Advanced Bioscience Resources (ABR), based in Alameda, California.

According to emails provided to Science Insider by Greene, RML researcher Kim Hasenkrug had prepared humanized mice for a trial of an antibody that the researchers believed—based on promising lab dish studies—might prevent HIV from establishing reservoirs in the human body. (Hasenkrug could not be reached for comment.) On 11 September, Hasenkrug informed Greene and Thomas Packard, a postdoctoral student of Greene’s, that he had obtained needed reagents and the mice were ready. Packard responded that they were excited at the prospect of getting the study started, and would immediately send Hasenkrug a batch of the antibodies. “I’ll not be able to get [the antibodies] on the 3 PM FedEx today, but I’ll ship [the antibodies] to you tomorrow, so you should have it on Thursday,” Packard wrote in an email.

On 28 September, however, Greene received a message from Hasenkrug that left him stunned. The email, which bore the subject line “HHS directive,” read in part:

[HHS] has directed me to discontinue procuring fetal tissue from ABR, the only source for us. I think that they are the only provider of fetal tissue for scientists in the nation who don’t have direct access to aborted fetal tissue. This effectively stops all of our research to discover a cure for HIV.

Hasenkrug had not yet launched the experiment, Greene says, and his supplies of existing mice were too small to conduct the repeated experiments required to reach convincing scientific conclusions.

The order to Hasenkrug came just as HHS launched its review of human fetal tissue research, and at the same time that the department killed the FDA contract, which was with ABR. (The department wrote at that time that it was “not sufficiently assured that the contract included the appropriate protections applicable to fetal tissue research,” but provided no evidence of violations.)

It is unclear whether HHS will next place restrictions on the grants of NIH-funded investigators at universities who don’t work for NIH but whose projects also rely on access to new fetal tissue. Science Insider posed this question and others to Assistant Secretary of Health Brett Giroir, who is heading the review, but did not receive a response by press time. Some extramural scientists are concerned. “Everything I am doing involves humanized mice. It would shut my lab down if we were not able to use fetal tissues,” says Jerome Zack, a virologist who studies HIV at UC Los Angeles, and has been using humanized mice for 25 years.

Such mice are particularly valuable for HIV drug testing in part because tissue from a single human fetus can readily generate a group of 40 to 50 genetically identical mice, and because the animals can, unlike monkeys, be infected with the human virus, HIV. Potential drugs can then be tested in such a group, with ample mice as controls, giving the studies robust statistical power.

Packard calls the HHS review and its attendant constraints “really just a travesty for the outlook for HIV research. Mice made with human fetal tissue are critical to moving from discoveries in the lab to clinical treatments. Blocking this significantly hurts our chances of finding an HIV cure.”

Greene adds that even if the HHS order is eventually lifted, the lost time would be consequential. “If we were given the green light right now” to resume acquiring fetal tissue, he says, “it would probably take us a year to get back in the position we were in when the ban was put in place.”

After this story was published, NIH emailed an additional statement. It said the agency in September “put a pause in place” for staff scientists procuring new human fetal tissue, “an action NIH thought was prudent given the examination of these procurements. Research with tissue already on hand could proceed, and NIH leaders asked to be notified by intramural investigators if new procurement would be necessary. NIH leadership was not informed that new procurement was necessary for the study you reference in your story. We are looking into why this did not occur.”

In September, it canceled a Food and Drug Administration (FDA) contract for acquiring human fetal tissue for testing candidate drugs.
The NIH lab had, for several years, obtained the human fetal tissue from Advanced Bioscience Resources (ABR), based in Alameda, California.

Fans are filling stadiums from coast to coast to watch America’s pastime. They hope to see their favorite player in action, relive childhood memories, and – perhaps – catch a fly ball.

For well over a century, summer in America has been synonymous with baseball. The greats – Babe Ruth, Jackie Robinson, Willie Mays, and Joe DiMaggio (to name just a few) – have earned a place in history for their skill and for their dedication to the sport. But there is one – Morris “Moe” Berg – whose spot in American history comes not from baseball, but from espionage. He was a catcher who put his multitude of talents to work for his country as an intelligence officer.

The Brainiest Man in Baseball

Moe was born in New York City on March 2, 1902. He began playing baseball as a child, and while majoring in modern languages at Princeton University, he played shortstop on the school team. After graduating from college in 1923, Moe was signed by the Brooklyn Dodgers. He started his career as a first baseman and shortstop. But, Moe was a man of many skills (he spoke 12 languages), and baseball was by no means his only passion.

Off the field, Moe studied French at the Sorbonne in Paris and then decided to attend Columbia University Law School. In 1926, Moe joined the Chicago White Sox, and changed positions from shortstop to catcher. When asked how he did it, Moe replied that “they didn’t call me the brainiest man in baseball for nothing.”

He received his law degree and was admitted to the New York State bar in 1928. He joined the law firm of Satterlee and Canfield and kept playing ball for the White Sox. Moe injured his right knee in 1930, which eventually limited his playing time. In 1931, Moe was traded to the Cleveland Indians, and then to the Washington Senators. The move to Washington would change his life.

Joining a Different Kind of Team

Being a baseball player with vast intellectual gifts, Moe was frequently invited to embassy dinners and parties. He impressed many with his exceptional language ability and quick wit. He soon became very well known around town and caught the attention of the Roosevelt administration.

Moe played with the Senators until 1934; that year, he toured Japan with the American All-Star baseball team. While in Japan, the Japanese-speaking ball player filmed Tokyo Harbor, military installations, and other facilities for the US government.

Moe Berg

When he returned from Tokyo, Moe began playing with the Boston Red Sox. While with Boston, Moe played in the inaugural Baseball Hall of Fame game in 1939. He played and coached for the Boston Red Sox until his retirement in 1942.



Shortly afterward, Moe toured Latin America with the Office of Inter-American Affairs, an agency set up to counter Axis propaganda in Latin America. During this trip, Moe used his linguistic talents to meet government officials, journalists, and businessmen.

In 1943, the Office of Strategic Services (OSS) – the forerunner of the CIA – recruited Moe into its ranks. Although he got off to a rocky start in the OSS, he was sent to Switzerland to collect intelligence on Germany’s efforts to build an atomic bomb. He met German physicist Werner Heisenberg, who – during a lecture – let slip his belief that Germany would lose the war and that the Nazis were not close to developing the bomb.

Moe provided the United States with incredibly helpful intelligence during World War II.

Life After World War II

Moe stayed with the OSS until it was dissolved in 1945. Afterward, he served on the staff of NATO’s Advisory Group for Aeronautical Research and Development.

Known as a man of mystery, Moe planned to write a book detailing his career as an intelligence officer. He never wrote the book, and many of his secrets will never be known.

Before his death in 1972, he said, “Maybe I’m not in the Cooperstown Baseball Hall of Fame like so many of my baseball buddies, but I’m happy I had the chance to play pro ball and am especially proud of my contributions to my country. Perhaps I couldn’t hit like Babe Ruth, but I spoke more languages than he did.”","A Look Back … Moe Berg: Baseball Player, Linguist, Lawyer, Intel Officer — Central Intelligence Agency",,[],"['central', 'playing', 'officer', 'baseball', 'intel', 'linguist', 'berg', 'war', 'lawyer', 'played', 'man', 'look', 'sox', 'shortstop', 'intelligence', 'player', 'moe']","He began playing baseball as a child, and while majoring in modern languages at Princeton University, he played shortstop on the school team.

The news that has been welcomed by scientists and leaders of the agriculture business alike as a move forward towards the industrial use of marijuana and hemp products could bring a major shift towards marijuana policies in the U.S.A. and ultimately, to the world.

Under present US federal law, it is illegal to possess, use, buy, sell, or cultivate marijuana, since the Controlled Substances Act of 1970 classifies marijuana as a Schedule I drug, although it has been decriminalized to some extent in certain states, Monsanto’s interest in the field has been interpreted by experts as the precursor to “a major shift in marijuana policy in the US” as it is believed the company would not have invested so much time and energy if it had not had “previous knowledge” of the Federal government’s “openness” towards the future legalization of marijuana.

Lawyer and marijuana law specialist, Edmund Groensch, of the Drug Policy Alliance, admits Monsanto’s involvement in marijuana projects could definitely help the pro-legalization activists.

“Currently, Federal law criminalizes marijuana and hemp derivatives because public opinion is still against it and legal commercial production in the U.S. is currently handled by a patchwork of small farmers whom are not trusted by investors. A major player as Monsanto could bring confidence within government and towards investors in the market if it were to own a large part of the exploitable lands and commercial products”.

“There is presently no way to control the production of marijuana and the quality of the strains. A GM strain produced by a company with the credentials and prestige of Monsanto would definitely lend a massive hand to pro-legalization activists within certain spheres of government and within the business world” he explains.

Although Monsanto’s testing on cannabis is only at an experimental stage, no plan has yet been released by the agriculture business firm as to what purposes the patented strain would be used for, although specialists believe answers should come this fall as rumors of a controversial new bill which could “loosen up laws around medical marijuana” is reportedly scheduled to pass before congress coming this fall.

The kids seemed to really enjoy the shows and especially liked ďThis Ainít No Rag, Itís A FlagĒ and ďIn AmericaĒ. We had a great time with them. We saw Camp X-Ray, where the Taliban detainees are being held only from a distance, but I picked up a lot of whatís going on there from talking with a lot of different people. The truth of the matter is that this operation is under a microscope. The Red Cross has an on site presence there and watches everything that goes on very closely. The media is not telling you the whole truth about whatís going on over there. The truth is that these scum bags are not only being treated humanely, but they are probably better off healthwise and medically than theyíve ever been in their lives They are fed well, able to take showers and receive state of the art medical care. And have their own Moslem chaplain. I saw several of them in a field hospital ward where they were being treated in a state of the art medical facility. Now letís talk about the way they treat our people. First of all, they have to be watched constantly. These people are committed and wanton murderers who are willing to die just to kill someone else. One of the doctors told me that when they had Taliban in the hospital the staff had to really be careful with needles, pens and anything else which could possibly be used as a weapon. They also throw their excrement and urine on the troops who are guarding them. And our guys and gals have shown great restrain in not retaliating. We are spending over a million dollars a day maintaining and guarding these nasty killers and anyone who wants to see them brought to the U.S.A. for trial is either out of their heads or a lawyer looking for money and notoriety. Or both. I wish that the media and the Red Cross and all the rest of the people who are so worried about these criminals would realize that this is not a troop of errant Boy Scouts. These are killers of the worst kind. They donít need protection from us, we need protection from them. If you donít get anything else out of this soapbox, please try to realize that when you see news coverage much of the time youíre not getting the whole story, but an account filtered through a liberal mindset with an agenda. We have two fights on our hands, the war against terror and the one against the loudmouthed lawyers and left wing media who would sap the strength from the American public by making us believe that weíre losing the war or doing something wrong in fighting it. Remember these are the same people who told us that Saddam Hussein's Republican guard was going to be an all but invincible enemy and that our smart bombs and other weapons were not really as good as the military said that they were. They also took up for Bill Clinton while he was cavorting around the Oval office with Monica Lewinsky while the terrorists were gaining strength and bombing our Embassies and dragging the bodies of dead American heroes around the dusty streets of Somalia. Itís a shame that we canít have an unbiased media who would just report the truth and let us make up our own minds. Here I must commend Fox News for presenting both sides much better than the other networks. They are leaving the other cable networks in the dust. People like being told the truth. Our military not only needs but deserves our support. Letís give it to them. The next time you read a media account about the bad treatment of the Taliban in Cuba, remember what I told you. Been there done that. Footnote: I got an e-mail from a rather irate first cousin of mine the other day who has a daughter whoís a lawyer and she seemed to think that I was painting all lawyers with the same brush. Please understand that Iím not doing that at all. That would be like saying that all musicians were drug addicts. There are a lot of good and honest attorneys out there. I happen to have one of them. But it seems that they never get any airtime. Itís always the radicals who get their opinions heard. Who fight the idea of the military tribunals and site The Constitution and the integrity of America as their source of justifying their opinions. Well, first of all The Constitution says Ē We the people of the United StatesĒ, it doesnít mention any other country. And secondly as far as integrity is concerned, I donít think some of these folks would know integrity if it bit them in the posterior. What do you think? God Bless America

Born of unknown parentage and adopted in 1985 by the Borneman/Calhoun family of Rabbit Hash, Goofy was raised as any local dog-resident of the town. His early years were happy ones, playing with the Bornemans’ son, Mike Calhoun. According to Mike, it was the standard boy-dog relationship with Goofy a constant companion for Mike as they traveled up and down Lower River Road. While Mike was in school, Goofy would still take the familiar path between his home and the Rabbit Hash General Store visiting neighbors and eating any scraps along the way. In his adolescence, Goofy ran into trouble. Lounging in the road proved to be a dangerous past-time as he was hit by cars more than once. He also had a stinky reputation and fell into trouble with his owner, Ed Borneman, when Goofy was allegedly found to be poaching town chickens.

In his older years, Goofy settled down and was content to remain on the straight and narrow. In June 1998, upon Boone County, Kentucky’s bicentennial celebration, the Rabbit Hash mayor’s race was announced. Although initially open to anyone in the area, only humans entered the race. After Jane and Randy Cochran entered their black Labrador Retriever, Herb, in the race, the Borneman family, finding that everyone in the town already held a relationship with their aging dog, Goofy, decided to enter him. The charisma of the Borneman family and the notorious reputation of Goofy led to a triumphant result as Goofy beat out famed woodcarver “Crazy Clifford” Pottorf and fellow four-legger Herb Cochran.

Unfortunately for the town, the aging mayor did not get to serve an entire term, however long that may be, and passed away in July of 2001 at the astounding age of 16. Although his burial-in-landfill was lacking the traditional pomp and circumstance of a funeral for a notorious politician, he reign over the town was celebrated in a parade at the 2001 Old Timers Day. His legacy continued with the release of the 2004 documentary Rabbit Hash: Center of the Universe, which focused on his election, and the 2004 and 2008 runs and wins for Junior Cochran and Lucy Lou respectively. Having set the precedent for canine mayors, Goofy and his tradition has brought an overwhelming amount of positive attention and funds for the preservation of the aging river town. To Goofy and to the Borneman family, we are eternally grateful.

Update via AP: Federal authorities announced on Tuesday they have ended their investigation of the fatal police shooting of John Crawford III in a Walmart store, concluding there wasn’t enough evidence to charge the white officer who killed him.​

Original reporting, Sept. 5, 2014: The phone call plays back in John Crawford Jr.'s head ""every day, all day"" since Aug. 5.

The mother of his son's young children – boys, five months and nearly 2 – was screaming.

Crawford Jr. was in Fairfield on business that Tuesday and had stopped by to see if his son, John Crawford III, would join him for dinner. But his son had already left for a cookout in Dayton, Ohio.

""Mr. John. Mr. John. They shot him. They shot him,"" Crawford recalls the cries from LeeCee Johnson.

She put her cell phone on speaker.

""You could hear in the background he was gasping,"" John Crawford Jr. told The Enquirer in a phone interview this week from his home in Jackson, Tenn. ""I'm virtually listening to my kid taking his last breath.""

Crawford Jr. painted the dramatic scene Thursday as he talked to The Enquirer about his son's life and what he wants from the investigation into his son's fatal shooting by police at a Walmart in the Dayton suburb of Beavercreek on Aug. 5.

The shooting has drawn national attention in the wake of the death of 18-year-old Michael Brown, who was gunned down by a Ferguson, Mo., police officer and a series of shootings of black males by police elsewhere. The Crawford investigation has even become an issue in the November election as Ohio Attorney General's Mike DeWine's contender David Pepper has suggested DeWine's involvement in the Crawford investigation is unethical.

The shooting came seven days after Crawford Jr. had celebrated his son's 22nd birthday together with a few rounds of pool at Memories Sports Bar in Fairfield, where Crawford III had resided for three or four years following graduation from Greensburg Christian Academy in Indiana.

Crawford III had lived in Cincinnati pretty much all of his life, attending at least 11 private, public or charter schools since entering the first grade in 1998, Cincinnati Public School records show. Crawford Jr., who had never married his son's mother, Tressa Sherrod of Fairfield, said he visited their only son nearly every weekend.

On that day at Memories, Crawford III, frustrated by not being able to find a job, had confided to his father that he wanted to start college. Crawford III, who had played football in high school, had shopped around for a football scholarship after high school, his father said. When that didn't happen, sons John IV and Jayden came along and plans for college were put on hold.

'He was figuring out his next step'

Crawford Jr. described his son as a typical 22-year-old who was laid back and very family oriented. He had once considered going into the military, following in the footsteps of a grandfather who served in the Army.

Hamilton County court records show that Crawford III had some minor scrapes with the law – two payout tickets for marijuana possession and a disorderly conduct charge.

He was charged with serious felonies in 2013 for allegedly carrying a concealed weapon and for aggravated robbery involving an incident at Clovernook Country Club. However, a Hamilton County grand jury declined to indict Crawford III. His father said Crawford III was wrongly accused and was charged because he was in a car with his cousin, but had no involvement in what happened.

""He was just figuring it out. He was figuring out his next step. I remember when I was 22,"" said Crawford Jr., a college graduate who worked in the court system in Tennessee for two decades. ""Unfortunately, all of that was cut down on the night of Aug. 5,""

That's when authorities have said that Crawford III was walking around the Walmart store with a MK-177 BB/Pellet Rifle. He was pronounced dead at Miami Valley Hospital around 9:25 p.m. shortly after police officers opened fire at the store.

Crawford Jr. said his son was at the store with a female friend to pick up picnic items on the way to a cookout in Dayton. Crawford III walked around the store and away from the female friend after receiving a call from Johnson. She could not be reached for comment.

Crawford Jr. has disputed that his son was waving the air rifle around and had refused to comply with police commands to drop it. Police responded when customers called 911, believing the gun was real. Police have said they repeatedly told Crawford III to put the gun down.

What does security footage show?

Crawford Jr. said security footage of the shooting and the time leading up to it – which he and family lawyer, Michael Wright, have viewed – shows that his son was standing in an aisle of the pet department holding the air rifle with his left hand with the barrel pointing to the floor. Crawford III was talking on his cell phone to Johnson with his back to the officers when he was shot, his father said.

""The footage we saw, he didn't know the officers were in the store. There was no reaction (from him) at all by the time the trigger was pulled,"" Crawford Jr. said.

""We were waiting to see him menacing, waving this thing in a threatening position with women or children. None of that happened from the footage we saw. He wasn't doing anything. He was just standing there. The final analysis is that my son was murdered.""

""All this nonsense of (them saying) 'Put the weapon down' two or three times. There was no reaction from him. There couldn't have been a cadence given.""

Ohio Attorney General Mike DeWine has refused to release the surveillance video to the public while the Ohio Bureau of Criminal Investigation (BCI), a branch of DeWine's office, investigates the shooting to determine if Beavercreek Officers Sean Williams or Sgt. David Darkow broke the law.

Wright said the coroner has told him that Crawford III was shot twice. The final autopsy report has not been completed. Crawford Jr. said the family has not been told which of the two officers shot his son. Williams remains off duty, while Darkow has returned to work.

The Greene County prosecutor has asked for a special prosecutor to avoid any appearance of a possible conflict of interest because DeWine – whose office would typically prosecute the case – used to be Green County prosecutor and his daughter now is an assistant prosecutor there.

Assistant Hamilton County Prosecutor Mark Piepmeier is now leading the prosecution team as special prosecutor. Wright has asked the U.S. Attorney's Office to take over the investigation and look into potential civil rights violation. He wants DeWine off the case altogether, saying DeWine is too close to people at the center of the investigation. It's a demand DeWine has refused.

DeWine's spokesman Dan Tierney said there's no conflict because DeWine is not directly involved in the investigation.

Beavercreek police officials asked for BCI to investigate the shooting because it was a conflict for them to fairly investigate their own officers, Tierney said. Greene County Prosecutor Stephen Haller sought a special prosecutor from the attorney general's office, but DeWine suggested Piepmeier because of his experience in prosecuting use of force cases.

Taking the investigation away from BCI and handing it over to another agency would cause a delay because the new agency would have to start from scratch, Tierney said.

""Our goal is to do a very thorough investigation but to make sure it is concluded in a compressed length of time to allow closure to the family,"" he said.

Crawford Jr. thinks that race played a factor in the shooting.

Cacao plants are slated to disappear by as early as 2050 thanks to warmer temperatures and dryer weather conditions.

Scientists at the University of California are teaming up with Mars company to try to save the crop before it's too late.

They're exploring the possibility of using the gene-editing technology CRISPR to make crops that can survive the new challenges.

Beyond the glittery glass-and-sandstone walls of the University of California’s new biosciences building, rows of tiny green cacao seedlings in refrigerated greenhouses await judgment day.

Under the watchful eye of Myeong-Je Cho , the director of plant genomics at an institute that's working with food and candy company Mars, the plants will be transformed. If all goes well, these tiny seedlings will soon be capable of surviving — and thriving — in the dryer, warmer climate that is sending chills through the spines of farmers across the globe.

It's all thanks to a new technology called CRISPR, which allows for tiny, precise tweaks to DNA that were never possible before. These tweaks are already being used to make crops cheaper and more reliable. But their most important use may be in the developing world, where many of the plants that people rely on to avoid starvation are threatened by the impacts of climate change, including more pests and a lack of water.

Cacao plants occupy a precarious position on the globe. They can only grow within a narrow strip of rainforested land roughly 20 degrees north and south of the equator, where temperature, rain, and humidity all stay relatively constant throughout the year. Over half of the world's chocolate now comes from just two countries in West Africa — Côte d’Ivoire and Ghana.

But those areas won't be suitable for chocolate in the next few decades. By 2050, rising temperatures will push today's chocolate-growing regions more than 1,000 feet uphill into mountainous terrain — much of which is currently preserved for wildlife , according to the National Oceanic and Atmospheric Administration.

Mars, the $35 billion corporation best known for Snickers, is aware of these problems and others presented by climate change.

In September, the company pledged $1 billion as part of an effort called ""Sustainability in a Generation,"" which aims to reduce the carbon footprint of its business and supply chain by more than 60% by 2050.

""We're trying to go all in here,"" Barry Parkin, Mars' chief sustainability officer, told Business Insider. ""There are obviously commitments the world is leaning into but, frankly, we don't think we're getting there fast enough collectively.""

Its initiative with Cho at UC Berkeley is another arm of that efforts. If all goes as planned, they could develop cacao plants that don’t wilt or rot at their current elevations, doing away with the need to relocate farms or find another approach.

Jennifer Doudna, the UC Berkeley geneticist who invented CRISPR, is overseeing the collaboration with Mars. Although her tool has received more attention for its potential to eradicate human diseases and make so-called “designer babies,” Doudna thinks its most profound applications won’t be on humans but rather on the food they eat.

Courtney Verrill

An avid tomato gardener, Doudna thinks her tool can benefit everyone from large food companies like Mars to individual hobbyists like herself.

”Personally, I’d love a tomato plant with fruit that stayed on the vine longer,” Doudna told Business Insider.

The research lab she oversees at UC Berkeley is called the Innovative Genomics Institute. Many of the efforts by graduate students there focus on using CRISPR to benefit small-holder farmers in the developing world. One such project aims to protect cassava — a key crop that prevents millions of people from starving each year — from climate change by tweaking its DNA to produce less of a dangerous toxin that it makes in hotter temperatures.

Doudna founded a company called Caribou Biosciences to put CRISPR into practice, and has also licensed the technology to agricultural company DuPont Pioneer for use in crops like corn and mushrooms.

Regardless of which crop the public sees CRISPR successfully used in first, the technology will be a key tool in a growing arsenal of techniques we'll need if we plan to continue eating things like chocolate as the planet warms.",When chocolate will go extinct,2018-01-02 20:29:45+00:00,[],"['university', 'technology', 'crispr', 'extinct', 'called', 'plants', 'company', 'climate', 'doudna', 'world', 'mars', 'chocolate']","Scientists at the University of California are teaming up with Mars company to try to save the crop before it's too late.

TO THE CONGRESS OF THE UNITED STATES:

Madam Speaker, Mr. Vice President, Members of Congress, the First Lady of the United States, and my fellow Americans:

We meet tonight at a moment of unlimited potential. As we begin a new Congress, I stand here ready to work with you to achieve historic breakthroughs for all Americans.

Millions of our fellow citizens are watching us now, gathered in this great chamber, hoping that we will govern not as two parties but as one Nation.

The agenda I will lay out this evening is not a Republican agenda or a Democrat agenda. It is the agenda of the American people.

Many of us campaigned on the same core promises: to defend American jobs and demand fair trade for American workers; to rebuild and revitalize our Nation’s infrastructure; to reduce the price of healthcare and prescription drugs; to create an immigration system that is safe, lawful, modern and secure; and to pursue a foreign policy that puts America’s interests first.

There is a new opportunity in American politics, if only we have the courage to seize it. Victory is not winning for our party. Victory is winning for our country.

This year, America will recognize two important anniversaries that show us the majesty of America’s mission, and the power of American pride.

In June, we mark 75 years since the start of what General Dwight D. Eisenhower called the Great Crusade — the Allied liberation of Europe in World War II. On D-Day, June 6, 1944, 15,000 young American men jumped from the sky, and 60,000 more stormed in from the sea, to save our civilization from tyranny. Here with us tonight are three of those heroes: Private First Class Joseph Reilly, Staff Sergeant Irving Locker, and Sergeant Herman Zeitchik. Gentlemen, we salute you.

In 2019, we also celebrate 50 years since brave young pilots flew a quarter of a million miles through space to plant the American flag on the face of the moon. Half a century later, we are joined by one of the Apollo 11 astronauts who planted that flag: Buzz Aldrin. This year, American astronauts will go back to space on American rockets.

In the 20th century, America saved freedom, transformed science, and redefined the middle class standard of living for the entire world to see. Now, we must step boldly and bravely into the next chapter of this great American adventure, and we must create a new standard of living for the 21st century. An amazing quality of life for all of our citizens is within our reach.

We can make our communities safer, our families stronger, our culture richer, our faith deeper, and our middle class bigger and more prosperous than ever before.

But we must reject the politics of revenge, resistance, and retribution — and embrace the boundless potential of cooperation, compromise, and the common good.

Together, we can break decades of political stalemate. We can bridge old divisions, heal old wounds, build new coalitions, forge new solutions, and unlock the extraordinary promise of America’s future. The decision is ours to make.

We must choose between greatness or gridlock, results or resistance, vision or vengeance, incredible progress or pointless destruction.

Tonight, I ask you to choose greatness.

Over the last 2 years, my Administration has moved with urgency and historic speed to confront problems neglected by leaders of both parties over many decades.

In just over 2 years since the election, we have launched an unprecedented economic boom — a boom that has rarely been seen before. We have created 5.3 million new jobs and importantly added 600,000 new manufacturing jobs — something which almost everyone said was impossible to do, but the fact is, we are just getting started.

Wages are rising at the fastest pace in decades, and growing for blue collar workers, who I promised to fight for, faster than anyone else. Nearly 5 million Americans have been lifted off food stamps. The United States economy is growing almost twice as fast today as when I took office, and we are considered far and away the hottest economy anywhere in the world. Unemployment has reached the lowest rate in half a century. African-American, Hispanic-American and Asian-American unemployment have all reached their lowest levels ever recorded. Unemployment for Americans with disabilities has also reached an all-time low. More people are working now than at any time in our history –- 157 million.

We passed a massive tax cut for working families and doubled the child tax credit.

We virtually ended the estate, or death, tax on small businesses, ranches, and family farms.

We eliminated the very unpopular Obamacare individual mandate penalty — and to give critically ill patients access to life-saving cures, we passed right to try.

My Administration has cut more regulations in a short time than any other administration during its entire tenure. Companies are coming back to our country in large numbers thanks to historic reductions in taxes and regulations.

We have unleashed a revolution in American energy — the United States is now the number one producer of oil and natural gas in the world. And now, for the first time in 65 years, we are a net exporter of energy.

After 24 months of rapid progress, our economy is the envy of the world, our military is the most powerful on earth, and America is winning each and every day. Members of Congress: the State of our Union is strong. Our country is vibrant and our economy is thriving like never before.

On Friday, it was announced that we added another 304,000 jobs last month alone — almost double what was expected. An economic miracle is taking place in the United States — and the only thing that can stop it are foolish wars, politics, or ridiculous partisan investigations.

If there is going to be peace and legislation, there cannot be war and investigation. It just doesn’t work that way!

We must be united at home to defeat our adversaries abroad.

This new era of cooperation can start with finally confirming the more than 300 highly qualified nominees who are still stuck in the Senate – some after years of waiting. The Senate has failed to act on these nominations, which is unfair to the nominees and to our country.

Now is the time for bipartisan action. Believe it or not, we have already proven that it is possible.

In the last Congress, both parties came together to pass unprecedented legislation to confront the opioid crisis, a sweeping new Farm Bill, historic VA reforms, and after four decades of rejection, we passed VA Accountability so we can finally terminate those who mistreat our wonderful veterans.

And just weeks ago, both parties united for groundbreaking criminal justice reform. Last year, I heard through friends the story of Alice Johnson. I was deeply moved. In 1997, Alice was sentenced to life in prison as a first-time non-violent drug offender. Over the next two decades, she became a prison minister, inspiring others to choose a better path. She had a big impact on that prison population — and far beyond.

Alice’s story underscores the disparities and unfairness that can exist in criminal sentencing — and the need to remedy this injustice. She served almost 22 years and had expected to be in prison for the rest of her life.

In June, I commuted Alice’s sentence — and she is here with us tonight. Alice, thank you for reminding us that we always have the power to shape our own destiny.

When I saw Alice’s beautiful family greet her at the prison gates, hugging and kissing and crying and laughing, I knew I did the right thing.

Inspired by stories like Alice’s, my Administration worked closely with members of both parties to sign the First Step Act into law. This legislation reformed sentencing laws that have wrongly and disproportionately harmed the African-American community. The First Step Act gives non-violent offenders the chance to re-enter society as productive, law-abiding citizens. Now, States across the country are following our lead. America is a Nation that believes in redemption.

We are also joined tonight by Matthew Charles from Tennessee. In 1996, at age 30, Matthew was sentenced to 35 years for selling drugs and related offenses. Over the next two decades, he completed more than 30 Bible studies, became a law clerk, and mentored fellow inmates. Now, Matthew is the very first person to be released from prison under the First Step Act. Matthew, on behalf of all Americans: welcome home.

As we have seen, when we are united, we can make astonishing strides for our country. Now, Republicans and Democrats must join forces again to confront an urgent national crisis.

The Congress has 10 days left to pass a bill that will fund our Government, protect our homeland, and secure our southern border.

Now is the time for the Congress to show the world that America is committed to ending illegal immigration and putting the ruthless coyotes, cartels, drug dealers, and human traffickers out of business.

As we speak, large, organized caravans are on the march to the United States. We have just heard that Mexican cities, in order to remove the illegal immigrants from their communities, are getting trucks and buses to bring them up to our country in areas where there is little border protection. I have ordered another 3,750 troops to our southern border to prepare for the tremendous onslaught.

This is a moral issue. The lawless state of our southern border is a threat to the safety, security, and financial well‑being of all Americans. We have a moral duty to create an immigration system that protects the lives and jobs of our citizens. This includes our obligation to the millions of immigrants living here today, who followed the rules and respected our laws. Legal immigrants enrich our Nation and strengthen our society in countless ways. I want people to come into our country, but they have to come in legally.

Tonight, I am asking you to defend our very dangerous southern border out of love and devotion to our fellow citizens and to our country.

No issue better illustrates the divide between America’s working class and America’s political class than illegal immigration. Wealthy politicians and donors push for open borders while living their lives behind walls and gates and guards.

Meanwhile, working class Americans are left to pay the price for mass illegal migration — reduced jobs, lower wages, overburdened schools and hospitals, increased crime, and a depleted social safety net.

Tolerance for illegal immigration is not compassionate — it is cruel. One in three women is sexually assaulted on the long journey north. Smugglers use migrant children as human pawns to exploit our laws and gain access to our country.

Human traffickers and sex traffickers take advantage of the wide open areas between our ports of entry to smuggle thousands of young girls and women into the United States and to sell them into prostitution and modern-day slavery.

Tens of thousands of innocent Americans are killed by lethal drugs that cross our border and flood into our cities — including meth, heroin, cocaine, and fentanyl.

The savage gang, MS-13, now operates in 20 different American States, and they almost all come through our southern border. Just yesterday, an MS-13 gang member was taken into custody for a fatal shooting on a subway platform in New York City. We are removing these gang members by the thousands, but until we secure our border they’re going to keep streaming back in.

Year after year, countless Americans are murdered by criminal illegal aliens.

I’ve gotten to know many wonderful Angel Moms, Dads, and families – no one should ever have to suffer the horrible heartache they have endured.

Here tonight is Debra Bissell. Just three weeks ago, Debra’s parents, Gerald and Sharon, were burglarized and shot to death in their Reno, Nevada, home by an illegal alien. They were in their eighties and are survived by four children, 11 grandchildren, and 20 great-grandchildren. Also here tonight are Gerald and Sharon’s granddaughter, Heather, and great‑granddaughter, Madison.

To Debra, Heather, Madison, please stand: few can understand your pain. But I will never forget, and I will fight for the memory of Gerald and Sharon, that it should never happen again.

Not one more American life should be lost because our Nation failed to control its very dangerous border.

In the last 2 years, our brave ICE officers made 266,000 arrests of criminal aliens, including those charged or convicted of nearly 100,000 assaults, 30,000 sex crimes, and 4,000 killings.

We are joined tonight by one of those law enforcement heroes: ICE Special Agent Elvin Hernandez. When Elvin was a boy, he and his family legally immigrated to the United States from the Dominican Republic. At the age of eight, Elvin told his dad he wanted to become a Special Agent. Today, he leads investigations into the scourge of international sex trafficking. Elvin says: “If I can make sure these young girls get their justice, I’ve done my job.” Thanks to his work and that of his colleagues, more than 300 women and girls have been rescued from horror and more than 1,500 sadistic traffickers have been put behind bars in the last year.

Special Agent Hernandez, please stand: We will always support the brave men and women of Law Enforcement — and I pledge to you tonight that we will never abolish our heroes from ICE.

My Administration has sent to the Congress a commonsense proposal to end the crisis on our southern border.

It includes humanitarian assistance, more law enforcement, drug detection at our ports, closing loopholes that enable child smuggling, and plans for a new physical barrier, or wall, to secure the vast areas between our ports of entry. In the past, most of the people in this room voted for a wall — but the proper wall never got built. I’ll get it built.

This is a smart, strategic, see-through steel barrier — not just a simple concrete wall. It will be deployed in the areas identified by border agents as having the greatest need, and as these agents will tell you, where walls go up, illegal crossings go way down.

San Diego used to have the most illegal border crossings in the country. In response, and at the request of San Diego residents and political leaders, a strong security wall was put in place. This powerful barrier almost completely ended illegal crossings.

The border city of El Paso, Texas, used to have extremely high rates of violent crime — one of the highest in the country, and considered one of our Nation’s most dangerous cities. Now, with a powerful barrier in place, El Paso is one of our safest cities.

Simply put, walls work and walls save lives. So let’s work together, compromise, and reach a deal that will truly make America safe.

As we work to defend our people’s safety, we must also ensure our economic resurgence continues at a rapid pace.

No one has benefitted more from our thriving economy than women, who have filled 58 percent of the new jobs created in the last year. All Americans can be proud that we have more women in the workforce than ever before — and exactly one century after the Congress passed the Constitutional amendment giving women the right to vote, we also have more women serving in the Congress than ever before.

As part of our commitment to improving opportunity for women everywhere, this Thursday we are launching the first ever Government-wide initiative focused on economic empowerment for women in developing countries.

To build on our incredible economic success, one priority is paramount — reversing decades of calamitous trade policies.

We are now making it clear to China that after years of targeting our industries, and stealing our intellectual property, the theft of American jobs and wealth has come to an end.

Therefore, we recently imposed tariffs on $250 billion of Chinese goods — and now our Treasury is receiving billions of dollars a month from a country that never gave us a dime. But I don’t blame China for taking advantage of us — I blame our leaders and representatives for allowing this travesty to happen. I have great respect for President Xi, and we are now working on a new trade deal with China. But it must include real, structural change to end unfair trade practices, reduce our chronic trade deficit, and protect American jobs.

Another historic trade blunder was the catastrophe known as NAFTA.

I have met the men and women of Michigan, Ohio, Pennsylvania, Indiana, New Hampshire, and many other States whose dreams were shattered by NAFTA. For years, politicians promised them they would negotiate for a better deal. But no one ever tried — until now.

Our new U.S.-Mexico-Canada Agreement — or USMCA — will replace NAFTA and deliver for American workers: bringing back our manufacturing jobs, expanding American agriculture, protecting intellectual property, and ensuring that more cars are proudly stamped with four beautiful words: made in the USA.

Tonight, I am also asking you to pass the United States Reciprocal Trade Act, so that if another country places an unfair tariff on an American product, we can charge them the exact same tariff on the same product that they sell to us.

Both parties should be able to unite for a great rebuilding of America’s crumbling infrastructure.

I know that the Congress is eager to pass an infrastructure bill — and I am eager to work with you on legislation to deliver new and important infrastructure investment, including investments in the cutting edge industries of the future. This is not an option. This is a necessity.

The next major priority for me, and for all of us, should be to lower the cost of healthcare and prescription drugs — and to protect patients with pre-existing conditions.

Already, as a result of my Administration’s efforts, in 2018 drug prices experienced their single largest decline in 46 years.

But we must do more. It is unacceptable that Americans pay vastly more than people in other countries for the exact same drugs, often made in the exact same place. This is wrong, unfair, and together we can stop it.

I am asking the Congress to pass legislation that finally takes on the problem of global freeloading and delivers fairness and price transparency for American patients. We should also require drug companies, insurance companies, and hospitals to disclose real prices to foster competition and bring costs down.

No force in history has done more to advance the human condition than American freedom. In recent years we have made remarkable progress in the fight against HIV and AIDS. Scientific breakthroughs have brought a once-distant dream within reach. My budget will ask Democrats and Republicans to make the needed commitment to eliminate the HIV epidemic in the United States within 10 years. Together, we will defeat AIDS in America.

Tonight, I am also asking you to join me in another fight that all Americans can get behind: the fight against childhood cancer.

Joining Melania in the gallery this evening is a very brave 10-year-old girl, Grace Eline. Every birthday since she was 4, Grace asked her friends to donate to St. Jude Children’s Research Hospital. She did not know that one day she might be a patient herself. Last year, Grace was diagnosed with brain cancer. Immediately, she began radiation treatment. At the same time, she rallied her community and raised more than $40,000 for the fight against cancer. When Grace completed treatment last fall, her doctors and nurses cheered with tears in their eyes as she hung up a poster that read: “Last Day of Chemo.” Grace — you are an inspiration to us all.

Many childhood cancers have not seen new therapies in decades. My budget will ask the Congress for $500 million over the next 10 years to fund this critical life-saving research.

To help support working parents, the time has come to pass school choice for America’s children. I am also proud to be the first President to include in my budget a plan for nationwide paid family leave — so that every new parent has the chance to bond with their newborn child.

There could be no greater contrast to the beautiful image of a mother holding her infant child than the chilling displays our Nation saw in recent days. Lawmakers in New York cheered with delight upon the passage of legislation that would allow a baby to be ripped from the mother’s womb moments before birth. These are living, feeling, beautiful babies who will never get the chance to share their love and dreams with the world. And then, we had the case of the Governor of Virginia where he basically stated he would execute a baby after birth.

To defend the dignity of every person, I am asking the Congress to pass legislation to prohibit the late-term abortion of children who can feel pain in the mother’s womb.

Let us work together to build a culture that cherishes innocent life. And let us reaffirm a fundamental truth: all children — born and unborn — are made in the holy image of God.

The final part of my agenda is to protect America’s National Security.

Over the last 2 years, we have begun to fully rebuild the United States Military — with $700 billion last year and $716 billion this year. We are also getting other nations to pay their fair share. For years, the United States was being treated very unfairly by NATO — but now we have secured a $100 billion increase in defense spending from NATO allies.

As part of our military build-up, the United States is developing a state-of-the-art Missile Defense System.

Under my Administration, we will never apologize for advancing America’s interests.

For example, decades ago the United States entered into a treaty with Russia in which we agreed to limit and reduce our missile capabilities. While we followed the agreement to the letter, Russia repeatedly violated its terms. That is why I announced that the United States is officially withdrawing from the Intermediate-Range Nuclear Forces Treaty, or INF Treaty.

Perhaps we can negotiate a different agreement, adding China and others, or perhaps we can’t –- in which case, we will outspend and out-innovate all others by far.

As part of a bold new diplomacy, we continue our historic push for peace on the Korean Peninsula. Our hostages have come home, nuclear testing has stopped, and there has not been a missile launch in 15 months. If I had not been elected President of the United States, we would right now, in my opinion, be in a major war with North Korea with potentially millions of people killed. Much work remains to be done, but my relationship with Kim Jong Un is a good one. And Chairman Kim and I will meet again on February 27 and 28 in Vietnam.

Two weeks ago, the United States officially recognized the legitimate government of Venezuela, and its new interim President, Juan Guaido.

We stand with the Venezuelan people in their noble quest for freedom — and we condemn the brutality of the Maduro regime, whose socialist policies have turned that nation from being the wealthiest in South America into a state of abject poverty and despair.

Here, in the United States, we are alarmed by new calls to adopt socialism in our country. America was founded on liberty and independence –- not government coercion, domination, and control. We are born free, and we will stay free. Tonight, we renew our resolve that America will never be a socialist country.

One of the most complex set of challenges we face is in the Middle East.

Our approach is based on principled realism — not discredited theories that have failed for decades to yield progress. For this reason, my Administration recognized the true capital of Israel — and proudly opened the American Embassy in Jerusalem.

Our brave troops have now been fighting in the Middle East for almost 19 years. In Afghanistan and Iraq, nearly 7,000 American heroes have given their lives. More than 52,000 Americans have been badly wounded. We have spent more than $7 trillion in the Middle East.

As a candidate for President, I pledged a new approach. Great nations do not fight endless wars.

When I took office, ISIS controlled more than 20,000 square miles in Iraq and Syria. Today, we have liberated virtually all of that territory from the grip of these bloodthirsty killers.

Now, as we work with our allies to destroy the remnants of ISIS, it is time to give our brave warriors in Syria a warm welcome home.

I have also accelerated our negotiations to reach a political settlement in Afghanistan. Our troops have fought with unmatched valor — and thanks to their bravery, we are now able to pursue a political solution to this long and bloody conflict.

In Afghanistan, my Administration is holding constructive talks with a number of Afghan groups, including the Taliban. As we make progress in these negotiations, we will be able to reduce our troop presence and focus on counter-terrorism. We do not know whether we will achieve an agreement — but we do know that after two decades of war, the hour has come to at least try for peace.

Above all, friend and foe alike must never doubt this Nation’s power and will to defend our people. Eighteen years ago, terrorists attacked the USS Cole — and last month American forces killed one of the leaders of the attack.

We are honored to be joined tonight by Tom Wibberley, whose son, Navy Seaman Craig Wibberley, was one of the 17 sailors we tragically lost. Tom: we vow to always remember the heroes of the USS Cole.

My Administration has acted decisively to confront the world’s leading state sponsor of terror: the radical regime in Iran.

To ensure this corrupt dictatorship never acquires nuclear weapons, I withdrew the United States from the disastrous Iran nuclear deal. And last fall, we put in place the toughest sanctions ever imposed on a country.

We will not avert our eyes from a regime that chants death to America and threatens genocide against the Jewish people. We must never ignore the vile poison of anti-Semitism, or those who spread its venomous creed. With one voice, we must confront this hatred anywhere and everywhere it occurs.

Just months ago, 11 Jewish-Americans were viciously murdered in an anti-semitic attack on the Tree of Life Synagogue in Pittsburgh. SWAT Officer Timothy Matson raced into the gunfire and was shot seven times chasing down the killer. Timothy has just had his 12th surgery — but he made the trip to be here with us tonight. Officer Matson: we are forever grateful for your courage in the face of evil.

Tonight, we are also joined by Pittsburgh survivor Judah Samet. He arrived at the synagogue as the massacre began. But not only did Judah narrowly escape death last fall — more than seven decades ago, he narrowly survived the Nazi concentration camps. Today is Judah’s 81st birthday. Judah says he can still remember the exact moment, nearly 75 years ago, after 10 months in a concentration camp, when he and his family were put on a train, and told they were going to another camp. Suddenly the train screeched to a halt. A soldier appeared. Judah’s family braced for the worst. Then, his father cried out with joy: “It’s the Americans.”

A second Holocaust survivor who is here tonight, Joshua Kaufman, was a prisoner at Dachau Concentration Camp. He remembers watching through a hole in the wall of a cattle car as American soldiers rolled in with tanks. “To me,” Joshua recalls, “the American soldiers were proof that God exists, and they came down from the sky.”

I began this evening by honoring three soldiers who fought on D-Day in the Second World War. One of them was Herman Zeitchik. But there is more to Herman’s story. A year after he stormed the beaches of Normandy, Herman was one of those American soldiers who helped liberate Dachau. He was one of the Americans who helped rescue Joshua from that hell on earth. Almost 75 years later, Herman and Joshua are both together in the gallery tonight — seated side-by-side, here in the home of American freedom. Herman and Joshua: your presence this evening honors and uplifts our entire Nation.

When American soldiers set out beneath the dark skies over the English Channel in the early hours of D-Day, 1944, they were just young men of 18 and 19, hurtling on fragile landing craft toward the most momentous battle in the history of war.

They did not know if they would survive the hour. They did not know if they would grow old. But they knew that America had to prevail. Their cause was this Nation, and generations yet unborn.

Why did they do it? They did it for America — they did it for us.

Everything that has come since — our triumph over communism, our giant leaps of science and discovery, our unrivaled progress toward equality and justice — all of it is possible thanks to the blood and tears and courage and vision of the Americans who came before.

Think of this Capitol — think of this very chamber, where lawmakers before you voted to end slavery, to build the railroads and the highways, to defeat fascism, to secure civil rights, to face down an evil empire.

Here tonight, we have legislators from across this magnificent republic. You have come from the rocky shores of Maine and the volcanic peaks of Hawaii; from the snowy woods of Wisconsin and the red deserts of Arizona; from the green farms of Kentucky and the golden beaches of California. Together, we represent the most extraordinary Nation in all of history.

What will we do with this moment? How will we be remembered?

I ask the men and women of this Congress: Look at the opportunities before us! Our most thrilling achievements are still ahead. Our most exciting journeys still await. Our biggest victories are still to come. We have not yet begun to dream.

We must choose whether we are defined by our differences — or whether we dare to transcend them.

We must choose whether we will squander our inheritance — or whether we will proudly declare that we are Americans. We do the incredible. We defy the impossible. We conquer the unknown.

This is the time to re-ignite the American imagination. This is the time to search for the tallest summit, and set our sights on the brightest star. This is the time to rekindle the bonds of love and loyalty and memory that link us together as citizens, as neighbors, as patriots.

This is our future — our fate — and our choice to make. I am asking you to choose greatness.

No matter the trials we face, no matter the challenges to come, we must go forward together.

We must keep America first in our hearts. We must keep freedom alive in our souls. And we must always keep faith in America’s destiny — that one Nation, under God, must be the hope and the promise and the light and the glory among all the nations of the world!

Pinterest This happens to me at least once a week: I fill my electric kettle up with water to let it boil for my evening tea and then… well, anything can happen. I was in the middle of working on something, or the TV show I’m watching just got really good and now what?

The perfectly hot water is now regrettably cold. The solution may seem simple; just turn the kettle back on and reboil it to be enjoyed in a couple more minutes.

But what happens to water when we reboil it?

It’s something they never taught us in chemistry class, but really should have. When we boil water, the chemistry of it changes, which is usually a good thing as it boils out volatile compounds and dissolves gases. This is why boiling water mostly ensures that it’s safe to drink.

If water is left boiled too long or is reboiled, the chemical compounds change for the worst. By leaving your water to boil down, you’re actually concentrating many harmful chemicals instead of getting rid of them.

The same thing happens when you reboil water, as the compounds concentrate and increase the risk of ingesting certain chemicals.

These chemicals could include arsenic, nitrates, and fluoride. Even the minerals that are healthy for us can become dangerous when concentrated, such as calcium salt which can lead to These chemicals could include arsenic, nitrates, and fluoride. Even the minerals that are healthy for us can become dangerous when concentrated, such as calcium salt which can lead to kidney stones and gallstones when taken excessively.

The Destructive Effects of Reboiled Water

1. Arsenic

“Drinking-water poses the greatest threat to public health from arsenic,” states The World Health Organization (WHO).

may lead to arsenic toxicity, which can develop physical effects slowly over a number of years, depending on the level of exposure. Exposure to arsenic may lead to arsenic toxicity, which can develop physical effects slowly over a number of years, depending on the level of exposure.

Dangers of arsenic toxicity include peripheral neuropathy, gastrointestinal symptoms, skin lesions, diabetes, renal systems effects, cardiovascular disease, and even cancer.

2. Nitrates

Nitrates are found naturally all over earth, in the soil, water, and air. However, the chemical can become harmful when used as a food preservative, such as in deli meats, or when exposed to high heat, such as boiling water.

When nitrates are exposed to high temperatures, they convert to nitrosamines, which are carcinogenic.

Nitrates have been linked to many diseases such as leukemia, non-Hodkin lymphoma, and different cancers, including colon, bladder, ovarian, stomach, pancreatic, and esophageal cancer.

3. Fluoride

Many studies have been done over the Many studies have been done over the controversial chemical fluoride and its presence in drinking water. The fact is, it’s there and it could pose a threat to your health. Despite the proof of the dangerous effects of fluoride, the government insists to keep it in our water.

Harvard University took data from over 27 studies that were carried out for 22 years and linked fluoride exposure to neurological and cognitive function in children.

The results were published in the journal of Environment Health Sciences and concluded that fluoride found in drinking water resulted in lower IQ scored among children.

A more recent study completed in 2013 links fluoride to lower infertility rates in male mice.

Unfortunately, not many of you know the numerous benefits they offer, and only a very small percentage of the natural medicines comprehensive database is dedicated to them.

Countries like Nigeria, Tanzania, Mozambique and Brazil are the biggest producers of cashew nuts, mostly due to the fact that they need hot and humid climate in order to grow.

Health Benefits of Cashew Nuts

Cashew nuts are rich in vitamins, soluble dietary fiber, minerals and many phytochemicals that prevent diseases, including cancers. Cashews are also rich in calories, about 50 grams of these favorable foods contain 275 calories.

These beneficial nuts provide numerous essential vitamins, including pantothenic acid or vitamin B5, pyridoxine or vitamin B6, thiamin or vitamin B11 and riboflavinThe aforementioned vitamins are crucial for metabolism of fat, protein and carbs at a cellular level. On the other hand, niacin improves the protection against pellagra or dermatitis.Furthermore, B6 is extremely beneficial for our health for it significantly lowers the chances of developing sideroblastic anemia and homocystinuria. Only 3.5 Oz (100 gr) of these nuts provide about 30% of daily recommended levels of B6 (that’s about 0.147 mg).

Moreover, cashews are also rich in essential minerals. Some of the most useful minerals found in cashew nuts are potassium, manganese, copper, selenium, magnesium, zinc and iron. Only a handful of these nuts on a daily basis can provide the necessary amount of these extremely needed minerals and protect you from deficiency- related diseases.For instance, copper acts as a co-factor for many important enzymes, like superoxide dismutase and cytochrome c- oxidase. Zinc, on the other hand, plays the same role together with enzymes that are responsible for the regulation of the growth and progress of digestion, gonadal function and DNA synthesis. Selenium is a very important micronutrient and it works as a co-factor for antioxidant enzymes like Glutathione peroxides, known as one of the strongest antioxidants in human body.

Monounsaturated fatty acids which are in high quantities in these nuts are extremely good for the heart health, as palmitoleic and oleic acids. They belong to the group of essential fatty acids that can increase the level of good HDL cholesterol and decrease the level of harmful LDLcholesterol in our blood. In addition, as shown by many scientific studies, the so-called Mediterranean diet which is mostly based on monounsaturated fatty acids supports the blood lipid profile, and protect our system from strokes and coronary artery diseases.

Furthermore, cashews also contain a small quantity of one very important pigment of flavonoid antioxidants, called zeaxanthin, which is selectively absorbed inside the retinal macula in our eyes. This pigment provides protective and antioxidant UV ray filtering features, and it also protects from ARMD or age-related macular degeneration in old people.

How Treat Depression Naturally – A Basic Guide to Cashew Nutrition

Cashew nuts are more than great source of tryptophan, which is a vital amino acid our body needs to take it throughout the food. This amino acid helps children develop and grow, regulates mood, balances our behavior, improves sleep and can significantly lower the level of stress, anxiety and depression.

Just two handfuls of cashews contain somewhere between 1.000 and 2.000 mg of tryptophan. This compound has been proven to be as equally successful as prescription antidepressants. The best thing about treating depression with cashews is that you will surely avoid side effects that are usually caused by antidepressants. Of course, this is yet another thing big pharma carefully hides from us.

According to FDA Deputy Commissioner for Policy’s David Adams, who was part of the Drug Information Association Annual Meeting back in 1993, we need to pay close attention to the things happening around the legal arena and dietary supplements. If producers of natural remedies manage getting the support, there will most likely be a completely new class of products, which will be competing with the already existing drugs. This is why we need a special law that will have the function to regulate the supplements.

In addition, back in 1993, FDA Dietary Task Force has released a report saying that the selling and existence of dietary supplements will not jeopardize efforts for creating new drugs.

As you are probably aware by now, big pharma is a huge business. However, there is much effective and safer natural depression treatment they want to hide from the common people because thus they will lose lots of money.

An introduction to Cashew Nut Allergy

Beside allergies caused by eating walnuts, almonds and other nuts, cashew nut cause allergy in both adults and children and is one of the commonest food allergies. Same as peanuts, cashews can lead to occurrence of some very severe allergic reactions, even if the individual has consumed just a small quantity of cashews.

The healthy nuts we dedicate this article to are a hidden ingredient in many common foods such as ice cream, cakes and Asian dishes. Anyway, if you ever experience symptoms of cashew nut allergy, it is mandatory to look for professional help.

May 20th, 2019

WASHINGTON, D.C.—Bernie Sanders's favorite pastime is calling out evil billionaires for their evilness. Sanders found the perfect opportunity to do this once again as billionaire Robert F. Smith announced he would be paying off the student debt of those who graduated from Morehouse College.

Sanders pointed to the egregious waste of funds as a perfect example of what happens when billionaires are allowed to keep their money.

""Why does this evil billionaire think he knows what's best for his money when clearly the incredibly efficient federal government could put it to better use?"" Sanders said at a rally Monday.

He was 54.

Dr. Lorich was found on the bathroom floor of his tony Upper East Side apartment with a knife in his chest by his 11-year-old daughter at around 1pm on Monday.

The knife missed the surgeon’s heart, leaving him to bleed out and be found by his daughter. Despite the fact police were called to the property regarding an “assault“, they instantly registered the death as “suicide” and closed the case.

One of the United States’ leading surgeons, Dr. Lorich was part of the relief effort sent by the U.S. to assist the relief effort led by the Clinton Foundation in Haiti after the devastating 2010 earthquake. However Dr. Lorich was disgusted by the “shameful” Clinton Foundation operation, and voiced his concerns to Hillary Clinton directly.

Unsatisfied with her response, he went public, writing an article published by CNN, accusing the Clinton Foundation of widespread corruption and malpractice in Haiti that cost the lives of thousands of children.

CNN article co-authored by Dr. Lorich exposing the extent of Clinton Foundation malpractice and corruption in Haiti.

Billions of dollars were raised by the Clinton Foundation to help the Haitians, but the vast bulk of this money was funneled to Clinton friends and associates, according to Dr. Lorich, who described in harrowing detail what this meant for the children of Haiti.

Dr. Lorich argued that, in essence, Clinton greed left Haitian children to die painful deaths:

“We expected many amputations. But we thought we could save limbs that were salvageable, particularly those of children. We recognized that in an underdeveloped country, a limb amputation may be a death sentence. It does not have to be so.“

“Shameful”

Considering billions of dollars had been donated to the Clinton Foundation with the express purpose of helping the Haitians, Dr Lorich and his team expected to have full support when their plane touched down.

Instead, Dr. Lorich described the situation on the ground as “shameful” and he witnessed Clinton Foundation corruption in action. The Haitians were receiving no help whatsoever.

According to Dr. Lorich, a paltry 0.6% of donations granted by international donors to the Clinton Foundation with the express purpose of directly assisting Haitians actually ended up helping citizens of Haiti. 9.6% ended up with the Haitian government. The remaining 89.8% – or $5.4 billion – was funneled to non-Haitian organizations.

Dr. Lorich’s WikiLeaks emails

Unable to perform his duties – and disgusted by the rampant corruption – Dr. Lorich sent an email to then-Secretary of State Hillary Clinton’s Chief of Staff Cheryl D. Mills to report what he had seen. The email was then forwarded to Hillary Clinton which meant it eventually found its way into WikiLeaks’ possession and can be read here

Dr. Dean Lorich on the ground in Haiti where he was disgusted to witness Clinton Foundation corruption first hand.

Unsatisfied with the lack of response from Hillary Clinton, Dr. Lorich went public, co-authored the CNN article that exposed the Clinton Foundation’s corruption and malpractice in Haiti:

“We found scores of patients with pus dripping out of open extremity fractures and crush injuries,” reported Dr. Lorich.

“Some wounds were already ridden with maggots.“

“About a third of these victims were children.“

“The entire hospital smelled of infected, rotting limbs and death.“

“Later on, we would judge our surgical progress by the diminishment of the stench.”

“As we got up and running and organized the patients for surgery, we told our contacts in the United States [the Clintons] what we needed.“

Unfortunately the Clinton Foundation did not provide that help, despite pocketing billions of dollars from donors with the express purpose of providing medical support to desperate Haitians.

“We left feeling as if we abandoned these patients, the country, and its people, and we feel terrible,” Dr. Lorich wrote, adding: “Our flight of critical medical equipment and personnel had been canceled.“

The father of three girls, Dr. Lorich was the associate director of the Orthopedic Trauma Service at the Hospital for Special Surgery in New York City, as well as the Chief of the Orthopedic Trauma Service at New York Presbyterian Hospital.

EPA Takes Three Important Steps to Ensure Chemical Safety Under the Lautenberg Act, Proposes Action on Asbestos

Contact Information: EPA Press Office (press@epa.gov)

WASHINGTON – Today, the U.S. Environmental Protection Agency (EPA) is releasing the following for public comment: (1) the first ten problem formulation documents, (2) EPA’s systemic review approach document, and (3) a significant new use rule (SNUR) proposal enabling the Agency to prevent new uses of asbestos – the first such action on asbestos ever proposed.

“These actions provide the American people with transparency and an opportunity to comment on how EPA plans to evaluate the ten chemicals undergoing risk evaluation, select studies, and use the best available science to ensure chemicals in the marketplace are safe,” said EPA Administrator Scott Pruitt. “At the same time, we are moving forward to take important, unprecedented action on asbestos.”

The problem formulation documents refine the scope of risk evaluations for the first ten chemicals selected under the Frank R. Lautenberg Chemical Safety for the 21st Century Act, which amended the Toxic Substances Control Act (TSCA). The Agency’s problem formulation documents are an important interim step prior to completing and publishing the final risk evaluations by December 2019. They clarify the chemical uses that EPA expects to evaluate and describe how EPA expects to conduct the evaluations. Read the documents. Comments are due in 45 days upon publication in the Federal Register.

EPA’s systematic review approach document will guide EPA’s selection and review of studies in addition to providing the public with continued transparency regarding how the Agency plans to evaluate scientific information. Read the document. Comments are due in 45 days upon publication in the Federal Register (Docket: EPA-HQ-OPPT-2018-0210).

For asbestos, EPA is proposing a SNUR for certain uses of asbestos (including asbestos-containing goods) that would require manufacturers and importers to receive EPA approval before starting or resuming manufacturing, and importing or processing of asbestos. This review process would provide EPA with the opportunity to evaluate the intended use of asbestos and, when necessary, take action to prohibit or limit the use. Read the document. Comments are due in 60 days upon publication in the Federal Register (Docket: EPA-HQ-OPPT-2018-0159).

The Frank R. Lautenberg Chemical Safety for the 21st Century Act required EPA to select the first ten chemicals to undergo risk evaluations. These ten chemicals were announced on December 16, 2016. As required, EPA issued corresponding scope documents on June 22, 2017, for these chemicals, which describe the scope of the risk evaluation to be conducted, including the hazards, exposures, conditions of use, and potentially exposed or susceptible subpopulations that the Agency expects to consider. The problem formulation documents EPA issued today refine those scope documents.

Biden Jr. created a stir Tuesday at a campaign speech in Virginia when he told the crowd that Mitt Romney’s policies would enable the banking and financial sectors to “put you all back in chains.”

The remark came roughly two-thirds of the way through Mr. Biden’s 30-minute speech, which was delivered to a crowd that included many African-Americans at the Institute for Advanced Learning and Research in Danville, Va.

“Romney wants to let the — he said in the first hundred days, he’s going to let the big banks once again write their own rules, unchain Wall Street,” Mr. Biden said. “They’re going to put you all back in chains.”

On a C-Span video of the speech, the audience does not appear to react negatively to Mr. Biden’s phrasing; indeed, laughter can be heard among the crowd.

President Obama and his surrogates have been campaigning heavily in Virginia, and the campaign’s strategy relies in part on energizing the black vote to take the traditionally Republican state, which moved to the Democratic column in the 2008 presidential election. According to the Census, the population of Danville is roughly 48.8 percent white and 48.6 percent black.

After Mr. Biden’s address, some Republicans assailed Mr. Biden’s remark. On Twitter, Ari Fleischer, a former press secretary for President George W. Bush, likened the comment to one made by Sarah Palin when she compared critical press coverage to “blood libel,” a term alluding to the false allegation that Jews once killed Christian children to use their blood for religious rituals.

“The press pounded Palin when she talked about ‘blood libel,’” Mr. Fleischer wrote. “What will they do about Biden’s ‘chains’ remark?”

Later Tuesday, both presidential campaigns responded to the vice president’s remarks, with Mr. Romney’s campaign calling the phrasing “not acceptable.”

“After weeks of slanderous and baseless accusations leveled against Governor Romney, the Obama campaign has reached a new low,” Andrea Saul, Mr. Romney’s press secretary, said in a statement. “The comments made by the vice president of the United States are not acceptable in our political discourse and demonstrate yet again that the Obama campaign will say and do anything to win this election. President Obama should tell the American people whether he agrees with Joe Biden’s comments.”

In a statement, Stephanie Cutter, Mr. Obama’s deputy campaign manager, defended Mr. Biden.

“For months, Speaker Boehner, Congressman Ryan and other Republicans have called for the ‘unshackling’ of the private sector from regulations that protect Americans from risky financial deals and other reckless behavior that crashed our economy. Since then, the vice president has often used a similar metaphor to describe the need to ‘unshackle’ the middle class. Today’s comments were a derivative of those remarks, describing the devastating impact letting Wall Street write its own rules again would have on middle class families. We find the Romney campaign’s outrage over the vice president’s comments today hypocritical, particularly in light of their own candidate’s stump speech questioning the president’s patriotism. Now, let’s return to that ‘substantive’ debate Mitt Romney and Paul Ryan promised 72 hours ago, but quickly abandoned.”

As he concluded his speech, Mr. Biden confused North Carolina with Virginia, where Danville is located.

“With you we can win North Carolina again, and if we do, we win the election if we win you,” Mr. Biden said.

The city of Danville abuts the northern border of North Carolina, which also went for Mr. Obama in 2008 but is considered a more challenging state for his campaign this time around.

At a second appearance on Tuesday, in Wytheville, Va., Mr. Biden said his remarks had merely alluded to a term used previously by Republicans, including Mr. Romney’s running mate, Representative Paul D. Ryan. In his response to Mr. Obama’s State of the Union address in 2011, Mr. Ryan said, “We believe a renewed commitment to limited government will unshackle our economy and create millions of new jobs and opportunities for all people, of every background, to succeed and prosper.”

“And I’m told that when I made that comment earlier today in Danville, Va., the Romney campaign put out a tweet,” Mr. Biden told the crowd in Wytheville. “You know, tweets these days? Put out a tweet, went on the airwaves saying, ‘Biden, he’s outrageous in saying that,’ I think I said instead of ‘unshackled,’ ‘unchained.’ ‘Outrageous to say that.’ That’s what we had. I’m using their own words.”

“I got a message for them,” Mr. Biden continued. “If you want to know what’s outrageous, it’s their policies and the effects of their policies on middle-class America. That’s what’s outrageous.”

Mr. Romney addressed Mr. Biden’s original remark in a speech Tuesday evening in Chillicothe, Ohio, calling it an indicator that Mr. Obama’s presidency had become “angry and desperate,” according to The Associated Press.",Biden Warns Romney Policies Would Put Crowd ‘Back in Chains’,2012-08-14 00:00:00,['Rebecca Berg'],"['campaign', 'crowd', 'policies', 'mr', 'obama', 'chains', 'warns', 'romney', 'speech', 'bidens', 'vice', 'press', 'president', 'biden']","After Mr. Biden’s address, some Republicans assailed Mr. Biden’s remark.

State Senator Scott Wiener (D-San Francisco) and Assemblywoman Susan Eggman (D-Stockton) introduced recent legislation “to end blatant discrimination against LGBT young people regarding California’s sex offender registry.”

However, under their bill, SB 145, the offenders would not have to automatically register as sex offenders if the offenders are within 10 years of age of the minor.

Wiener claims the current law “disproportionately targets LGBT young people for mandatory sex offender registration, since LGBT people usually cannot engage in vaginal intercourse.”

Existing law, the Sex Offender Registration Act, amended by Proposition 35 by voters in 2012 (Ban on Human Trafficking and Sex Slavery), requires a person convicted of a certain sex crime to register with law enforcement as a sex offender while residing in California or while attending school or working in California.

Wiener says, “Currently, for consensual yet illegal sexual relations between a teenager age 15 and over and a partner within 10 years of age, ‘sexual intercourse’ (i.e., vaginal intercourse) does not require the offender to go onto the sex offender registry; rather, the judge decides based on the facts of the case whether sex offender registration is warranted or unwarranted. By contrast, for other forms of intercourse — specifically, oral and anal intercourse — sex offender registration is mandated under all situations, with no judicial discretion.”

“This bill would authorize a person convicted of certain offenses involving minors to seek discretionary relief from the duty to register if the person is not more than 10 years older than the minor,” SB 145 states.

Proposition 35 was created and passed to protect children from sexual exploitation and sex trafficking. Victims of sex trafficking are often vulnerable children, “afraid for their lives and abused—sexually, physically, and mentally,” the Proposition said.

What Does SB 145 Also Do?

Legislators Wiener and Eggman say they are trying to shield LGBT young people from having to automatically register as sex offenders for specified sex crimes. But their bill does much more.

SB 145 would allow a sex offender who lures a minor with the intent to commit a felony (i.e. a sex act) the ability to escape registering as a sex offender as long as the offender is within 10 years of age of the minor. No specification is made as to whether the sexual offender is straight or LGBT.

SB 145 would add a section to the state’s penal code (Section 290.55) stipulating that as long as the offender is “not more than 10 years older than the minor,” they are not automatically mandated to register as a sex offender. There is no age limit or range specified, except for existing law which already excludes lewd acts with children under 14.

SB 145 appears to allow adults to victimize minors by luring them with the intent to have sex, and then shields the predator from being automatically registered as a sex offender, as in the case of a 25 year old luring a 15 year old for sex, or a 22 year old luring a 12 year old.

SB 145, as currently written, appears to allow certain sexual predators to live among the population without anyone being aware.

Why is this bill needed?

Here is the text from SB 145:

This bill would authorize a person convicted of certain offenses involving minors to seek discretionary relief from the duty to register if the person is not more than 10 years older than the minor.

Digest Key – Vote: MAJORITY Appropriation: NO Fiscal Committee: YES Local Program: NO

THE PEOPLE OF THE STATE OF CALIFORNIA DO ENACT AS FOLLOWS:

SECTION 1. Section 290.55 is added to the Penal Code, immediately following Section 290.5, to read:

290.55. (a) A person convicted of an offense specified in subdivision (b) may, by writ of mandate, seek discretionary relief from the duty, imposed as a result of that conviction, to register pursuant to the act if, at the time of the offense, the person is not more than 10 years older than the minor, as measured from the minor’s date of birth to the person’s date of birth.

Here is the current California Penal Code § 288.3 (2017)

(a) Every person who contacts or communicates with a minor, or attempts to contact or communicate with a minor, who knows or reasonably should know that the person is a minor, with intent to commit an offense specified in Section 207, 209, 261, 264.1, 273a, 286, 287, 288, 288.2, 289, 311.1, 311.2, 311.4 or 311.11, or former Section 288a, involving the minor shall be punished by imprisonment in the state prison for the term prescribed for an attempt to commit the intended offense.

(b) As used in this section, “contacts or communicates with” shall include direct and indirect contact or communication that may be achieved personally or by use of an agent or agency, any print medium, any postal service, a common carrier or communication common carrier, any electronic communications system, or any telecommunications, wire, computer, or radio communications device or system.

(c) A person convicted of a violation of subdivision (a) who has previously been convicted of a violation of subdivision (a) shall be punished by an additional and consecutive term of imprisonment in the state prison for five years.

Last week, California Globe reported on another sex crime bill introduced by California Democrats: “legislation to shield a person from the consequences of crimes they commit in California, even violent ones, as long as the person reports the crimes to authorities.The language of the proposed statute appears to immunize a person from ANY crime so long as they are reporting a violation of a sex crime law.” Sen.

And fortunately, there is now REAL HOPE …

A completely natural medicine science is pointing to as THE SOLUTION to surviving the coming epidemic .

In fact, this unique treatment has already shown it can wipe out some of the deadliest drug-resistant superbugs on the planet

It’s a medically verified, oral immune booster known as AC-44 .

And the more scientists study it, the more they’re amazed by the results…

For starters… AC-44 has been scientifically verified to be 100 times more powerful than some of the most popular antibiotics available .

To demonstrate this, researchers at the University of London put AC-44 to the test against the most antibiotic resistant strain of staph infection known to man…

A “superbug” known as MRSA that kills tens of thousands of patients in UK and US hospitals every year…

This infection swats away antibiotics like a gorilla shooing a fly.

That’s why researchers were stunned when lab studies showed AC-44 can kill the deadly infection in just weeks .

Giving new hope to millions around the world.

How is it able to achieve such unheard of results? By doing something antibiotics simply can’t …

AC-44 is able to completely shut down superbugs’ ability to grow and spread throughout your body on a cellular level…

Weakening the virus…so your immune system can finally keep up.

But is AC-44 powerful enough to halt the spread of Mexican “Blood Flu?”

Thank God —YES!

In fact, when AC-44 was specifically tested on the Mexican “Blood Flu” the results were amazing.

Lab studies show that…

AC-44 is able to kill the Mexican “Blood Flu” virus in less than 6 hours

Yes, one of the most feared and drug-resistant superbugs on the planet can be wiped out in mere hours .

So why haven’t you heard of it?

Why on Earth aren’t they express shipping palettes of AC-44 to hospitals around the country?

Because the more scientists study it, the more they find it can do.It’s not just “Blood flu,” this natural breakthrough is being proven effective against some of the most deadly and common diseases of our time...

Which is why big pharma executives are willing to risk a pandemic to keep a lid on it and protect their profits…

Studies show it can slash both diastolic and systolic blood pressure, lower cholesterol and even wash away deadly artery plaque.

But that’s only the beginning…

Research shows it can destroy infections, germs and bacteria of all kinds…

Scientists at Bringham Young University found that AC-44 kills nearly 100% of the rhinovirus responsible for common colds and flu.

They also found it’s 90%-100% effective against both the Herpes and Polio viruses.

It’s so strong it’s been used to ward off things like gangrene, the plague, and cystic fibrosis .

But here’s where Big Pharma is really threatened…

It’s even being used against some of the deadliest cancers in the world .

Studies show it can slash lung cancer risk nearly in half…

It can destroy deadly glioblastoma brain cancer cells by the millions…

And it’s also being used to prevent prostate, breast, stomach, rectal and colon cancer .

In fact, AC-44 is so promising that as we speak… Big Pharma is in the process of synthesizing this natural miracle into a pill they hope to sell for billions in profit.

Which is exactly why they don’t want the public to know that there’s a natural version available RIGHT NOW .

It couldn’t be more obvious…

In order to protect yourself and your family from the deadly Mexican “Blood Flu”…

As well as skyrocket your immune system to fend off cold, flu and deadly staph infections…

Or even fight some of the deadliest cancers ever recorded…

You have to get your hands on a life-saving supply of AC-44 .

And you have to do it RIGHT NOW .

Shortages of this natural breakthrough are already being reported around the world…

And when the Mexican “Blood Flu” explodes in 2019, those shortages will surely skyrocket .

Meaning you and your loved ones could find yourself empty-handed and unprotected at the worst possible time.

That’s why I want to provide you with everything you need to obtain your very own personal supply of AC-44 immediately .

Where to find it… and the most potent source.

You’ll discover every single life-saving detail inside Forbidden Miracles: Natural Healing Secrets to the World’s Deadliest Diseases

A 504 page book personally compiled by the health researchers at the Institute for Natural Healing …

And in a minute, you’ll discover how you can receive a bound and printed copy absolutely FREE .

Inside you’ll find full details on how to protect yourself and your family from the Mexican “Blood Flu” using AC-44…

But that’s not the only thing you’ll learn about today because…

The Mexican “Blood Flu” is FAR from the only threat facing American seniors in 2019.

In fact, you face one that’s arguably bigger.

A mainstream medical “industrial complex” that’s actively ignoring natural cures and treatments to some of America’s most deadly and debilitating diseases.

Why is this happening?

Because the American medical system is more concerned with profit than patients…

Last year alone, American pharmaceutical companies pocketed a mind-blowing $458 billion .

That’s more than double drug sales in China, Russia, Brazil and India put together!

And they’ll do anything to protect their money.

Which means silencing natural alternatives with the power to stop their endless cycle of dangerous prescriptions…

Because to them, a cured patient is no longer a paying customer.

Which is why mainstream medicine desperately doesn’t want you to hear what I’m about to tell you…

There are currently 5 new natural treatments you can have today with the power to reverse or even cure America’s most deadly and debilitating diseases

A secret breakthrough that kills 10,000 times more cancer cells than standard methods alone, used by an underground network of American oncologists. The brand new “Sabin Technique” that completely reverses arthritis, eliminates pain and repairs damaged joints . It’s so powerful it’s even been shown to reverse paralysis! Rare Chinese “Acetyl Moss” that blows away top-selling Alzheimer’s drugs and improves memory function by 460% . (Supplies are limited but we’ll tell you how to secure your very own.) The liquid Israeli cardio solution that reverses heart disease and clears clogged arteries 5 times better than any prescription . (And tastes delicious!) The simple solution for reversing type II diabetes in as little as 8 weeks that’s stunning European scientists. (It tricks your body into creating its own insulin again!)

Across America, doctors have been raided, black-listed and even jailed for promoting the same type of natural alternative treatments we’re about to expose…

But at INH we’ve realized there is strength in numbers …

Which is why we’ve developed a vast network of 280,000 independent medical researchers, doctors and like-minded individuals like you.

And just like we’ve been tracking the spread of the Mexican “Blood Flu” and the AC-44 breakthrough that can stop it…

We’ve also been using our rapidly expanding resources and connections around the world to uncover the most powerful cures to some of today’s most common (and deadly) diseases…

And while you’ll find countless of them in your free copy of Forbidden Miracles …

We feel the five I mentioned above are so important, you absolutely must see them today.

We call them the INH Top Five .

And I’m going to reveal them to you right now, starting with…

A cancer-starving miracle used by an exclusive group of American oncologists

It’s been scientifically proven 10,000 times more powerful than standard methods alone in in-vitro studies…

One doctor is even reporting full remission rates of up to 95% ...

And even better, it also shields your healthy cells from harm!

That means you can now destroy 10,000 times more deadly cancer cells …

Without the agonizing side effects of conventional treatments.

And no matter how bleak your diagnosis… or advanced your cancer…

There is now real hope for complete and total remission.

Because this unique method is being used by doctors around the world to treat some of the most aggressive cancers known to man including…

Lung

Uterine

Bone

Lymphoma

Sarcoma

Hodgkin’s Lymphoma

Pancreatic

And that’s just a small sample.

Yes, right now patients are reporting recoveries from cancers once considered a death sentence as easily as if they were shaking off a bad cold.

And here’s the sad part…

Mainstream medicine has known about this method for decades. But instead of ending the suffering of tens of millions and promoting what many consider a real cure …

They chose to protect the profits of the cancer industry while your friends, family and acquaintances slowly succumbed to this horrible disease.

That ends today.

I’m going to fill you in on every last detail about this groundbreaking cancer breakthrough right now…

The scientific proof, the secret behind how it works and real-life patients who are cheating death by using it right now.

So let’s dive in.

In 1923, Canadian scientists received a Nobel Prize for the discovery of a natural protein they called Insula Peptide …

Researchers around the world were first stunned by its ability to treat everything from Diabetes to Syphilis.

But it was another 70 years before its true potential became clear.

Doctors believe Insula Peptide kills cancer cells in droves

It exploded in popularity in South America where patients used it to make full recoveries from their cancer…

All without the burning, scarring and disfiguring side effects of conventional treatments.

And that’s when The National Cancer Institute took notice…

In a peer reviewed study… they took aggressive cancer cells and treated them with one of the most widely prescribed chemotherapies on the market…

But then they did something else…

They added Insula Peptide …

And were bowled over by the results.

Insula Peptide obliterated 10,000 times more cancer cells than the chemotherapy alone

Think about that… a natural treatment proven 10,000 times stronger than one of the most popular chemotherapies on the market.

You’d think the National Cancer Institute would have touted this study in every major American news outlet…

And urged oncologists to start adding it to their treatment regimens immediately .

But that’s not what they did at all.

Because even though they knew Insula Peptide had proven the ability to save millions of lives , they also knew something else…

Results like this would mean a roughly 90% drop in conventional treatments for cancer… and tens of billions in lost profit .

So they didn’t even publish the study in the United States.

Instead it was relegated to a small European medical journal, where it gathered dust and was quickly forgotten.

But a tight circle of forward thinking American oncologists still managed to find the results—and quietly started treating patients of their own.

And the results they’re reporting are mind-blowing … After years of treating patients, one doctor reported…

A 95% full remission rate for tumors smaller than 4 cm



An 80% full remission rate for tumors larger than 4 cm



And remission rates of up to 70% for recurrent cancers (consistently the most difficult of cancers to treat)

How does Insula Peptide achieve such incredible results?

By essentially starving cancer cells to death.

Cancer cells crave glucose and they need to gobble it up to survive…

In fact, cancer cells consume 20 times more glucose than normal cells…

Insula Peptide works by denying these cells access to glucose and starving them completely…

Even better, the starving cancer cells start gobbling up anything they can for food… including standard cancer treatments…

This causes cancer cells and tumors to shrivel away to nothing like magic.

And because Insula Peptide acts like a cancer seeking missile … your healthy cells stay out of the line of fire and are left to thrive.

Which is why patients recover with none of the debilitating side effects experienced by conventional treatments…

In fact, one doctor’s patients report quality of life improvements of 98% .

And while American doctors using this method are flying under the radar to avoid possible consequences from the FDA and big pharma…

Thankful patients are singing its praises online…

Like Carrie T. from Montana who says, “I was diagnosed with breast cancer. It was a 6mm malignant tumor.

After Insula Peptide, my prognosis now is very good…

“Ultrasounds revealed the tumor is nothing but a shell.”

I had absolutely NO side effects , continued working, home schooling and lived life!

I have NEVER felt sick or run-down. I actually felt as healthy, if not more, while undergoing treatments.”

And then there’s Tracy M from San Antonio, who was facing a terrifying lung cancer diagnosis. She says…

“After my diagnosis, I felt that my life was finished and that I would probably not see my family again.”

But after trying Insula Peptide, everything changed for the better…

As she puts it…

“I had a CAT scan of the lung at the South Texas Scan Center and the radiology specialist reported that the mass had disappeared .

I could not believe that I had been successfully treated.

Six months later another x-ray reported the absence of cancerous tumors .

At the moment (15 years later) I continue to enjoy life and good health.”

“My lung cancer disappeared.”

And then there’s James U. from Connecticut who writes…

“I had stage 4 prostate cancer. Very serious.

Because it had spread, (metastasized) the urologist suggested I start an anti- androgen therapy, commonly called chemical castration.

He explained there is no cure, I would lose my hair and go through menopause.

I was willing to do it if there was no option but… my wife Teresa called a friend that knows a lot about medicine. They recommended Insula Peptide.”

And that’s when everything changed for James. As he puts it…

“The size of my prostate is now near normal and no traces of other tumors can be seen in ultrasound scans.”

“There is no cancer activity and the tumors are gone.”

And when Allison C. was diagnosed with breast cancer, doctors told her she’d be dead in 6 months when she chose Insula Peptide over more conventional methods…

In fact, as she puts it...

“Insula Peptide made the cancer a non-event! I never lost my hair, and I never got sick.”

I am now totally cancer free and all my scans are clear. This quite simply saved my life. I will always be grateful.”

And these are just a handful of countless testimonials found online.

For years this revolutionary therapy was extremely difficult to obtain…

In fact, if you asked your doctor about it today he probably wouldn’t know what you’re talking about.

And that’s exactly why the Institute for Natural Healing is releasing Forbidden Miracles: Natural Healing Secrets to the World’s Deadliest Diseases .

On page 375 of your free copy, you’ll have full access to everything you need to know about Insula Peptide cancer treatment.

Including contact info for the brave underground doctors across the country who are experts in this cutting edge treatment.

But that’s far from the only thing you’ll find inside.

In addition to the 5 natural disease cures and treatments we’re revealing in this video…

Forbidden Miracles will also bring you complete details on countless more life-saving breakthroughs that mainstream medicine and big pharma have been suppressing for decades.

I’m going to tell you exactly how to get your free, 504 page copy in just a moment…

But first, I’m going to fill you in on the 2nd in our INH Top Five list…

And if you or a loved one have been suffering from debilitating pain then you’ll want to pay close attention because this proves…

Full recovery from arthritis and chronic pain is now a reality

It’s all thanks to a brand new treatment known as the Sabin Technique , after one of its earliest pioneers.

And you’re about to see how it’s not just healing a lucky few… but achieving unheard of recovery rates of up to 100% in scientific studies.

It’s quietly being used right now for conditions such as…

Osteoarthritis

Damaged Knee Cartilage

Degenerative Discs

Torn ACLs

Shoulder Rotator Cuff Tears

And even Paralysis due to Stroke

And whether your pain is in your hips, back, shoulders, or knees …

The Sabin Technique has the power to bring you complete and total relief … without dangerous prescription drugs, costly surgeries or debilitating side effects.

And the science behind it is stunning doctors worldwide...

In fact, Dr. Natesh Parashurama who’s led more than 30 studies on the Sabin Technique for both Stanford and Harvard says,

“This will change medicine forever.”

And when you look at some of the studies we’ve compiled here at the Institute for Natural Healing, it’s easy to see why.

A small study conducted by the University of Liverpool was able to literally regrow damaged knee cartilage for 100% of the patients treated after 12 months. Most were able to avoid a costly knee replacement surgery.

A small study conducted by the University of Liverpool was able to treated after 12 months. Most were able to avoid a costly knee replacement surgery. A study on agonizing hip osteoarthritis published in the Journal of Hip Preservation Surgery found that 100% of participants treated with the Sabin technique were able to walk and move with ease afterwards. 100 PERCENT ...

A study on agonizing hip osteoarthritis published in the Journal of Hip Preservation Surgery found that 100% of participants treated with the Sabin technique were able to walk and move with ease afterwards. ... Researchers from the University of Texas studied patients with degenerative disks so advanced and painful, their only option was a horrifying spinal fusion surgery. But after treatment with the Sabin Technique, 81% of the patients were so much better they avoided the surgery completely .

Researchers from the University of Texas studied patients with degenerative disks so advanced and painful, their only option was a horrifying spinal fusion surgery. But after treatment with the Sabin Technique, . And doctors from the University of Oregon treated patients with a torn ACL—an injury that normally requires almost a full year of rehabilitation—and 70% were able to regain nearly full function within just 3 months .

And that’s just a handful of the stunning research we have on file.

In fact, there are over 4,500 clinical trials involving the Sabin Technique right now.

So how does this work?

The Sabin Technique is a non-invasive treatment that works by doing something surgery and drugs simply can’t…

It harnesses your cell’s own healing powers to miraculously regrow damaged ligaments and joints .

So instead of masking the pain like addictive drugs… or filling you with metal plates, screws and stents like expensive surgeries…

The Sabin Technique actually targets the root cause of your pain … reverses the damage and leaves you totally pain-free.

And patients aren’t shy about sharing their shocking recoveries online…

Patients like Gabriel Marks from Los Angeles.

Gabriel was 55 but still keeping up with skiers decades younger on the most difficult slopes.

Then he started feeling stabbing pains in his knees and was diagnosed with osteoarthritis.

Doctors told him his only hope was a grueling surgery to replace both knees.

But Gabriel decided to go another route… he tried the Sabin Technique .

And now four years later…

Without expensive surgeries, addictive drugs or wallet-draining rehab of any kind…

Gabriel is back to intense skiing.

In fact, his knees feel so good he’s taken up a second sport, competitive long-distance cycling… routinely biking 200 miles at a stretch.

He even won California’s prestigious Triple Crown cycling award.

Yes…

Gabriel avoided a double knee replacement and became a medal-winning cyclist thanks to the Sabin Technique

And then there’s Jim B from Orlando, Florida.

For Jim, walking just a few steps was agony.

His doctor told him he needed to have surgery to replace the joints in his hips…

But instead, Jim opted for the Sabin Technique.

The simple treatment lasted only an hour and a half and …

After just two months Jim was more active and pain-free than he’d been in years.

But one of the most incredible stories comes from Shannon C. out of New York.

Shannon suffered a debilitating stroke that left her partially paralyzed in one leg.

But then she heard about a trial study for the Sabin Technique being performed at Stanford University …

And that’s when her life changed forever.

She says the improvement was instantaneous .

As she puts it, “My leg is about 95% better. Everything is good and it’s only getting better.”

But here’s what’s so incredible about this story…

She wasn’t the only one!

There were 18 other patients treated with the Sabin Technique who all had results similar to Shannon.

And these weren’t small transformations.

According to chief science officer, Dr. Kristin Comella…

“We literally have patients who have come out of wheelchairs and are walking again.”

Yes, the Sabin Technique is that life-changing...

In fact, because of these results… it’s currently undergoing its first trial study for ALS as we speak.

But its promise is also part of its downfall.

Why?

Because the Sabin Technique has the power to completely replace surgery and prescription pain killers …

Which again means a potential profit loss of tens of billions.

And while the FDA can’t stop valid research…

They have completely turned their back on the growing Sabin Technique industry, likely hoping it will fail.

Right now there is zero regulation…

But luckily, the Institute for Natural Healing has done the work for you.

On page 313 in your free copy of Forbidden Miracles …

We tell you exactly how to find America’s top Sabin Technique experts and also provide you with 7 “must see” tips before you try it.

Yes, the Sabin Technique sounds like the stuff of miracles but it’s very real .

People across the country are quietly using it to reverse conditions science once thought incurable…

All while the government and mainstream medicine stick their heads in the sand.

It’s maddening!

And unfortunately, they’re doing exactly the same thing with the third cure on our INH Top Five list …

A strange Eastern solution to America’s most dreaded disease: Alzheimer’s

If there’s one disease that perfectly captures the complete and total failure of America’s medical system it’s Alzheimer’s.

It’s been over 100 years since the disease was first identified and we’re still no closer to a cure…

In fact, we’re getting further away.

In the last 15 years there hasn’t been a single new drug approved to fight Alzheimer’s.

Not one.

And the drugs that do exist are more like a bad joke.

They do virtually nothing but delay symptoms for a few months at best.

Which is why if you or a loved one are suffering from this horrible disease, what I’m about to show you could change your life forever.

It’s a completely natural treatment for Alzheimer’s that makes America’s prescriptions for the disease seem like a sugar pill.

It’s known as Chinese Acetyl Moss . And while it may not look all that special…

This simple-looking moss is now being used to reverse Alzheimer’s symptoms across China

In fact, it’s currently one of the go-to Alzheimer’s treatments prescribed by Chinese doctors.

And it’s not simply delaying or halting symptoms for a short time…

This natural breakthrough is actually reversing Alzheimer’s symptoms, switching on patients’ memory and giving them back their lives .

Put simply, these patients are waking up from Alzheimer’s .

And the research behind it is undeniable.

The Institute for Natural Healing researched more than 20 years of science on Acetyl Moss…

And we were stunned by what we found.

In 2014, scientists at China Medical University published a review of multiple studies that show it doesn’t just target one aspect of cognitive function…

Acetyl Moss “lights up” nearly every aspect of your brain across the board

When tested against placebo, scientists were amazed to discover its benefits could be seen from one end of the mental spectrum to the other…

Patients taking it showed dramatic improvements in…

Memory

Space and time orientation

Attention

Calculation

Language

Repetition

And following complex commands

And not surprisingly, the researchers also concluded that Acetyl Moss supplements were far superior to some of the most widely prescribed Alzheimer’s drugs on the market…

Including Razadyne, Aricept and Cognex.

Even better, it works without the scary side effects of hallucinations, fever, seizures, depression, and more associated with those drugs.

Another study from the prestigious Chinese Academy of Medical Sciences was even more stunning…

In fact, it’s one of the first studies I’ve seen that actually uses the word “remarkable” .

They tested Acetyl Moss on 100 Alzheimer’s patients and found that…

Acetyl Moss skyrocketed patients’ brain function an unheard of 460%

Yes, 460%!

They were showing significant improvements in everything from memory, to thinking, to mood and behavioral functions.

In short, the lights came back on for these patients!

But it’s one thing to hear about the studies and another to hear from a real live patient online who’s experienced similar results…

Like Marge T.…

Marge’s short term memory was declining rapidly to the point where she believes she was in the first stages of Alzheimer’s…

She had trouble remembering simple names and words and was even starting to avoid people because she couldn’t keep a conversation flowing…

But after just a couple days on an Acetyl Moss supplement she states…

“I had names and words when I needed them. I was totally amazed.”

Acetyl Moss works by increasing levels of a chemical messenger in the brain known as Acetylcholine.

As we age, the levels of Acetylcholine in our brains naturally decline, which can lead to those senior moments we’re all familiar with.

But Alzheimer’s patients have another problem…

An enzyme known as acetylcholinesterase (AChE) that drops Acetylcholine levels even more… sometimes as much as 90%.

That’s when the devastating symptoms of Alzheimer’s take hold.

But Acetyl Moss works by specifically targeting this rogue enzyme so your levels of memory-boosting Acetylcholine can not only normalize but skyrocket .

Which is leading to the unheard of results we’ve gone over.

And it’s also why it’s now a natural Alzheimer’s prescription in China.

But its widespread use there is also leading to a problem…

Acetyl Moss is now being harvested at a lightening pace that’s putting it on the verge of extinction.

Which means it’s becoming increasingly expensive and difficult to obtain…

But inside your very own free copy of the 504 page Forbidden Miracles , the Institute for Natural Healing will fill you in on everything you need to get your very own supply…

Just turn to page 25 and we’ll reveal a natural, self-replenishing source (backed by a Yale scientist) that’s not only our first and only choice for Acetyl Moss…

It’s also dirt cheap at less than $1 a day!

In a second, you’ll discover exactly how you can get this life-saving book right now, free of charge…

But first, let me explain how the fourth cure on our INH top five could be your only hope against America’s #1 killer.

In fact,

This delicious Israeli drink clears clogged arteries 5 times better than any prescription drug

But the study that proves it has been covered up and virtually buried for years…

And the statin industry desperately hopes its contents are never revealed.

But that’s exactly what the Institute for Natural Healing is doing today.

Because while statins can lower your cholesterol…

They’re also linked to more than 300 adverse side effects .

Even worse, they do virtually nothing to deal with the clogged arteries which are responsible for 1 in 4 deaths every year in America .

But while you and your loved ones suffer…

Israeli scientists have finally discovered the answer to reversing atherosclerosis, every cardiologists’ white whale.

Sure, it looks like nothing more than a tasty beverage but this natural drink has the power to save millions .

It was first widely tested on mice where its power to clear blocked arteries was first proven…

But scientists remained skeptical until researchers finally put it to the test in a human trial.

But they didn’t just test it on ordinary patients, they tested it on patients with severe atherosclerosis… meaning their arteries were 70%-90% clogged .

And what they found is nothing short of amazing …

Patients drinking just 1 glass a day washed away 30% of the deadly plaque buildup in their arteries after just one year

It was like pouring Drano down a clogged kitchen drain!

To put that in perspective, one of the most popular statins in America went on a marketing blitz after showing just a 6% reduction in plaque.

Which means the natural Israeli treatment cleared 5 TIMES more plaque than America’s leading statin.

Not to mention, patients in the study who took the placebo actually increased their plaque buildup by 9% over that same period…

So patients drinking this simple beverage had 40% cleaner arteries after just one year than those who didn’t !

Imagine what would happen after 2 years.

Even better, patients also saw a 21% reduction in blood pressure and 90% reduction in LDL oxidation (meaning their cholesterol was less likely to stick to artery walls).

Friend, this simple, tasty drink is your key to not only dissolving lethal artery plaque like magic…

But also ending your fear of a deadly “anytime/anywhere” heart attack for good.

So what’s keeping doctors from prescribing this at the first sign of high cholesterol or plaque buildup?

$19 billion.

That’s the current size of America’s statin industry. It’s more than the economy of a modest sized country.

And just like a sovereign nation, the statin industry will do anything to defend itself from enemies.

Which is why studies on this natural, artery-cleansing drink are relegated to the nether regions of the internet.

But inside your free copy of Forbidden Miracles , you’ll find full details on this life-saving drink…

Including the cheapest, most potent and tastiest source available.

In a minute, I’m going to tell you exactly how to get this 504 page book absolutely free (we’ll even cover the shipping)…

And when you get it, be sure and open to page 209.

That’s where anyone suffering from diabetes will want to turn immediately.

Why?

Because it reveals…

A simple, 8 week solution to reversing diabetes for good

Diabetes has become an epidemic in the US…

And Big Pharma has jacked up the prices so high for treatment that patients are actually resorting to things like buying black market insulin online.

But what if you could completely reverse diabetes and train your body to start producing healthy amounts of insulin again…

Completely on its own?

Well, researchers from New Castle University in London have figured out how to do just that…

Without dangerous drugs, grueling exercise… and without life-altering gastric bypass surgery.

And again… this isn’t just a treatment for Diabetes. This is being looked at as an actual cure.

As one of the doctors behind this revolutionary method puts it...

""This is a radical change in understanding type 2 diabetes... We have shown that we can reverse the condition.""

And it’s absolutely changing the lives of patients who’ve tried it…

Patients like Iris M.

Iris was 59 when doctors diagnosed her with Type 2 diabetes…

For the next three years she was on a steadily increasing supply of medication with insulin injections likely right around the corner…

But then someone mentioned the New Castle method that was starting to gain steam in Europe…

After about 16 weeks her doctor gave her the unbelievable news…

Her blood sugar was now completely normal.

As she puts it,

“When doctors told me that my pancreas was working again, it felt fantastic, absolutely amazing!”

“I don’t think of myself as a diabetic anymore. I am one of the lucky ones to have gone into remission.

I’ve not taken any medication for diabetes in three years … and feeling great!”

And Iris isn’t the only one…

In fact, in one small study using this new method, 100% of the patients were able to completely reverse their diabetes after just 8 weeks …

Yes, a disease that mainstream medicine labels as “incurable” is being cured right now…

And when you turn to page 209 of Forbidden Miracles you’ll find full details on exactly how they’re doing it…

Without prescriptions, surgeries or giving up the foods they love.

Can you imagine a life without pills, insulin shots and counting every single calorie?

It’s a reality for “recovered diabetics” in Europe and now it can be yours when you claim your free copy of Forbidden Miracles .
