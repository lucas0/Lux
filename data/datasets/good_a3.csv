People who have no faith in police responded with mob justice.05.21.17 11:00 AM ETPhoto Illustration by Elizabeth Brockway/The Daily BeastMEXICO CITY—“Kill him! Kill him! Kill him,” chanted a mob of roughly 100 angry Mexicans in Cancun, the popular tourist destination on the coast of Quintana Roo, Mexico. “I’m going to decapitate you,” one man shouted at Aleksei Viktorovich Makeev, as the bloodied 42-year-old Russian resident of Mexico fled the interior of his home for a nearby rooftop while the mob pelted him with large rocks and jeered. When Makeev finally collapsed on the rooftop, covered in his own blood—and that of an unarmed teenager whom he stabbed moments before, after the teen attempted to enter the Russian’s apartment—the townspeople finally let him be, as reporters livestreaming from the scene claimed that Makeev had died.In fact, after being beaten with sticks and stoned nearly to death, the half-naked Russian was transported to a local hospital and treated for his injuries. The townspeople had fractured his skull.Makeev is now reportedly in stable condition, but remains in a drug-induced coma, paralyzed and likely brain-damaged, said Dmitry Bolbot, Mexico City’s Russian consul. But the 19-year-old youth whose last name has not yet been disclosed, “Lalo”—a nickname for Eduardo—bled out on the pavement as paramedics attempted to save his life. He was pronounced dead soon after Makeev stabbed him repeatedly in the stomach with a kitchen knife as he fled the home. The horrific stabbing was also caught on tape.“The Russian has just stabbed this person. He’s losing a lot of blood,” someone said in one of many livestreams of the hours-long encounter, as thousands of social media users watched from their phones and computers, leaving comments like “Cut off [the Russian’s] head! Toss him in a ditch,” and “Finish him off! Get it over with!”The mob descended on his home after local media reports began circulating on Friday about Makeev, who had spent the previous months uploading videos of himself on his personal YouTube channels surrounded by swastikas.In the videos, one can see that he had made a hobby of disparaging the people of Mexico, speaking with particular loathing about indigenous women and infants. He was dubbed #LordNaziRuso on social media—Lord Russian Nazi—and outrage quickly grew.Just past noon on Friday, Makeev posted on Facebook that he was “feeling adventurous,” along with the comment that “Terrorists are trying to kill me!”Hours later, he posted a crude drawing that read “lick my dick Mexican piece of shit” as he laughed at the angry crowd that had begun to phone him and cover his Facebook wall with angry comments.By dusk, as the mob formed outside the tiny one-room apartment in Cancun from which he often posted videos at his untidy desk—next to cans of peas and other food lining the windowsill— a local reporter with a drone began to film the lead-up to the lynching attempt, as Makeev sat at his desk and continued to poke the bear and mock the people online.From that desk—seated next to a family-size bottle of ketchup and more pictures of swastikas and promotional material for his unpopular YouTube channels—the Russian had repeatedly posted videos complaining about both the Mexican people and their police in a mix of Russian and the occasional insult in English or Spanish.Though he made himself completely unwelcome in Mexico, Makeev—who is originally from the small town of Elektrostal, on the outskirts of Moscow—had also previously made a name for himself in Russia where he was apparently put under review by the Ministry of Internal Affairs in 2013, after footage posted online showed him shoving an elderly woman and child. He was reportedly interned in a Russian psychiatric facility for his erratic behavior as a result.“If the government doesn’t want to do anything, if our authorities can’t, we’re going to get together and do this right,” said one man in a livestream Friday night, just before the lynching attempt began, inviting the people of Cancun to come down to the man’s home and get him. “We aren’t going to lynch him, because that sounds bad, but we are going to teach him a lesson.”“Cancun deserves respect,” the man said, adding, “It’s the most beautiful place you could ever imagine.”The bizarre videos Makeev became known for show his fanatical obsession with Madonna and knives, and that he far too often sat at the local McDonald's in Cancun, invasively filming humble Mexican diners— zooming in on the faces of what he called their “bastard” children, and referring to the people as “monkeys” and “pieces of shit.”In one video, filmed from a local rooftop, he stood shirtless next to a swastika and—wearing a clown nose—referred to “McDonald… Trump.” Many of his Facebook posts, in fact, relate to the various controversies involving the U.S. President’s alleged ties to Russia.He had been getting on people’s nerves for a while, but had made at least a few friends locally. Just two weeks ago, he uploaded a video of himself interviewing an American man who called himself Roy, who claimed to have been beaten by the local police, after picking up some cash from a local Western Union. He said the cops “took [his] $200,” stranding him in Mexico without a passport.“When I woke up, I’m on my hands and knees. And when I got up, I seen my teeth, so I picked ‘em up and put ‘em in my pocket, and the muth... uh, they had gone. They left. So, I was left with nothing, and I was left with this,” said a toothless Roy, pointing to a blackened right eye. “So I advise anyone coming here, be careful. The police are very corrupt.”It was a common theme in his videos. When not complaining about Mexicans, he complained about their cops.Last December, he was locked up for a month in an immigration center in Quintana Roo and declared persona non grata after repeatedly threatening the local Maya people . He complained in videos that he had not been given water, and had been treated poorly in detention. In a statement, the National Migration Institute said that Makeev’s “definitive exit from the country was ordered on January 19” of this year.But Makeev, who was previously employed as a scuba instructor at AquaWorld Cancun, remained in the country regardless. When contacted on Saturday, the watersports company was unable to offer any comment, but said in a statement that he stopped working with them in November 2015, after they noticed that “his behavior had begun to turn aggressive.”A statement reportedly from the Russian Embassy did not condone his actions in Mexico, but added that they “categorically reproach the manner in which Mexican citizens did not attempt to denounce [his actions] but instead took matters into their own hands,” asking Mexican authorities to help clarify these “unfortunate events.”But citizens and residents had reported his behavior to immigration authorities in recent months, even after his recent detention. One local radio disc jockey, 55-year-old Fabricio Rechy, provided The Daily Beast with screenshots of a conversation he had with immigration authorities this past February, in which he sends authorities the worrisome videos he had come across, requesting that the Russian be removed for posing a danger to the local people.During his conversation, the immigration employee at first implied that the videos were filmed in Russia, but the radio host pointed out that they were filmed inside the local McDonald’s. He even made it easy for them, providing screenshots of the man’s immigration documents.“They thanked me for the information and said they would investigate,” Rechy said in a telephone interview on Saturday. “But I doubt they gave it any importance.”“I stumbled on the videos, and saw the way he was threatening people, calling them shit, saying he was going to kill Mexicans, cut off their heads, and I thought he was a dangerous person, so I felt the need to report it. It’s my duty as a citizen,” he said. “There are videos that show him giving babies the middle finger, throwing coins at an old woman in a grocery store, hitting another elderly lady inside a bank, and stepping on children’s lunch on the beach.”As for the incident that ended one young man’s life on Friday night, Rechy said, “It never should have happened.”“The police arrived at night, but left saying they couldn’t do anything because the man was locked inside his home,” he said.Later that night, “about half an hour after the lynching started,” when the riotous fighting was well under way, the police finally returned with backup. But by then the situation had become unmanageable.As paramedics transported Makeev’s unconscious bloody body to the hospital late Friday night, smiling families cheered and screamed insults at him—at times chanting, “Mexico! Mexico! Mexico!”The National Immigration Institute said in a statement that it would seek his repatriation back to Russia as soon as his legal situation in Mexico is determined.But, Rechy noted, “None of this would have happened if they had just taken notice when I asked them to.”“That boy would still be alive,” he said. “Unfortunately, this is a national problem in Mexico—the lack of authority, and the authorities’ inaction. I hate to say it, but we are used to corruption here in Mexico.”“There just isn’t any trust,” he said. “People prefer to take justice into their own hands than deal with authorities. That’s how this works.”--------------------The Daily Beast’s Moscow-based correspondent Anna Nemtsova contributed to this report.READ THIS LIST",2017/01/30,snopes,1

According to social media postings by the current UT Austin student body president a student with a concealed handgun license saw the stabbing attack in progress, drew his firearm, and chased down the attacker. If true, there’s little doubt that the quick action on the part of this legally armed student may have stopped the attacker from injuring and possibly killing more people.UPDATE: Later reports from the same source indicate that the earlier report about an armed student are unconfirmed. However there is additional supporting evidence posted by another user on social media claiming to have been the CHL holder in question.Texas recently passed legislation enabling students with a concealed handgun license to carry their handgun in most areas of campus, excluding lab areas and other sensitive locations. A group of students and staff opposed this new legislation by forming the group Gun Free UT , organizing a dildo-filled “cocks not GLOCKs” protest , and proclaiming that carrying concealed handguns on campus will make UT less safe not more safe. There is no comment yet from Gun Free UT about this particular event.Making this story more interesting is the fact that the armed student reportedly stopped the mass stabber without firing a single shot. Concealed carry opponents constantly use the argument that civilians aren’t as well trained as police officers and will cause more harm than good in an emergency situation, but as this case illustrates that’s a complete and total fabrication. Even in the heat of the moment the CHL holder in this case understood that it was more dangerous to fire his gun in the middle of campus than to simply chase the mass stabber away.For those keeping score, organizations such as The Trace will refuse to classify this incident as a defensive gun use since the knife wielding attacker was not killed and no rounds were fired by the CHL holder.",2017/05/01,snopes,1

The new memorial will make good on President Trump's promise to bring about a peaceful resolution to the nearly 20-year contrived conflict.""President Trump is proud to declare victory in the War on Christmas,"" said a White House spokesman, who repeatedly asked that their name not be used. ""No longer will the celebration of Christmas be restricted to private homes, multiple 24/7 radio stations, non-stop television specials, Christmas themed commercials interrupting those television specials, decorations in every major retail outlet, proclamations from elected officials, and a federal holiday. Now that the War on Christmas is over, this cherished religious holiday can finally get the recognition it deserves. The President believes his victory in the War on Christmas will be among the greatest achievements of his presidency.""At the consecration ceremony for the new monument, President Trump is expected to issue an official proclamation establishing that ""Christmas"" will now refer to the entire period of time between Thanksgiving and New Year's Day.The proposed monument is expected to feature several installation pieces, each highlighting a different aspect of the War on Christmas. So far, the proposed monument includes:A memorial to everyone who was wished ""Happy Holidays"" by a department store cashier;An exhibition of anti-Christian Starbucks cups;A statue commemorating the ""Faceless Fox News Staffer,"" which will honor the unsung Fox News staff and interns who were forced to scour the internet for any story that could be plausibly spun to look like an attack on Christmas; andA life-size Nativity Scene.Following the announcement, the White House has been forced to respond to a litany of criticisms, including accusations that the monument constitutes religious favoritism and is ""wildly unnecessary.""""If you analyze this decision in the context of how the President and his cabinet view ‘religious freedom,' it makes a lot more sense,"" said the anonymous White House staffer before letting out a loud and heavy sigh. ""Like many of the President's policy decisions, this announcement comes following a meeting with the nation's leading religious right groups. The President shares their conviction that this monument will help reassert the principle of religious freedom, which is the inalienable right of every American to believe in conservative evangelical Christianity.""""This monument is as unnecessary as it is unsurprising,"" said Larry T. Decker, Executive Director of the Secular Coalition for America. ""This is a monument to religious privilege and a message that Christian supremacists should feel emboldened. What's next? Are we going to display the Ten Commandments in public schools? Or entomb a leader of the religious right in our nation's capital? Or mandate that a specific set of religious beliefs be treated like a get-out-of-jail-free card ?

Brown Jr. today ended the drought state of emergency in most of California, while maintaining water reporting requirements and prohibitions on wasteful practices, such as watering during or right after rainfall.“This drought emergency is over, but the next drought could be around the corner,” said Governor Brown. “Conservation must remain a way of life.” Executive Order B-40-17 lifts the drought emergency in all California counties except Fresno, Kings, Tulare and Tuolumne, where emergency drinking water projects will continue to help address diminished groundwater supplies. Today’s order also rescinds two emergency proclamations from January and April 2014 and four drought-related executive orders issued in 2014 and 2015. Executive Order B-40-17 builds on actions taken in Executive Order B-37-16 , which remains in effect, to continue making water conservation a way of life in California:The State Water Resources Control Board will maintain urban water use reporting requirements and prohibitions on wasteful practices such as watering during or after rainfall, hosing off sidewalks and irrigating ornamental turf on public street medians. The state will continue its work to coordinate a statewide response on the unprecedented bark beetle outbreak in drought-stressed forests that has killed millions of trees across California. In a related action, state agencies today issued a plan to continue to make conservation a way of life in California , as directed by Governor Brown in May 2016. The framework requires new legislation to establish long-term water conservation measures and improved planning for more frequent and severe droughts.Although the severely dry conditions that afflicted much of the state starting in the winter of 2011-12 are gone , damage from the drought will linger for years in many areas. The drought reduced farm production in some regions, killed an estimated 100 million trees, harmed wildlife and disrupted drinking water supplies for many rural communities. The consequences of millions of dead trees and the diminished groundwater basins will continue to challenge areas of the state for years.California’s Drought ResponseThe drought that spanned water years 2012 through 2016 included the driest four-year statewide precipitation on record (2012-2015) and the smallest Sierra-Cascades snowpack on record (2015, with 5 percent of average). It was marked by extraordinary heat: 2014, 2015 and 2016 were California’s first, second and third warmest year in terms of statewide average temperatures.The state responded to the emergency with actions and investments that also advanced the California Water Action Plan , the Administration’s five-year blueprint for more reliable, resilient water systems to prepare for climate change and population growth. To advance the priorities of the Water Action Plan and respond to drought, the voters passed a comprehensive water bond , the Legislature appropriated and accelerated funding and state agencies accelerated grants and loans to water projects.California also enacted the historic Sustainable Groundwater Management Act , took action to improve measurement and management of water, retrofitted tens of thousands of inefficient toilets, replaced lawns with water-wise landscaping and provided safe drinking water to impacted communities. Californians also responded to the drought with tremendous levels of water conservation, including a nearly 25 percent average reduction in urban water use across the state. ###",2017/04/18,snopes,1

https://www.snopes.com/fact-check/alien-mummy-baffles-scientists/,"an ""alien mummy"" was recently unearthed in a pyramid, and scientists cannot explain its origins.",False,['worldwide science stories'],https://outlook.wustl.edu/,https://outlook.wustl.edu/2007/summer/mummy.htm,2016/03/21,"Download the Baby Mummy graphic.For more than two decades, the baby mummy remained in a storage facility at the Saint Louis Science Center.One day last spring, Washington University scientist Charles F. Hildebolt got an intriguing phone call. A mummy had turned up in the storage facility of the Saint Louis Science Center (SLSC), but no one knew much about it. Could he and his colleagues do some detective work to learn more?""When you hear the word 'mummy,' you think big box or large tomb,"" says Hildebolt, DDS, PhD, a dentist and anthropologist in the Department of Radiology. ""It was a surprise when we got over there and found that this was a small child, partly unwrapped and in a little pine box. We said, 'Wow! This is really interesting.' But we didn't know exactly what we'd be able to find out.""Charles F. Hildebolt, DDS, PhD, enlisted the help of Li Cao, MD, center, and Anne M. Bowcock, PhD, to retrieve and analyze the baby mummy's DNA.Hildebolt and other volunteer investigators from the School of Medicine, helped by experts from around the world, began a yearlong quest to uncover the mummy's past. Assisted by the latest technology — sophisticated CT scanning, DNA analysis and radiocarbon dating — they pieced together a likely story of love and loss, of ancient Egypt and European conquerors, of theft and recovery, that has attracted international attention.At the same time, they made a bit of scientific history. Although the record of child mummies in existence is still incomplete, they are ""exceedingly rare,"" says Hildebolt. The extensive research they have done to understand this one may well rank, he says, ""as the most extensive work ever done on a child mummy.""What information they had when they began came from SLSC records. Around the turn of the last century, a dentist from Hermann MO was traveling in the Middle East when he acquired the mummy as a keepsake. Back home, a niece eventually inherited it, and she brought it out for display on Halloween. Her family donated it to the SLSC in 1985.For two decades, the small mummy remained in the SLSC storage facility until new vice president Al Wiman noticed it in 2006. ""The first thing I asked was 'What do you know about it?' Well, they knew it was a boy,"" he says today. ""'Do you know anything else?' No, they didn't.""Once Washington University agreed to help, Mallinckrodt Institute of Radiology was the first stop. Hildebolt, a veteran of other forensic detection efforts, recruited Kirk Smith, a senior research engineer with CT expertise. Smith did the full-body scanning, and Hildebolt and pediatric radiologist Steven Don, MD, studied the results in hopes of determining the child's age and cause of death.""It was just what a doctor would do with a living patient except that we could scan at a very high resolution, with an X-ray dose you would not use on a live person,"" says Smith. ""We also have state-of-the-art CT scanners, among the best in the world.""They captured some 1,000 CT slices, which Smith integrated for an overall look and segmented for close-ups. From the teeth and cranial sutures, Hildebolt and Don established the child's age: 7 to 8 months. They hypothesized that, in the tradition of Egyptian mummification, his organs had been removed through a hole in his left side and his brain through his left nostril. Within the mummy, they could see amulets at a tantalizing distance, but couldn't make out any inscriptions that might pinpoint the child's identity.Canopic jars (reproductions pictured here) were used to hold the dried internal organs of Egyptian mummies.So far, everything indicated an Egyptian place of origin, but how to prove it? Other cultures also mummified the dead. With the help of paleoneuroanatomist Dean Falk, PhD, from Florida State University, who confirmed the brain removal, they contacted Salima Ikram, PhD, an Egyptologist at the American University in Cairo. Snipping a postage-stamp-sized piece of the wrapping material, they sent it to Ikram, who passed it on to Emilia Cortés, a textile conservator at the Metropolitan Museum of Art. She determined it was Egyptian wrapping material from the Roman period in Egypt, around 2,000 years ago.Ikram unraveled other pieces of the mystery. True to Roman-period mummification custom, this mummy had a wooden rod placed at its back for support. The dark brown color of the body and the linen wrapping — turned gentle shades of beige in the CT scans — was the product of resins and oils used in the 70-day mummification process. As to the mummy's origin, Ikram says, it ""definitely"" came from a grave that was plundered by robbers, ""but several sites are possible, so I shall not speculate.""Sadly, its very existence may point to sorrow that resonates through the centuries. The parents of this child were wealthy, since they could afford to mummify their child, and they were likely heartbroken at their loss.""This was certainly a loved child,"" says Hildebolt, ""for the family to go to the cost, trouble and time to have him mummified.""But the investigation also left some questions unanswered. Since the bones showed no injury, the team still does not know the cause of death. At first the skull seemed a bit enlarged, possibly due to hydrocephaly, but Don's measurements proved it was within the normal range. And who were the parents? Would further testing corroborate the mummy's time period?With funding from the SLSC, university researchers sent another swatch of wrapping to a laboratory for radiocarbon dating; with 95 percent certainty, the results showed a close match. This baby lived sometime between 40 BC and 130 AD, at the end of the Macedonian-Egyptian period of control and the beginning of Roman rule under Caesar Augustus.""So this child could easily have been alive at the same time as Cleopatra, Marc Antony, Julius Caesar and Octavian,"" says Hildebolt.To trace the baby's roots, they contacted Washington University geneticist Anne M. Bowcock, PhD, who enlisted researcher Li Cao, MD, to help retrieve and analyze DNA. This process was fraught with problems. For one thing, they needed to find uncontaminated DNA, deep inside the body. For another, the mummy was rock hard, yet they didn't want to damage it. Using instruments designed for spinal punctures, they bored into its bone through existing holes in the skin, extracting samples from several sites.Targeting the mitochondrial DNA, they amplified and sequenced their samples, checking the results with Douglas C. Wallace, PhD, of the University of California-Irvine, a mitochondrial expert. Next came a major surprise: This kind of DNA, provided by the maternal side, showed that this child's mother came of European lineage — perhaps a Roman or Greek living in Egypt. So far, the researchers have not been able to amplify the child's nuclear DNA, which would show the father's lineage.More questions linger, but the ""Child Mummy,"" as the SLSC calls it, has generated an excited response from visitors, who have flocked to the new permanent exhibit.The respectful treatment given this long-ago child also pleases Ikram. ""I am delighted with the results,"" she says, ""and feel that the ancient Egyptians would have been, too.""",2015/09/17,snopes,1

The tears soaking Cristy's face were not the first she'd cried since her baby boy's complicated delivery on December 11th. She had been induced four days prior to his birth and struggled through 53 hours of labor. By the time he began to crown, not even Cristy's determination could overcome her exhaustion. The doctor told her to stop pushing.We don't know why the doctor didn't elect to perform a c-section earlier on. We don't know if her decision to use suction during the final moments of Dakota's birth was a wise one. What we know is that immediately after delivery, he began suffering one seizure after another.The small-town North Dakota hospital wasn't equipped to care for the newborn, so they life-flighted him to a hospital in the state's capital of Bismarck. His worried dad and even his exhausted mom left the hospital immediately and drove to Bismarck to be with their baby boy.A neurologist discovered Dakota's skull was fractured and bleeding in the brain was soon detected. The doctors have since learned that the bleeding is coming from a place deeper in the brain than initially thought.The good news amidst all of this heartache is that Dakota is showing himself to be a fighter! Today, instead of receiving sustenance through a feeding tube as he has been since birth, Dakota nursed (and nursed and nursed...!). This was the first time his mom was able to hold him.The road ahead to health is long. It would help so much if his parents could stay together in Bismarck until Dakota can come home with them. That means time off work, the added expense of staying in a town far from home and family support--not to mention the cost of medical care and the life flight, which goes far above and beyond what their medical insurance provides.Any financial help you can give this sweet, young family would be a tremendous blessing.

The report suggested that Cambridge Analytica had essentially issued questionnaires through a third party; those questionnaires, which were personality quizzes, requested that you use your Facebook login. Cambridge Analytica then compiled data regarding those who completed the quiz and cross-referenced that data with political preferences in order to target potential voters.This isn’t particularly shocking. In 2012, The Guardian reported that President Obama’s reelection team was “building a vast digital data operation that for the first time combines a unified database on millions of Americans with the power of Facebook to target individual voters to a degree never achieved before.” ADVERTISEMENTWhat, exactly, would Obama be doing? According to The Guardian, Obama’s new database would be gathered by asking individual volunteers to log into Obama’s reelection site using their Facebook credentials. “Consciously or otherwise,” The Guardian states, “the individual volunteer will be injecting all the information they store publicly on their Facebook page — home location, date of birth, interests and, crucially, network of friends — directly into the central Obama database.” Facebook had no problem with such activity then. They do now. There’s a reason for that. The former Obama director of integration and media analytics stated that, during the 2012 campaign, Facebook allowed the Obama team to “suck out the whole social graph”; Facebook “was surprised we were able to suck out the whole social graph, but they didn’t stop us once they realized that was what we were doing.” She added , “They came to [the] office in the days following election recruiting & were very candid that they allowed us to do things they wouldn’t have allowed someone else to do because they were on our side.”Not so with Trump. As soon as Facebook realized that Cambridge Analytica had pursued a similar strategy, they suspended the firm.Again, this isn’t surprising. Since Trump’s election, Democrats — in search of a rationale for their favored candidate’s defeat — have blamed a bevy of social media outlets. Senate Democrats trotted out pathetic Russian-created memes on Facebook, viewed by a handful of human beings, as an excuse for Hillary’s loss; Democrats claimed — without evidence — that “fake news” had swamped Facebook and thus led to Trump’s victory. Democrats have also insisted that Facebook be regulated. Sen.

And in February, Zuckerberg said he wanted to re-jigger the algorithms on his platform to benefit content that Facebook deems “trustworthy, informative, and local.” Wired celebrated: “You can’t make the world more open and connected if you’re breaking it apart.”The result of Facebook’s algorithmic changes: conservatives have been slammed. And that’s the point. A study from The Western Journal found that conservative sites have lost an average of 14 percent of their Facebook traffic; leftist sites saw a minor increase. Even major publications saw that effect: The New York Daily News saw a bump of 24.18 percent, while the New York Post dropped 11.44 percent.And that’s the goal in covering Cambridge Analytica, and Russian interference on Twitter, and all the rest — even without any serious information suggesting that such interference shifted votes, the left can rest assured that its Silicon Valley allies will act to de-platform Republicans and conservatives. There’s a reason Twitter has suspended alt-right racists but continued to recommend that others follow Louis Farrakhan; there’s a reason YouTube is being sued by Prager University; there’s a reason Google used automatic fact-checking on right-wing sites but did no such thing for left-wing sites.We’re in the midst of a radical reshifting in social media. Ironically, the people who have stumped against regulation — conservatives — are those being targeted by social media companies. If companies like Facebook, YouTube, Google and Twitter don’t start acting like platforms again rather than like motivated left-wing outlets, Republicans likely won’t let principle outweigh practicality for long.Ben Shapiro ( @BenShapiro ), a lawyer and conservative commentator, is founder and editor in chief of The Daily Wire .

Women can now vote in municipal elections, work in some retail and hospitality jobs and were allowed to compete in the Olympics for the first time in 2012.However Saudi Arabia was still ranked 141 of 144 countries in the 2016 Global Gender Gap, a World Economic Forum study on how women fare in economic and political participation, health and education.The system of make guardianship, which requires women to obtain permission from a guardian - father, husband, or son - to travel, study or marry is an impediment to realizing women’s rights, say rights groups.“Male guardianship is un-Islamic and humiliating for women,” said Akeel. “Some (men) take advantage of this male guardianship for their own benefit and abuse it.”Reporting by Heba Kanso @hebakanso, Editing by Belinda Goldsmith and Ros Russell; Please credit Thomson Reuters Foundation, the charitable arm of Thomson Reuters, that covers humanitarian news, women’s rights, trafficking, property rights, and climate change.

While we expect battery capacity to decrease as batteries age, we expect processor performance to stay the same. However, users with older iPhones with lower-than-expected Geekbench 4 scores have reported that replacing the battery increases their score (as well as the performance of the phone). What’s going on here? How many phones are experiencing decreased Geekbench 4 score?To answer these questions I’ve plotted the kernel density of Geekbench 4 single-core scores for the iPhone 6s and the iPhone 7 running different versions of iOS. Scores obtained in low-power mode are not included in the distribution.iPhone 6sHere are the charts for the iPhone 6s:The distribution of iPhone 6s scores for iOS 10.2.0 appears unimodal with a peak around the average score. However, the distribution of iPhone 6s scores for iOS 10.2.1 appears multimodal, with one large peak around the average and several smaller peaks around lower scores. Under iOS 11.2.0 the effect is even more pronounced.iPhone 7Here are the charts for the iPhone 7:The distribution of iPhone 7 scores under iOS 10.2.0, iOS 10.2.1, and iOS 11.1.2 appears identical. However, the distribution changes with iOS 11.2.0 and starts to look like the iPhone 6s distribution from 10.2.1.Performance and Battery AgeSo what’s going on here?First, it appears the problem is widespread, and will only get worse as phones (and their batteries) continue to age. See, for example, the difference between the distribution of iPhone 6s scores between 10.2.1 and 11.2.0.Second, the problem is due, in part, to a change in iOS. The difference between 10.2.0 and 10.2.1 is too abrupt to be just a function of battery condition. I believe (as do others) that Apple introduced a change to limit performance when battery condition decreases past a certain point. Why did Apple do this? kadupse on Reddit offers the following explanation:Many iPhone 6s devices were shutting down unexpectedly, even after the battery replacement program (Which many people weren’t entitled to use). Because degraded batteries last much less and end up with a lower voltage Apple’s solution was to scale down CPU performance, it doesn’t solve anything and is a bad experience… but it’s better than having your device shutdown at 40% when you need it the most.Apple acknowledged the sudden shutdown issue that affected the iPhone 6 and iPhone 6s earlier this year. However, does the same issue affect the iPhone 7? Apple appears to have added a similar change to iOS 11.2.0 for the iPhone 7.If the performance drop is due to the “sudden shutdown” fix, users will experience reduced performance without notification. Users expect either full performance, or reduced performance with a notification that their phone is in low-power mode. This fix creates a third, unexpected state. While this state is created to mask a deficiency in battery power, users may believe that the slow down is due to CPU performance, instead of battery performance, which is triggering an Apple introduced CPU slow-down. This fix will also cause users to think, “my phone is slow so I should replace it” not, “my phone is slow so I should replace its battery”. This will likely feed into the “planned obsolescence” narrative.John Poole is the Founder of Primate Labs and lives in Toronto, Ontario.Products",2017/12/18,snopes,1

Trump's highly anticipated foreign policy speech Wednesday will test whether the Republican presidential front-runner, known for his raucous rallies and eyebrow-raising statements, can present a more presidential persona as he works to unite the GOP establishment behind him. (AP Photo/Evan Vucci)The Donald Trump campaign continued railing against the judge who is presiding over the fraud case against the mogul’s university, linking his past membership in a Latino lawyers’ group as a reason to doubt his objectivity.Trump spokeswoman Katrina Pierson on Monday said that Judge Gonzalo Curiel had been member of a group that has been overtly against her candidate.""I think what's really interesting about this particular judge — as Mr. Trump refers to him as a 'Trump hater' — is he even mentions on his judicial questionnaire that he was a La Raza Lawyers Association member,"" Pierson said in an interview on CNN.Trump has been trying to get Curiel off the fraud case against Trump University since 2014.At a campaign rally on Friday in San Diego, Trump denounced Curiel’s handling of the case, which involves two class action suits that accuse Trump University of deceptive practices against customers who were promised insight into the mogul’s strategies for succeeding in real estate.The lawsuit overseen by Curiel states that Trump University's nationwide seminars and classes were like infomercials and pressured students to buy more but didn't deliver as promised in spite of students paying as much as $35,000 for seminars.The Washington Post reported that Curiel's order to release an estimated 1,000 pages of Trump University-related documents cites heightened public interest in Trump and that he had ""placed the integrity of these court proceedings at issue."" The judge appeared to reject the argument by Trump attorneys that the information had commercial value, saying that there was no support for the assertion that Trump University may resume operations.Trump assailed the judge’s scheduling for a trial to begin in November. The candidate already was displeased with Curiel's decision last year to accept the court complaints against Trump University as class-action suits.""The trial is going to take place sometime in November,” Trump said at the rally. “There should be no trial. This should have been dismissed on summary judgment easily, everybody says it. But I have a judge who is a hater of Donald Trump, a hater. He's a hater.”""The judge, who happens to be, we believe, Mexican, which is great. I think that's fine.""It was the second time this year Trump tried to link the judge's ethnicity to his ability to be impartial in the case. In February, Trump said in an interview on ""Meet the Press"" that Curiel's Hispanic heritage was a reason the judge was not ruling in his favor in the case.The judge was born and raised in Indiana. His parents came from Mexico, according to various published reports.Pierson defended Trump’s comments, which many later criticized as unfair and bigoted, saying the judge’s ethnicity was irrelevant and should not have been singled out. She also questioned the judge’s involvement with the National Council of La Raza, a national civil rights group.""This is an organization that has been out there organizing anti-Trump protesters with the Mexican flags,” Pierson said, “they are pushing it. The signs have been very apparent. And so Mr. Trump is just stating the obvious.""Trump has attacked Mexico as a country that dumps drug dealers and other criminals along the U.S.-Mexico border. A cornerstone of his campaign has been that he will crack down on illegal immigration. He has vowed to build a huge wall that he says he will force Mexico to fund, and also has vowed to have a mass deportation to expel the estimated 11 million undocumented immigrants living in the United States.The CNN interviewer told Pierson that the judge is American-born.Pierson said she was not sure of his ethnic origin, but argued that it was relevant.""Well, it's because of what we see outside of these rallies, these anti-Trump rallies, these criminal rallies, these criminal protesters out there defacing property and attacking police officers,"" Pierson said. ""They're doing so under the guise of an anti-Trump protest, with their Mexican flags, and La Raza and this judge is connected to that.""Curiel is not permitted to address Trump’s attacks.He has said only that during the civil case against Trump University, the mogul has become a leading presidential candidate who “placed the integrity of these court proceedings at issue.”Earlier in his career, Curiel prosecuted drug smugglers and cartel leaders, a mission that made him a target of assassination attempts and required him to live under tight security.In 1997, for example, a gunman for a Tijuana drug cartel spoke in a bugged conversation of being willing and able to arranged Curiel’s murder, according a Los Angeles Times story from that year.A 2002 New York Times story credited Curiel with being one of the key figures in one of the U.S.’s most important victories in the fight against drug smuggling across the border.As a chief drug prosecutor in the late 1990’s, Curiel and other law enforcement officials in California of Mexican descent were able to use their Spanish-language skills and knowledge of the culture to win the trust of their police counterparts in Mexico and identify the corrupt officials who were sabotaging U.S.-Mexico efforts to crack down on the drug cartels.“According to participants on both sides, the Mexicans looked across the table at Mr. Chavez, Mr. Vega and Mr. Curiel, all born of Mexican parents, and the spark of recognition lit a fire,” the Times story said.''It couldn't but help,'' Mr. Curiel said to the Times in 2002.

One of those was a man named Alex Oronov, who runs a major agribusiness concern in Ukraine. Oronov was a partner in the ethanol business Cohen and Cohen’s brother Bryan set up in Ukraine about a decade ago. Oronov is Bryan Cohen’s father-in-law. Today we learned that Oronov apparently organized that ‘peace plan’ meeting that brought together Ukrainian MP Artemenko, Cohen and Felix Sater . About four hours ago Andrii Artemenko, the Ukrainian parliamentarian who came to New York with that ‘peace plan’, went on Facebook to announce that Alex Oronov has died.(I was first alerted to Artemenko’s post by Natasha Betrand of Business Insider who has been all over this story.)The rest of the post is a sort of pained rant, blaming Oronov’s death on the reporting of The New York Times. The Times you’ll remember published the story on Feb. 19 describing the meeting between Artemenko, Michael Cohen and Felix Sater. Artemenko describes himself as a pawn caught up in a war between the Times and Donald Trump and said the stress created by the article and the subsequent press attention was too much for Oronov to bear.A notable detail is that Artemenko says that it was Oronov who arranged the meeting described in that initial story by the Times. Here is a loose translation courtesy of a friend who is a Russian speaker: “Yes, I’m guilty …. Alex Oronov, my partner, my friend, my mentor, Alex was a family member of Michael Cohen. And he organized all kinds of stuff, including an introduction and a meeting for me with Michael Cohen.”The remembrance website legacy.com has a listing for an Alex Oronov who died on March 2. The date of birth, June 9, 1948, matches the date of birth listed on Oronov’s Florida voter registration records . The condolence page also has one well-wisher describing selling farm equipment to Oronov for transshipment to Ukraine. So there’s little doubt that this is the Alex Oronov associated with Michael Cohen. A person who answered the phone Saturday night at an address associated with Oronov’s daughter told TPM the family had no comment.More Edblog",2017/03/05,snopes,1

Joe Kennedy III is Democrats’ pick to respond to President Trump’s State of the Union speech. That could be a problem, given his big pharma ties.Rep. Kennedy (D-Massachusetts) might be pharma’s favorite Democrat in the U.S. House of Representatives, given that he’s received more than $57,000 from the pharmaceutical/health products industry in this current election cycle alone. According to the Center for Responsive Politics, that’s approximately four times more than pharma’s average contribution to House Democrats. Over the course of his short Congressional career, Kennedy has received more than $348,000 since 2011 .However, Kennedy’s ties to pharma go well beyond campaign contributions. As the Boston Globe reported last year, Rep. Kennedy has more than $434,000 invested in Gilead Sciences, Inc. Gilead is the manufacturer of life-saving hepatitis C drug Sovaldi — which Gilead recently increased to $1,000 per pill , or $84,000 for a treatment. Rep. Kennedy’s financial disclosure forms show that he made between $15,000 and $50,000 off of selling Gilead stock in 2014. Kennedy bought Gilead’s stock at a time when hepatitis C was spreading rapidly throughout Massachusetts. He also holds the most Gilead stock out of all 23 members of Congress financially invested in the company.The multiple financial ties Kennedy has to pharma may help provide context to his hesitation to embrace single-payer healthcare and legalized marijuana. In a September 2016 interview with Boston Magazine — just two months before Massachusetts voters would approve a ballot question legalizing the sale of marijuana for recreational purposes — Rep. Kennedy came out against legalized marijuana using the tired “think about the children” trope.“If we’re going to say marijuana is a medicine, it needs to be treated like a medicine and regulated like a medicine,” said Rep. Kennedy. “But when we look at full-on legalization, the potential danger that marijuana poses particularly to adolescents—I’m not convinced.”And during an interview with Boston Public Radio last September, Rep. Kennedy would only rhetorically support the House version of the single-payer healthcare bill authored by former Rep. John Conyers (R-Michigan) co-sponsored by more than 100 members of his own party, but chalked up his hesitation to the finer details of the plan.“I think [the bill’s cosponsors] are 100 percent right on the value that they are trying to enshrine in the federal law, that health care is a right in this country, not a privilege to be enjoyed by few,” Kennedy told WGBH. “There are some details, however, in that Conyers bill that I do have some struggles with, and [I’m] trying to work through a bit. If we can get there, then great, but regardless, healthcare is critically important to me, and I believe fundamentally in that principle, and we’ll keep pushing forward.”Kennedy is the grandson of former Attorney General and U.S. Senator Robert F. Kennedy, and grand-nephew of former President John F. Kennedy. President Trump will give his State of the Union address on Tuesday, January 30. Rep. Kennedy’s response will come shortly afterward.

That is probably some random blog someone wrote for amusement and get a bunch of gullible people to argue over.2. It could be photo shopped.3. Just because you have both genitalia doesn't mean you have both reproductive organs.4. Probably 100% of the people claiming to be ""hermaphrodites"" are probably making it up to back up their argument. 5. I doubt lady gaga's managers actually found a hermaphrodite that looks reasonably like her to learn her moves, and pose as her at live concerts. 6. It's illegal for strippers to show their genitalia due to indecent exposure.7. Baby pictures don't prove anything, there isn't any proof that it is actually her, it could be anyone.8. Getting plastic surgery on extra body parts to be removed is pretty easy, and affordable on her wage.9. Has anyone thought that this is probably just a publicity stunt? 10. Most of these comments are hypocritical and prejudice. You are ranting about people that are ""against"" lady gaga simply because you are convinced she is a hermaphrodite and that makes her special and need to be defended and protected. You rant on people for insulting her, you may aswell double post that to reply to yourself.11. I don't even understand why so many people feel obliged to defend her, what satisfaction will you gain from it what so ever? does it make you feel better about yourself or something? if you really want to support her go buy one of her albums or something.12.

""people should be able to do and live how they want, as long as it doesn't hurt or affect anyone else, without the criticism.""firstly, what makes you think she doesn't just LOVE the attention she gets from all this? And secondly, you're saying you want to live in a world without a government? Every man for himself? What a ridiculous comment.14. ""its whats on the inside that counts""No, it's not what's on the inside that counts, that's not how people become famous.. In a literal sense, you can sell various organs for some worth; so it is partly true.15. ""...who cares what she is...""obviously, all these people commenting care..16. ""fuck anyone who thinks they're sick peopleim nnot a hermaphrodite but i know that you people are just complete ignorant pigs."" That's probably the most ignorant comment I've seen yet..17.

You obviously have no respect for anyone, go and get a life!""You're worse then him, he's judging a celebrity, which the media does every day and no one seems to care.. but you're judging him from a simple comment? He should get a life? what about you, you have nothing better to do then to insult people on the internet?19. ""ONE IS BORN A HERMAPHRODITE- ITS A BIOLOGICAL PHYSICAL FEATURE. THERE IS NOTHING WRONG WITH THAT.""umm, yes there is something wrong with that.. only certain species are ""natural"" and successful hermaphrodites.

PRESIDENT DONALD TRUMP: Hello, everybody. Great to be back in New York with all of our friends and some great friends outside the building, I must tell you. I want to thank all of our distinguished guests who are with us today, including the members of our cabinet: Treasury secretary Stephen Mnuchin and OMB Director Mick Mulvaney and the Transportation Secretary who is doing a fabulous job, Elaine Chao. Thank you all for doing a really incredible and creative job on what we're going to be discussing today, which is infrastructure. We've just had a great set of briefings upstairs on our infrastructure agenda. My administration is working every day to deliver the world class infrastructure that our people deserve and frankly our country deserves. That’s why I just signed a new Executive Order to dramatically reform the nation's badly broken infrastructure permitting process. Just blocks away is the Empire State Building. It took 11 months to build the Empire State Building. But today it can take as long as a decade and much more than that. Many, many stories where it takes 20 and 25 years just to get approvals to start construction of a fairly routine highway. Highway builders must get up to 16 different approvals involving nine different federal agencies governed by 29 different statutes. One agency alone can stall a project for many, many years and even decades. Not only does this cost our economy billions of dollars, but it also denies our citizens the safe and modern infrastructure they deserve. This overregulated permitting process is a massive, self-inflicted wound on our country. It’s disgraceful. Denying our people much needed investments in their community, and I just want to show you this, because it was just shown to me. I think I'm going to show it to the media – both real and fake media by the way. This is what it takes to get something approved today. Elaine, you see that? So this is what it takes, permitting process flow chart. That's a flow chart. So that can go out to about 20 years, this shows about ten. But that can go out to about 20 years to get something approved. This is for a highway. I have seen a highway recently in a certain state – I won’t mention it’s name, it is 17 years. I could have built it for $4 million, $5 million without the permitting process. It costs hundreds of millions of dollars, but it took 17 years to get it approved and many, many, many, many pages of environmental impact studies. This is what we will bring it down to. This is less than two years. This is going to happen quickly, that's what I'm signing today. This will be less than two years for a highway, so it's going to be quick, it's going to be a very streamlined process, and by the way, if it doesn't meet environmental safeguards, we are not going to approve it – very simple. We’re not going to approve it. So this is – maybe this one will say, let's throw the other one away. Would anybody like it from the media? Would anybody like that long, beautiful chart, you can have it. The most reliable politics newsletter. Sign up for POLITICO Playbook and get the latest news, every morning — in your inbox. By signing up you agree to receive email newsletters or alerts from POLITICO. You can unsubscribe at any time. So my Executive Order also requires agencies to work together efficiently by requiring one lead agency for each major infrastructure project. It also holds agencies accountable if they fail to streamline their review process, so each agency is accountable. We're going to get infrastructure built quickly, inexpensively, relatively speaking and the permitting process will go very, very quickly. No longer will we tolerate one job killing delay after another. No longer will we accept a broken system that benefits consultants and lobbyists at the expense of hard working Americans. Now, I knew the process very well – probably better than anybody. I had to get permits for this building and many of the buildings I built. All of the buildings I built in Manhattan and many other places, and I will tell you that the consultants are rich people. They go around making it very difficult. They lobby congress, they lobby state government, city governments to make it very difficult so that you have to hire consultants and that you have to take years and pay them a fortune, so we’re streamlining the process, and we won't be having so much of that anymore. No longer will we allow the infrastructure of our magnificent country to crumble and decay, while protecting the environment we will build gleaming new roads, bridges, railways, waterways, tunnels and highways. We will rebuild our country with American workers, American iron, American aluminum, American steel. We will create millions of new jobs and make millions of American dreams come true. Our infrastructure will again be the best in the world. We used to have the greatest infrastructure anywhere in the world, and today, we are like a third-world country. We are literally like a third-world country. Our infrastructure will again be the best, and we will restore the pride in our communities, our nation. And all over the United States, we will be proud again, so I want to thank everybody for being here. God bless you, God bless the United States. If you have any questions, Mick, you could come up here, please. Come on up. Mick Mulvaney. If you have any questions, please feel free to ask. REPORTER: Why are the CEOs leaving your manufacturing council? TRUMP: Because they are not taking their job seriously as it pertains to this country. We want jobs, manufacturing in this country. If you look at some of those people that you are talking about, they are outside of the country. They are having a lot of their product made outside. If you look at Merck as an example, take a look where – excuse me, excuse me – take a look at where their product is made. It is made outside of our country. We want products made in the country, now I have to tell you, some of the folks that will leave, they’re leaving out of embarrassment, because they made their products outside, and I have been lecturing them, including the gentleman that you are referring to, about you have to bring it back to this country. You can't do it necessarily in Ireland and all of these other places. You have to bring this work back to this country. That's what I want. I want manufacturing to be back into the United States so that American workers can benefit. REPORTER: Why did you wait so long to denounce neo-Nazis? TRUMP: I didn't wait long. I didn’t wait long. I didn’t wait long. I wanted to make sure, unlike most politicians, that what I said was correct, not make a quick statement. The statement I made on Saturday, the first statement, was a fine statement, but you don't make statements that direct unless you know the fact. And it takes a little while to get the facts. You still don't know the facts. And it is a very, very important process to me. It is a very important statement. So I don't want to go quickly and just make a statement for the sake of making a political statement. I want to know the facts. If you go back to my statement, in fact I brought it. I brought it. As I said on remember this, Saturday, we condemn in the strongest possible terms this egregious display of hatred, bigotry and violence. It has no place in America. And then I went on from there. Now here is the thing. Excuse me, excuse me. Take it nice and easy. Here is the thing, when I make a statement, I like to be correct. I want the facts. This event just happened. A lot of the event didn't happen yet as we were speaking. This event just happened. Before I make a statement, I need the facts, so I don't want to rush into a statement. So making the statement when I made it was excellent. In fact, the young woman who I hear is a fantastic young woman and it was on NBC, her mother wrote me and said through I guess Twitter, social media, the nicest things, and I very much appreciated that. I hear she was a fine, really actually an incredible young woman, but her mother on Twitter, thanked me for what I said. Honestly, if the press were not fake and if it was honest, the press would have said what I said was very nice. – excuse me – unlike you and unlike the media, before I make a statement, I like to know the facts. TRUMP: They didn’t, they didn’t. They don’t. TRUMP: How about, how about, how about a couple of infrastructure questions. REPORTER: The CEO of Walmart said you missed a critical opportunity to help bring the country together. Did you? TRUMP: Not at all. I think the country -- look, you take a look. I've created over a million jobs since I have been president. The country is booming, the stock market is setting record, we have the highest employment numbers we’ve ever had in the history of our country. We are doing record business. We have the highest levels of enthusiasm, so the head of Walmart, who I know, who’s a very nice guy, was making a political statement. I mean, I would do it the same way, you know why? Because I want to make sure when I make a statement that the statement is correct. And there was no way – no way – of making a correct statement that early. I had to see the facts, unlike a lot of reporters, unlike a lot of reporter. I didn't know David Duke was there. I wanted to see the facts. And the facts, as they started coming out, were very well-stated. In fact, everybody said his statement was beautiful. If he would have made it sooner, that would have been good. I couldn't have made it sooner, because I didn't know all of the facts. Frankly, people still don't know all of the facts. It was very important – excuse me, excuse me. It was very important to me to get the facts out and correctly. Because if I would have made a fast statement and the first statement was made without knowing much other than what we were seeing. The second statement was made after it with knowledge, with great knowledge. There are still things – excuse me. There are still things that people don't know. I want to make a statement with knowledge, I wanted to know the facts, okay. REPORTER: Two questions: was this terrorism? And can you tell us how you are feeling about your Chief Strategist Steve Bannon? TRUMP: I think the driver of the car is a disgrace to himself, his family and this country. And that is – you can call it terrorism, you can call it murder. You can call it whatever you want. I would just call it as the fastest one to come up with a good verdict. That’s what I’d call it. And there is a question. Is it murder? Is it terrorism? Then you get into legal semantics. The driver of the car is a murderer, and what he did was a horrible, horrible, inexcusable thing. REPORTER: Can you tell us how you are feeling about your chief strategist, Mr. Bannon? Can you talk about that? TRUMP: I never spoke to Mr. Bannon about it. REPORTER: Can you tell us broadly about – do you still have confidence in Steve? TRUMP: Well, we’ll see. And look, look, I like Mr. Bannon. He is a friend of mine, but Mr. Bannon came on very late. You know that. I went through 17 senators, governors and I won all the primaries. Mr. Bannon came on very much later than that, and I like him. He is a good man. He is not a racist – I can tell you that. He is a good person, he actually gets very unfair press in that regard. We'll see what happens with Mr. Bannon. He’s a good person, and I think the press treats him frankly very unfairly. REPORTER: They have called on you to defend your national security adviser H.R. McMaster against these attacks. TRUMP: I did that before. Senator McCain? Senator McCain. You mean the one that voted against Obamacare? Who is Senator McCain? You mean senator McCain who voted against us getting good health care? REPORTER: Senator McCain said that the alt-right is behind these attacks, and he linked that same group to those that perpetrated the attack in Charlottesville. TRUMP: Well, I don't know. I can't tell you. I'm sure Senator McCain must know what he is talking about, but when you say the alt-right, define alt-right to me. You define it. Go ahead. Define it for me, come on, let's go. REPORTER: Senator McCain defined them as the same group. TRUMP: Okay, what about the alt-left that came charging at [indiscernible] – excuse me – what about the alt-left that came charging at the, as you say, the alt right? Do they have any semblance of guilt? TRUMP: What about this? What about the fact that they came charging – they came charging with clubs in their hands swinging clubs? Do they have any problem? I think they do. TRUMP: As far as I’m concerned, that was a horrible, horrible day. Wait a minute, I'm not finished. I'm not finished, fake news. That was a horrible day. TRUMP: I will tell you something. I watched those very closely, much more closely than you people watched it. And you had, you had a group on one side that was bad. And you had a group on the other side that was also very violent. And nobody wants to say that, but I'll say it right now. You had a group – you had a group on the other side that came charging in without a permit, and they were very, very violent. REPORTER: Do you think what you call the alt left is the same as neo-Nazis? TRUMP: Those people – all of those people, excuse me – I've condemned neo-Nazis. I've condemned many different groups, but not all of those people were neo-Nazis, believe me. Not all of those people were white supremacists by any stretch. TRUMP: Those people were also there, because they wanted to protest the taking down of a statue Robert E. Lee. So – excuse me – and you take a look at some of the groups and you see, and you’d know it if you were honest reporters, which in many cases you’re not. Many of those people were there to protest the taking down of the statue of Robert E. Lee. So this week, it’s Robert E. Lee, I noticed that Stonewall Jackson’s coming down. I wonder, is it George Washington next week? And is it Thomas Jefferson the week after. You know, you really do have to ask yourself, where does it stop? TRUMP: But, they were there to protest – excuse me – you take a look the night before, they were there to protest the taking down of the statue of Robert E. Lee. Infrastructure question. Go ahead. REPORTER: Does the statue of Robert E. Lee stay up? TRUMP: I would say that’s up to a local town, community or the federal government, depending on where it is located. REPORTER: Are you against the Confederacy? REPORTER: On race relations in America, do you think things have gotten worse or better since you took office with regard to race relationships? TRUMP: I think they’ve gotten better or the same – look – they have been frayed for a long time, and you can ask President Obama about that, because he’d make speeches about it. I believe that the fact that I brought in, it will be soon, millions of jobs, you see where companies are moving back into our country. I think that's going to have a tremendous positive impact on race relations. We have companies coming back into our country. We have two car companies that just announced. We have Foxconn in Wisconsin just announced. We have many companies, I’d say, pouring back into the country. I think that's going to have a huge, positive impact on race relations. You know why? It is jobs. What people want now, they want jobs. They want great jobs with good pay. And when they have that, you watch how race relations will be. And I’ll tell you, we’re spending a lot of money on the inner cities – we are fixing the inner cities – we are doing far more than anybody has done with respect to the inner cities. It is a priority for me, and it’s very important. REPORTER: Mr. President, are you putting what you’re calling the alt-left and white supremacists on the same moral plane? TRUMP: I am not putting anybody on a moral plane, what I’m saying is this: you had a group on one side and a group on the other, and they came at each other with clubs and it was vicious and horrible and it was a horrible thing to watch, but there is another side. There was a group on this side, you can call them the left. You’ve just called them the left, that came violently attacking the other group. So you can say what you want, but that's the way it is. REPORTER: You said there was hatred and violence on both sides? TRUMP: I do think there is blame – yes, I think there is blame on both sides. You look at, you look at both sides. I think there’s blame on both sides, and I have no doubt about it, and you don't have any doubt about it either. And, and, and, and if you reported it accurately, you would say. REPORTER: The neo-Nazis started this thing. They showed up in Charlottesville. TRUMP: Excuse me, they didn't put themselves down as neo-Nazis, and you had some very bad people in that group. But you also had people that were very fine people on both sides. You had people in that group – excuse me, excuse me. I saw the same pictures as you did. You had people in that group that were there to protest the taking down, of to them, a very, very important statue and the renaming of a park from Robert E. Lee to another name. REPORTER: George Washington and Robert E. Lee are not the same. TRUMP: Oh no, George Washington was a slave owner. Was George Washington a slave owner? So will George Washington now lose his status? Are we going to take down – excuse me. Are we going to take down, are we going to take down statues to George Washington? How about Thomas Jefferson? What do you think of Thomas Jefferson? You like him? Okay, good. Are we going to take down his statue? He was a major slave owner. Are we going to take down his statue? You know what? It’s fine, you’re changing history, you’re changing culture, and you had people – and I'm not talking about the neo-Nazis and the white nationalists, because they should be condemned totally – but you had many people in that group other than neo-Nazis and white nationalists, okay? And the press has treated them absolutely unfairly. Now, in the other group also, you had some fine people, but you also had troublemakers and you see them come with the black outfits and with the helmets and with the baseball bats – you had a lot of bad people in the other group too. REPORTER: I just didn’t understand what you were saying. You were saying the press has treated white nationalists unfairly? TRUMP: No, no. There were people in that rally, and I looked the night before. If you look, they were people protesting very quietly, the taking down the statue of Robert E. Lee. I’m sure in that group there were some bad ones. The following day, it looked like they had some rough, bad people, neo-Nazis, white nationalists, whatever you want to call ‘em. But you had a lot of people in that group that were there to innocently protest and very legally protest, because you know, I don't know if you know, but they had a permit. The other group didn't have a permit. So I only tell you this: there are two sides to a story. I thought what took place was a horrible moment for our country, a horrible moment. But there are two sides to the country. Does anybody have a final – does anybody have a final question? You have an infrastructure question. REPORTER: What makes you think you can get an infrastructure bill? TRUMP: Well, let me tell you. We came very close with health care. Unfortunately, John McCain decided to vote against it at the last minute. You’ll have to ask him why he did that. We came very close to health care. We will end up getting health care. But we’ll get the infrastructure, and actually, infrastructure’s something I think we'll have bipartisan support on. I actually think – I actually think Democrats will go along with the infrastructure. REPORTER: Mr. President, have you spoken to the family of the victim of the car attack? TRUMP: No. I will be reaching out, I’ll be reaching out. REPORTER: When will you be reaching out? TRUMP: I thought that the statement put out, the mother's statement I thought was a beautiful statement. I’ll tell you – it was something that I really appreciated. I thought it was terrific. And really under the kind of stress that she’s under and the heartache she’s under, I thought putting out that statement to me was really something I won't forget. Thank you all very much. Thank you. REPORTER: Do you plan to go to Charlottesville, Mr. President? TRUMP: Did you know I own a house? It’s in Charlottesville, oh boy. It’s in Charlottesville, you’ll see. REPORTER: Is that the winery or something? TRUMP: It’s a, it’s a, it is the winery. TRUMP: I mean, I know a lot about Charlottesville. Charlottesville is a great place that's been very badly hurt over the last couple of days. I own – I own actually one of the largest wineries in the United States. It’s in charlottesville. REPORTER: What do you think needs to overcome the racial divides? TRUMP: Well, I really think jobs are going to have a big impact. If we continue to create jobs – over a million – substantially more than a million, and you see just the other day, the car companies come in with Foxconn, I think if we continue to create jobs at levels that I'm creating jobs, I think that's going to have a tremendous impact – positive impact – on race relations. REPORTER: And what you said today, how do you think that will impact? TRUMP: Because the people are going to be working and making a lot of money, much more than they ever thought possible. That's going to happen. And the other thing, very important, I believe wages will start going up. They haven't gone up for a long time. I believe wages now, because the economy is doing so well, with respect to employment and unemployment, I believe wages will start to go up. I think that’ll have a tremendously positive impact on race relations. Thank you. Missing out on the latest scoops?

I had to be carried up the stairs and put into a wheelchair for the rest of my stay.Anna Pesce suffered from back pain and hunchback posture (left) until yoga back-care specialist Rachel Jesien began treating her (right) in late 2014.Kevin Kelley Photography: www.kphotok.com (inset); Stephen YangFor the past few decades, Pesce suffered from hunchbacklike posture the result of a herniated disc, scoliosis and osteoporosis, which weakens the bones and can lead to curvature of the spine.I tried everything: acupuncture, a physical therapist and seeing a chiropractor, Pesce adds. You feel good temporarily, but [Id be] in pain again soon after.Three months after her South Carolina visit, she began working with certified yoga instructor Rachel Jesien, 28, who also suffers from scoliosis a curvature in the spine that usually develops during puberty and specializes in back care. Pesces granddaughter, also a yoga teacher, introduced the two.Jesien visited Pesce in her home once a week, teaching her restorative poses and stretches such as childs pose and chair savasana, in which Pesce would rest her lower legs on a chair while lying on the floor with her knees slightly bent and a strap around her thighs. After one month of sessions, Pesce was able to walk again.Anna Pesce (left) uses props such as bolsters and slings to practice yoga with Rachel Jesien.Stephen YangAfter two months, another big milestone was that [Pesce] knew what poses to do whenever the usual pains would come up for her, Jesien says. For example, if she was having hip pain, shed sit on a chair and do an ankle-to-knee pose.By her fourth month, Pesce could do a modified headstand, with her back against the wall and her feet parallel to her head in an inverted V-shape.[Pesce] was timid at first, because just moving caused her so much pain, says Jesien, who received her yoga and back-care certification from the Yoga Union center in Chelsea in 2011. Luckily, the 86-year-old was a quick learner, and they still continue to do weekly sessions after nearly two years.Jesien says that yoga, done with the guidance of a back-care specialist, can strengthen bone density and muscles and alleviate back pain caused by osteoporosis, osteoarthritis and other conditions that affect the elderly.She discovered back-care yoga in 2010 upon the recommendation of a massage therapist. I had to wear a back brace for five years and went to physical therapy every week, but this was the only thing that worked, says Jesien.Dr. Houman Danesh, director of integrative pain management at Mount Sinai Hospital, agrees that doing yoga poses can help some people manage painful back conditions.Doing weight-bearing exercises like squats and lunges can definitely increase bone density, says Danesh. Yoga poses can be easily extrapolated to have the same effect. Physical therapists have been incorporating yoga stretches into their sessions as well.I feel wonderful now because I can drive by myself and do the things I wasnt able to do before, Pesce says.Stephen YangWhile Danesh recommends that people go to a physical therapist first for a proper diagnosis, he stresses that one-on-one care with a specialist is key.I would rather patients see a great physical therapist over a great yoga instructor, Danesh says. But whats important is that people get individual care and attention.While older people may feel intimidated by yoga, Jesien says its worth seeking out a certified back-care instructor, and Pesce agrees.I feel wonderful now because I can drive by myself and do the things I wasnt able to do before, Pesce says. I would recommend this to other people.Pesces daughter, Rosemary Pitruzzella, says shes definitely seen a change in her moms demeanor.My mom is a lot more independent, and even how she carries herself she just seems a lot happier and brighter now, says Pitruzzella, 57.Every day, Pesce practices a series of poses, from pranayama breathing exercises to a supported downward dog achieved with the help of a sling.Shes a tough cookie, Jesien says. Before we were working together, [Pesce] was so down about her condition, but now she has such a different outlook and feels so much better about her life.Stephen YangStephen YangStephen YangStephen YangStephen YangStephen YangStephen YangAdUp NextThe saddest moment for Missy Franklin in mysterious fall Missy Franklin was a swimming star at the 2012 Olympics.... 7View SlideshowBackContinueShare this:FacebookTwitterGoogleFacebook MessengerWhatsAppEmailCopy Advertisement August 8, 2016 Share this:FacebookTwitterGoogleFacebook MessengerWhatsAppEmailCopy",2016/08/09,snopes,1

With cow bells jangling and Masai women thumping up and down, doing a dance they usually do in drought times to praise God, the festivities were an unusual way to mark the fifth anniversary of the attacks. But then again, it was an unusual demonstration of sympathy in the first place. It all began when Kimeli Naiyomah, a star pupil from Enoosaen studying at Stanford University, returned to his village in spring 2002 and told people about Sept. 11. News travels slowly over the bumpy roads of rural Kenya. Even months later, many Masai, who are among Kenya’s most traditional people, had not understood the attack’s magnitude.

The elders settled on 14 head of cattle, which, with a total value of around $3,000, is a huge sum in a village of thatched huts. American diplomats flirted with the idea of shipping the animals to the Central Park Zoo. That proved too complicated. Then someone suggested selling them and using the proceeds to buy Masai jewelry for New Yorkers. But that seemed a little heartless. The indecision went on and on, and by Year 3, some of the Masai were feeling spurned. The cattle were growing fat — and going nowhere. In Masai culture, it is disrespectful to dillydally over such a gift. American diplomats eventually decided that the education plan made the most sense. On Sunday, Ambassador Ranneberger, with his 15-year-old daughter, Elizabeth, toured two of Enoosaen’s high schools — low-slung buildings with tin roofs — before checking out the cattle. There are 21 of them now, and they mooed when they saw the ambassador. “How many cows do you think my daughter would fetch?” he asked Mr. ole Yiamboi as he inspected the animals. “All of them, Daddy!” Elizabeth cut in. Mr. ole Yiamboi laughed — and then cast a quick glance at the ambassador’s daughter. “Six or eight cows would do,” he said.

https://www.snopes.com/fact-check/rhode-island-governor-seize-guns/,the governor of rhode island signed an executive order allowing the federal government to confiscate people's firearms.,Mostly False,"['conservative daily post', ' conservative unite', ' gina raimondo', ' gun confiscation', ' gun control', ' red flag laws', ' rhode island']",https://www.washingtonpost.com/,https://www.washingtonpost.com/national/health-science/five-states-allow-guns-to-be-seized-before-someone-can-commit-violence/2018/02/16/78ee4cc8-128c-11e8-9570-29c9830535e5_story.html,2018/03/03,"In the wake of massacres similar to Wednesday’s school shooting in Parkland, Fla., a small number of states have passed “red flag laws” that allow the seizure of guns before people can commit acts of violence. California, Washington, Oregon, Indiana and Connecticut have statutes that can be used to temporarily take guns away from people a judge deems a threat to themselves or others. Lawmakers in 18 other states — including Florida — plus the District of Columbia have proposed similar measures. At the federal level, Rep. Salud Carbajal (D-Calif.) and Sen. Dianne Feinstein (D-Calif.) introduced legislation last May that would encourage states to adopt the approach. Mental illness, escalating threats, substance abuse and domestic violence are among the circumstances in which a judge can order weapon restrictions under the statutes. “This morning I heard the sheriff [in Parkland] lament the fact that he did not have the tools to remove the firearms from the shooter,” Joshua Horwitz, executive director of the Coalition to Stop Gun Violence, said Thursday. The nation’s patchwork of federal and state gun laws mainly involves background checks and actions to prevent people who pose a threat from buying firearms. The approach of the red flag laws is to seize guns from people who have them and to restrict their access until they are no longer deemed dangerous. “We think of this as a new frontier,” said Jonas Oransky, deputy legal director of Everytown for Gun Safety, an advocacy group founded in 2014. “We don’t have a perfect system in this country, and we can’t stop every act of gun violence. The laws allow family members or law enforcement officers to ask a judge for a “gun violence restraining order” or an “extreme risk protection order” against someone who behaves the way 19-year-old Nikolas Cruz, the alleged Florida gunman, did in recent years. According to news reports, Cruz killed squirrels with a pellet gun, trained his dogs to attack a neighbor’s piglets, posted on Insta­gram about guns and killing animals and eventually threatened at least one teen. He showed signs of depression and had been treated at a mental health clinic. Authorities say Cruz used an AR-15 assault-style rifle to kill 17 people and wound at least 15 others at Marjory Stoneman Douglas High School on Wednesday. Cruz has been charged with 17 counts of premeditated murder. In an Everytown study of mass shootings from 2009 to 2016, 42 percent of the attackers had shown warning signs of violent behavior. In most situations, however, the danger is suicide, not homicide. When Duke University researchers looked at the application of Connecticut’s red flag law between 1999 and 2013, they found that police served 762 so-called “risk warrants” during that period and estimated that a gun suicide was prevented for every 10 to 20 seizures. The police found guns in 99 percent of the cases in which they served the warrants, seizing an average of seven firearms from each person. Twenty-one people went on to commit suicide anyway, six by firearms. Overall, suicides account for about 60 percent of gun deaths in the United States. The National Alliance on Mental Illness has no formal position on red flag laws, according to Ron Honberg, a senior policy adviser for the organization, but hopes to see more states adopt them. “It creates some mechanism to intervene at a particular point in time when a person may be in bad shape,” Honberg said. “Is it going to be 100 percent effective? In the three Western states with such laws, all adopted since 2014, a family member or law enforcement officer must petition a court about someone who appears to be a threat. Relatives often go to the police and ask them to do so, experts said. A judge can quickly order the weapons surrendered if convinced of the threat. Within a few weeks, a full hearing is held on longer-term restrictions, which can last a year. Judges must allow people who want their weapons back to revisit the ruling. In Connecticut, only law enforcement agents can ask for a risk warrant. And in Indiana, law enforcement can confiscate weapons without a judge’s order. The gun owner must ask the court to get the weapons returned. States have long prohibited some convicted felons and people committed involuntarily from having firearms. At least seven states last year passed laws restricting access to guns for people convicted of misdemeanor domestic violence crimes, and three require that offenders turn their guns in. Horwitz and Oransky said the National Rifle Association and other members of the gun lobby have not put up much opposition to the statutes. “We would be happy if they came to the table and were supportive of those laws,” Oransky said.",2018/02/16,snopes,1

Valizadeh has instructed his followers to go to a public location at each meeting area and identify themselves by asking, “Do you know where I can find a pet shop?” From there, group members will be taken to a secret meeting location.Women and the LGBT community have been banned from attending the meetings.Valizadeh argued on his blog last year that rape should be legal on private property.“By attempting to teach men not to rape, what we have actually done is teach women not to care about being raped, not to protect themselves from easily preventable acts, and not to take responsibility for their actions,” he wrote at the time. “I thought about this problem and am sure I have the solution: make rape legal if done on private property.”“I propose that we make the violent taking of a woman not punishable by law when done off public grounds,” Valizadeh said.However, the planned meetings are already receiving opposition in some countries.“Sex without consent is rape. There are no excuses. If someone is drunk or drugged they cannot give consent,” a spokesperson for Police Scotland told The National. “We must do all we can to prevent rape and sexual assaults amongst offering all the necessary support and protection to those who are victims.”Australian Greens Party candidate Jill Thomsen lashed out at Valizadeh’s group on Twitter.“The creeps from @ReturnOfKings are meeting in Sydney,” she wrote . “Their masculinity is so fragile they will use ‘codewords’ to find each other in public.”Don't let Silicon Valley control what you see.

We heard that the militants grabbed six strong men working at the bakery and burned them inside the oven. We knew them, Assaf told Dr. Yvette Isaac, who works for the advocacy group, according to the UK Mirror.After that, they caught some 250 kids and kneaded them like dough in the bakery dough machine, Assaf said, according to media reports. They were put in the dough mixer, they were kneaded. The oldest one of them was four-years-old.ISIS transported hundreds of girls to the city of Douma, which has been at the center of the Syrian civil war, to be slaughtered. ISIS has been systematically killing non-Muslims, and the majority of its victims at the time were Christian.Assaf said her own son, George, was killed by the radical militants after he refused to switch to a Muslim name.My son said to me, No, mother, I dont want to die with an identity not my own. I prefer to die with the name George,' Assaf said, according to the Christian Post. Assaf added, I asked my son then to hide, but he refused and said, I dont want to hide myself. You are the one who taught me to follow what Christ said whoever denies me before man, I will also deny before my father who is in Heaven.'Dr. Isaac reported the savage slayings to a member of the UK Parliament, Fiona Bruce, who recently recounted the horrifying testimony to her colleagues in open chambers.She showed us recent film footage of herself talking with mothersmore than one who had seen their own children crucified, Bruce said.She told us of a mother with a two-month-old baby.

Representatives for the Sanders campaign did not immediately respond to a request for comment.Kimmel said he asked Trump about the debate at the suggestion of Sanders, who is scheduled to appear on the show Thursday night.Sanders, a self-described democratic socialist who was elected to Congress as an independent and has made economic equality a keystone of his campaign, had first challenged Clinton to a California debate. He said he was disappointed when the former secretary of state declined. The Clinton campaign did not immediately respond to a request for comment to a possible Trump-Sanders debate.Clinton has tried to woo Sanders supporters as she works to secure the party’s nomination for the Nov. 8 election. But some worry his supporters - who are largely young, working-class and disillusioned with party establishment - will turn instead to political neophyte Trump, who has championed a populist agenda.Sanders has said he will do everything he can to ensure that Trump does not win the White House.Reporting by Megan Cassella; Editing by Bernadette Baum and Bill Trott",2016/05/26,snopes,1

The bomb killed 70,000-80,000 people and injured another 70,000.But during the daily White House press briefing Monday, Earnest was asked about Abe’s decision to visit Pearl Harbor — which will come shortly after the 75th anniversary of the attack — and how veterans should feel about it, namely because Japan has refused to apologize for the attack.“If I were a World War II veteran who was drafted by the United States military to go and fight for our country overseas in the aftermath of the Pearl Harbor attack, I might feel quite embittered,” Earnest said. “And I think it would be a perfectly natural and understandable human reaction to not be particularly satisfied with the words of the Japanese Prime Minister.”But, Earnest said those people who feel “personal bitterness” should set aside their feelings for the greater good of the U.S.“And so, yes, there may be some who feel personally embittered,” he added. “But I’m confident that many will set aside their own personal bitterness, not because they’re personally satisfied by the words of the Prime Minister, but because they recognize how important this moment is for the United States.”For what it’s worth, Abe said that he would “mourn the souls of the victims” of Japan’s surprise attack with Obama during his visit later this month.",2016/12/06,snopes,1

The legislation would also impose heftier penalties for anyone who patronizes the extremist hate group’s chicken sandwich establishments during Pride Month.“We want people making fast-food dining choices to think carefully about a restaurant’s background,” House Minority Leader and bill co-sponsor Nancy Pelosi said in a video posted to her official YouTube account. “If a restaurant’s leadership is associated with Christian values in any way, frequenting their locations amounts to literal violence against minorities, women, and the LGBTQ+ community.”According to Pelosi, the legislation was rushed into motion after Twitter CEO Jack Dorsey posted that he was eating at Chick-fil-A on his Twitter account over the weekend, and was later forced to apologize after weathering severe criticism by progressives. Federal agents found they were unable to prosecute him, since eating at a Christian-owned restaurant wasn’t “technically” defined as a hate crime under United States law.“It’s 2018.

Trump had been ordered to leave Bavaria for failing to complete mandatory military service and to register his initial emigration to the United States twenty years earlier. Prince Luitpold rejected Trump’s request for repatriation; the family later settled in New York. Translated from the German by Austen Hinkley.Most Serene, Most Powerful Prince Regent! Most Gracious Regent and Lord!I was born in Kallstadt on March 14, 1869. My parents were honest, plain, pious vineyard workers. They strictly held me to everything good — to diligence and piety, to regular attendance in school and church, to absolute obedience toward the high authority.After my confirmation, in 1882, I apprenticed to become a barber. I emigrated in 1885, in my sixteenth year. In America I carried on my business with diligence, discretion, and prudence. God’s blessing was with me, and I became rich. I obtained American citizenship in 1892. In 1902 I met my current wife. Sadly, she could not tolerate the climate in New York, and I went with my dear family back to Kallstadt.The town was glad to have received a capable and productive citizen. My old mother was happy to see her son, her dear daughter-in-law, and her granddaughter around her; she knows now that I will take care of her in her old age.But we were confronted all at once, as if by a lightning strike from fair skies, with the news that the High Royal State Ministry had decided that we must leave our residence in the Kingdom of Bavaria. We were paralyzed with fright; our happy family life was tarnished. My wife has been overcome by anxiety, and my lovely child has become sick.Why should we be deported? This is very, very hard for a family. What will our fellow citizens think if honest subjects are faced with such a decree — not to mention the great material losses it would incur. I would like to become a Bavarian citizen again.In this urgent situation I have no other recourse than to turn to our adored, noble, wise, and just sovereign lord, our exalted ruler His Royal Highness, highest of all, who has already dried so many tears, who has ruled so beneficially and justly and wisely and softly and is warmly and deeply loved, with the most humble request that the highest of all will himself in mercy deign to allow the applicant to stay in the most gracious Kingdom of Bavaria.Your most humble and obedient,Friedrich Trump",2017/02/18,snopes,1

So how come he left the rave reviews till last?Bryan AppleyardJust over 20 years ago, in his mid-forties, Patrick Stewart was doing pretty well as an actor. He didn’t have any savings, but he had a nice house in Chiswick and could afford to send his two children to private schools. “My career,” he says, “had been chugging along in an okay way.” Then he appeared in Peter Shaffer’s Yonadab at the National Theatre. It was Shaffer’s only flop, and Stewart found himself playing to an almost empty house. Next came Who’s Afraid of Virginia Woolf? with Billie Whitelaw at the Young Vic. It was a hit and ready to transfer to the West End, but Whitelaw didn’t want to go. The money man said the loss of Whitelaw was a problem. He couldn’t take it into the West End without a star people had heard of. “It really hurt, that remark. All those years of work at the RSC. But I guess it was a pragmatic point of view. I wasn’t bankable, and he couldn’t sell this production on my name.”So, in 1987, he took a television job in Hollywood. Everybody told him to do it – he could make some money, be seen by millions and then come home. It was no big commitment, he was assured, as the series would certainly bomb. “It sounded like a great plan. It was a great deal. That’s why I did it.” The series was certain to fail because it seemed like little more than a desperate attempt to revive an old one. Furthermore, Stewart was to be cast as the most unAmerican hero imaginable, an earl-grey drinking, vaguely aristocratic, vaguely naval type with a French – French! – name, who preferred talking to fighting. On the face of it, the series only made sense as some sort of tax scam. Stewart and the rest of the cast thought nothing of signing up for six years.But, of course, Star Trek: The Next Generation lasted for seven years, and Stewart was Captain Jean-Luc Picard of the Starship Enterprise for 178 episodes. Then it turned into a series of films, culminating in Star Trek: Nemesis, in 2002. “It came to a point where I had no idea where Picard began and I ended. We completely overlapped. His voice became my voice, and there were other elements of him that became me.” Stewart was now unbankable in a wholly new way. No director in Hollywood wanted to cast this grand, deep-voiced, bald English guy because everybody knew he was Picard and couldn’t possibly be anybody else. In the event, he effectively reprised the part as Professor Charles Xavier – a grand, deep-voiced, bald English guy – in the X-Men films. “I don’t have a film career,” he says wryly, “I have a franchise career.”In 2004, however, homesick, pining for the stage and with his second marriage coming to an end (he now lives with the actress Lisa Dillon), he came home with, for a Shakespearian star, a gaping hole in his CV. “There comes a point where you have to start ticking off these roles. I’ve missed out on Hamlet and Romeo, probably Richard III, too. I was even uncomfortably aware when I took on Macbeth that people were saying I was a little old for it. I’ve not done Lear, but Ian McKellen has closed that door for a good few years. If I could fit in only one more Shakespeare role, it would be Falstaff. I’ve always thought of him as a middle-aged Hamlet. It’s a great role.” He’s 67 now and so absurdly buff that he could pass for an absurdly buff 50. We meet at the stage door of the Gielgud theatre – or, rather, we fail to meet, because he rushed in with a Huddersfield Town cap pulled over his face. He doesn’t like the hooker-and thug-infested bit of Soho around Rupert Street, and he and the rest of the cast leave by the front entrance in the evening, hence the speed of his entry and the disguise. He’s doing his Macbeth at the Gielgud, and both he and the show are magnificent, mesmerising. The reviews are raves, and it’s just about to go to New York. It was, I say, the play that turned me on to Shakespeare when I was 14. He laughs. “I think you’ll find a lot of people will say that. I got a sniff of it when I was 14. I thought I was going to play it, and somebody said to me, ‘Stewart, you’re going to get a lot of opportunities to play parts like this – we’re giving it to somebody else.’ As it happened, that production didn’t eventually happen.”There seem to be three important things about Stewart’s childhood: his luck, his dad and the Yorkshire countryside. He was lucky because, in spite of abject academic failure – he skived off on the day of his 11-plus – he was spotted by a smart English teacher and was taught outside school by a brilliant drama teacher. It was clear where he was going, and, after a spell on the local paper, he became a full-time actor. “It was a smart move, bunking off the 11-plus. I would never have met Cecil Dormand – a great man – and I would have been a grammar-school failure.”His father had been in the army for 10 years and then enlisted again in 1939. “He was an imposing man, regimental sergeant major in the Parachute Regiment. He had a terrific voice, better than mine. Somebody said when my father walked on the parade ground, the birds stopped singing.” The Macbeth production is set in a modern, military state. Stewart has grown a sergeant-majorish moustache for the part. “When I put my uniform on and look in the mirror, he stares straight back at me.”From the first, he was a workaholic, an affliction that, he admits, made him a bad father, remote like his dad. “I always chose work over the family – I regret that, I really do. I have a great relationship with my children now, terrific, but I didn’t always have it. I missed out so much. And I don’t think I supported their mother as much as I might have done. It would never occur to me to put family first. It’s still a struggle. It wasn’t because I didn’t love them, I just loved the job so much.”He did bits of film and television, but everything else was theatre. He pursued his craft with awesome austerity, a habit that backfired on him when he got on the Star Trek set. At an early shoot, he snapped at the rest of the cast: “We’re not here to have fun, we’re here to work.” He says now: “I came to think there was too much fooling around on set. I was very aware of the clock ticking. I was the oldest person on the set, and we were working until midnight or beyond, and it took more of a toll on me than on them.”The others also concluded he had a poverty mentality, another aspect of his austerity. He was in denial about what he was being paid for playing Picard. For 15 minutes’ overtime, he earned an extra £125, exactly what he had been making in a week at the Young Vic. But he still lived above somebody’s garage.After a year, he did buy a new car: a Honda. The rest of the cast were in Mercedes and Fer-raris. But the point was – and this, I am sure, is why his Star Trek was easily the most successful iteration of the franchise – that he took Picard seriously.“I’m very proud of the series. I think we did really good work. Every now and then we did absolute crap, but it was 178 episodes. We really fought to keep the standards high – the script, the language, the story lines, everything. We also acquired an astonishing number of eminent fans: several secretaries of state, chiefs of staff, chancellors of universities. Frank Sinatra never missed Earth is released on November 16 www.bryanappleyard.com a show, and Tom Hanks knows the name of every episode.”Perhaps the key was that Stewart was such a team player. He speaks warmly of the cast, and they are plainly still friends, especially Jonathan Frakes, who played Riker, Picard’s deputy, and whose shouting of “Red alert!” gave me and my daughter hours of innocent delight. He mentions proudly that Marina Sirtis, the pompous “counsellor” Deanna Troi, had lunch with him in London recently. Best of all, he loves the movie Galaxy Quest, a sublime Star Trek spoof. “Jonathan told me to see it. I said I didn’t want to see the piss taken out of me by Alan Rickman and the rest. He told me to see it in Santa Monica on a Saturday night. I did, and it was perfect, fantastic, one of my all-time favourites. They got it exactly right – that’s how it was, and the ending was right at the heart of the spirit of Star Trek.”He was missing theatre from the beginning. And so, in his room above the garage, he constructed a series of one-man shows that he took to universities and drama schools in California. The best, A Christmas Carol, made it to Broad-way. The first few nights were full of Trekkies, many in uniform.But now, he’s back. His rich voice provides the narration for the movie Earth, made by the BBC Natural History Unit, a feature-length version of Planet Earth. And, best of all, he is immersed, for at least two years, in the theatre and Shakespeare. This makes him very happy. He revels in the ensemble and he wallows in the language. “When Macbeth starts, I have three hours to inhabit this role, this man who’s saying these amazing things. It’s not just a great story, it’s mind-expanding just getting your head round this imagery and this language. It’s like a drug – there’s nothing to match it.”And that third important thing, the countryside? Well, he used to cycle up to the Dales as a boy – “Turning back to go home was a physical pain” – and the landscape infected him for life. In Hollywood, he pined for English hills and valleys. Now he has a house in the south Dales. He reckons he could walk northeastward for three days from there and never see a road. He has also learnt to love southern England. He has just done up a house in Oxfordshire. And he remembers a walk he took over the South Downs. “One evening that I didn’t have a show, I had been rehearsing and I went home. It was midsummer, so it was light, and I started walking. I walked for hours and got to some high point looking down on this valley.” He sighs and his eyes are damp. “And smoke was coming up. I was overwhelmed with feelings I couldn’t articulate. Overwhelmed. It moved me so much.”Great actor, good man. As the Vulcans used to say, live long and prosper, Captain Picard – sorry, Patrick Stewart.I live in Ann Arbor, Michigan and it was a little over a year ago that I saw Patrick Stewart performing here with the Royal Shakespeare Company and I enjoyed the performances immensely. What moved me most I think was the awareness that here's someone who sets the example for one who has found a love in his own work that we should all strive to find in ours.Chris Kaltwasser, Ann Arbor, Michigan USI was a pretty big Star Trek TNG fan when I was a kid. Patrick Stewart is an amazing actor. And kind of hot for an old bald dude. :)I heard he's a Beavis and Butthead fan. That blows my mind. And is awesome.Sarah, Virginia, USAPatrick Stewart was also good in the original version of Dune.Kerry Rose, Houston, TexasI've seen a lot of Macbeths over the years of my professional career, and Mr. Stewart's made me hear the words as if newly written for him alone. It was a magnificent, mindaltering performance. And, to bow to my inner geek, to be in the same room with Picard was a thrill. Long live Patrick Stewart!Robert A. Wright, Atlanta, Geogia, USAAround the early 80s I bump into Mr. Stewart on a video of Derek Jacobiâs Hamlet in a High School British Literature Class. Needless to say, due to being in high school, I was not that consistently interested in it. I think I sleep through half of it over a four day period of classes. Then as an insatiable curious budding actor studying Shakespeare in an Illinois college library, I came across John Bartonâs Playing Shakespeare Video Series which introduced me again to Mr. Stewart. From then on I was hooked and keep track of what he was doing. And now, in light of where he has taken his career in these last two years, I am inspired. It serves as a model to be constantly evolving and challenging oneself in a life's work. Mr. Stewart...Thank You!George Younts, Charleston, USA/SCI fell in love with Patrick Stewart well before Trek in the sublime camp of the BBC miniseries ""I Claudiu"" as Sejanus. Hot Gladiator! Evil character that gets what he deserves. I can't recomend ""I Claudius"" enough!Andrew Mondt, Chicago, IllinoisJean-Luc Picard is the manager everyone of us would love to work for. I love TNG because of him. But I've really enjoyed seeing him back in Shakespear -- his Prospero was wonderful. Long may he shine as an actor in whatever he wishes to do.Peter, Warwick, WarksI love Patrick Stewart since I first saw him in an episode of Star Trek the Next Generation. I found his character exceptionally intelligent and highly inspirational for anyone leading a group of professionals. But then I learned that he was a classical theatre actor and that he loved to play Shakespeare and Dickens and so on. I had the pleasure to watch him at Washington when he portrayed Othello in a photonegative version and have followed his career in movies and TV programs. I never have enough of him and I am very pleased to know that he is still having new and great accomplishments and success as the great actor he is. God bless him.Ana Leticia Pastrana, Mexico City, MexicoPatrick Stewart is indeed a very fine actor. Being an original trekkie, I must say that Star Trek Next Generation reruns are still a pleasure to watch (I also have been enjoying the recent series Star Trek Enterprise which tells how it all started and is also very well done). Even though we have never met, in my book he is a very intelligent, sexy man with a great sense of humor (yeah Galaxy Quest!). I just love that voice AND the bald head! :) May he continue to enjoy his wonderful life and give us many, many more years of his talent.P K Landry, Houston, TXAlot of good things have come out of yorkshire, GeoffreyBoycott, The Kings Own Yorkshire Light Infantry, Leeds Utd,to name a few.

He served five terms in Congress. He ran a newspaper and helped found a state Republican Party. But first, he had to win his freedom. To do that, he conceived a plan that struck a blow against the Confederacy so significant that he was heralded across the nation. Carrying out his mission required bravery, intelligence and precision timing — attributes that many whites at that time thought blacks didn’t possess. Robert Smalls proved them wrong and changed history in the doing. Smalls was born in Beaufort, S.C., on April 5, 1839, the son of Lydia Polite, a slave who was a housekeeper in the city home of John McKee, owner of the Ashdale Plantation on Lady’s Island, one of the Sea Islands. Though he never knew the identity of his father, it was widely believed that Smalls was the progeny of McKee’s son, Henry. “There was a distinctly fatherly relationship between [Henry McKee] and my great-grandfather,” said Helen Boulware Moore of Lakewood Ranch, Fla., who grew up hearing stories about Smalls from her grandmother, Elizabeth Lydia Smalls Bampfield, his daughter. Growing up at the McKees’ place, Smalls played with both black and white children, ate food cooked in the kitchen where his mother worked and slept in a bed in a small house that was provided for her. Polite had been taken from her family on the island plantation at age 9 to work as a companion to the McKee children in Beaufort. Because of his connection to Henry McKee, Smalls was allowed “to go places and do things others couldn’t do. That could cause problems with blacks . . . and could be a dangerous thing with whites, as well,” said Michael Allen of the National Park Service’s Gullah/Geechee Cultural Heritage Corridor, which runs through South Carolina. The town of Beaufort maintained a 7 p.m. daily curfew for blacks, but on many occasions young Smalls ignored the bell and continued to play with white children. Several times, he was taken into custody. Henry McKee paid a fine to retrieve him, Moore said. When he was 10, his mother sent him to the plantation to learn the reality of slave life. He came back defiant, not willing to comply, as she had hoped. “He acted as if he could do what the white children did, and that frightened her,” Moore said. Worried that her son would suffer consequences for his bold behavior, Polite asked McKee to rent out Smalls at age 12 to work in nearby Charleston. Each week, he was given $1 of his wages; the rest went to the McKees. He supplemented his income by purchasing cheap candy and tobacco and reselling them. At age 18, Smalls met Hannah Jones, an enslaved hotel worker who had two daughters. He sought permission to marry and live with her in an apartment in Charleston, Moore said. “He was smart enough to know that at any moment, she and any children they had might be sold, so he asked her enslaver,” who agreed, Moore said. Smalls became skilled at working on ships, eventually advancing to the position of pilot. In 1861, he was hired to work on a steamer called the Planter, which was used to transport cotton to ships headed to Europe. But once the Civil War started, the Confederates seized it for use as an armed transport vessel. Smalls knew how to navigate. He knew that the white crew trusted him. He had his eye on freedom, and all he needed was an opportunity. “They were going to seize the ship,” said Lawrence Guyot, a black-history expert in Washington. “It was dangerous. It was daring. It was unprecedented. And when they accomplished it, it was used to demonstrate that blacks could be brave and strategic in pulling off military maneuvers. Moore, a retired professor, pointed out that “a lot is said about [Smalls’s] patriotism, but it was not simply patriotism that led him to act. Smalls had sought to purchase his wife, his two young children and his wife’s daughters, but the price of $800 was too steep. In the early hours of May 13, 1862, the Planter’s crew took an unapproved furlough into town, leaving Smalls, 23, and several other black crew members aboard. Wearing a captain’s coat and hat and taking care to hide his black face, Smalls steered the ship toward a rendezvous spot to pick up the men’s families. “It was really dangerous because they were flying the Confederate flag,” Moore said. “They made a decision that they wouldn’t be taken alive. . . . Through Charleston Harbor and past several Confederate lookouts, the ship steamed. Smalls signaled at the appropriate points, as he’d seen the captain do. By dawn, the Planter had reached the federal blockade of the harbor. The crew lowered the Confederate flag and hoisted a white sheet that Hannah had brought from the hotel where she worked, Moore said. “One of the most heroic and daring adventures since the war commenced was undertaken and successfully accomplished by a party of negroes in Charleston,” trumpeted the June 14, 1862, edition of Harper’s Weekly. Commodore S.F. DuPont, the commander of the federal fleet barricading Fort Sumter, in Charleston Harbor, wrote to the Department of the Army that Smalls provided information “of the utmost importance” to the Union, such as the location of mines he had helped lay in the harbor while working for the Confederacy, news accounts show. This May marks the 150th anniversary of the seizure of the Planter. A commemoration is scheduled for May 12-13 in Charleston. “Somebody should make a movie about this guy,” said Frank Smith, founding director of the District’s African American Civil War Memorial Museum, which includes an exhibit about Smalls. Smalls became a ship pilot for the Union, serving as a volunteer until he was commissioned as a second lieutenant in Company B of the 33rd Regiment, U.S. Colored Troops. He fought in 17 battles and is credited with recruiting 5,000 blacks. He was later designated a major general in the South Carolina militia. In April 1865, Smalls returned to Beaufort and the McKee house, which he had purchased in a tax sale, using part of a $1,500 appropriation he received for taking the Planter. Back home, he was reunited with his mother — and one of his former owners. “Mrs. McKee, after the war was over, came wandering to the house one day,” Moore said. “Because of her dementia, she didn’t realize the house was no longer hers. . . . Smalls, who had learned to read and write while serving in the military, went into business and then politics. He served in both houses of the South Carolina Legislature and in 1874 was elected to the U.S. House of Representatives, beating a white Democrat in a district that was almost 70 percent black. But his later years were plagued by racism as white-supremacist Democrats stepped up efforts to unseat Reconstruction legislators. He was accused of bribery but later cleared, historical accounts show. In his personal life, Smalls lost a son in infancy and Hannah in 1883. Seven years later, at the age of 51, he married Annie Wigg, who bore him a second son, William Robert. Annie died a few years later. Smalls himself died in 1915 at what is now called the the Robert Smalls House, at 511 Prince Street in Beaufort. It is listed on the National Register of Historic Places and is currently for sale for $1.2 million. Other structures and streets have been named for Smalls. The African American Museum in Philadelphia is currently displaying “The Life and Times of Congressman Robert Smalls: A Traveling Exhibition.” The highest honor, though, was the commissioning in 2007 of the Maj. Gen. Robert Smalls, an Army logistics support vessel, in a ceremony at Baltimore’s Inner Harbor attended by several of his descendants. It is the only Army ship named for an African American. Moore said Smalls’s direct descendants number about 75, the youngest of whom is her 3-month-old granddaughter, Maya Helen Jenkins. Moore’s son, Michael, 49, the chairman of Glory Foods, which sells Southern-style dishes, said his great-great-grandfather’s story is an inspiration for his four young sons, as it was for him. As a child, he said, he would search bookstores for books about Smalls. “I didn’t think about Robert Smalls as history,” he said. “I thought of him as family. “The thing that I’m proudest of is his mind-set that he was going to be free, when he had no rational or logical reason to think that he would be. It was all or nothing.",2012/02/23,snopes,1

That's why a cartoon from 1956 decided to take things to the next level by killing not his body, but his soul.Continue Reading BelowContinue Reading BelowAdvertisementThe cartoon starts with Tom sitting in the middle of a train track with the clear intention of letting the train run over him as Jerry's suave narration states that ""in a few minutes it'll all be over"" and that ""it's better this way.""Pictured: Adele's cat.We then flash back to reveal the reason of Tom's suicidal despair: a dame.Tom instantly falls in love with her and they have some tender moments together (as far as we can tell, because her expression never changes), but the floozy ends up leaving him the moment she spots another cat with more money.

Marquez ignored them which prompted calls and shouts that he was a racist.Marquez left the establishment after eating, but allegedly sustained a sudden blow to the back of his head outside the McDonald’s, which knocked him unconscious. When he woke up, his pants were ripped and wallet gone, which contained $400 in cash, three credit cards, his VA medical card, school identification, metro card and driver’s license.“I remember this group of teens harassing me while I was eating, they surrounded my table and kept on asking me ‘Do you believe black lives matter,'” Marquez told The Daily Caller News Foundation. “Then they started calling me a racist. I can’t recall if they were saying anything else to me at this moment because the blow to my head really screwed up my memory.”DeAnthony Mason, manager of the McDonald’s, reviewed security footage and told Marquez in a phone call Saturday that when he left the restaurant a teen with a white shirt struck him on the side of the head, knocking him unconscious. The other teens then converged on his incapacitated body, taking his belongings. The head blow Marquez sustained left his memory dazed, but Mason’s review of security footage helped him piece together what occurred.Upon regaining consciousness, Marquez found a cab driver willing to drive him to his apartment across from American University, where he attends school. Workers in the lobby called the police on his behalf, who took him to George Washington Hospital where he was evaluated for several hours. Medical documents obtained by TheDCNF show Marquez was treated for head trauma and an eye contusion.Credit card transactions reviewed by TheDCNF reveal that the assailants charged over $115 on his various credit cards at a liquor store, Five Guys and Walmart. Mason, the McDonald’s store manager told Marquez that police have been looking for the group of teens for a previous incident.“I believe this was a hate crime and I was targeted because of my skin color,” Marquez told TheDCNF. “Too many of these types of attacks have been happening against white people by members of the black community and the majority of the main stream media refuses to report on it.”Marquez served eight years active duty in the Marines between 2003 and 2011 in Iraq and Afghanistan as a Rifleman and Scout Sniper. He received the Bronze Star for valor during his first deployment after he carried the body of his slain team leader from combat following an ambush during the Battle of Fallujah.“When I was in the Marine Corps, I served with people from many different backgrounds, ethnicities, religions, and races,” Marquez told TheDCNF. “Like all Marines, I fought for the freedom of all Americans and not just one particular group.”Marquez was also involved in the infamous fire fight dubbed “Hell House” in Fallujah. He and a fellow Marine, Dane Shaffer, pulled out four Marines who were stuck in a house after an insurgent ambush. A picture taken of them pulling Sgt Maj Brad Kasal out of battle served as the inspiration for a famous war memorial of Iraq located in California, reports The Los Angeles Times. Marquez is pictured on the left side holding Kasal by his right arm.Officer Anthony Hector of the Metropolitan Police Department is currently investigating the alleged assault. TheDCNF reached out to the MPD for comment but no further details could be provided at this time. Marquez described roughly 5 black assailants including one female, ages 16 to 21.Marquez told TheDCNF, “I really think this group of teens is dangerous and will do this type of thing again if they are not caught.”",2016/02/15,snopes,1

The classification is offered to charitable, religious and educational organizations that operate as nonprofits. Under the Obama administration IRS political appointees illegally targeted conservative groups, either making them wait up to seven years for tax-exempt status or denying their application altogether. Judicial Watch uncovered that scandal and has obtained piles of government records showing how the IRS illegally colluded with another federal agency to single out groups with conservative-sounding terms such as patriot and Tea Party in their titles when applying for tax-exempt status.In the meantime, leftist groups like the Satan club got fast tracked. The principle goal of establishing the Satan clubs in public schools throughout Washington State appears to be to counter existing enterprises operated by a Christian-based group. Documents obtained by Judicial Watch include the process of establishing an after-school Satan club at Point Defiance Elementary in Tacoma. The entity behind the club is a nonprofit called Reason Alliance, which is based in Somerville, Massachusetts, and operates in Washington State as the Satanic Temple of Seattle. Its director, Lilith X. Starr, established the Point Defiance Elementary Satanic club, the records show. In its application the club states that its purpose is character development and that adult instructors are vetted by the Satanic Temples Executive Ministry. Children ages 5-12 will develop basic critical reasoning, character qualities, problem solving and creative expression, according to the Satanic Temple filings included in the documents. The club logo is a pencil with devils horns. Records obtained by Judicial Watch from the Treasury Department show that the Satanic cult applied for tax-exempt status on October 21, 2014 and received it on October 31, 2014.The parent permission forms ask for the name of the childs church and pastor, the records show. They also reveal that Starr, the Seattle Satanic Temple director, told Tacoma School District Superintendent Carla Santorno that the clubs are led by caring Satanists and each child receives a membership card. Starr also tells the superintendent that the effort to establish after-school Satan clubs in Tacoma schools is in direct response to the Christian-based Good News Clubs operating in campuses throughout the district. This ignited concern among some Tacoma district officials, the records show. In one electronic mail exchange, Tacoma Schools official Andrea O-Brien-Henley sends colleague Paul Koch a citation from the Satanic Temples website noting that the temple only wants to establish after-school Satan clubs in school districts with Christian Good News Clubs. OBrien-Henley notes that its odd that the Satanic Temple only targets schools that have Good News Clubs, writing to hear colleague: If they really want to get their message out to kids it seems kind of odd that they would only be targeting schools with a Good News Club; one would think that they would want to start clubs anywhere there is an *interest* in them.Heres the citation that OBrien-Henley forwarded to fellow school district official Koch from the Satanic Temples website: How do I start an After School Satan Club in my school district? If there isnt a chapter of The Satanic Temple near you, but youre interested in starting and After School Satan Club in your school district, please contact The Satanic Temple. Please keep in mind that the Satanic Temple is not interested in operating After School Satan Clubs in school districts that are not already hosting the Good News Club. However, The Satanic Temple ultimately intends to have After School Satan Clubs operating in every school district where the Good News Club is represented.In another exchange, the Executive Director of Communications for the Tacoma School District, Dan Voelpel, expresses concern to colleagues that people will confuse the school districts message of tolerance toward the Satan Club with tolerance toward alleged hate-related activities around the country in the wake of the presidential election. In the records the principal of Point Defiance Elementary reveals that, two weeks after the Satan club was launched, no one had signed up for it. The fact remains however, that the IRS fast-tracked a deranged Satanic cult to operate as a nonprofit in taxpayer-funded elementary schools. Toward The Past: Leftist Fight Club at Public Fla.

Pete Sessions in the March 4 Republican primary, acknowledges the mistake. She told police then, and repeated recently, that she was talked into shoplifting by a friend.“Like an idiot, I went along for the ride,” Pierson said in a recent interview.She and the other woman were accused of trying to lift nine pieces of women’s clothing from a J.C. Penney store in Plano. They stuffed the clothes into shoe boxes in a clumsy, failed heist.According to a Plano police report, Pierson said she and the woman with her, Laura Elizabeth Nelson, told police they needed the clothes for jobs they were trying to obtain.Pierson told police she was “scared at first and did not want to go through with it.”Pierson exited the store with four items of clothing in a shoe box inside her shopping bag. They were valued at $168. The report said Pierson had her young son with her when the incident occurred.She was booked into the Plano City Jail. She eventually pleaded no contest to the charges and received deferred adjudication.“That’s what the attorney guy told me to do,” she said. “My defense was as good as I could afford.”Pierson, a tea party leader from Garland, said she knew her background would be open for scrutiny if she decided to take on Sessions, the powerful incumbent.Pierson says the incident helped turn her life around, showing her that mistakes often come with consequences.And the 37-year-old says the shoplifting charge was nothing compared with what could have happened in her life.Pierson says she was born to a 15-year-old mother and grew up exposed to the wrong crowd, folks involved in gangs and other unsavory activities. An early marriage lasted just three months.“I’m surprised I made it out,” Pierson said.Pierson said Sessions’ supporters are mounting a smear campaign, but added that she has nothing to hide.A Sessions spokesman declined to comment on the arrest. Sessions has said he’s never been arrested.Pierson says she’s willing to discuss her shoplifting charge, and other issues, with Sessions, chiding her opponent for refusing to consent to a public debate before the primary.“Why don’t we both meet up in a public forum and talk about it?” she said.Follow Gromer Jeffers Jr. on Twitter at @gromerjeffers.View Comments",2014/02/14,snopes,1

Also, has anyone at the FBI seen the film?” But the FBI has remained firm in their stance. “The Bureau will not bend to the will of those who choose to be linked to domestic terrorist organizations,” iterated Michael P.

Hillary Rodham Clinton (D-N.Y.), faced with multimillion-dollar houses to furnish here and in suburban New York, left the White House yesterday with an unprecedented $190,027 worth of gifts received over the last eight years. In their financial disclosure forms, the Clintons reported a variety of assets and receipts, including ""over $1 million"" in a Citibank personal account in New York; blind trusts, insurance policies and some common stock worth more than $1 million; and the payment of $1.05 million in legal fees by the Clinton Legal Expense Trust. Bill Clinton continues to owe ""between $1 million and $5 million"" to each of two law firms, Williams and Connolly and Skadden, Arps, Slate, Meagher & Flom, resulting primarily from his defense in House and Senate impeachment proceedings, along with a number of other investigations. Many of the gifts the Clintons are taking with them are from Hollywood figures, Democratic donors and a wide array of friends and associates, including his Georgetown University classmates. Most of the gifts are artworks, flatware, furniture, china and rugs for a couple who for nearly two decades have not had a home of their own but now suddenly have two large houses, one in Northwest Washington, the other in Chappaqua, N.Y. The Clintons received, for example, five gifts of china ranging in value from $2,110 from Jill and Ken Iscol, of Pound Ridge, N.Y. -- two of Sen. Clinton's new constituents -- to $5,000 from Mr. and Mrs. Bill Brandt of Winnetka, Ill. Actor-actress couple Ted Danson and Mary Steenburgen of Los Angeles spent $4,787 for china, but they didn't quite match the $4,920 that movie director and producer Steven Spielberg and his wife, actress Kate Capshaw, paid for the china they gave the Clintons. Altogether, the Clintons reported receiving $21,819 worth of china. The Clintons will have no problem with silver and flatware for their guests in the future: They received five gifts of flatware worth a total of $17,966, including $4,944 worth of settings from Ghada Irani of Los Angeles and $4,967 worth from Edith Wasserman of Beverly Hills. One of the biggest gifts was from Steve Mittman of New York, who gave the Clintons two sofas, an easy chair and ottoman worth $19,900. That was more than double the value of the china cabinet, travel humidor, chandelier and copy of Abraham Lincoln's Cooper Union speech, together worth $9,683, from Mr. and Mrs. Walter Kaye, of New York. In addition, the Clintons left the White House with $52,021 worth of furniture, $71,650 in artworks and three carpets valued at $12,282. Bill Clinton's 1968 class at Georgetown University gave the former president and new senator a basket by artist Dale Chihuly said to be worth $38,000, and Chihuly gave the couple a $22,000 glass sculpture. In addition to the home furnishings, the most common gift given to the Clintons was golf equipment. Ten people gave drivers, putters and other golf paraphernalia worth $300 to $650. Actor Jack Nicholson gave Clinton a $350 driver. Actor Sylvester Stallone gave the couple boxing gloves. In seven previous years, the most the Clintons had reported receiving in gifts was $23,602 in 1999. Clinton's predecessor in the White House, George Bush, listed $52,853 in gifts in 1992.

Britain's Prince Harry, right, and former U.S. President Barack Obama at the Invictus Games in Toronto on September 29. Mark Blinch/Reuters When the Duke and Duchess of Cambridge were married, in 2011, the Obamas were left off the guest list because of the added security costs of protecting the president. The day of the wedding, thousands of Britons took the day off, and about 1,900 guests attended the ceremony in Westminster Abbey in central London. The Obamas traveled to the U.K. less than a month later for an official state visit. Since Obama is no longer president, he doesnt require as extensive a security detail as he once did.If Trump were to appear at Prince Harrys wedding in spring 2018, it would likely spark protests. When Prime Minister Theresa May offered Trump a state visit early this year, polls showed that 2 million people intended to take part in a protest against him. The risk of embarrassment, were such a protest to occur at a royal wedding, might put the couple off inviting such a controversial figure.Instead of a state visit, Trumps trip to the U.K., scheduled for early 2018, has been cast as a working trip where he will not meet the queen. In January, sources said Trump wanted to go one better than Obamas state visit and play golf with Queen Elizabeth II at Balmoral Castle.Read more: Melania Trump went bananas when Ivana Trump called herself 'first lady'The Obamas have forged a close relationship with Prince Harry.

It must remain so here in Australia.“Outside of this, all offenses against children must be reported to the authorities, and we are absolutely committed to doing so.”“We understand the significance of religious confession – in particular, the inviolability of the confessional seal to people of some faiths, particularly the Catholic faith”, said the report. “However, we heard evidence of a number of instances where disclosures of child sexual abuse were made in religious confession, by both victims and perpetrators.”We are satisfied that confession is a forum where Catholic children have disclosed their sexual abuse and where clergy have disclosed their abusive behavior in order to deal with their own guilt.”Archbishop Hart, who’s also the President of the Australian Catholic Bishops Conference, argued that the confessional seal should remain protected from the law, saying in a statement: “It is a fundamental part of the freedom of religion, and it is recognized in the law of Australia and many other countries. It must remain so here in Australia.”Outside of this, all offenses against children must be reported to the authorities, and we are absolutely committed to doing so.”Independent reports: Asked on Tuesday if he would rather go to prison than breach the seal of confession, he told ABC Radio Melbourne:“I’ve said that I would.”I believe that this is an absolutely sacrosanct communication of a higher order.”“I would go to extreme lengths outside of the confessional to make sure that the law was observed. “But there are some matters which are of a higher order, things to do with God.”His stance was backed by other high-profile clerics, including his Brisbane counterpart Mark Coleridge and priest and lawyer Frank Brennan, who he said he would “conscientiously refuse to comply with the law” if it was changed.Writing in the Sydney Morning Herald, Father Brennan suggested requiring clerics to report abuse allegations would make children less safe because it “may take away the one possibility that a sex offender will repent and turn himself in”.But lawyer Vivian Walker, who has represented child sex abuse victims, welcomed the commission’s recommendations. “I think it’s about time the Catholic Church was dragged out of the dark ages,” she said. “We can no longer think about sexual offending against children as some kind of forgivable sin.”In its submission to the commission, the Catholic Church’s Trust Justice and Healing Council argued requiring priests to disclose information heard during confession would undermine freedom of religion.“The whole concept of confession in the Catholic Church is built on repentance, forgiveness, and penance,” said Frances Sullivan, the council’s chief executive.”Part of this forgiveness process, certainly in the case of a child sex-abuser, would normally require they turn themselves in to the police.”But the commission’s report stressed:“The right to practice one’s religious beliefs must accommodate civil society’s obligation to provide for the safety of all and, in particular, children’s safety from sexual abuse.”Reporting information relevant to child sexual abuse to the police is critical to ensuring the safety of children.”Australia’s Parliament will decide whether to enact the changes contained in the report.Archbishop Hart’s predecessor at the Diocese of Melbourne, Cardinal George Pell, is due to face trial on multiple sex charges later this year.236.4k",2017/08/20,snopes,1

""I will put all my effort into it, and I will support my man,"" she said recently. ""She's popular, she's brilliant, she's a wonderful woman,"" says Trump with uncharacteristic understatement. And who are we to disagree? Not only does she manage to keep a man fabled for his erections (the latest is the Trump World Tower on New York's First Avenue) on the right flight path, but she's also fluent in four languages. Very handy for those summit meetings. ""I'm going to do everything I can do see that regular Americans can fly as high as their wings will take them,"" says Trump. He's got our vote.

Such a pardon is unlikely as President Trump encouraged the prosecution of Cheney in the waning days of the 2016 Presidential campaign.Cheney had publicly endorsed Trump for president, but it was not enough to avoid a prosecution under President Trump's revolutionary ""fair and balanced"" justice system. ""Just like Fox News,"" the President quipped.""We focused on jailing Cheney in order to attract Bernie Sanders supporters,"" confided Kellyanne Conway, former Trump campaign manager. ""And it worked. Despite all the mud thrown at us, we were able to rig our own rigged election. There was so much rigging going on, you could hang Christmas lights from it.""Indeed, cries of ""Jail Chey-nee, Jail Chey-nee"" thundered through crowds at Trump rallies and events. ""Hillary Clinton had no response because we threatened her, too,"" explained Conway, who is now President Trump's Surgeon General. ""There were those who complained about our threatening to jail government officials"" said Conway, ""but their pleas fell on deaf ears.""""They didn't realize jailing government officials can cut both ways,"" Conway said pointedly. Five others were convicted along with Cheney, and their sentences were upheld as well.Former President George W. Bush was granted immunity in direct negotiations with President Trump. ""I got a great deal,"" Trump bragged, ""We got Bush's testimony against Cheney, plus he got me Salma Hayek's phone number.""Earlier, Trump campaigned on a ""Lock Her Up' pledge that targeted Secretary Clinton. After the election, though, Trump never prosecuted Clinton, a former friend who attended three of President Trump's four weddings.Clinton was not invited to most recent ceremony when Trump wed First Lady Salma Hayek. ""Not being invited was punishment enough for Hillary and Bill,"" President Trump told People Magazine. ""Bill likes to 'kiss' the bride, you know,"" the President said, making tiny air quotes with his miniature hands.The vote on the Supreme Court was 5-3. The five justices who voted to uphold Cheney's sentence were Sonia Sotomayor and Trump appointees Donald Trump Jr., Eric Trump, Chris Christie and Ivanka Trump. Vladimir Putin did not vote even though he has been confirmed by the Senate because his citizenship application is still pending. Lawyers saw no conflict when a court packed with President Trump appointees approved a conviction urged by Candidate Trump. ""Its what kids do for their dad,"" beamed the President.Cheney, 78, contends all the charges against him are politically motivated. ""Things will change if we ever have a Republican president again,"" Cheney wrote on a note secretly smuggled from solitary confinement. ""Sad.""Prison will only be a minor inconvenience for Cheney. As a result of a 2002 deal in which Cheney sold his soul to the devil in exchange for not being impeached over 9/11, Cheney no longer ages.He hopes to be president, as he puts it, ""Eventually.""",2016/10/23,snopes,1

The athlete did not wear a cover and was therefore disqualified.“All teams are informed of the advertising policy at a technical meeting prior to competition so it wasn’t as if they had not been reminded about the rules.”Craig, who has cerebral palsy, won two gold medals at the 2012 Paralympic Games in London, where he set two world records at the age of 15.

https://www.snopes.com/fact-check/hillary-clinton-goldman-sachs/,the transcript of hillary clinton's speech to finance giant goldman sachs was leaked and published online. see example( s ),false,"['clinton', ' goldman sachs', ' hillary clinton', ' speech']",http://www.counterpunch.org/,http://www.counterpunch.org/2016/02/26/hillary-clintons-speech-to-goldman-sachs/,2016/02/27,"by K.J. NohSatire Alert!The following is a leaked transcript of Hillary Clinton’s first speech to Goldman Sachs delivered on 6/04/2013. Two other speeches are also rumored to be in circulation awaiting publication. This is the full transcript. Secretary Clinton received $225,000 for this speech. The speech has not been confirmed or authenticated.CLINTON: Thank you. Thank you so much. Thank you very much, Lloyd [Blankfein], and thanks to everyone at Goldman Sachs for welcoming me today. I’m delighted to be back among friends, colleagues, collaborators, supporters, kindred spirits…Let me jump right in. You know, over the past few months, there have been popular concerns about an economy that still isn’t delivering for the majority of Americans. It’s not “delivering” the way that they feel it should, that they feel entitled to. Most Americans that you speak to, speak a populist rhetoric that claims it is stacked for those at the top, that those of you here have it too good.(Laughter)But we know the hopes that the little people have for their future — things like school, job, food, clothing on their backs– all of those little things would not be possible without your leadership and innovation. Since the time of the Medicis, even before, and the financing of the first joint stock companies in the transatlantic slave trade, we know that finance and banking is what makes our capitalist economy not just grow but tick…Previous generations of Americans built this economy and a middle class on a collective illusion: that they do productive work, this creates wealth, and that this builds the economy. We all know how misguided that is. We know that it’s really due to your investing, credit, and economic stewardship, that they have been able to work at all, that they are able to put food on their tables. It’s due to you and other banking, trading, investment houses that we have an economy that works at all. You are why we are a truly 21st century economic power.(Applause)You, Lloyd, and your colleagues, have been instrumental in that. People say you are overpaid or even parasitic, parasites on the economic body, and they quote a long line of seemingly “unethical behavior”. They equate with you everything that is wrong and immoral with Capitalism, they charge that you have acted ruthlessly and unethically, “rigging every major market bubble since the Great Depression”.(Hissing)But I—contrary to populist, hysterical demonizing–firmly believe that what you do is essential and critical: you help allocate our investment, direct our economic development, hedge risks, and create power, policies, and alliances in ways that make our country stronger, richer, more powerful, more innovative, competitive, and yes, more “democratic”. You underwrite our elections and our political process—taking on the huge cost of enabling democratic dialogue at its biggest, broadest capacity. Your tireless work adds true value, and without you, we would still be struggling helplessly against industrial powerhouses in Asia and across the world trying to compete with them on the level of industry, technology, innovation, and hard work, at which they would beat us hands down. It’s your financial innovation, your speculative tools, which allow us new ways of creating value without sweat or struggle, that gives us the competitive advantage. It’s this vision, this technological innovation, this financial wizardry, this is what makes America great and powerful.(Applause)For decades, people have argued that if we give more wealth to those at top by cutting taxes and letting you and other corporations write the own rules, it will trickle down, it will trickle down to everyone else. And it has! My speech here is an example!(Cackles, Waves Check) (Laughter).But seriously, I believe that the work of Goldman Sachs is critical for us, and without you, America would be a faint shadow of its current greatness. Your work in innovating finance, in creating new sources of wealth and investment, your tireless efforts stimulating the creation of new financial instruments, in lobbying politicians, in monopolizing the treasury and cabinet, in setting and binding the parameters of financial regulation that allows fluidity and flexibility in investment and speculation, this allows us to create wealth—almost out of thin air. It’s this alchemy, this genius, this Midas touch—which is one of the most under-appreciated and under-acknowledged contributions in modern economic history.(Applause)It’s fair to say that you have transformed the solid, clunky, friction-laiden trading of traditional commodity speculation into responsive, intelligent, liquid flows, that have vaporized every barrier and transformed into an expansive, responsive, endlessly expanding gas that fills every atom of our productive economic space that generates immeasurable value everywhere it goes, and everything it touches. Who cares that it’s a little chaotic or “unethical”? That it seems tied to every financial scandal and crisis and economic catastrophe in history? Not me. “Creative Destruction” is all part of the game, and you are masters of it.(Applause)Some will say that you are simply parasitic on those who labor at menial physical production—these are people who still subscribe to 18 Century notions of value production–and that you skim off profit without doing anything meaningful or of value. Those people are misguided: we know that if money never sleeps, that’s because you keep it awake! You have—if I may use a metaphor–injected money with caffeine, Adderal, crack, meth, with LSD so that it can dance the crazy dance and grow a crazy thousand psychedelic feet tall in a rainbow minute! Money was a lazy b*tch, until you put it to work! And look how it works! Look how it grows! Materializes out of nowhere!(Waves check again, dances, cackles).Some people have said that it was your irresponsible financial engineering, risk-taking, and profit-seeking, that led to the 2008 crash; that you shorted your own toxic mortgages in the most brazen securities fraud in financial history, dynamiting and imploding the global economy; and that the exorbitant bonuses paid from tax payer money, the financial bailouts, the non-prosecutions created moral hazard, rewarded avarice, incompetence, corruption and vice. You and I know it is nothing of the sort. As leaders, innovators, captains of finance, you will always be subject of the jealous resentment, the petty tantrums of the unwashed masses, the insolvent, the irresponsible, the invidious, the losers. They will envy you, your successes, they will despise you, but they secretly want to be like you!(Laughter)As you know, my husband tried very hard to change the culture of this misbegotten underclass, by kicking them off the government teat, by poisoning their milk with harsh, bitter regulation, and by disciplining them with the most arbitrary, racist, punitive, devastating criminal laws in US history, laws which Richard Nixon, the Southern strategists, the slave catchers, could only have dreamed of. He also passed NAFTA, which told them in no uncertain terms that they needed to discipline themselves as workers, and learn to be competitive in the global sweatshop, or face certain extinction. But they have not learned their lesson.(Hissing)The effects prove themself. Under President Clinton — I like the sound of that!— America saw the longest, most prodigious reaming of the undesirable classes in our history, putting them firmly in their places. And they loved it! He felt their pain! And relished it! Because he was inflicting it!(Applause)And I will too!(Applause)Now today — today, another capitalist crisis looms, bigger and more dangerous than 2008, and again we hear sentimental cries for populist reform. I believe we have to stave off these demands to reform the banking and the financial system, and restructure the economy more equitably. You can’t build an economy without the smart people—the Titans and Gods of Finance—like you–to direct the economy, and for the smart people to do their work, you need to be rewarded for your efforts, and you need a free hand to exercise your brilliance.(Applause)Books like “The Spirit Level” and organizations working for equality, certain politicians, spew a ridiculous myth of populism and the benefits of equality. But the fact is, we can’t create profitable businesses without exploitation, and we can’t grow the economy without speculation and inequality, and we certainly can’t boost our economy into the stratosphere without allowing you to exercise your amazing financial intelligence and acumen in fiscal number-crunching, speculation, numbers-running and fraud!(Applause)Just think of this: can you imagine a football game without gambling? It would be dull, mind-numbing—who would watch steroid-addled jocks rut and slam into each other mindlessly without having put down money on the outcome? Who would pay the huge salaries for these vapid idiots? It’s only because you have bet on the outcome that people become excited about the sport: it becomes life-and-death-thrilling! It becomes paint-your-face-get-shit-faced exciting! Act-stupid-exciting! That’s what you do: you add excitement, thrill, value, and enthusiasm to the dull, dirty job of growing the economy, you make the game exciting, sexy, which draws more money into the game, the casino, that expands the excitement, grows the customer base, develops the economy, and that’s priceless! You speculate, stimulate, titillate, dynamize, satyriasize the entire economy! I am such a fan! Go Goldman Sachs!(Does little cheerleading number, complete with hand gestures)Gooold-Maaan-Sachs!(Applause)Let’s tell the truth: America is struggling—despite the endless fabrication about “the recovery”– because we are not yet running the way we should. Banks are still over regulated. It’s over-regulation that creates financial catastrophe! Despite your huge paychecks and squirreled away assets, I know that you are worried: worried that some “socialist” demagogue might come along and confiscate it all and put you all in jail. With president Obama, you were in good hands: he’s one of us. (Good thing you ponied up $981K for his campaign). He took good care of you, had your back, covered your financial rear. But populist sentiment is rising up again, more strongly than before, and the unwashed masses are full of resentment, anger, jealousy. They are angry that they don’t have jobs, that they are in debt, that they can’t scrape a living together, even though they are working, 2,3,4 jobs to put shelter over their heads. That their children are starving. That they cannot see a light at the end of the tunnel. They are angry about the 100 million people driven into the brink of starvation and the global food riots that they claim you caused with your commodity futures speculation. The $5Trillion of value lost from the markets that they claim you collapsed. The millions who lost their homes and are now on the verge of homelessness. The trillions funneled to you in loans, write-offs, bribes to keep the system going. Even when I was working for Barry (Goldwater), I felt that same irrational resentment. Now it’s at an all time high. Irresponsible single mothers, uneducated immigrants, lead-drinking ghetto-strutters, homeless, crying, babies, starving senior citizens, obnoxious, entitled African Americans who object to having bullets pumped into their bodies by police: all these people are angry, entitled, and making noise, and they are endangering our democracy and economy, our greatness.(Hissing)I hear this everywhere I go. A single mother, with three children—wants to go to college, find enjoyable, well-paid work and also enjoy the emotional luxuries of motherhood—all at the same time. Everyone feels entitled to everything. She even wants housing. Now even I couldn’t do all these things, despite my incredible privilege and intelligence. But they want it all, now. Three children?(Booing)A grandmother, playing with children—it makes her happy like a cow, but she still feels entitled to be paid. Because she wants to feed her drug habit, she wants to sell them for more money….she wants it all!(Booing)A student, with an unmarketable degree in women’s studies, specializing in medieval feminist villanelles, wants debt forgiveness, and a high-paid job putting her non-existent skills analyzing romance language texts to use and profit in a rewarding cause. She also wants a pony, a sensitive but dominant lover, a villa on the Riviera, and World Peace!(Cackles).(Laughter)Millions of working sad-sack Americans have similar fantasies. They want more money. More pay. Decent wages for hard work. They think it grows on trees. They think that money will grow and nuzzle up to them in their sleep, when they have no money-appeal. They think they can tax Other People’s Money to get what they want. They don’t realize Money has to be jacked up the ass, stuck in the veins with meth, dragged out and pimped to make more! You have figured out how to make your money work, turned it into a profit-generating prostitute! The future expected earnings of a profit-generating prostitute! That you’ve shorted! These people, idiots, all of them, they expect money to come to them! Without Scheming! Without reaming others! By working hard and being good! Like puppies and ponies! Like flowers after a downpour! Like the lilies of the valley! Like utopian visions of a drug-addled socialist!(Laughter)Wages need to be kept down, and people just need to work harder. Damn harder. At least as hard as Bill worked to keep Haiti down.(Applause)We must lower incomes for low-value working schmucks, so they give up on any notions of a middle-class life. But more than that, we must reduce the slick, unsustainable bigotry of expectation: the profit-sucking cage of entitlement, expectation, and imagination. We must drive income down steadily and siphon that surplus wealth to you, the captains of finance, so that we can build a strong economy that is innovative, powerful, that acknowledges and rewards your acumen…(Applause)And that will be my mission, from the first day I am president to the last. I…(Applause)I will get up every day thinking about you, the hard-working Wizards of Finance, Lords of Capital, Economic Giants of Innovation, Noble Titans that make us strong and powerful!(Applause)I came from a petit-bourgeois family with a drapery business that exploited workers to give me good middle-class life, a first-class education, and my incorrigibly elitist beliefs. It put me on third base, instead of striking out. As I try to steal home, I will be thinking about all the Wall Street bankers that I represented in New York and the “advice” that they gave me, and I will work with them—for you– to give them the maximum freedom to do what’s best for them. Because what’s best for Wall Street is what’s best for the US. What’s best for Goldman Sachs is what’s best for the planet. I promise to take on this challenge against the clamoring, whining, agitating babies demanding for major changes in our economy and the global economy, demanding for equity and justice. These demands are stupid beyond belief.(Laughter)As you know, advances in financial technology and global trade have created new areas of commercial activity and opened new markets for our exports. Too often policy wonks want to resort to protectionist measures because they don’t realize that these treaties are designed to suck wealth out of the third world and suck it into your portfolios. These people suffer from a lack of big-picture thinking. They believe that they are still going to be building widgets in a factory if it were not for the 1 billion Chinese stealing their jobs. They don’t understand that we are sucking the lifeblood out of both of the Chinese and all workers—the vampire squid with the blood funnel—creating value, wealth, growth!(Cackles)Today’s marketplace focuses on the short-term, instantaneous financial trading, and short-term earnings reports, and that’s just how it should be. Those who are struggling need to rent out their living rooms, garages, bathrooms, dog houses, sell trinkets on EBay, sell themselves, their time and their bodies in the gig economy. All of this creates exciting, dynamic extra wealth, which should go to you, the geniuses of the universe, because you are the ones driving this with your investments, speculations, deregulation, policy capture, and of course outright bribes. There’s no problem that a little more liberalization and deregulation can’t make better!(Takes out check and cackles)But all of these trends are temporary, and artificial, and unless we push really hard to make them happen, they won’t continue. The choices we make as a nation matter. The choices we make will set the stage for what American life will be like in this 21st century: will we have a nation of namby-pamby socialistic commies whining and demanding every little privilege while our nation crashes down around our ears, and we are reduced to becoming serfs for the Chinese? Or will we have a powerful country, bristling with guns and weapons, capable of putting everyone in their place? Capable of invading countries on a whim? Of unleashing chaos and violence gratuitously? Of violating a leader’s body orifices with sharp objects with impunity?(Cackles).Of manipulating the world economy on a dime, without sweating any labor?(Applause)As president, I will work with you to turn the tide of populism, to make these currents of change infeasible, impossible. We don’t hide from change; we subvert, hijack it, appropriate it.(Applause)But it will take money. Lots of it. This is a good start.(Waves check again, smiles, coyly).The measure of our success must be how much incomes rise for you, the elite, the 0.0001%, not some just arbitrary growth targets tethered to people’s unwarranted and undeserved notions of “equity”, and “justice”.(Applause)I want to see our economy work for the top, the leaders, the Gods, the Masters of the Universe like you. We’re not going to find all the answers we need in the playbooks of the past, we can’t go back to the policies of social equity that failed completely…Today is not 1968. The sixties are so over. And it’s not 1917. The Bolshies are so over. It’s not 1789. No more liberty, equality, fraternity. No more freedom fries. Non Merci! ça suffit! People need to accept the fact that finance capital is a reality, that the interests of the capital markets drives the world, that it can’t be turned back, and that it’s the final solution for all the challenges we face now, including the unending catastrophes that it’s creating, including the burning, fiery apocalyptic end of the planet.So today, I’m proposing an agenda to give you what you deserve, an agenda for unlimited financial deregulation, growth, wealth accumulation and concentration. It’s the least we can offer you given the undeserved contempt and abuse you’ve suffered over the past years.More concentration means more jobs and more new businesses catering to you. More jobs give people more opportunities to service you, toady up to you, vampire squid and all.(Waves check suggestively).Full employment is completely unnecessary, so 19th Century; the desperation of potential unemployment keeps people working hard to keep their jobs, so their productivity and toadying should be absolutely top notch! No more disrespect!We know that Finance creates most of the wealth in this country, so that has to be THE top priority.Let me tell you straight: I want to be the presidency of, by, for Goldman Sachs, and I mean it. I’ll make sure to line my cabinet with your people, like everyone else. Lloyd, name your position!(Wild Applause)And throughout the upcoming campaign, I’m going to be sending lots of dog-whistle messages about how to empower you with less red tape, less regulation, less taxes, easier access to free, risk-free money, simplification, easy access to me, all the while talking populist claptrap….(Takes out dog whistle and blows to utter silence)(Loud laughter)Don’t be thrown off by the populist rhetoric. You know that’s just how we play the game. You know I’m your gal…a Goldman Sachs gal….(Brushes check wistfully over lips)(Laughter)Just don’t tell anyone what I said….(Laughter)I’ll push for tax incentives to spur speculation, giving you loopholes that you can drive your jumbo private jet or yacht through! Show us how innovative, creative thinking you are!(Wild applause)And I know it’s not always how we think about this, but another engine of strong growth should be the TPP and the TTIP, and the TISA.(Applause)I want you to hear this. Creating a global neo-liberal enclosure of the entire world economy that pretends to be about “free trade” won’t do much for the total economy—perhaps a tiny percentage point of growth—but I guarantee it will line your pockets like nothing else. Think trillions in your coffers. Quadrillions, once we force all the Asian-Pacific economies to suspend their financial uptightness restricting wild casino gambling! Financial liberalization forced on Asia will result in Quadrillions! Bazillions! And remember, the house—that’s us—we write the rules—never loses!(Wild Applause)These are the new policies that will help change the world order. It’s not just about these United states, or even the Asia-Pacific that I’m pushing for in the Pacific Pivot. We need to change the planet, before the planet changes us, gets back at us for abusing it so deeply. It’s the planetary endgame, and we want to have a big blast before our toys are taken away….When I get started, we get our country moving in the direction that we want. Money that can channel more public and private funds to the top leadership—that’s you and me…(Applause)… channel those funds to finance and speculation!(Applause)So let’s built those faster trading algorithms and make sure they work faster, bigger, riskier, and trade sums larger than they have ever before!(Applause)And really, there’s no excuse not to make wilder, greater investments in speculative trading right now.(Wild applause)Our economy obviously runs on finance, and the time is long overdue to make America the ultimate financial superpower. Weapons of financial mass destruction? Bring them on! They are our weapons! Some may worry Finance may destroy millions of jobs, put billions into penury, kill billions of starvation, send the economy into a crazy tailspin, but it will make us—that’s you and me—rich and powerful beyond imagination. Let’s be real here. Isn’t that what matters?(Cackles)(Laughter)Let’s fund the mathematical research that spawns breathtakingly risky trading algorithms and creates entire new areas of fictitious capital, an equation to model every aspect of human greed and fantasy and desire! I can put my support behind that! A mathematical copula that really copulates the unwashed masses!(Laughter)(Wild Applause)I will set ambitious goals in all of these areas in the months ahead.But today, let me emphasize again, that I will institute the key ingredient of strong growth that often goes overlooked… I will break down all global non-tariff barriers so we can do what we did to our economy all over the world. We are equal opportunity crisis-makers!(Applause)Watch what I do, not what I say!(Lifts dog whistle to lips)(Loud laughter)We are in a global competition, as I’m sure you have noticed.I’m starting to repeat myself, but I’m on a roll.We can’t afford to leave finance on the benches. That’s exactly what we’re doing today with Glass-Steagall-type regulation. When we leave money on the bench, we not only shortchange its power, and we lose the game, and we shortchange our country and our future.The movement of hot, speculative money into real estate during the past 20 years was responsible for trillions funneled into your pockets. But that progress is beginning to stall out.Studies show that nearly this decline is happening because we’re trying to stop real fictitious growth, considering valorizing people over profits. What an absurdity!We should be making it easier for speculative finance to make money and innovate. To develop bubbles and create trillion dollar valuations out of thin air! And to short them at will! This is how we pump up our economy like a hydrogen bomb! Speculators who want to speculate without limit should be able to do so without worrying that they may find themselves inside a federal resort working on their abs and pecs.You know, last year –(Applause)You know, all this speculation adds up. And for you, it’s trillions every day. Now I am well aware that for far too long these practices have been challenged by socialistic demagogues.Well, those days are over.(Applause)Free speculation, and free money, no taxes, and no restrictions, here or anywhere else in the world: this is essential to our competitiveness and our growth and my ego! And I can do this in a way that doesn’t alarm or outrage the unwashed masses! As president, I’ll fight to put you first, just like I have my entire career. Just remember the dog whistle!(Lifts to whistle to lips)(Laughter)Just watch!(Applause)The trader who stands on his feet all day, shrieking his heart out, or the quant who is driving his synapses into overdrive trying to make an unforgiving algorithm match the fluctuations in a chaotically fibrillating market, or the hedge fund manager, who has loses sleep over the global economy, these people do not need regulation! They do not need a lecture! They do not need the planet’s animosity. They need more rewards, for the hard, crucial, essential, brilliant, world-changing work they are doing!(Applause)The truth is the current rules for our economy do not reward financial risk-taking enough. r(Applause)Alongside gutting taxes, it’s time to stand up to efforts across our country to restrict the power of finance, which has been proven again and again to destroy an economy, and make you sad….Socialist demagogues like Elizabeth Warren and Bernie Sanders have made their names stomping and vilifying you….(Hissing)I will fight back against these mean-spirited, misguided attacks. But I will do with subtlety and finesse and subterfuge! Just like when I was a Goldwater girl! Now I’m a Goldman Sach’s girl!(Rubs check suggestively)(Laughter)In the years leading up to the “crash”, financial firms innovated risk away, but regulators in Washington either could not or would understand this. I was alarmed when they took the punchbowl away.The current President Obama gave you and your colleagues 17 Trillion of free money, and endless zero-rate loans, but he still had to pretend to take you and your colleagues to the woodshed. Dodd-Frank. Sarbanes-Oxley. The return of Glass-Steagall. Other annoying, pesky legislation and regulations. Too many of you are bound and wrapped in red tape: shadow banking, money laundering, hedge funds, high-frequency trading, non- bank financing, interest rate manipulation, all done in the shadows, because of vicious, irrational regulations that marginalize and oppress you.(Hissing)Even when you have already pocketed the gains, and gotten away scott-free, there is social approbation, contempt, and this is painful, this is wrong. I feel your pain! On my watch this will all change. Over the course…(Applause)… over the course of my campaign, I will offer plans to unleash your endless creativity and risk-taking. I will make sure that you will not pay the price of those risks: I want to encourage you to take them. Just as limited liability allowed early capitalism to grow, back-stopping your risks will be my charge and duty. We’ll make sure that Wall Street and stock markets explode in growth for you!

Sadly, it's not. Ready for it?""Couples are turning extra IVF embryos into jewelry.""A website unironically named KidSpot says ""Couples are Turning Extra IVF Embryos into Jewelry.""After a six-year IVF journey to receive miracles Lachlan, 4, and 21-month-old twins Charlotte and William, Belinda and Shaun Stafford didn’t know what to do with their remaining embryos. Their babies. Donation wasn’t an option, the annual storage fee was an added financial strain, and disposing of them unimaginable.So when the NSW couple heard about Baby Bee Hummingbirds, an Australian company turning embryos into keepsake jewelley, they jumped at the chance. Now Ms Stafford has all of her babies with her every day – including seven embryos in her heart-shaped pendant worn close to her heart, always.The mom said the financial strain would be too much to keep the embryos alive in perpetuity so the couple considered planting the embryos in a garden. But she said they move too much and she couldn't bear to leave them behind. Hence, the necklace.In quotes that sound like a commercial for jewelry made from embryos, the mother said:“My embryos were my babies - frozen in time.“When we completed our family, it wasn’t in my heart to destroy them.“Now they are forever with me in a beautiful keepsake.”Amy McGlade, founder of Baby Bee Hummingbird, said that while they make thousands of keepsakes that include breast milk over placenta, they've made over 50 pieces of jewelry made of embryos in the past few years. “I don’t believe there is any other business in the world that creates jewellery from human embryos, and I firmly believe that we are pioneering the way in this sacred art, and opening the possibilities to families around the world,” she said.Did she just say ""sacred art?"" Make. It. Stop. The more I read the more horrified I became. But wait, it gets worse. According to the group's Facebook page, they're running a sale!The families we craft for are truly aware of the various world wide options for Embryos in storage.

It is our wish that we can have these pieces professionally photographed & used for our resources.EMBRYO15 This is the code. It only applies to pieces crafted with Embryos & will help raise much needed awareness.Here's a rule of thumb. Any time someone talks about ""extra"" humans, take a step back. (Yes Bill Nye, you too.)When I consider where we are as a culture and how confused we are, in the end it really is so simple. Do we believe God created each and every human being? Do we believe life is sacred? Not just important. Sacred. Priceless. (And fyi, priceless means you can't run a sale on it.)I understand the sorrow of failed pregnancies. The pain of the family featured in that article is real. I have held in my hands my own stillborn child. My heart breaks for those with failed pregnancies or those unable to have children.I know of a family that after several failed pregnancies opted for IVF and they now have a wonderful baby girl whom they adore. But now the mother is unable to carry children due to complications and they have these ""extra"" embryos frozen. They don't know what to do about them. Unfreeze them? Let them die? Keep them frozen? Heartbreaking decisions. I'm sure those who contact the company selling embryo necklaces are truly seeking solace. But healing comes from Christ, not a keepsake.There are no good solutions in cases like these for what to do with frozen embryos. Even when one of those solutions is on sale.View Comments",2017/05/04,snopes,1

https://www.snopes.com/fact-check/black-dot-campaign/,victims of domestic violence can effectively send out a secret signal for help by drawing black dots on their palms. see example( s ),Mixture,"['black dot', ' black dot campaign', ' domestic abuse', ' domestic violence', ' victims']",http://www.projectsanctuary.org/,http://www.projectsanctuary.org/about-us/in-the-news/the-black-dot-project-sanctuary-cited-in-internet-domestic-violence-awareness-campaign/,2015/09/14,"Project Sanctuary » About Us » In The News » The Black Dot: Project Sanctuary cited in Internet domestic violence awareness campaignThe Black Dot: Project Sanctuary cited in Internet domestic violence awareness campaignLast week, a well-intentioned Internet campaign swept through Facebook and other social media platforms, going viral in a matter of hours and garnering millions of hits.The “Black Dot” Campaign was founded as a way for victims of domestic abuse to silently signal another person – perhaps a family member or friend –that they are being abused.The signal consisted of drawing a small black dot on their hand and “flashing” the dot to someone who might be able to provide help. Photos of supporters displayed their hands sporting black dots, standing up for domestic violence victims.Though the Internet campaign was shared by millions – even supported by the likes of television personality Dr. Drew Pinsky, not everyone in the domestic violence community was convinced of the merits of this campaign.Like many others who work with domestic violence victims, Dina Polkinghorne, executive director of Project Sanctuary, weighed in on the project. What she didn’t expect was her comments spreading throughout the Internet, posting not only on Facebook, but reaching BuzzFeed – the massive news and entertainment site.Project Sanctuary was one of several agencies that addressed concerns about the campaign, honoring the intentions of the campaign organizers but suggesting that there are other, better, safer ways for domestic violence victims to reach out.In addition to the Ukiah Daily Journal, Polkinghorne was contacted by a London radio station for an interview. “We had no idea that our comments had gone viral until you contacted us,” Polkinghorne noted.Her comments, as well as the comments of other agencies and domestic violence victims sparked a second wave of interest in the campaign.“The Black Dot campaign is a very well-meaning idea, but a bad idea nonetheless. I believe that the woman who started the campaign is a survivor herself. The campaign is spurring conversations but there are better ways to go,” she explains. On its Twitter feed, Project Sanctuary explained that victims could be putting themselves at risk by drawing something on themselves that their abuser could see. “Another issue with the campaign is that not everyone you flash the black dot to is connected to social media,” she continues.“The campaign is getting a lot of attention, so abusers may also be aware of it. They might question why their partner would have the dot on their hand. A well-meaning family member could also see the dot, and inadvertently compound the violence,” she explains.“The Black Dot was a way to silently tell someone that you are in a domestic violence situation, but when would it be appropriate to use it? At the grocery store? At the doctor’s office? Someone who was being completely controlled would be told by the abuser that they want to be in the exam room, so the victim would not be able to tell their doctor that they were in a domestic violence situation.“Most medical professionals are highly trained to look for cues that might suggest someone was being abused. They would ask the alleged abuser to leave the room to have a confidential conversation, and the black dot would not be necessary.”Polkinghorne suggests that there are many ways for concerned friends and family to help a person whom they suspect might be in an abusive relationship.“If you’re a domestic violence victim and you are alone with a friend, you have an opportunity to say something to them,” Polkinghorne explains. “There are many options available.”“If someone suspects that a friend or family member are being abused, they can call Project Sanctuary. Because services are confidential, people sometimes think that they can’t call us and just talk. All staff have signed confidentiality agreements. We don’t even discuss cases among staff in order to protect the confidentiality of our clients. If people are concerned about local confidentiality, they can call any domestic violence agency or hotline.”In these conversations, says Polkinghorne, staff help the caller assess the problem and what friends and family can do to help. “We receive many calls from mothers who are concerned about their daughters or grandchildren. We discuss the red flags with them and suggest ways to help.”There are many “silent pleas for help,” says Polkinghorne, which, if observed can help caring family members provide support.“General warning signs include a person seeming overly afraid or anxious to please their partner, and going along with everything their partner says or does. Do they seem to check in too often with their partner? Do they constantly have to report their whereabouts and what they’re doing?”Other warning signs include receiving frequent, harassing phone calls from a partner, insufficient excuses for bruises and injuries, or missing school, work or social occasions. “If she’s wearing turtlenecks or other inappropriate clothing in the summer or if she wears sunglasses indoors, she could be covering up bruises or other injuries.”Another concern is if the victim seems to be restricted from socializing with family or friends, if the frequency of socialization has changed dramatically or if the victim rarely goes out without their partner. Limited access to money, cars or credit cards can indicate control issues. “More serious signs include the person appearing depressed, anxious or suicidal, or if their self-esteem has plummeted.”Often, those in abusive relationships are the last to see the warning signs for themselves, Polkinghorne explains.“Do you feel anxious around your partner? Do you try to please him or her to avoid being hurt or to ‘keep the peace?’ Are you criticized in front of others? Are you blamed for everything? Are you expected to report your whereabouts at all times? Are you threatened with harm or violence?”Sexual and physical abuse is probably the most blatant form of abuse. “Physical and sexual abusers threaten to kill you or your children. They force partners to have sex, purposefully make sexual activities painful, hit, push, hold partners down or cause others physical harm,” says Polkinghorne.But all abuse isn’t physical. Polkinghorne stresses that emotional abuse is far more insidious than physical abuse. “I can’t tell you the number of emotionally abused victims who say, ‘I wish he would have just hit me, because then it would have been over.’” The scars from emotional abuse are long-lasting and difficult to overcome.Abusive partners frequently switch between kind and hurtful behavior. They control the finances and make the majority of relationship decisions. They make you wait all the time and make you feel like something is wrong with you for being upset. They are jealous for no reason, make you feel powerless and minimize their abusive comments or behavior.”“If you suspect abuse, ask your friend or family member if something is wrong. Express your concern. Listen and offer your personal or professional help. Support your friend’s decisions and get information for yourself so you can be the best possible advocate.”Polkinghorne says creating a safety plan is one way that family and friends can help the abused person to begin an exit strategy. “It’s very scary to think about leaving an abusive relationship. Statistics bear out that the most dangerous time for people in domestic violence situations is when they leave the relationship. People ask us, ‘Why don’t people just leave the relationship?’ When the abuser holds the credit, the money, the keys, when the abuser’s name is on the lease and the victim has no job and their family lives in New York, what are their options? This is why a safety plan is important. Save money and ask a family member or a friend to hold it for you. Keep copies of important documents. Seek professional help and stay in contact with a trusted friend.”October is Domestic Violence Awareness Month. “Though the Black Dot Campaign may not be the perfect answer to help victims of domestic abuse, there is so much people can do to support their loved ones and help them find a way to a better life,” Polkinghorne concludes.For more information, visit Project Sanctuary on Facebook, on Twitter @p_sanctuary and online at http://www.projectsanctuary.org.",2015/10/09,snopes,1

The style is personal preference, and people who keep their hair long are viewed as hippies, hipsters, or just plain lazy. However, a whole different story emerged during the time of the Vietnam war.A woman, lets call her Sally, was married to a licensed psychologist who happened to work at a VA Medical Hospital. He worked with combat veterans who were suffering from PTSD.Below is Sallys story:I remember clearly an evening when my husband came back to our apartment on Doctors Circle carrying a thick official looking folder in his hands. Inside were hundreds of pages of certain studies commissioned by the government. He was in shock from the contents. What he read in those documents completely changed his life. From that moment on my conservative middle of the road husband grew his hair and beard and never cut them again. What is more, the VA Medical center let him do it, and other very conservative men in the staff followed his example. As I read the documents, I learned why.It seems that during the Vietnam War special forces in the war department had sent undercover experts to comb American Native American Reservations looking for talented scouts, for tough young men trained to move stealthily through rough terrain. They were especially looking for men with outstanding, almost supernatural, tracking abilities. Before being approached, these carefully selected men were extensively documented as experts in tracking and survival.With the usual enticements, the well proven smooth phrases used to enroll new recruits, some of these Native American trackers were then enlisted. Once enlisted, an amazing thing happened. Whatever talents and skills they had possessed on the reservation seemed to disappear mysteriously, as recruit after recruit failed to perform as expected in the field.Serious casualties and failures of performance led the government to contract expensive testing of these recruits, and this is what was found.When questioned about their failure to perform as expected, the older recruits replied consistently that when they received their required military haircuts, they could no longer sense the enemy. They could no longer access a sixth sense, their intuition no longer was reliable, they could not read subtle signs as well or access subtle extrasensory information.So the testing institute recruited more Native American trackers, let them keep their long hair, and tested them in multiple areas. Then they would pair two men together who had received the same scores on all the tests. They would let one man in the pair keep his hair long, and gave the other man a military haircut. Then the two men retook the tests.Time after time the man with long hair kept making high scores. Time after time, the man with the short hair failed the tests in which he had previously scored high scores.Here is a standardized test:The recruit is sleeping out in the woods. An armed enemy approaches the sleeping man. The long haired man is awakened out of his sleep by a strong sense of danger and gets away long before the enemy is close, long before any sounds from the approaching enemy are audible.In another version of this test, the long haired man senses an approach and somehow intuits that the enemy will perform a physical attack. He follows his sixth sense and stays still, pretending to be sleeping, but quickly grabs the attacker and kills him as the attacker reaches down to strangle him.This same man, after having passed these and other tests, then received a military haircut and consistently failed these tests and many other tests that he had previously passed.So, the document recommended that all Native American trackers be exempt from military haircuts. In fact, it required that trackers keep their hair long.How is this possible? It all has to do with how we as humans have evolved. Every part of the body has a purpose, and when we lose touch with ourselves and our bodies, we lose the true power we have.Hair, like skin, is an extension of the nervous system, it may be correctly seen as exteriorized nerves, a type of highly evolved feelers or antennae that transmit vast amounts of important information to the brainstem, the limbic system, and the neocortex.However, many people think hair is dead and does nothing for us as humans. It is just an accessory. I do not know who is right or who is wrong, but I am open to all possibilities.Here is the man you need to hear it from:This article was featured at Rense & WakingTimes by C.

When pressed for specifics, the GOP frontrunner dismissively quipped, “Well, I think we spend way too much on organizations and departments that just ‘save’ stuff. For instance, I’d make a move to get rid of the Library of Congress. ”Trump continued, “Y’know what? Old books, decomposing newspapers, pansy artwork and a bunch of black and white movies about women and illegal immigrants have no business being “protected” with our hard-earned tax dollars. My first act as President would be to dissolve wasteful branches of government like the Library and that Kennedy Center for Peforming Arts stuff, and sell the material to China for huge profits.”The statement caused a surprisingly quick response from Acting Librarian of Congress David S. Mao. Having just been named to the position by retired Congressional Librarian James H. Billington this past October, Mao did not foresee such inflammatory attention being brought to his doorstep so quickly, “The threat of dissolution of the Library of Congress is unprecedented,” Mao stated in a missive sent to AP. “It’s not within the scope of the Presidency to deny such funding.”David S. Mao, Acting Librarian of CongressMao went on to define the depth and breadth, and impact such a cavalier undertaking could mean. “We are the largest library in the world, with over 162 million items. Books, films, photographs, audio recordings, maps and manuscripts, our collection is unprecedented. To lose these vital touchstones to all of civilization would be catastrophic.”When asked to respond, Trump’s campaign manager, Corey Lewandowski, issued this statement: “The President of the United States appoints the Librarian of Congress and can just as easily “unappoint”him. Mr. Mao should be more concerned with his ancestry, which sounds a little Communistic, if anything.” CNN’s Anderson Cooper attempted to reach Lewandowski live on air following the statement, but was informed the campaign manager is currently focused on his arrest for battery against a female reporter.As expected, the statement caused shockwaves across social media.

It is also versatile and can be used for ""sport shooting, hunting and self-defense situations,"" the NRA said, adding the ability to ""personalize"" so many of the rifle's components ""is one of the things that makes it so unique.""The Brady Campaign to Prevent Gun Violence said the AR-15, a civilian model of the military's M-16, also cited the weapon's versatility in evaluating its popularity.""They're accurate and they can basically shoot as quickly as you can pull the trigger,"" according to a campaign statement.""Along those lines, they're very customizable — most average people can figure out how to install accessories like forward trigger grips that let you hold the gun at waist height and spray bullets while stabilizing the gun, laser sights, and you can add high-capacity magazines.""But Dean Hazen, owner of The Gun Experts in Mahomet, Ill., and a master firearms instructor, said the reason mass shooters are turning to the AR-15 is due to a ""copy-cat"" mentality more than any feature of the rifle.""It's really just a perception thing,"" Hazen said. ""There are rifles that are more powerful and more dangerous than that, but they're not being used.""Hazen said the AR-15 has ""gotten a bad rap."" He believes mass shooters generally don't know much about guns and choose the AR-15 because of the reputation it has gotten from being used in other mass shootings.""Thank God they don't know any better because if they did they would use much more effective weapons,"" Hazen said.Here is a list of mass shootings in the U.S. that featured AR-15-style rifles during the last 35 years, courtesy of the Stanford Geospatial Center and Stanford Libraries and USA TODAY research:Feb. 24, 1984: Tyrone Mitchell, 28, used an AR-15, a Stoeger 12-gauge shotgun and a Winchester 12-gauge shotgun to kill two and wound 12 at 49th Street Elementary School in Los Angeles before killing himself.Oct. 7, 2007: Tyler Peterson, 20, used an AR-15 to kill six and injure one at an apartment in Crandon, Wis., before killing himself.June 20, 2012: James Eagan Holmes, 24, used an AR-15-style .223-caliber Smith and Wesson rifle with a 100-round magazine, a 12-gauge Remington shotgun and two .40-caliber Glock semi-automatic pistols to kill 12 and injure 58 at a movie theater in Aurora, Colo.Dec. 14, 2012: Adam Lanza, 20, used an AR-15-style rifle, a .223-caliber Bushmaster, to kill 27 people — his mother, 20 students and six teachers — in Newtown, Conn., before killing himself.June 7, 2013: John Zawahri, 23, used an AR-15-style .223-caliber rifle and a .44-caliber Remington revolver to kill five and injure three at a home in Santa Monica, Calif., before he was killed.March 19, 2015: Justin Fowler, 24, used an AR-15 to kill one and injure two on a street in Little Water, N.M., before he was killed.May 31, 2015: Jeffrey Scott Pitts, 36, used an AR-15 and .45-caliber handgun to kill two and injure two at a store in Conyers, Ga., before he was killed.Oct. 31, 2015: Noah Jacob Harpham, 33, used an AR-15, a .357-caliber revolver and a 9mm semi-automatic pistol to kill three on a street in Colorado Springs, Colo., before he was killed.Dec. 2, 2015: Syed Rizwyan Farook and Tashfeen Malik, 28 and 27, used two AR-15-style, .223-caliber Remington rifles and two 9 mm handguns to kill 14 and injure 21 at his workplace in San Bernardino, Calif., before they were killed.June 12, 2016: Omar Mateen, 29, used an AR-15 style rifle (a Sig Sauer MCX), and a 9mm Glock semi-automatic pistol to kill 49 people and injure 50 at an Orlando nightclub before he was killed.Oct. 1, 2017: Stephen Paddock, 64, used a stockpile of guns including an AR-15 to kill 58 people and injure hundreds at a music festival in Las Vegas before he killed himself.Nov. 5, 2017: Devin Kelley, 26, used an AR-15 style Ruger rifle to kill 26 people at a church in Sutherland Springs, Texas, before he was killed.Feb. 14, 2018: Police say Nikolas Cruz, 19, used an AR-15-style rifle to kill at least 17 people at Marjory Stoneman Douglas High School in Parkland, Fla.",2018/02/15,snopes,1

Think again! Research indicates that your blood type is a key genetic factor that influences many areas of health and well-being.Throughout your life, you've probably observed that some people tend to lose weight more easily, while for others, their weight is an ongoing battle. Or wondered why some people are plagued by chronic illness while others stay healthy and vital well into their advanced years. Very simply, the answer is in your blood type.Knowing your blood type is an important tool for understanding how your body reacts to food, your susceptibility to disease, your natural reaction to stress, and so much more. A single drop of blood contains a biochemical makeup as unique to you as your fingerprint.Below are five facts about your blood type that could change your life:Your blood type may predict your susceptibility for certain diseases.Research has found that individuals of certain blood types may be at a higher risk for certain diseases; studies have found that people with blood type O have a lower risk for heart disease, but a higher risk for developing stomach ulcers. People who are blood type A have higher risks of microbial infections, but Type A women experience a higher rate of fertility. Other research has found that people with type AB and B blood have a much higher risk of developing pancreatic cancer.People of different blood types react differently to stress.Type A people naturally have higher levels of the stress hormone cortisol in their bodies and produce more in response to stressful situations. On the other hand, people with type O blood, have a 'fight or flight' reaction to stress which results in the overproduction of adrenaline. It takes type O's longer to recover from stress because it is more difficult for them to clear the adrenaline from their bodies.Read More Blood Group Genetics, Exercise and StressYour blood type antigens are not just in your blood!They are everywhere in your body, particularly in the surfaces that interact with the environment. These include your digestive tract, from your mouth to your large intestine, as well as your nasal passages and lungs. Because these blood type antigens are everywhere, they influence how your body reacts to the food you eat through several factors. For example: the lectins in certain foods bind to your blood type antigen and cause your blood to agglutinate (stick together), resulting in feelings of fatigue, headaches, digestive issues, skin problems and a host of other health issues.Gut bacteria is related to blood type.People of different blood types have different gut bacteria, in fact, certain bacteria are 50,000 more likely to turn up in people with one blood type or the other. This originated from our ancestors whose digestive tracts developed to accommodate one type of diet over another. For example, the microbiome of certain people developed to break down carbohydrates much more efficiently (blood type A). People lacking this ability (blood type O) tend to store carbs as fat.A one-size-fits-all approach to nutrition does not work.Food fads come and go, but the facts are clear: everyone does not have the same basic nutritional needs. We all know someone who is a strict vegetarian and thrives on that diet, while others swear by Atkins or similar low-carb plans. I've found that your nutritional needs can be determined by your blood type. Take a look at the food lists in Eat Right 4 Your Type; they are a guide for choosing the foods that will allow you to lose weight, reduce inflammation, increase energy and lead a longer, healthier life.As you've learned, your blood type affects more than just the type of blood you'd need in the event of a transfusion â your blood type is a genetic factor that plays many roles in the human body. Choosing low-lectin, non-agglutinating foods that create a hospitable environment for your good' intestinal flora and selecting foods that combat your disease risks are two good first steps in creating an individualized nutritional program just for you.Parts Excerpted From: mindbodygreen.com One of the hallmarks of alternative medicine is the recognition of the biochemical uniqueness of each individual and the need to tailor treatments and prescriptions to match that individual variability. While a person's genetic code, ultimately, is the basis of this individuality, basing treatments on genetic factors is too broad an approach and not consistent with alternative medicine. According to naturopathic physician Peter J. D'Adamo, N.D., in his book Eat Right 4 Your Type, the missing link might be the four basic blood types: O, A, B, and AB. ""There had to be a reason why there were so many paradoxes in dietary studies and disease survival,"" why some people lose weight and others do not on the same diet or why some people keep their vitality as they age, and others do not, says Dr. D'Adamo. His research into anthropology, medical history, and genetics led him to conclude that blood type is ""the key that unlocks the door to the mysteries of health, disease, longevity, physical vitality, and emotional strength."" Dr. D'Adamo explains that the practical application of the blood type ""key"" is that it enables you to make informed choices about your dietary, exercise, supplement, and even medical treatment plans. With the blood type ""road map,"" these plans can now ""correspond to your exact biological profile"" and ""the dynamic natural forces within your own body."" Read More Blood Groups and the History of PeoplesType O-People with type O blood fare best on intense physical exercise and animal proteins and less well on dairy products and grains, says Dr. D'Adamo. The leading reason for weight gain among Type O's is the gluten found in wheat products and, to a lesser extent, lentils, corn, kidney beans, and cabbage, Dr. D'Adamo explains. Ideal exercises for Type O's include aerobics, martial arts, contact sports, and running. Type A-Those with blood type A, however, are more naturally suited to a vegetarian diet and foods that are fresh, pure, and organic. As Type A's are predisposed to heart disease, cancer, and diabetes, ""I can't emphasize how critical this dietary adjustment can be to the sensitive immune system of Type A,"" says Dr. D'Adamo. Type A's can derive significant benefit from calming, centering exercise, such as yoga and tai chi. Type B-Type B's have a robust immune system and a tolerant digestive system and tend to resist many of the severe chronic degenerative illnesses, or at least survive them better than the other blood types. Type B's do best with moderate physical exercise requiring mental balance, such as hiking, cycling, tennis, and swimming. Type AB-Blood type AB, the most recent, in terms of evolution, of the four groups and an amalgam of types A and B, is the most biologically complex. For this group, a combination of the exercises for types A and B works best, says Dr. D'Adamo. Blood type, with its digestive and immune specificity, is a window on a person's probable susceptibility to or power over disease, according to Dr. D'Adamo. For example, Type O's are the most likely to suffer from asthma, hay fever, and other allergies, while Type B's have a high allergy threshold, and will react allergically only if they eat the wrong foods. Type B's are also especially susceptible to autoimmune disorders, such as chronic fatigue, lupus, and multiple sclerosis. Type AB's tend to have the fewest problems with allergies, while heart disease, cancer, and anemia are medical risks for them. With arthritis, Type O's, again, are the predominant sufferers because their immune systems are ""environmentally intolerant,"" especially to foods such as grains and potatoes which can produce inflammatory reactions in their joints, says Dr. D'Adamo. Types A and B are the most susceptible to diabetes, while types A and AB have an overall higher rate of cancer and poorer survival odds than the other types. Lectins and Blood TypeA chemical reaction occurs between your blood and the foods you eat. This reaction is part of your genetic inheritance. It is amazing but true that today, in the twenty first century, your immune and digestive systems still maintain favoritism for foods that your blood type ancestors ate.We know this because of a factor called lectins. Lectins, abundant and diverse proteins found in foods, have agglutinating properties that affect your blood and the lining of your digestive tract. Lectins are a powerful way for organisms in nature to attach themselves to other organisms in nature. Lots of germs, and even our own immune systems, use this super glue to their benefit. For example, cells in our liver's bile ducts have lectins on their surfaces to help snatch up bacteria and parasites. Bacteria and other microbes have lectins on their surfaces as well, which work rather like suction cups, so that they can attach to the slippery mucosal linings of the body. Often the lectins used by viruses or bacteria can be blood type specific, making them a stickier pest for people of that blood type.So, too, with the lectins in food. Simply put, when you eat a food containing protein lectins that are incompatible with your blood type antigen, the lectins target an organ or bodily system (kidneys, liver, gut, stomach, etc.) and can begin to interact with the tissues in that area.Read More Blood Types and the Lectin ConnectionWhile you cannot change your blood type, you can use knowledge about its nature to implement a dietary plan biologically suited to your makeup, says Dr. D'Adamo, who supplies copious details on eating plans for all four types. ""Most of my patients experience some results [within two weeks of starting the diet plan]-increased energy, weight loss, a lessening of digestive complaints, and improvement of chronic conditions such as asthma, headaches, and heartburn.""Parts Excerpted From: Alternative Medicine Digest, Future Medicine PublishingReviewed and revised on: 05/02/18The statements made on our websites have not been evaluated by the FDA (U.S. Food & Drug Administration).Our products and services are not intended to diagnose, cure or prevent any disease.

At least that’s what Lorina Hern hopes. Hern, the co-founder of the Rhino Rescue Project, has spent the last four years “devaluing” the horns of rhinos by infusing them with ectoparasiticides — or anti-parasite drugs — and pink dye. The dye isn't visble on the outside, and the ectoparasiticides are harmless to the rhinos when injected into their horns. But humans who handle or consume the horns may not be so lucky. “At a minimum it would start with diarrhea, nausea, vomiting, severe headaches, all the way up to nervous symptoms, which could be permanent,” Hern says. “Some ectoparasiticides also precipitate the development of cancers later on in life.” Lorinda Hern is the co-founder of the Rhino Rescue Project. Credit: Bobby Bascomb Rhino Rescue does its work on behalf of wildlife parks and game reserves looking to protect their rhinos from poachers. Wildlife tourism brings billions of dollars into the South African economy each year, and tourists expect to see rhinos on their safari tours. That makes rhinos expensive: One animal can cost an owner more than $20,000. But the demand for rhino horns in Asia, where they are believed to have medicinal and aphrodisiac qualities, has made a single rhino horn worth 10 times that on the black market, making the animals tempting targets for poachers. To protect their investments, more and more parks are buying insurance for their high-risk animals. The biggest wild life insurance company in South Africa, One Financial Services, charges $700 a year to insure a rhino against poaching. “The poaching risk is so horrendous that it is close to being uninsurable,” says Peter Darroll, a development manager for One Financial Services. The rhino insurance business doesn't make the company much money, he says, but it helps them attract business for more profitable policies on animals like buffaloes. Profitable or not, One Financial Services still requires that rhinos undergo the horn posioning procedure before they can be covered under the company’s policy. It starts with Hern and her team tranquilizing the animals by darting them from a helicopter. As the rhinos begin to lose consciousness, they are laid on their side. Technicians drill three holes into the horn an inject the poison and the dye under high pressure. The procedure has its risks. In 2012, a white male rhino named Spencer died while under anesthesia, but a veterinarian who was an independent observer believed he had an underlying medical condition. Horns also grow relatively quickly, so the toxins and dye are only effective for four years before the process has to be repeated. This video from photographer Joey Skibel gives you an idea of what the process looks like in action: A day in the Life of the Rhino Rescue Project with the founder Lorinda Hern by Joey Skibel The South African National Park Service has not been supportive of Rhino Rescue’s work. The government organization has co-authored a report critical of the horn-poisoning method and its effectiveness. ""This strategy will never help in quelling rhino poaching in the park because we have so many rhino such that we can't even manage to capture them,” park spokesperson William Mabasa told government news agency SANews. But it's not a full condemnation. “I do think it will be a good thing for the individuals who own few rhinos,"" he added. Hern maintains the government is biased against the horn poisoning technique because officials want to eventually legalize and regulate the trade; Rhino Rescue vigorously contests the government report’s findings on its website. And the goal of the horn poisoning isn’t to poison every rhino’s horn, or even stop poaching all together: It’s meant to sow doubt in the minds of poachers and horn buyers. That's why a key step in the process has nothing to do with the rhinos themselves, but with community outreach. A local takes a photo of Rhino after it has been treated by Rhino Rescue. Credit: Courtsey of Rhino Rescue. Hern estimates that up to 90 percent of poachers plan their attacks based on inside information from park workers or locals. So when a rhino's horn is poisoned, everyone is invited to watch in what Hern calls a “bush telegraph,” or the South African version of the “grapevine.”“The staff are invited to come out, local schools are invited to come out, community leaders, the chiefs of certain clans,” Hern says. “Everyone in South Africa has a cell phone, so they actively are encouraged to take as many pictures as they want on these treatment sites and to distribute the word.”No matter the method, Hern sees defending the rhino as her life’s mission. “I can much easier live with myself knowing that if rhinos still go extinct, it happened despite me and not because of me,"" she says. ""I would hate to look future generations in the eye and have them ask me, ‘Well what were you doing while rhinos went extinct?’ And to have to answer, ‘Well, nothing.

Objective: The purpose of this study was to describe mortality in vegetarians and comparable nonvegetarians in a large United Kingdom cohort. Design: The study involved a pooled analysis of data from 2 prospective studies that included 60,310 persons living in the United Kingdom, comprising 18,431 regular meat eaters (who ate meat ≥5 times/wk on average), 13,039 low (less-frequent) meat eaters, 8516 fish eaters (who ate fish but not meat), and 20,324 vegetarians (including 2228 vegans who did not eat any animal foods). Mortality by diet group for each of 18 common causes of death was estimated with the use of Cox proportional hazards models. Results: There were 5294 deaths before age 90 in >1 million y of follow-up. There was no significant difference in overall (all-cause) mortality between the diet groups: HRs in low meat eaters, fish eaters, and vegetarians compared with regular meat eaters were 0.93 (95% CI: 0.86, 1.00), 0.96 (95% CI: 0.86, 1.06), and 1.02 (95% CI: 0.94, 1.10), respectively; P-heterogeneity of risks = 0.082. There were significant differences in risk compared with regular meat eaters for deaths from circulatory disease [higher in fish eaters (HR: 1.22; 95% CI: 1.02, 1.46)]; malignant cancer [lower in fish eaters (HR: 0.82; 95% CI: 0.70, 0.97)], including pancreatic cancer [lower in low meat eaters and vegetarians (HR: 0.55; 95% CI: 0.36, 0.86 and HR: 0.48; 95% CI: 0.28, 0.82, respectively)] and cancers of the lymphatic/hematopoietic tissue [lower in vegetarians (HR: 0.50; 95% CI: 0.32, 0.79)]; respiratory disease [lower in low meat eaters (HR: 0.70; 95% CI: 0.53, 0.92)]; and all other causes [lower in low meat eaters (HR: 0.74; 95% CI: 0.56, 0.99)]. Further adjustment for body mass index left these associations largely unchanged. Conclusions: United Kingdom–based vegetarians and comparable nonvegetarians have similar all-cause mortality. Differences found for specific causes of death merit further investigation. See corresponding editorial on page 3. Vegetarians are defined as people who do not eat any meat, poultry, or fish. They may be subclassified as lacto-ovo-vegetarians, who eat dairy products and/or eggs, and vegans, who do not eat any animal products. Others choose to limit their consumption of meat and fish, perhaps eating fish but not meat (often described as pesco-vegetarians) or eating meat infrequently (sometimes described as semivegetarians). Vegetarianism is uncommon in most countries, with <10% of the population following a vegetarian diet (1). For example, vegetarians and vegans have been estimated to constitute 5% and 2%, respectively, of the US population (2). In India, the proportion of the population consuming a vegetarian diet is much higher at almost 30% (3). These figures indicate that vegetarians and others who eat little or no meat represent a sizeable minority of the global population, and with calls for a reduction in the average worldwide consumption of animal products (4), their long-term health is a matter of considerable interest. Previous studies of mortality in vegetarians have not consistently shown a difference in overall mortality between vegetarians and comparable nonvegetarians (by which we mean persons from a similar background to vegetarians, including ethnicity and socioeconomic status, who eat meat and/or fish). For example, in a pooled analysis of 5 prospective studies, the death rate ratio in vegetarians compared with nonvegetarians, based on a total of 8330 deaths, was 0.95 (95% CI: 0.82, 1.11), albeit with significant heterogeneity of risks between studies (5). Further analyses of mortality data from the European Prospective Investigation into Cancer and Nutrition (EPIC)4–Oxford study (6) and Adventist Health Study 2 (AHS-2) (7), based on 1513 and 2570 deaths, respectively, produced inconsistent results (8, 9). In the EPIC-Oxford study, there was no difference in all-cause mortality between vegetarians and nonvegetarians (HR: 1.05; 95% CI: 0.93, 1.19), although the overall death rate was only one-half that of the United Kingdom population as a whole (8). In contrast, all-cause mortality in the AHS-2 was 12% (95% CI: 3, 20) lower in all vegetarians combined than in nonvegetarians (9). However, heterogeneity of risks between studies (5) and small numbers of deaths from specific causes have limited the ability of researchers to study relative mortality for many common causes of death. To provide more information on mortality in vegetarians and vegans, persons who eat fish but not meat, and infrequent meat eaters, we report here HRs for each of 18 common causes of death, including all causes combined. The analysis used pooled mortality data from 2 prospective studies in the United Kingdom, the Oxford Vegetarian Study (OVS) (10) and the EPIC-Oxford cohort (6), and included more than 5000 deaths before age 90. Thus, the present analysis mirrors a recent study of cancer incidence by diet group that used pooled data from the same 2 cohorts (11), while updating and extending the results from previous analyses of comparative mortality in United Kingdom-based vegetarians and nonvegetarians (8, 12). Participants in the OVS were recruited throughout the United Kingdom between 1980 and 1984 (10). Vegetarian participants were recruited through advertisements, the news media, and word of mouth. Nonvegetarian participants were recruited as friends and relatives of the vegetarian participants. In total, 11,140 subjects were recruited. At recruitment, participants completed a questionnaire on their diet and other lifestyle factors, including 4 questions on whether or not they consumed meat, fish, dairy products, and eggs, and 2 questions on the frequency of meat consumption. The EPIC-Oxford cohort was recruited throughout the United Kingdom between 1993 and 1999 (6). A multicenter research ethics committee (Scotland A Research Ethics Committee) approved the protocol. Two methods of recruitment were used: general practice (GP) recruitment and postal recruitment, as described elsewhere (6). In total, 7,421 participants were recruited by the GP method and 57,990 participants by the postal method. The recruitment questionnaire, which can be viewed online at http://www.epic-oxford.org, included 4 questions on whether or not participants consumed meat, fish, dairy products, and eggs, and questions on the frequency of meat consumption. Surviving participants were sent follow-up questionnaires approximately 5, 10, and 15 y after recruitment, including the same 4 questions on current intake of meat, fish, dairy products, and eggs and ≥1 questions on the frequency of meat consumption, enabling us to classify them according to diet group at each time point. The 5 y, 10 y, and 15 y follow-up questionnaires can also be viewed online at http://www.epic-oxford.org. For both studies, answers to the 4 questions on the consumption of meat, fish, dairy products, and eggs were used to assign participants to 1 of 4 diet groups at each time point [OVS recruitment, EPIC-Oxford recruitment, EPIC-Oxford follow-up questionnaire 1 (FU1), EPIC-Oxford follow-up questionnaire 2 (FU2), and EPIC-Oxford follow-up questionnaire 3 (FU3), as applicable]: meat eaters (participants who ate meat, irrespective of whether they ate fish, dairy products, or eggs), fish eaters (participants who did not eat meat but did eat fish), vegetarians (participants who did not eat meat or fish, but did eat either or both dairy products and eggs), and vegans (participants who did not eat meat, fish, eggs, or dairy products). Combining this information with data on the frequency of meat consumption enabled us to divide the meat eaters into regular meat eaters (who reported eating meat on ≥5 occasions per week on average) and low meat eaters (who ate meat <5 times/wk). Participants in both studies were followed until the censoring date of 31 March 2014 by record linkage with the United Kingdom’s National Health Service Central Register, which provides information on deaths and their causes. Person-years were calculated from the beginning of recruitment until the date of death, emigration, or loss to follow-up, the participant’s 90th birthday, or the censoring date, whichever occurred first. Participants in the OVS who subsequently joined the EPIC-Oxford study contributed person-years in the OVS until the date when they joined the EPIC-Oxford study. For EPIC-Oxford participants, the person-years were split into 1 to 4 phases depending on which, if any, of the follow-up questionnaires they completed. Diet group and categories of each of the adjustment and stratification variables were reset as appropriate at the beginning of each phase. For example, a participant who joined the OVS as a regular meat eater and had become a low meat eater at recruitment to the EPIC-Oxford study and a fish eater at FU1 completion would contribute person-years to each of these diet groups. The 18 common underlying causes of death for which HRs were calculated were as follows: malignant cancer [International Classification of Diseases (ICD)-10 codes C00–97 and equivalent ICD-9 codes], including colorectal cancer (ICD-10 C18–20), pancreatic cancer (C25), lung cancer (C34), female breast cancer (C50), ovarian cancer (C56), and cancers of the lymphatic/hematopoietic tissue (C81–96); mental and behavioral disorders (F00–99); diseases of the nervous system (G00–99); circulatory disease (I00–99), including ischemic heart disease (IHD) (I20–25), cerebrovascular disease (I60–69), and other circulatory disease (I00–15, I26–52, and I70–99); diseases of the respiratory system (J00–99); diseases of the digestive system (K00–93); injury, poisoning and external causes (S00–T98 and V01–Y98); all other causes (ICD-10 codes beginning with A, B, D, E, H, and L–R); and all causes combined. Participants were excluded from the analysis if they were aged <20 or >89 y at recruitment, or had a previous (registered or self-reported) malignant neoplasm before recruitment; a previous self-reported stroke, heart attack, or angina; uncertain follow-up; or had no information for ≥1 of the factors age, sex, smoking, and diet group at recruitment. EPIC-Oxford participants who did not complete the main questionnaire were also excluded because data on several important factors were thereby unavailable. After these exclusions, there were 60,310 participants (14,916 men and 45,394 women), including 10,359 OVS participants and 52,659 EPIC-Oxford participants; 2,708 participants contributed follow-up data from both studies. HRs (95% CIs) for 18 common causes of death, including all causes combined, were calculated by Cox proportional hazards regression with age as the underlying time variable, with the use of a clustered sandwich variance estimator to allow for intraparticipant correlation among individuals contributing person-years to >1 of the 5 possible phases of follow-up, including OVS recruitment to the earlier of EPIC-Oxford recruitment (if applicable) or death/censoring, EPIC-Oxford recruitment to the earliest of FU1/FU2/FU3 completion (if applicable) or death/censoring, FU1 completion (if applicable) to the earliest of FU2/FU3 completion (if applicable) or death/censoring, FU2 completion (if applicable) to the earlier of FU3 completion (if applicable) or death/censoring, and FU3 completion (if applicable) to death/censoring. For the small number of participants whose diet group was unknown at FU1, FU2, or FU3 completion (∼30 participants at each stage), diet group was deemed to be the same as at EPIC-Oxford recruitment or at the most-recently completed follow-up questionnaire, as appropriate. The analyses were stratified by study protocol (OVS participants, EPIC-Oxford GP-recruited participants, or EPIC-Oxford postal recruited participants), a 28-category variable combining sex; parity; oral contraceptive and hormone therapy use in women (men, plus the 27 combinations of nulliparous, parous, and unknown parity; never user, past or current user, and unknown user of oral contraceptives; and never user, past or current user, and unknown user of hormone therapy); self-reported prior diabetes (yes, no, or unknown); self-reported prior high blood pressure (yes, no, or unknown); and self-reported long-term medical treatment (yes, no, or unknown). HRs also were adjusted for smoking (never smoker; former smoker; current smoker of 1–9, 10–19, or ≥20 cigarettes/d; other current smoker, including pipe and cigar smokers; or unknown); alcohol consumption (<1, 1–7, 8–15, or ≥16 g ethanol/d or unknown); physical activity [low, high, or unknown; for OVS, high means sport/keep fit and/or running/cycling ≥2 times/wk, and low means neither of these (where known); for EPIC-Oxford, low means an average of <3.5 h/wk cycling or other physical exercise, and high means more than this (where known)]; marital status (married or cohabiting, not married or cohabiting, or unknown); and regular use of nutritional supplements (yes, no, or unknown), with optional further adjustment for BMI (in kg/m2; <18, 18–19.9, 20–21.9, 22–23.9, 24–25.9, 26–27.9, 28–29.9, 30–32.4, or ≥32.5, or unknown). In the main analysis of mortality before age 90 y, the meat eaters were divided into 2 categories according to the average frequency of meat consumption, whereas the vegetarians and vegans were combined into a single group, creating 4 diet groups: regular meat eaters (who reported eating meat ≥5 times/wk on average), low meat eaters (who ate meat but did so <5 times/wk), fish eaters, and vegetarians and vegans. For the 6 most common causes of death (malignant cancer, circulatory disease, IHD, cerebrovascular disease, diseases of the respiratory system, and all causes combined), subgroup analyses were also conducted for men; women; participants with BMI <20 (underweight), BMI 20–24.9 (normal weight), and BMI ≥25 (overweight); never smokers, former smokers and current smokers; and after excluding the first 2 y of follow-up in either the OVS or EPIC-Oxford study according to which study participants joined first. We also conducted the mortality analyses for all 18 causes of death after excluding participants known to have changed diet group at least once during follow-up, including participants common to the OVS and EPIC-Oxford study who were in a different diet group at recruitment to the 2 studies. For the 6 most common causes of death only, we also calculated HRs with the vegetarians and vegans separated to give results for 5 diet groups (regular meat eaters, low meat eaters, fish eaters, vegetarians, and vegans). We also examined mortality before age 75 y in the model for the 4 diet groups for 17 causes of death (there were too few deaths from mental and behavioral disorders before age 75 for meaningful analysis), censoring at participants’ 75th birthday if this preceded their censoring date or date of death, emigration, or other loss to follow-up, repeating this analysis after excluding participants known to have changed diet group at least once during follow-up. The main results were not adjusted for BMI because we consider that the differences in BMI between the dietary groups are largely caused by the differences in diet, and, therefore, that BMI may mediate some of the differences in risk between dietary groups, but we do report the effects on the HR of further adjustment for BMI (in 10 categories, including unknown, as listed above). Chi-square tests of heterogeneity of risk between the diet groups were based on the statistical significance of diet group in the model, the null hypothesis being equality of risk across the 4 (or 5) diet groups. Tests of heterogeneity of risks by diet group between men and women and categories of BMI and smoking were based on the statistical significance of the corresponding interaction term in the model. Statistical significance was set at the 5% level. All statistical analyses were conducted with the use of Stata Statistical Software: Release 14. The characteristics of the participants in each of 4 diet groups (regular meat eaters, low meat eaters, fish eaters, and vegetarians and vegans combined) are shown in Table 1. To avoid double counting, persons who participated in both the OVS and EPIC-Oxford study are grouped according to their characteristics at recruitment to the EPIC-Oxford study. One-third of participants were vegetarian or vegan and three-quarters were women. Two-thirds of the vegetarians and vegans had followed their diet for more than 5 y (results not shown), and 59% of meat eaters ate meat ≥5 times/wk on average. Mean age at recruitment was lower in the fish eaters than in the meat eaters, and lower still in the vegetarians and vegans. Smoking rates were low overall, with only 16% of men and 12% of women reporting that they were smokers at the time of recruitment. Mean BMI was ∼2 kg/m2 lower in vegetarians and vegans than in regular meat eaters and the proportion with a BMI <20 was 2–3 times as high in the former group as in the latter. Fish eaters had a slightly higher mean BMI than did the vegetarians and vegans. Mean alcohol consumption was lowest in the vegetarians and vegans and highest in fish eaters (women) or regular meat eaters (men). The proportions of men and women who reported a relatively high amount of physical activity were highest in fish eaters and lowest in regular meat eaters. About two-thirds of participants were married or cohabiting at recruitment, the proportion being highest in regular meat eaters and lowest in vegetarians and vegans. The proportions of men and women who reported regular use of nutritional supplements were highest in fish eaters and lowest in regular meat eaters, with more than one-third of men and more than one-half of women taking supplements. The proportion of women who were nulliparous at recruitment was highest among vegetarians and vegans and lowest among regular meat eaters, and the proportion of women who had ever used oral contraceptives was highest in fish eaters and lowest in regular meat eaters. Less than 2% of participants reported a previous diagnosis of diabetes, the percentages being highest in regular meat eaters and lowest in vegetarians and vegans; a similar pattern was found for self-reported prior high blood pressure and long-term medical treatment, except that the percentages were closer to 10% and 20%, respectively. Values are means ± SDs or percentages. Persons who participated in both the Oxford Vegetarian Study and EPIC-Oxford are grouped according to their characteristics at recruitment to EPIC-Oxford.

Values are means ± SDs or percentages. Persons who participated in both the Oxford Vegetarian Study and EPIC-Oxford are grouped according to their characteristics at recruitment to EPIC-Oxford. EPIC-Oxford, European Prospective Investigation into Cancer and Nutrition–Oxford. Includes pipe or cigar smokers and current smokers of an unknown number of cigarettes per day. Known for 14,441 men and 43,951 women. In 11,625 men and 39,936 women in the EPIC-Oxford study with reliable nutrient intake data. As a nonstarch polysaccharide. The estimated mean intake of selected foods and nutrients by diet group is also shown in Table 1. Because the OVS recruitment questionnaire was insufficiently detailed to enable nutrient intake to be estimated, the values are based on data from the EPIC-Oxford study only. Expressed as a percentage of energy intake, intake of protein, total fat, and saturated fat was highest in regular meat eaters and lowest in vegetarians and vegans, whereas the reverse was true for intake of carbohydrate, dietary fiber, and plant protein. Meat intake was >3 times higher in regular meat eaters than in low meat eaters (∼110 g/d and ∼35 g/d, respectively), whereas total fish intake was ∼40 g/d in each of the nonvegetarian groups, about one-third of which was oily fish. Intake of fresh fruit and vegetables was lowest in regular meat eaters and generally highest in vegetarians and vegans, although the differences between the highest and lowest mean intake was only ∼50 g/d. Of the 2708 persons who participated in both the OVS and EPIC-Oxford study, 1839 (68%) were allocated to the same diet group (regular meat eater, low meat eater, fish eater, or vegetarian or vegan) at recruitment to both studies, with an average 13 y gap between recruitment dates, indicating a high degree of consistency in diet group. Of the 52,659 EPIC-Oxford participants included in the analysis, 34,983 completed FU1 ∼5 y after recruitment and could be characterized according to diet group at this time. Of these, 25,555 (73%) were allocated to the same diet group (regular meat eater, low meat eater, fish eater, or vegetarian or vegan) as they had been at recruitment. There were 5294 deaths before age 90 among the participants in >1 million years of follow-up. Table 2 shows the HR for low meat eaters, fish eaters, and vegetarians and vegans combined relative to regular meat eaters for the 18 causes of death investigated, each of which was responsible for more than 130 deaths before age 90, without and with additional adjustment for BMI. For all causes of death combined, there was no significant difference in risk between diet groups [low meat eaters, HR: 0.93 (95% CI: 0.86, 1.00); fish eaters, HR: 0.96 (95% CI: 0.86, 1.06); and vegetarians and vegans, HR: 1.02 (95% CI: 0.94, 1.10) compared with regular meat eaters; P-heterogeneity of risks = 0.082]. There was significant heterogeneity of risk between diet groups for deaths from pancreatic cancer [low meat eaters, HR: 0.55 (95% CI: 0.36, 0.86) and vegetarians and vegans, HR: 0.48 (95% CI 0.28, 0.82), compared with regular meat eaters; P-heterogeneity = 0.012] and cancers of the lymphatic/hematopoietic tissue [vegetarians and vegans compared with regular meat eaters, HR: 0.50 (95% CI: 0.32, 0.79); P-heterogeneity = 0.010]. Mortality from all malignant cancers combined was significantly lower in fish eaters than in regular meat eaters, HR: 0.82 (95% CI: 0.70, 0.97). There was also significant heterogeneity of risk between diet groups for circulatory disease mortality [fish eaters compared with regular meat eaters, HR: 1.22 (95% CI: 1.02, 1.46); P-heterogeneity = 0.046]; cerebrovascular disease mortality (P-heterogeneity = 0.023, but no significant differences in risk between regular meat eaters and any of the other diet groups); and respiratory disease mortality [low meat eaters compared with regular meat eaters, HR: 0.70 (95% CI: 0.53, 0.92); P-heterogeneity = 0.020]. Mortality from all other causes (ICD-10 codes beginning with A, B, D, E, H, and L–R) was significantly lower in low meat eaters than in regular meat eaters (HR: 0.74 (95% CI: 0.56, 0.99), although there was no overall heterogeneity of risk between the diet groups for this endpoint (P-heterogeneity = 0.13). Further adjustment for BMI left these associations largely unchanged, except that the higher mortality from other circulatory disease in fish eaters compared with regular meat eaters became statistically significant (HR: 1.45 (95% CI: 1.03, 2.03); P-heterogeneity = 0.20). Estimated by Cox proportional hazards regression with age as the underlying time variable. Basic model adjusted for smoking (never smoker; former smoker; current smoker of 1–9, 10–19, or ≥20 cigarettes per day; other current smoker; unknown); alcohol consumption (<1, 1–7, 8–15, or ≥16 g ethanol/d or unknown); physical activity (low, high, or unknown); whether married or cohabiting (yes, no, or unknown); and regular use of nutritional supplements (no, yes, or unknown), and stratified by study/method of recruitment (Oxford Vegetarian Study, EPIC-Oxford postal, or EPIC-Oxford general practice); all possible combinations of sex, parity (nulliparous, parous, or unknown), oral contraceptive use, and hormone therapy use (both ever, never, or unknown); prior diabetes; prior high blood pressure; and receipt of long-term medical treatment (each no, yes, or unknown), with the use of separate models for each endpoint. Model +BMI is further adjusted for BMI (in kg/m2; <18, 18.0–19.9, 20.0–21.9, 22.0–23.9, 24.0–25.9, 26.0–27.9, 28.0–29.9, 30.0–32.4, or ≥32.5, or unknown).

Basic model adjusted for smoking (never smoker; former smoker; current smoker of 1–9, 10–19, or ≥20 cigarettes per day; other current smoker; unknown); alcohol consumption (<1, 1–7, 8–15, or ≥16 g ethanol/d or unknown); physical activity (low, high, or unknown); whether married or cohabiting (yes, no, or unknown); and regular use of nutritional supplements (no, yes, or unknown), and stratified by study/method of recruitment (Oxford Vegetarian Study, EPIC-Oxford postal, or EPIC-Oxford general practice); all possible combinations of sex, parity (nulliparous, parous, or unknown), oral contraceptive use, and hormone therapy use (both ever, never, or unknown); prior diabetes; prior high blood pressure; and receipt of long-term medical treatment (each no, yes, or unknown), with the use of separate models for each endpoint. Model +BMI is further adjusted for BMI (in kg/m2; <18, 18.0–19.9, 20.0–21.9, 22.0–23.9, 24.0–25.9, 26.0–27.9, 28.0–29.9, 30.0–32.4, or ≥32.5, or unknown). EPIC-Oxford, European Prospective Investigation into Cancer and Nutrition–Oxford; het, heterogeneity; ICD, International Classification of Diseases. Chi-square test of heterogeneity of risk between the 4 diet groups. With 2 exceptions, there was no significant heterogeneity of risks between men and women; between never, former, and current smokers; or between low-weight, normal-weight, and overweight participants for any of the 6 most common causes of death (malignant cancer, circulatory disease, IHD, cerebrovascular disease, diseases of the respiratory system, and all causes combined) for which subgroup analyses were performed (results not shown). The exceptions were circulatory disease mortality subdivided by BMI category (P-interaction = 0.030), for which there was significant heterogeneity of risks between diet groups for participants with BMI ≥25 [fish eaters, HR: 1.53 (95% CI: 1.13, 2.08), and vegetarians and vegans, HR: 1.28 (95% CI: 1.00, 1.64) compared with regular meat eaters; P-heterogeneity = 0.015] but not for participants with BMI <20 or 20–24.9; and respiratory disease mortality subdivided by smoking status (P-interaction = 0.047), for which there was significant heterogeneity of risks between diet groups for never smokers [vegetarians and vegans compared with regular meat eaters, HR: 1.53 (95% CI: 1.00, 2.37); P-heterogeneity = 0.024], but not for former smokers or current smokers. When the first 2 y of follow-up were excluded, leaving 5133 deaths before age 90, there was significant heterogeneity of risk between the diet groups for all causes of death combined, as follows: low meat eaters, HR: 0.94 (95% CI: 0.87, 1.01); fish eaters, HR: 0.96 (95% CI: 0.86, 1.06); and vegetarians and vegans, HR: 1.05 (95% CI: 0.97, 1.13) compared with regular meat eaters; P-heterogeneity = 0.035. The heterogeneity of risks for circulatory disease, cerebrovascular disease and respiratory disease mortality all remained statistically significant (P-heterogeneity = 0.040, 0.021, and 0.016, respectively; HRs not shown). Further adjustment for BMI left these associations largely unchanged except that the heterogeneity of risk between the diet groups for all causes of death after excluding the first 2 y of follow-up was no longer statistically significant (P-heterogeneity = 0.10; HRs not shown). When we excluded data for participants known to have changed diet group at least once during follow-up, leaving data for 4270 deaths before age 90, there was no significant difference in risk between diet groups for all causes of death combined, as follows: low meat eaters, HR: 0.93 (95% CI: 0.85, 1.02); fish eaters, HR: 0.91 (95% CI: 0.81, 1.02); and vegetarians and vegans, HR: 0.92 (95% CI: 0.84, 0.99) compared with regular meat eaters; P-heterogeneity = 0.13 (Table 3). There was significant heterogeneity of risk between the diet groups for mortality from all malignant cancers combined and cancers of the lymphatic/hematopoietic tissue (P-heterogeneity = 0.006 and 0.001, respectively). For all malignant cancers, both fish eaters and vegetarians and vegans combined had significantly lower mortality than regular meat eaters [HR: 0.76 (95% CI: 0.63, 0.91) and HR: 0.82 (95% CI: 0.72, 0.94), respectively]. Vegetarians and vegans combined also had significantly lower mortality than did regular meat eaters for pancreatic cancer [HR: 0.47 (95% CI: 0.26, 0.86); P-heterogeneity = 0.065] and cancers of the lymphatic/hematopoietic tissue [HR: 0.43 (95% CI: 0.27, 0.70)], and low meat eaters had significantly lower respiratory disease mortality than regular meat eaters [HR: 0.69 (95% CI: 0.49, 0.97); P-heterogeneity = 0.14]. Further adjustment for BMI left these associations largely unchanged except that the heterogeneity of risk between the diet groups for deaths from pancreatic cancer became statistically significant (P-heterogeneity = 0.029), with low meat eaters and vegetarians and vegans both having significantly lower pancreatic cancer mortality than regular meat eaters [HR: 0.55 (95% CI: 0.30, 0.98) and HR: 0.42 (95% CI: 0.23, 0.77), respectively].

Chi-square test of heterogeneity of risk between the 4 diet groups. For 6 major causes of death (including all causes combined), vegetarians and vegans were separated and HRs compared with regular meat eaters were calculated for each of low meat eaters, fish eaters, vegetarians, and vegans (Table 4). For all causes of death, there was no significant difference in risk between diet groups as follows: low meat eaters, HR: 0.93 (95% CI: 0.86, 1.00); fish eaters, HR: 0.96 (95% CI: 0.87, 1.06); vegetarians, HR: 1.00 (95% CI: 0.93, 1.08); and vegans, HR: 1.14 (95% CI: 0.97, 1.35) compared with regular meat eaters; P-heterogeneity = 0.056. There was significant heterogeneity of risk between diet groups for cerebrovascular disease and respiratory disease mortality (P-heterogeneity = 0.023 and 0.015, respectively), with vegans having the highest mortality for both of these causes of death [compared with regular meat eaters, HR: 1.63 (95% CI: 0.98, 2.69) and HR: 1.57 (95% CI: 0.92, 2.67), respectively], but the CIs for the HRs in vegans were wide, precluding any clear conclusions. Further adjustment for BMI made little difference to the results. When we repeated this analysis after excluding data for participants known to have changed diet group at least once during follow-up, there was significant heterogeneity of risks between diet groups for malignant cancer mortality alone (P-heterogeneity = 0.015; results not shown). HRs for vegans compared with regular meat eaters for deaths from malignant cancer, circulatory disease, IHD, cerebrovascular disease, diseases of the respiratory system, and all causes combined were HR: 0.97 (95% CI: 0.72, 1.29); HR: 1.09 (95% CI: 0.76, 1.56); HR: 0.79 (95% CI: 0.44, 1.43); HR: 1.50 (95% CI: 0.84, 2.68); HR: 1.00 (95% CI: 0.50, 2.01); and HR: 1.00 (95% CI: 0.83, 1.20), respectively. Again, further adjustment for BMI made little difference to the results. Estimated by Cox proportional hazards regression with age as the underlying time variable.

EPIC-Oxford, European Prospective Investigation into Cancer and Nutrition–Oxford; het, heterogeneity; ICD, International Classification of Diseases. Chi-square test of heterogeneity of risk between the 5 diet groups. We also examined mortality before age 75 for the categorization with 4 diet groups including vegetarians and vegans combined. There were 2601 deaths before age 75 among the participants up to the censoring date. The HRs for low meat eaters, fish eaters, and vegetarians and vegans combined relative to regular meat eaters for 17 causes of death are shown in Supplemental Table 1 (mental and behavioral disorders were responsible for only 18 deaths before age 75—too few for meaningful analysis). For all-cause mortality before age 75, there was no significant difference in risk between diet groups: HRs for low meat eaters, fish eaters, and vegetarians and vegans compared with regular meat eaters were HR: 0.92 (95% CI: 0.83, 1.01); HR: 0.90 (95% CI: 0.78, 1.04); and HR: 0.97 (95% CI: 0.87, 1.08), respectively; P-heterogeneity = 0.28. Significant heterogeneity of risks between the diet groups was found for pancreatic cancer, lung cancer, and cancers of the lymphatic/hematopoietic tissue, and malignant cancer mortality was significantly lower in fish eaters than in regular meat eaters (Supplemental Table 1). Again, further adjustment for BMI made little difference to the results. When we excluded data for participants known to have changed diet group at least once during follow-up from the early mortality analysis, leaving data for 2155 deaths before age 75, vegetarians and vegans had significantly lower all-cause mortality than regular meat eaters, although there was no overall heterogeneity of risk between the diet groups: HRs for low meat eaters, fish eaters, and vegetarians and vegans compared with regular meat eaters were HR: 0.97 (95% CI: 0.86, 1.09); HR: 0.87 (95% CI: 0.74, 1.02); and HR: 0.86 (95% CI: 0.77, 0.97), respectively; P-heterogeneity = 0.068 (Supplemental Table 2). There was significant heterogeneity of risk between the diet groups for mortality from all malignant cancers combined, cancers of the lung and lymphatic/hematopoietic tissue, and other circulatory disease. In addition, vegetarians and vegans had significantly lower mortality than regular meat eaters for pancreatic cancer and digestive diseases, and fish eaters had significantly lower colorectal cancer mortality than regular meat eaters (Supplemental Table 2). Further adjustment for BMI left these associations largely unchanged. In this analysis of mortality by diet group in a population with a high percentage of vegetarians and others who eat little or no meat, we found no significant differences in all-cause mortality between the diet groups. For specific causes of death, compared with regular meat eaters, low meat eaters had ∼30–45% lower mortality from pancreatic cancer, respiratory disease, and all other causes of death, fish eaters had ∼20% lower mortality from malignant cancer and ∼20% higher circulatory disease mortality, and vegetarians and vegans had ∼50% lower mortality from pancreatic cancer and cancers of the lymphatic/hematopoietic tissue. These findings were essentially unchanged on further adjustment for BMI, and generally were robust across categories of sex, smoking, and BMI for the 6 most common causes of death. When we excluded data for participants known to have changed diet group at least once during follow-up (on the basis that a change in diet group could be prompted by the onset of illness), compared with regular meat eaters, low meat eaters had ∼45% lower mortality from pancreatic cancer and ∼30% lower respiratory disease mortality, fish eaters had ∼25% lower mortality from malignant cancer, and vegetarians and vegans had ∼10% lower all-cause mortality, ∼20% lower mortality from malignant cancer, and ∼50–60% lower mortality from pancreatic cancer and cancers of the lymphatic/hematopoietic tissue. Separating the vegetarians and vegans for the 6 most common causes of death did not reveal any statistically significant differences in mortality between vegans and regular meat eaters. When we censored the data to study mortality before age 75, the results were broadly similar to those for mortality to age 90. Our results for all-cause mortality are in line with previous studies of mortality in United Kingdom-based vegetarians and comparable nonvegetarians (5, 8, 12). In contrast, recent results from the AHS-2 study found that all-cause mortality was 12% (95% CI: 3, 20) lower in all vegetarians combined (including occasional meat eaters and persons who ate fish but not meat) than in nonvegetarians (9), and earlier studies of US Seventh-Day Adventists also found lower all-cause mortality in vegetarians (5). Orlich et al. (9) considered possible reasons for this apparent discrepancy in findings between US-based Seventh-Day Adventists and United Kingdom-based free-living subjects, suggesting that the “perceived healthfulness of vegetarian diets” may be a major motivating factor for Adventist vegetarians, whereas United Kingdom vegetarians may be motivated by other factors that are not health-related, making them less likely to adopt a “healthy” vegetarian diet (13). It may also be the case that differences in the dietary characteristics of vegetarians and nonvegetarians are greater among Adventists than among the participants in our studies. For example, nonvegetarians in the AHS-2 had 2.6 times the intake of animal protein (expressed as a percentage of energy intake) as lacto-ovo-vegetarians in the same study (14), rather higher than the ratio of 2.1 between the animal protein intake of regular meat eaters and vegetarians and vegans in the present study (Table 1). Whether such variations in diet between vegetarians and nonvegetarians in the United States and the United Kingdom contribute to the differences in all-cause mortality between vegetarians and nonvegetarians in the AHS-2 and between regular meat eaters and vegetarians in the present study is unclear. We found no difference in IHD mortality between diet groups. This contrasts with results from the AHS-2, which showed significantly lower IHD mortality in fish eaters than in nonvegetarians (who ate meat and fish more than once per week; HR: 0.65; 95% CI: 0.43, 0.97) (9), and an earlier EPIC-Oxford study showing a 32% (95% CI: 19, 42) lower risk of incident IHD (including 1235 mostly nonfatal IHD events) in vegetarians than in nonvegetarians (15). The most likely explanation for the finding of a lower risk of incident IHD in vegetarians is that vegetarians have generally lower values of established risk factors for IHD (namely, non-HDL cholesterol, blood pressure, and BMI) than do nonvegetarians (16), but why this finding is not replicated for IHD mortality is unclear. The IHD risk factors that are affected by consuming a vegetarian diet are, proportionally, more strongly related to the risk of IHD at younger ages (17), which might explain our finding of a larger (but nonsignificant) difference in IHD mortality between regular meat eaters and vegetarians before age 75 y than for mortality up to age 90 y. Incident, nonfatal IHD may also lead to the effective medical management of established risk factors for IHD (e.g., drugs to treat non-HDL cholesterol and high blood pressure), lowering subsequent IHD mortality and partially nullifying the differences between vegetarians and meat eaters found for IHD incidence. In our analysis of cancer incidence in British vegetarians, based on data from the same 2 cohort studies, we found an ∼10% significantly lower incidence of all malignant cancers in fish eaters and vegetarians (including vegans) than in meat eaters (11). In the present study, fish eaters had a significant ∼20% lower malignant cancer mortality than did regular meat eaters, whereas vegetarians and vegans had a nonsignificantly lower cancer mortality than regular meat eaters (by ∼10%), so our findings are consistent with the results for overall cancer incidence. In the AHS-2, there was no difference in cancer mortality between vegetarians and nonvegetarians (9). The lower mortality for pancreatic cancer and cancers of the lymphatic/hematopoietic tissue in vegetarians and vegans compared with regular meat eaters partially reflects the findings from our analysis of cancer incidence in British vegetarians (11). Although data from the EPIC study as a whole found no association between intakes of red and processed meat and pancreatic cancer risk, poultry consumption was associated with an increased risk (18), and a meta-analysis of 11 prospective studies found a positive association between pancreatic cancer incidence and processed meat consumption (19). We also found significant heterogeneity of risks between the diet groups for circulatory disease, cerebrovascular disease, and respiratory disease mortality, although there were no obvious patterns to the HRs and the heterogeneity was nonsignificant for mortality before age 75 y. Similarly, the ∼25% lower mortality from all other causes (a catch-all category in which the most common cause of death is old age) in low meat eaters compared with regular meat eaters is hard to explain. Strengths of the study include the large numbers of deaths (5294, including 2601 before age 75 y) in >1 million years of follow-up and the inclusion of many actual and potential confounders among the variables used for stratification and adjustment. There was also a high degree of consistency of diet group during follow-up, both among EPIC-Oxford study participants who completed the first follow-up questionnaire ∼5 y after recruitment and among the 2708 participants who contributed follow-up data from both studies. Limitations of the study include the simple adjustment for physical activity and the uneven distribution of participants by sex (three-quarters of participants were women). The study participants are not representative of the United Kingdom population, but the mean intake of red meat in our reference group of regular meat eaters (84 g/d in men and 70 g/d in women) are similar to those of adults aged 19–64 y in the UK National Diet and Nutrition Survey (86 g/d in men and 56 g/d in women) (20). In conclusion, our results suggest that United Kingdom–based vegetarians and comparable nonvegetarians (including people who eat fish but not meat and those who eat meat <5 times per week on average) have similar all-cause mortality. The differences by diet group found for specific causes of death merit further investigation.

Marijuana can be smoked, eaten, vaporized, brewed and even taken topically, but most people smoke it.The intoxicating chemical in marijuana is tetrahydracannabinol, or THC. According to research from the Potency Monitoring Project , the average THC content of marijuana has soared from less than 1 percent in 1972, to 3 to 4 percent in the 1990s, to nearly 13 percent in 2010. Today, some retail marijuana has 30 percent THC or more. The increased potency makes it difficult to determine the short- and long-term effects of marijuanaHow Cannabis is consumedIn a 2010 National Survey on Drug Use and Health (NSDUH), 17.4 million people in the United States said they had used marijuana in the past month. Since then, many states have made it legal to use marijuana recreationally or medically. As of early 2017, 26 states and the District of Columbia have made the use of pot legal in one form or another. A 2016 Gallup poll found that one in eight people smoke marijuana and 43 percent of U.S. adults admit to trying it.Marijuana is usually smoked, according to the National Institute on Drug Abuse (NIDA). The Cannabis (called ""pot,"" ""weed,"" ""grass,"" etc.) is typically spread on rolling papers and formed into a cigarette, often referred to as a joint, or a cigar-like blunt. Smoking releases the THC, which is absorbed into the blood stream through the lungs. Glass pipes, bubblers and bongs are other ways to smoke marijuana.Marijuana can also be ingested in food, often a choice of those who are using medical marijuana. Aside from the popular ""pot brownie,"" edible marijuana can be added to a number of foods, including candy, ice cream and butter. Some states that have legalized marijuana have issued rules for packaging and labeling ""marijuana edibles.""Cannabis can be taken in liquid form, by brewing it as a tea. It can also be added to other beverages, including soda, milk and alcohol. Hashish is a resin made of the concentrated plant material. Other forms include capsules, oral sprays and topical oils. A relatively new method of inhaling marijuana is vaporization , a ""smokeless"" delivery system using devices such as e-cigarettes. By heating the Cannabis at lower temperatures, the plant's oils or extracts are released. Several studies suggest that ""vaping"" is better for health than smoking pot. Vaporized marijuana contains little other than cannabinoids, according to a 2004 study in the Journal of Cannabis Therapeutics . Users inhaled fewer toxic compounds and carbon monoxide when vaping compared with smoking marijuana, according to a 2007 study in the journal Clinical Pharmacology & Therapeutics . According to the Colorado Department of Public Health and Environment, there hasn't been enough research to conclude how much healthier vaping is than smoking unfiltered marijuana.How marijuana affects the mindMarijuana reaches the same pleasure centers in the brain that are targeted by heroin, cocaine and alcohol.Depending on the quantity, quality and method of consumption, marijuana can produce a feeling of euphoria — or high — by stimulating brain cells to release the chemical dopamine. When smoked or otherwise inhaled, the feeling of euphoria is almost immediate. When ingested in food, it takes much longer, even hours, for the drug to signal the brain to release the dopamine, according to the National Institutes of Health .Other changes in mood can occur, with relaxation frequently being reported. Some users experience heightened sensory perception, with colors appearing more vivid and noises being louder. For some, marijuana can cause an altered perception of time and increased appetite, known as the ""munchies.""The impact can vary by person, how often they have used the drug, the strength of the drug and how often it has been since they have gotten high, among other factors.""In some cases, reported side effects of THC include elation, anxiety, tachycardia, short-term memory recall issues, sedation, relaxation, pain-relief and many more,"" said A.J. Fabrizio, a marijuana chemistry expert at Terra Tech Corp, a California agricultural company focused on local farming and medical cannabis.Other effects, according to the NIH, include:Feelings of panic and fear (paranoia)HallucinationsDecreased ability to perform tasks that require coordinationDecreased interest in completing tasksWhen coming down from the high, users may feel depressed or extremely tired. While marijuana use produces a mellow experience (users are sometimes referred to as ""stoners"") for some, it can heighten agitation, anxiety, insomnia and irritability, according to the NIH.Marijuana and teensWhen marijuana use begins in the teen years, it can have a significant impact on brain development, including decreased brain activity, fewer neural fibers in certain areas and a smaller than average hippocampus, which controls learning and memory functions.According to a 2014 Northwestern Medicine study of teen marijuana users, memory-related structures in the brain appeared to shrink, a possible signs of a decrease in neurons. These abnormalities remained two years after the teen stopped using marijuana, indicating that the drug has long-term effects and look similar to brains of schizophrenics. Those who started using marijuana after 21 generally do not experience the same type of brain abnormalities as those who started using the drug earlier.Long-term users report that they sometimes have trouble thinking clearly, organizing their thoughts, multitasking and remembering things. Sustained marijuana use can also slow reaction times in some individuals.Another study by the University of Montreal published in the journal Development and Psychopathology in 2016 found similar results after researching almost 300 students. Those that started smoking around age 14 did worse on some cognitive tests than non-smokers. The study found that pot smokers also have a higher school dropout rate. Those that waited to start around age 17 did not seem to have the same impairments. How marijuana affects the bodyMarijuana smoke can cause many of the same respiratory problems experienced by tobacco smokers, such as increased daily cough and phlegm production, more frequent acute chest illnesses such as bronchitis, and a greater instance of lung infections, according to NIDA .While it had been thought that there was a connection between marijuana smoking and increased risk of lung cancer, even those who are heavy marijuana users do not appear to be at greater risk for lung cancer , according to a 2013 study by Dr. Donald Tashkin, UCLA professor of pulmonary and critical care medicine.A 2017 study by the Einstein Medical Center in Philadelphia found that those who used marijuana were 26 percent more likely to have a stroke than those who did not use marijuana. Those studied were also 10 percent more likely to have developed heart failure.Marijuana can also raise heart rate by 20 percent to 100 percent shortly after smoking and the effect can last up to three hours, according to NIDA. Marijuana also can reduce sperm production in men and disrupts a woman's menstrual cycle, according to NIDA.While it is widely thought that marijuana is not addictive, about 30 percent users may have some degree of marijuana use disorder, according to NIDA . Long-term marijuana users who try to quit experience cravings, irritability, sleeplessness, decreased appetite and anxiety — some of the same physical symptoms of those trying to quit other types of drugs or alcohol. A 2016 study found a link between certain genetic markers and symptoms of marijuana addiction , suggesting that some people may have a genetic predisposition to marijuana addiction. That same study showed some overlap between the genetic risk factors for marijuana dependence and the genetic risk factors for depression, suggesting a possible reason why these two conditions often occur together, the researchers said.You might not think marijuana and quizzes go together, but on the assumption that you arrived at this quiz sober, we pose some serious questions that will require your utmost attention and critical thinking skills.

Salil Sheety, who has been the groups Secretary General since 2010, accused Trump of hateful politics and being a threat to human rights across the globe.President Trump takes actions that violate human rights at home and abroad, the group reports. He put Trump in the same group as the barbaric leaders of Egypt, the Philippines, Venezuela, Russia and China who Sheety said, are callously undermining the rights of millions.Donald Trumps politics may have marked a new era of human rights regression but they are not unique, said Shetty. The specters of hatred and fear now loom large in world affairs, he continued, and we have few governments standing up for human rights in these disturbing times.Add your name to millions demanding Congress take action on the Presidents crimes. IMPEACH TRUMP & PENCE!Along with Trumps treatment of womens rights, LGBTQ rights and his politics that were discriminatory or otherwise contradicted international human rights principles, Shetty singled out Trumps travel bans aimed at Muslim-majority countries as a transparently hateful move.Shetty added that the bans, some which have survived court challenges, set the scene for a year in which leaders took the politics of hate to its most dangerous conclusion.The report also cites Trumps views on immigration and immigrants as examples of these hateful new policies. Those include his plan to build a wall along the US-Mexico border, increased detention of asylum seekers and their families, increased immigration and customs enforcement, penalties against sanctuary cities and prioritized deportation of migrants.The report also sheds light on human rights abuses such as the termination of the Central American Minors program last August, which had allowed those under 21 to flee violence in Central America if their parents already had achieved legal status in the U.S.It notes that more than 17,000 unaccompanied children and 26,000 people who were caught illegally enting the U.S. at the Mexican border between January and August were detained for months, many without proper access to medical care and legal counsel.The report notes that since September the Trump administration has worked to end the Deferred Action for Childhood Arrivals (DACA) program, placing 800,000 individuals brought to the U.S. as children at risk of being deported.Trump then worked to stop the passage of the Dream Act to allow those who had DACA status to meet requirements to maintain their eligibility and get full legal status.The report also cites Trumps efforts against womens rights which it reports were broad and multi-faceted.President Trumps administration, continues the report, overturned politics that required universities to investigate sexual violence as gender discrimination and suspended equal pay initiatives that had helped women identify whether they were being paid less than male colleagues.Attacks on womens reproductive rights were particularly virulent, states the report. That includes attacks on funding for Planned Parenthood, a government issued rules exempting employers from promotion health insurance coverage for contraception, and the introduction of the global gag rule which prohibits financial assistance to any hospital or organization that provides information about safe, legal abortions.The rights of gay people were also reduced, marginalized or eliminated in many cases under Trump. The report, in particular, cites the marginalization of transgender people, including the elimination of guidelines that protected them in school, gave them access to public facilities and Trumps effort to ban them from the military.The group also raises a red flag about Trumps treatment of both domestic and foreign nationals accused of terrorism crimes, charging that the president flouted the presumption of innocence in a series of posts on Twitter in which he called for the death penalty.Trump also ended impunity for the systematic human rights violations of detainees at the prison in Guantanamo and elsewhere, and opened the door to a renewal of torture methods that had been banned under President Obama and the renewal of secret detention programs by the CIA.The report also points out that programs to stop mistreatment of minorities in the U.S. were rolled back, as the number of killings by law enforcement rose. African Americans who comprised 13 percent of the population represented nearly 23 percent of victims in 2017, states the report.The mistreatment of the mentally ill, the use of non-lethal weapons by police that turns out to actually be very lethal and the rise in gun violence and mass murders are all detailed in the new report, while funding for government studies of how to deal with gun violence was lowed or killed off.The use of the death penalty also rose in the U.S. under Trump, with more states executing prisoners than had happened in years.During the year, notes the report, four inmates were exonerated of the crimes for which they were originally sentenced to death in the states of Delaware, Florida, Arkansas, and Louisiana, bringing to 160 the number of such cases since 1973,The report criticizes what it termed the feeble response by world leaders like Trump to human rights issues, and what it called the willingness to tout fake news in order to manipulate public opinion.This was also the year that Trump changed Americas foreign policy to eliminate human rights as a factor in relationships with other countries.In fact, we saw Trump embrace, meet with and praise many dictators and authoritarians who abused the democratic system to stay in power while damaging relationships with longtime allies who are true democracies and do work to provide human rights to all.Through changes in trade politics, refusal to keep commitments to address the global climate crisis and in other ways, Trump embraced big business at the expense of individual citizens.This 400-page report from Amnesty International details much of this horror story, which unfortunately continues to grow worse by the day, week, month and year under Trump.Add your name to millions demanding Congress take action on the Presidents crimes.

It happened on Nov. 7, 2012, the day after Mitt Romney lost what had been presumed to be a winnable race against President Obama. Republicans were spiraling into an identity crisis, one that had some wondering whether a GOP president would ever sit in the Oval Office again. But on the 26th floor of a golden Manhattan tower that bears his name, Trump was coming to the conclusion that his own moment was at hand. And in typical fashion, the first thing he thought about was how to brand it. One after another, phrases popped into his head. “We Will Make America Great.” That one did not have the right ring. Then, “Make America Great.” But that sounded like a slight to the country. “I said, ‘That is so good.’ I wrote it down,” Trump recalled in an interview. “I went to my lawyers. I have a lot of lawyers in-house. We have many lawyers. I have got guys that handle this stuff. Five days later, Trump signed an application with the U.S. Patent and Trademark Office, in which he asked for exclusive rights to use “Make America Great Again” for “political action committee services, namely, promoting public awareness of political issues and fundraising in the field of politics.” He enclosed a $325 registration fee. His was a vision that ran against the conventional wisdom of the time — in fact, it was “much the opposite,” Trump said. To save itself, the Republican establishment was convinced, the GOP would have to sand off its edges, become kinder and more inclusive. “Make America Great Again” was divisive and backward-looking. It made no nod to diversity or civility or progress. It sounded like a death wish. But Trump had seen something different in the country, and in the daily lives of its struggling citizens. “I felt that jobs were hurting,” he said. “I looked at the many types of illness our country had, and whether it’s at the border, whether it’s security, whether it’s law and order or lack of law and order. Democrats slammed it. “If you’re looking for someone to say what is wrong with America, I’m not your candidate. I think there is more right than wrong,” Democratic nominee Hillary Clinton said. “I don’t think we have to make America great. Her husband, former president Bill Clinton, went so far as to declare it a racist dog whistle. “I’m actually old enough to remember the good old days, and they weren’t all that good in many ways,” he said at a rally in Orlando. The slogan itself was not entirely original. Ronald Reagan and George H.W. Bush had used “Let’s Make America Great Again” in their 1980 campaign — a fact that Trump maintained he did not know until about a year ago. “But he didn’t trademark it,” Trump said of Reagan. His decision to claim legal ownership reflected a businessman’s mind-set. “I think I’m somebody that understands marketing,” Trump said. Trump Organization lawyer Alan Garten said Trump holds upward of 800 trademarks in more than 80 countries. The trademark became effective on July 14, 2015, a month after Trump formally announced his campaign and met the legal requirement that he was actually using it for the purposes spelled out in his application. Having won the trademark, Trump was aggressive in protecting his idea. When his GOP primary rivals Sen. Ted Cruz (Tex.) and Wisconsin Gov. Scott Walker began tucking “make America great again” into their own speeches, Trump’s lawyers fired off cease-and-desist letters. Trump was an impulsive and erratic candidate who ran a chaotic campaign. “I didn’t know it was going to catch on like it did. It’s been amazing,” Trump said. There were plenty of snickers when his Federal Election Commission filings showed that his campaign was spending more on “Make America Great Again” trucker caps than on polling, political consultants, staff or television ads. “An appropriate icon for his failing campaign,” the Washington Examiner’s Philip Wegmann wrote in late October. Trump saw the hats as a fundraising and advertising vehicle. He was thrilled when his campaign headgear landed in the New York Times Style section — during Fashion Week, no less. “In the Style section, it was the ornament — what do you call that? — an accessory. They said the accessory of the year. You know the hat. You’d see people going to the fanciest balls at the Waldorf Astoria wearing red hats,” he exulted. As is often the case, Trump’s description is more than a little hyperbolic. None of which fazed the celebrity billionaire who had debuted the hats by wearing one during a July 2015 trip to the Mexican border — or the legions of supporters who raced to snap them up. Trump had designed them himself, he said. The basic models sold through his campaign website were priced at $25. “How many did we sell? Does anyone know? Millions!” Trump said in the interview. “It was copied, unfortunately. It was knocked off by 10 to one. It was knocked off by others. However many hats he sold, what cannot be disputed is that “Make America Great Again” caught on. It was the most effective kind of political message, bite-sized and visceral. “It actually inspired me,” Trump said, “because to me, it meant jobs. It meant industry, and meant military strength. It meant taking care of our veterans. That kind of mission statement was something that Clinton’s campaign — for all its poll testing and high-priced advice from Madison Avenue — struggled to articulate. Her strategists considered 85 possibilities for a general-election campaign slogan before settling on “Stronger Together,” according to an email from the account of campaign chairman John Podesta that was published by WikiLeaks. What they were up against was nothing short of “a marketing genius,” said David Axelrod, who had been Obama’s chief political strategist. Trump “understood the market that he was trying to reach. You can’t deny him that. While Clinton carried the popular vote, Trump lined up the states he needed to win what mattered: the electoral college. Halfway through his interview with The Washington Post, Trump shared a bit of news: He already has decided on his slogan for a reelection bid in 2020. “Are you ready?” he said. “Get me my lawyer!” the president-elect shouted. Two minutes later, one arrived. “Will you trademark and register, if you would, if you like it — I think I like it, right? Do this: ‘Keep America Great,’ with an exclamation point. With and without an exclamation. ‘Keep America Great,’ ” Trump said. “Got it,” the lawyer replied. That bit of business out of the way, Trump returned to the interview. “I never thought I’d be giving [you] my expression for four years [from now],” he said. “But I am so confident that we are going to be, it is going to be so amazing. It’s the only reason I give it to you. All of which raises the questions: How can greatness be measured and sensed? What does it even mean? “Being a great president has to do with a lot of things, but one of them is being a great cheerleader for the country,” Trump said. “And we’re going to show the people as we build up our military, we’re going to display our military. “That military may come marching down Pennsylvania Avenue. That military may be flying over New York City and Washington, D.C., for parades. I mean, we’re going to be showing our military,” he added. The president-elect has an ambitious to-do list for the next four years: building stronger borders, keeping the country safe against terrorism, producing more jobs, repealing the Affordable Care Act, replacing it with something better, promoting excellence in engineering and science, investing in modern infrastructure. Ultimately, it will be up to the people for whom “Make America Great Again” was a covenant, not a slogan, to decide whether the 45th president has lived up to his promise. “I think they have to feel it,” Trump acknowledged. “Honestly, you haven’t seen anything yet. Wait till you see what happens, starting next Monday,” he said. “A lot of things are going to happen. He has been holding interviews and meetings as he prepares to enter the White House. Wait 1 second to continue. Alice Crites contributed to this report.",2017/01/17,snopes,1

(The Oregonian)Commentagreen@oregonian.comThe Oregonian/OregonLiveRoughly a third of the people arrested in the past week of anti-Trump demonstrations in Portland apparently didn't vote in the election they were protesting . Thirty-six of the 112 arrested people -- 32 percent -- were registered in Oregon but didn't return ballots, according to data compiled by the Multnomah County Elections Division. The data showed 31 people -- 28 percent -- did vote in Oregon.But the figures leave unanswered questions:The Elections Division determined that another 36 of the people weren't registered in Oregon at the time of the Nov. 8 election -- but that doesn't mean they weren't registered in another state, said spokesman Eric Sample.There's no specific time period when someone living in Oregon must register to vote here instead of their home state, he said. That's particularly common among out-of-state college students.So it's possible that some or all of those 36 people who weren't registered in Oregon could have voted in other states.What's more, Sample said, a state-by-state search would be necessary to determine whether those 36 people are registered elsewhere.The Election Division also wasn't able to account for the voter participation of five protesters because it lacked middle names for those people or birth dates.Of the 112 protesters who were arrested, four were under age 18 -- in other words, too young to vote.The Elections Division came up with the results after running the names and ages of the protesters through its Oregon database and looking for matches in response to a public records request by KGW-TV. The Elections Division also provided the results Tuesday to The Oregonian/OregonLive, but the numbers are different from those reported by KGW, in part because the division had updated information.The Oregonian/OregonLive is independently researching who among the arrested protesters voted in Oregon as well as Washington, by checking voter participation records. But, like the Elections Division, the news organization has run into some roadblocks, such as acquiring the arrested person's date of birth to make a match to voter records.Stay tuned for a story about those results when they're available.-- Aimee Green",2016/11/15,snopes,1
https://www.snopes.com/fact-check/after-school-satan-clubs/,"a group called the satanic temple wants to establish after school satan clubs in public schools to introduce children to the ""religion of darkness."" see example( s )",Mixture,"['religion and school', ' satanic temple', ' satanism']",https://www.washingtonpost.com/,https://www.washingtonpost.com/local/education/an-after-school-satan-club-could-be-coming-to-your-kids-elementary-school/2016/07/30/63f485e6-5427-11e6-88eb-7dda4e2f2aec_story.html?hpid=hp_hp-top-table-main_afterschoolsatan-5pm%3Ahomepage%2Fstory,2016/08/01,"SALEM, Mass. —It’s a hot summer night, and leaders of the Satanic Temple have gathered in the crimson­-walled living room of a Victorian manse in this city renowned for its witch trials in the 17th century. They’re watching a sepia-toned video, in which children dance around a maypole, a spider crawls across a clown’s face and eerie, ambient chanting gives way to a backward, demonic voice-over. The group chuckles with approval. They’re here plotting to bring their wisdom to the nation’s public elementary school children. They point out that Christian evangelical groups already have infiltrated the lives of America’s children through after-school religious programming in public schools, and they appear determined to give young students a choice: Jesus or Satan. “It’s critical that children understand that there are multiple perspectives on all issues, and that they have a choice in how they think,” said Doug Mesner, the Satanic Temple’s co-founder. On Monday, the group plans to introduce its After School Satan Club to public elementary schools, including one in Prince George’s County, petitioning school officials to allow them to open immediately as the academic year starts. Chapter heads from New York, Boston, Utah and Arizona were in Salem on July 10 talking strategy, with others from Minneapolis, Detroit, San Jose, New Orleans, Pittsburgh and Florida participating online. The promotional video, which feels like a mash-up of a horror movie trailer and a “Saturday Night Live” sketch, will serve to promote the new club along with its website — Afterschoolsatan.com. The Satanic Temple — which has been offering tongue-in-cheek support for the fallen angel in public arenas that have embraced prayer and parochial ceremonies — is bringing its fight over constitutional separation of church and state to the nation’s schools. But the group’s plan for public schoolchildren isn’t actually about promoting worship of the devil. The Satanic Temple doesn’t espouse a belief in the existence of a supernatural being that other religions identify solemnly as Satan, or Lucifer, or Beelzebub. The Temple rejects all forms of supernaturalism and is committed to the view that scientific rationality provides the best measure of reality. According to Mesner, who goes by the professional name of Lucien Greaves, “Satan” is just a “metaphorical construct” intended to represent the rejection of all forms of tyranny over the human mind. The curriculum for the proposed after-school clubs emphasizes the development of reasoning and social skills. The group says meetings will include a healthful snack, literature lesson, creative learning activities, a science lesson, puzzle solving and an art project. Every child will receive a membership card and must have a signed parental­ permission slip to attend. “We think it’s important for kids to be able to see multiple points of view, to reason things through, to have empathy and feelings of benevolence for their fellow human beings,” said the Satanic Temple’s Utah chapter head, who goes by the name Chalice Blythe. The emphasis on multiple perspectives is a hint pointing to the Temple’s true foe. The group at first intends to roll out the clubs in a limited number of schools in districts that also host an evangelical Christian after-school program known as the Good News Club. Good News Clubs, which are sponsored by an organization founded in 1937 called the Child Evangelism Fellowship (CEF), aim to reach children as young as 5 with a fundamentalist form of evangelical Christianity. For most of their history, Good News Clubs were largely excluded from public schools out of concern that their presence would violate the Constitution. In 2001, in a case that commanded the resources of powerful legal advocacy groups on the religious right, including the Alliance Defending Freedom and the Liberty Counsel, the U.S. Supreme Court ruled that to exclude an after-school program on account of the religious views of its sponsors amounted to a violation of free-speech rights. The CEF then went on a tear, and by 2011, it reported 3,560 Good News Clubs, putting them in more than 5 percent of the nation’s public elementary schools. The Satanic Temple makes no secret of its desire to use that same approach. “We would like to thank the Liberty Counsel specifically for opening the doors to the After School Satan Clubs through their dedication to religious liberty,” Greaves explained to the gathering of chapter heads in Salem. Should The Satanic Temple be allowed to open After School Satan Clubs in elementary schools? Yes they should be allowed. Pardon the interruption! We need to verify that you are an actual person. Yes they should be allowed. This is a non-scientific user poll. Results are not statistically valid and cannot be assumed to reflect the views of Washington Post users as a group or the general population. The Liberty Counsel agrees that the Satanic Temple has a right to organize its clubs in public schools and takes the view that they can’t be banned so long as they’re not disruptive or engaging in rituals that put people at risk. “I would definitely oppose after­-school Satanic clubs, but they have a First Amendment right to meet,” said Mat Staver, Liberty Counsel’s founder and chairman. “I suspect, in this particular case, I can’t imagine there’s going to be a lot of students participating in this. The Satanic Temple is eager to compete directly with the Good News Clubs and doesn’t hide its belief that its own after-school product is on the right side. “While the Good News Clubs focus on indoctrination, instilling children with a fear of hell and God’s wrath, After School Satan Clubs will focus on free inquiry and rationalism,” Greaves said. Good News Club leaders have defended their organization’s presence in public schools. According to the Good News Club’s website, “each club includes a clear presentation of the Gospel and an opportunity for children to trust the Lord Jesus as Savior. Amy Jensen, a professional educator in Tucson who has a master’s degree in curriculum, instruction and teaching from the University of Denver, says she has decided to lead an After School Satan Club after comparing its curriculum materials with those of the Good News Club. Jensen noted that the Satanic Temple’s materials say the group encourages benevolence and empathy among all people, and advocates practical common sense. “As a teacher, if I were deciding whether to teach that or the fear and hatred of other people’s beliefs, which is what Good News Clubs teach, I would choose what the Satanic Temple has available,” she said. Like all ASSC teachers, Jensen is a volunteer. To cover After School Satan Club costs, including facility use fees and curriculum materials, the Satanic Temple is launching a crowdfunding campaign — which is how it covers many of its initiatives. The blend of political activism, religious critique and performance art that characterizes the After School Satan Club proposal is not a new approach for the Satanic Temple. It is just the most recent in a series of efforts that have made the Temple famous and notorious. In 2014, after the Supreme Court ruled that the regular recitation of prayers before town meetings did not violate the First Amendment, provided that towns do not discriminate among religions, the Temple decided to test just how much religious liberty towns allowed. They volunteered to perform a Satanic benediction in an Arizona town where the board had regularly opened with a Christian prayer. In that case, the town preferred to abolish the practice of opening prayers. In this and other instances — such as when the Satanic Temple proposed the installation of a statue of Baphomet in Oklahoma in response to a stone monument emblazoned with the Ten Commandments — the thrust of the Temple’s activism has been to prevent religious groups from claiming the mantle of implicit state endorsement. The group’s activism has much in common with a movement started a decade ago, when Bobby Henderson of the Church of the Flying Spaghetti Monster penned an open letter to the Kansas School Board in 2005, citing fears that the introduction of teaching religious intelligent design alongside the theory of evolution would inculcate public school students with Christian thought. Henderson argued that believing that there is a benevolent deity made of spaghetti and meatballs is just as legitimate as believing in God. Like the Satanic Temple, the Pastafarians insist that theirs is a genuine religion. “The Church of FSM is legit, and backed by hard science. Anything that comes across as humor or satire is purely coincidental,” Henderson says on his website. “Let me make this clear: we are not anti-religion, we are anti-crazy nonsense done in the name of religion. Greaves likewise insists that the Satanic Temple is much more than satire: “We’ve moved well beyond being a simple political ploy and into being a very sincere movement that seeks to separate religion from superstition,” he said. The Satanic Temple expects to face opposition to its after-school proposal. When the group sought to erect the Baphomet monument, the Oklahoma governor’s office dismissed the proposal as “absurd,” and right-wing activists joined the attack. Given the fight ahead and the long odds of pushing Christianity out of public schools, an important question about the After School Satan Clubs is: Does the Satanic Temple really want religion — even its own — in public schools? Greaves is blunt: “We are only doing this because Good News Clubs have created a need for this. If Good News Clubs would operate in churches rather than public schools, that need would disappear. In the 2001 Supreme Court ruling, Justice David Souter penned a scathing dissent. The Satanic Temple probably wasn’t front and center in his thinking. Yet it appears determined to prove him correct.

The fish, though exotic, is a Pacu, not a piranha. None the less they caution male swimmers to protect their privates when swimming in the sound.Pacu teeth.

It's the first time this species has been caught in the wild in Scandinavia,"" says Associate Professor and fish expert Peter Rask Møller of the Natural History Museum of Denmark , University of Copenhagen .Caught by hobby fishermanThe frightening fish was caught by hobby fisherman Einar Lindgreen on August 4. As he emptied his nets north of Danish isle Saltholm in the strait Oresund which seperates Denmark and Sweden he saw the red-bellied bigtooth among eels and perch. Back in the harbour the exotic fish caused quite an uproar, as several of Lindgreens colleagues were convinced that they were staring at a South American Piranha. Fortunately the fish was sent for study at the Natural History Museum of Denmark. Here Peter Rask Møller and fellow fish expert Henrik Carl examined the animal. Their calming communique for Danish bathers is that the fish is not a Piranha but a close South American relative; the Pacu.Pacu. Photo: Henrik CarlThough the Pacu, like its cousin the Piranha, belongs in waters like the Amazon it has found its way to other waters around the globe by way of aquariums and fish farms. In large parts of the USA and Asia it is now considered an invasive species. It grows to as much as 25 kilograms and is a popular fish for farming and eating. But how this fish ended up in Scandinavian waters is a bit of a puzzler.Some have imagined that it escaped from the recently established The Blue Planet - Denmark's Aquarium. This Copenhagen attraction is situated right next to Oresund and gets its water from there.But that is flat out impossible assures curator at The Blue Planet Lars Skou Olsen.""We do exhibit Pacus in our Amazonas exhibition, but ours are a lot larger than the one caught. And even though the distance between our aquariums and Øresund can be measured in meters there are sophisticated filters in place to avoid contamination. So this is not one of our fish,"" assures Olsen.The usual suspects""Amateur aquarium owners and fish farmers are ""The usual suspects"" when we meet fish where they do not belong,"" says Peter Rask Møller.""It is not unlikely that someone has emptied their fish tank into a nearby stream just before a vacation and that the Pacu then swam out into the brackish waters of Oresund. We don't know of any commercial farming of Pacus in Europe. But just like the Piranhas the Pacus are quite easy for amateurs to raise,"" says Møller.Danish boy Malthe with Pacu. Photo: Henrik CarlOnly once before has a Pacu been caught anywhere in Europe. That was in 2002, when a sportsfisher hooked one near a power plant on the Odra river in Poland.""The river Odra empties into the Baltic Sea very close to Denmark,"" says Peter Rask Møller.The Pacu is known as the peaceful cousin of the Piranha as it is largely vegetarian. Their powerful teeth are not as sharp as those of the Piranhas, but they are fully capable of severing fishing lines and even fingers.""In order to be one hundred percent certain of the identification we will now perform a genetic examination, as there are several species of Pacu which are very similar when young. In the aqua culture busines they even produce hybrids between species,"" explains Peter Rask Møller.The teeth are used mainly to crush nuts and other fruits, but the Pacu eats fish and small invertebrates as well. Its preference for nuts have had fatal results though. In Papua New Guinea where the species has also escaped it is rumoured to have mistaken nuts for male reproductive organs. So anyone choosing to bathe in the Øresund these days had best keep their swimsuits well tied.Contact",2013/08/12,snopes,1

Refuse Fascism is publishing the written notes for a presentation that Andy Zee, a member of the Advisory Board of Refuse Fascism, made to a national meeting of leaders of Refuse Fascism. After discussion, the meeting affirmed the decision to issue the Call for November 4 and developed plans for Regional Conferences on August 19 to build and organize for November 4. Andy Zee began by reading the Call for November 4, which we are reprinting below. His speech follows. NO! This Nightmare Must End: The Trump/Pence Regime Must Go! In the Name of Humanity, We REFUSE to Accept a Fascist America! Immigrants living in terror—their next step could mean detention, deportation, being torn from children and loved ones. Muslims and refugees demonized, banned and cast out. Millions—children, the elderly, the sick, the poor—denied healthcare, food assistance, the very right to live. Women objectified, degraded, and denied the basic right to control their own reproduction with fundamentalist Christian fascism increasingly being made law. LGBTQ people stigmatized, ostracized, and denied civil rights recently won. Black and Latino people openly threatened by the President, with maximum sentencing, stop-and-frisk going national, intensified police brutality and murder of our youth with no holds barred. People all over the world facing bombings, occupations, war and the threat of nuclear war with Donald Trump’s “America First” finger on the nuclear trigger. The truth bludgeoned—lies and more lies—critical thinking being destroyed in education and public discourse. The whole planet in peril from a regime that denies global warming and shreds all environmental protections. A regime step by step discarding basic democratic rights, targeting group after group, and suppressing dissent and resistance. A regime unleashing the violence of fascist thugs. This is fascism—a qualitative change in how society is governed. History has shown that fascism must be stopped before it becomes too late. THIS NIGHTMARE MUST END. Millions feel this and ache with the question of how to stop this unrelenting horror. The stakes are nothing less than the future of humanity and the planet itself. Who will end this nightmare? We will. Only the determined struggle of millions of people acting together with courage and conviction can drive this regime from power. Only the determined struggle of millions of people acting together with courage and conviction can drive this regime from power. This Nightmare Must End: the Trump/Pence Regime Must Go! Our actions will reflect the values of respect for all of humanity and the world we want—in stark contrast to the hate and bigotry of the Trump/Pence fascist regime. Our determination to persist and not back down will compel the whole world to take note. Every force and faction in the power structure would be forced to respond to our demand. The cracks and divisions among the powers already evident today will sharpen and widen. As we draw more and more people forward to stand up, all of this could lead to a situation where this illegitimate regime is removed from power. Spread the word and organize now. Be a part of making history. Don’t let it be said that you stood aside when there was still a chance to stop a regime that imperils humanity and the Earth itself. Join in taking to the streets and the public squares day after day and night after night demonstrating that In the Name of Humanity, We REFUSE to Accept a Fascist America. This Nightmare Must End: The Trump/Pence Regime Must GO! On November 4, 2017, We Begin, This Nightmare Must End: The Trump/Pence Regime Must GO! Available in 40x60"" & 36x54"" sizes. These hard hitting posters are an indictment of what the Trump/Pence Regime has done and is doing. They concentrate the facts of the regime’s efforts to consolidate fascism. They drive home why, in the interests of humanity, the Trump/Pence Regime “Must GO!” People are being led by mass media to think “Trump really hasn’t been able to accomplish anything yet.” People need a much fuller grasp of the aims of this regime, and the direction it is pushing in. “This Nightmare Must End” captures how millions of people feel right now. This feeling is at times inchoate and, at others, it enrages. It disturbs sleep, dominates conversation. For immigrants and Muslims it is terror that is lived—a foreboding pervading every aspect of life. Where you never know if this is the day you will be snatched from family and the life you have made—perhaps to be returned to a place you don’t know where you may face persecution or even death. Millions of people agonize over every move of the regime and they worry about the specter of worse to come. They feel trapped in the kind of nightmare from which you desperately need an escape—desperately hoping to wake up so as to put the terror behind you. Adding “This Nightmare Must End” to our demand speaks very broadly to how people feel. People feel that somehow this must end and yearn for a way out. Refuse Fascism is the hope and the way to drive the Trump/Pence Regime from power. What people don’t know, and need to know, is that THEY ARE THE WAY OUT OF THE NIGHTMARE, if they join together and act outside all the normal avenues that they expect society and government to provide for redress of their concerns—outside the ways that they would normally think of to act themselves for remedy. Waiting for investigations, waiting for the Democrats to act, thinking that Trump will implode, hoping for 2018 Congressional elections, even protesting each abuse—as righteous and part of people raising their heads as such protest is, these are all acting within the normal frameworks that people have grown accustomed to thinking and acting within for change in policy and direction. But change, even under “normal” times, rarely comes without ferocious struggle if it is not change in the interests of at least some of those in power. BUT EVEN MORE, THERE IS NOTHING NORMAL ABOUT THE TRUMP/PENCE REGIME. FASCISM IS NOT NORMAL. Refuse Fascism is up against what society is up against. Fascism is not the normal way that this country has been ruled. While more and more people are coming to see the qualitative change that the Trump/Pence Regime is bringing, we have a society-wide struggle to wage with people to recognize and come to grips with the reality that with the election of Trump there is a fascist qualitative change in the social, political, and cultural norms of how this society is governed and ruled. The abnormality of Trump consistently gets focused on his narcissistic psychology and/or his financial and other misdeeds, and what is not confronted is the radical tearing up of the norms of society and in its place new fascist norms being cemented into place. Again, there is a break with what have been the norms we confront, and to deal with this there must be a break with the “normal” ways people seek change from government. The normal forms of petition and protest DO NOT APPLY with Trump—even as they have been difficult enough under the normal functioning of this system. So we constantly hear the talking heads on cable news, or commentators on social media critiquing and mocking Trump’s outrageous tweets and utterances, his disregard for the truth, his overall buffoonery and his flaunting of the norms of society. And they not only gloss over the full scale and scope of his program and almost never mention its fascist character, but they also consistently “advise” the regime on how to govern “normally.” THE PROBLEM is Trump glories in breaking the norms—and that is why he was elected by a social base that has been riled up for decades behind a racist, misogynist, anti-immigrant program. They believe Trump’s outsider outrageousness and his flaunting of the norms shows that he can and will deliver. The program of the Democrats and their media mouthpieces is restoring the norms. So people who hate and oppose the regime are being led to look to all the ways I mentioned before: elections, hearings, investigations, and protest as usual to “make their voices heard,” as if we are dealing with a normal regime. We are not. We need to learn from those times in the history of this country, and from around the world, when people stepped outside the normal channels to struggle for their demand. Just this past winter tens, and then hundreds, of thousands of people took to the streets in the capital of South Korea—eventually every day and night—to demand the ouster of the president. After almost four months, they succeeded. We should recognize, and hold firmly to, our demand that the whole REGIME must go. This is a tremendous strength of Refuse Fascism. No one else, no other organization, has raised this demand. Yet, many are paralyzed at the thought of Trump being removed and ending up with Mike Pence. Their repulsion at Pence is warranted. Pence is now the political leader of a theocratic Christian fundamentalism—that we should more accurately call Christian fascism. Decades in the making, the roots of this are gone into extensively in The Truth About Right-Wing Conspiracy… And Why Clinton and the Democrats Are No Answer and The Coming Civil War, both by Bob Avakian, the Chairman of the Revolutionary Communist Party and architect of the new synthesis of communism. This past week, two Catholic Vatican scholars close to Pope Francis warned U.S. Catholics that the Christian evangelicalism of the Trump/Pence Regime is “not too far apart” from the kind of Islamic fundamentalism that is tearing up the Mideast. The Trump/Pence Regime is saturated with and dependent on this Christian fascist social base, and already they have made huge strides in implementing their agenda, with catastrophic impact on the lives of women and LGBTQ people as well as on medicine, healthcare, and public education. Impact that will disproportionately hurt communities of oppressed nationalities. Christian fascism runs through this regime, from Steve Bannon’s world apocalyptic view of a war for Western (read white) Judeo-Christian civilization on through the Trump cabinet with Rick Perry, Betsy DeVos, Ben Carson, and that vicious nut job now on the Supreme Court—Neil Gorsuch. This is a REGIME—that word matters—it is an amalgam of all the strains of fascism that have run through America’s history which have become forged over the last decades and now, in the context of the huge problems this country and system faces, has come to power. It may have shocked all or some of these fascists movements that Donald Trump is the vehicle that they are riding, but they have recognized it, and now it is so. Bannon and the Nazi Rudy Giuliani have said: THIS is our last chance (even as they have left unsaid, but made clear) to consolidate fascism. In our July 15 message, we posed: “Could it happen here? The Answer: Yes... It is an American Fascism—Manifest Destiny and American exceptionalism—a fascism wrapped in the Bible taken literally and the American flag, saturated with racism, misogyny, and xenophobia.” And, in answering yes, we said: “It is happening and the responsibility falls to all of us to stop it before it chokes off air in society.” The point is: this is not just another normal swing of the pendulum—it is a REGIME bringing about a Fascist America. ONLY REFUSE FASCISM has a PLAN for DRIVING OUT THE WHOLE REGIME, and THIS MATTERS AND IS OUR STRONG SUIT. That REFUSE FASCISM identifies and demands that the whole regime must go is a great strength and should be a magnet for people to get with the vision for November 4. Our two slogans, “This Nightmare Must End, The Trump/Pence Regime Must Go!” and “In the Name of Humanity, We REFUSE to Accept a Fascist America!” concentrate a lot of understanding of the situation that we face and the road forward—they need to be everywhere and everywhere struggled over. Our plan requires thinking and acting, as they say, outside the box. We are calling on people to put a lot on the line—taking to the streets and the public squares day after day and night after night and not stopping. For this to happen more and more people need to understand in a basic way the situation—again, the necessity—that humanity faces with fascism coming to power in the most powerful country in the world. We need to deeply get this too, because if we want others to be strong, we must be no less. The seven panels of indictments we have developed are a tremendous tool—that bring people the brutal reality of what this regime has actually done; what they have said they are going to do; and what their regime has unleashed in the states and in their vigilante fascist groups. We have not fully appreciated the role that these panels can play in mobilizing the people. After reading the panels, people have told us: “I didn’t really know.” The SCALE AND THE SCOPE of what the TRUMP/PENCE FASCIST REGIME HAS DONE IN SIX MONTHS IS BREATHTAKING. The panels have three key dimensions: Education—getting people the facts, the reality (the scale and scope of fascist remaking of society); They are a tool for politically provocative actions—wielding the panels and the research concentrated in them to hound the enemy: the regime, Congress, administrators from agencies such as ICE, the Border Patrol, and more; or, to go out and shake up and wake up those who normalize fascism and distract the people from the real deal going down and steer people away from the fact that there is an organization and a way to fight this—this includes media like CNN and MSNBC, as well as Democrats and social democrats among others; and These panels are a tremendous organizing tool. People can download the panels in different sizes and get them out in their city or neighborhood. We can’t be everywhere, but the panels can be. People want to form a group for November 4? Hold a discussion on each of the panels in light of the Refuse Fascism Call to Action and the November 4th Call, and take the display out to the people. I will come back to plans at the end of this presentation, but what overall will be decisive in bringing forward masses of people is using this sharp agitation—the exposure of what this fascist regime has done—in politically provocative actions: like the protest outside and inside Trump's recent rally in Youngstown, Ohio; the disruption and protest during the Ann Coulter Politicon panel; or the 100 hours of around-the-clock protest exposing Fox News. In the 1980s and ’90s ACT-UP did a lot of research on AIDS, and they had the goods on the government and what it was not doing to deal with AIDS. But they didn’t just sit on this information—they took creative, disruptive, even shocking actions, and that became a critical form of ACTIVE education that was, at the same time, a form of struggle. What the Trump/Pence Regime has done and is about should shock the conscience, but for all the reasons of “normalization” that I have been talking about, part of what we must do is act in ways that put the “shock the conscience” quality of this fascism in front of people where it can’t be ignored. November 4, 2017, we begin. Why have we set this date? Because without the kind of mass determined opposition of millions of people being in the streets day after day night after night, there is little chance of the whole regime being removed before they are able to cement into place a fascist re-ordering of society. By setting the date, we focus our attention and that of the whole society on the form of political protest that is required. We have recognized that there are two windows that are still open that make it possible to do what we are calling for. First is that the Trump/Pence Regime has not, as yet, been able to fully institute fascism. They have made significant progress, they have plans in the works, but there is still an opening. As we and others have pointed out, it would only take one serious international or domestic incident for that window to suddenly slam shut with the regime taking “emergency” measures. And even without such an incident, things can reach a point through executive measures and laws that the regime pushes through, where the window closes in that way—with the result that fascism is consolidated. This morning Jeff Greenfield, a long-time political commentator, was on CNN, and he argued against the prevailing discourse that Trump is “off track, not able to accomplish anything.” Greenfield said that while we, speaking of the news media and people following the media, have been caught up in the daily onslaught of outrageousness from the Trump White House, the regime has been making significant real progress in advancing their program. He pointed especially to outsourcing the appointment of federal judges to the Federalist Society, which is resulting in appointments to the federal courts of judges in the mold of Supreme Court justice Neil Gorsuch, who will radically reshape law in a reactionary direction for decades. There is a second window that we have pointed to in that there are still millions and millions of people who are not adjusted to or resigned to the Trump/Pence Regime. There is still willingness of masses of people to protest. While protests have not reached the numbers of the Women’s March, and there is a lot of normalization that has taken place, there remain millions of people who are alert. And if they saw and understood that there is a program to really remove this regime, and people acting on it, they could be moved to act. With the actions on July 15, we put on the political map that there is a national movement dedicated to fighting for the demand that the whole Trump/Pence Regime Must Go!—and that organization is Refuse Fascism. The demonstrations were relatively small, hundreds in key cities, yet people came forward in the face of threats and the presence of organized fascists. In LA, when the fascists began chanting “USA! USA!” they were answered with chants of “Humanity First! Humanity First!” We should grasp the potential and the significance of that. We should not fail to appreciate and build on the embryo of July 15. Yet we do not have the numbers or enough leaders right now for what is needed to begin on November 4. We can get them in the next two and half months. This proposal is made in full recognition of the huge leap in our work, and for the millions of people who want the nightmare to end. First, we must understand that the kind of struggle that we are calling for on November 4th is absolutely essential. Waiting till next year could well be too late. There is freedom in really understanding this. To just keep on keeping on with what we and other forces have been doing will very likely lead to real catastrophe. Understanding that hard truth opens up and compels us, together with many other people, to find and fight for the ways and means to meet that necessity that is objectively posed and underscored by setting a date to begin. The principle here is that really understanding the necessity we face opens up the potential to find and act on new freedom to transform that necessity. We should clearly understand that we are not organizing for November 4 in a situation where nothing else is happening but us and the Trump/Pence Regime. Quite the opposite. Every social force in society is in the mix in one way or another. The process of organizing and leading towards November 4 will be the back and forth, the interrelationship between what the Trump/Pence Regime does, what other fascist forces do, how the Democrats and even some Republicans conciliate with and also object to and oppose the regime, what other social forces do—the analyses they put forth and the struggles they initiate, as well as actions and events in the world from other governments, and even natural disasters (recall Katrina1); AND, all of this in relation to what Refuse Fascism puts forth and does. We will have to lead through a contentious mix of forces and events consistently putting forth our position as concentrated in the two Calls (the Call for November 4 and Refuse Fascism’s founding statement) and leading struggle as part of organizing to make a real beginning on November 4. By calling for November 4, we will actually be in a far stronger position, should masses of people come out in response to a breaking event in large numbers, to advance the date to earlier, if conditions emerge that make that possible. There is another important dimension to comprehend about why only the people through mass struggle in the ways that Refuse Fascism is calling for could lead to removing the whole regime and a positive outcome. The Democrats, along with the New York Times and the Washington Post, etc., are seeking to resolve the crisis with the Trump presidency on the terms of this system, and in the interests of the ruling class of this system, which they represent. We, the masses of people, must go all out, and mobilize ourselves in the millions, to resolve this in our interests, in the interests of humanity, which are fundamentally different from and opposed to those of the ruling class. This, of course, does not mean that the struggle among the powers-that-be is irrelevant or unimportant; rather, the way to understand and approach this (and this is a point that must also be repeatedly driven home to people, including through necessary struggle, waged well) is in terms of how it relates to, and what openings it can provide for, “the struggle from below”—for the mobilization of masses of people around the demand that the whole regime must go, because of its fascist nature and actions and what the stakes are for humanity. From my point of view, what is concentrated in these two paragraphs is extremely important and helpful to understanding the dynamics at play in the situation we face and the plan we have put forward—even as it is not necessary for people in Refuse Fascism to share this analysis of the system and its ruling class that is concentrated in these paragraphs. There are two points I want to underscore here. The first paragraph concentrates the reason why the people must take independent action outside the normal confines of two-party politics. The Democrats will not and cannot provide an answer that is in the interests of humanity to this fascism because they are part of the same system which has created the conditions that gave rise to and foster this fascism. As we saw when Trump launched missiles at Syria, the Democrats applauded, showing that when it comes to fundamental interests of their empire, they share with the fascist section of the ruling class a belligerent grotesque American chauvinism. Listen to the praises of the Democrats for the Generals John Kelly and Mad Dog Mattis. When Trump in his State of the Union address sang the praises of one of the Navy SEALs from the January raid in Yemen, CNN commentator Van Jones gushed that in that moment, Donald Trump ""became President."" Second, as the new Refuse Fascism Call for November 4 says: “The cracks and divisions among the powers already evident today will sharpen and widen. As we draw more and more people forward to stand up, all of this could lead to a situation where this illegitimate regime is removed from power.” In other words, the infighting among the rulers—between the Democrats and the Republicans, and things like the Mueller investigation—all provide openings for the struggle from below. Without that struggle from below, these cracks at the top will either amount to nothing, or will resolve in ways that could be bad for the people—such as with Pence put in power with all factions of the ruling class firmly uniting behind him and the fascist program intact. Before moving to our immediate plans, I want to underscore again that a key obstacle that we must overcome is people today having little experience with truly mass struggle that steps outside the bounds of the normal political processes, including protest as usual. Our actions and our organizing between now and then must make this different way of doing things come alive for masses of people. This is both unprecedented, and at the same time, there are models and experience to learn from. Nixon and his Vice President, Spiro Agnew were both driven from power. More recently in South Korea millions filled the streets night after night, at first starting just on the weekends, and they eventually drove their President from power. The Ukraine, Tahrir Square in Egypt—people in their millions protested day after day night after night creating a political crisis for those in power to remove despised leaders. There were shortcomings for sure, and there are differences, but never, NEVER, underestimate the power of the people when we struggle righteously in the interests of humanity. WE CAN DO THIS. The people are there. The anger is there. If we act creatively with determination, confronting the regime and their representatives and institutions and always doing so in ways that puts the truth to the lies of what they represent. Making people feel through what we do that immigrants, Muslims, women, Blacks, Latinos, LGBTQ, people all over the world are full human beings, showing through word and deed that we will not accept the cruel and brutal future of the Trump/Pence Regime ... that they must GO! And that they, and we, are the ones to make it happen. Before moving to briefly putting out the plans, I want to reiterate that while we should aim for mobilizing millions and put that before people, and if they all came out on November 4 that would be great, but the process is more likely to be, and what we must concretely achieve through our organizing, is that at least several thousand people in each of several key cities begin on November 4, and that through a process, this quickly becomes a platform from which to rapidly call forward and draw forward more and more people. There will be a back-and-forth struggle in the media, among the people, and with the authorities. Through this there will be a dynamic where through ebbs and flows as well as attempts to slander and suppress what we are doing, more and more people can be drawn forward. Where thousands become tens and then hundreds of thousands, and potentially millions. After discussion of the proposal and Call for November 4, 2017, we will discuss the upcoming Regional Conferences on August 19 and develop plans to organize and build for November 4. On November 4, 2017, we will stand together with conviction and courage, overcoming fear and uncertainty, to demand: This Nightmare Must End: The Trump/Pence Regime Must GO! This Nightmare Must End: The Trump/Pence Regime Must GO! 1. Hurricane Katrina was a major hurricane in 2005. In addition to being a devastating natural disaster, Katrina became a significant political and social crisis due to the criminal response of George W. Bush and his administration that dramatically magnified the death, the suffering, the vicious and racist repression and the widespread displacement of those hardest hit, especially larger numbers of Black people.

You’re not alone – plenty of us feel the need to snack as the night progresses, and luckily, studies have deduced the perfect nightcap: wine.You heard us.Recent studies have pointed out that wine can help diabetics and improve your sex drive , but apparently, wine is also a great way to prevent midnight munchies. According to Linda Monk, a 47-year-old woman who’s lost 6 pounds in three weeks, the benefit of having a nightly glass of wine is that the treat suppresses her cravings for unhealthy snacks like “sweet, biscuits, and chocolate.” Instead, the moderate portion of wine makes her feel sated without going to town on the late night eating. Linda is gleaning advice from Tim Ferriss’s book: The 4-Hour Body: An Uncommon Guide To Rapid Weight Loss . Ferriss champions the theory that if you enjoy a little wine in the evening, you’re more likely to feel satisfied and thus less inclined to give up on dieting. Red wine is supposedly preferable to other snacks.According to The Daily Mail, a study that took place over the course of 13 years at Harvard University found that amongst a group of 20,000 women, those who drank half a bottle of wine a day lessened their risk of obesity. As half a bottle is the equivalent of two glasses, Linda and the other women seem to be live proof of the study.40-year-old Samantha Merrit is another woman who sings the praises of nightly wine, claiming “the calories don’t seem to have made an impact on the bathroom scales…Now, I can happily say no to a dessert and I treat myself to a glass or two around four nights a week.” Besides her appetite being satisfied, Merrit also credits the wine with helping her sleep and feeling less anxious.As is always the case, the trick is moderation. While having a glass or two before bed is a good substitute for going crazy on chocolate snacking, drinking too much wine can leave you consuming more calories than a late night binge, and leave you feeling pretty hungover for work. Stick to 1-2 glasses if you want to curb your hunger, sleep better, and feel less deprived.",2015/05/12,snopes,1

The decision to place the capital on land ceded by two pro-slavery states-Virginia and Maryland-ultimately influenced the acquisition of laborers to construct its public buildings. The D.C. commissioners, charged by Congress with building the new city under the direction of the president, initially planned to import workers from Europe to meet their labor needs. However, response to recruitment was dismal and soon they turned to African Americans—both enslaved and free—to provide the bulk of labor that built the White House, the United States Capitol, and other early government buildings.A slave coffle passing the Capitol grounds, 1815, published in A Popular History of the United States, 1876.Library of CongressShow Me MoreStonemason Collen Williamson trained enslaved people on the spot at the government's quarry at Aquia, Virginia.

Her actions say far more about her than about me. I always do my best to treat people, including those I disagree with, respectfully and will continue to do so— Sarah Sanders (@PressSec) June 23, 2018Following her tweet, supporters of President Donald Trump and pro-Trump trolls started targeting the restaurant, its staff, its owner, and her family online. The avalanche of harassment so far has included doxxing her (publishing her personal contact information) on multiple online platforms including Twitter, Facebook, and message boards Voat and 4chan. Previous harassment campaigns organized by pro-Trump trolls have had dangerous , real-life consequences for their targets, including acts of violence and potentially dangerous pranks.On Voat, pro-Trump trolls called for a comprehensive harassment campaign and posted the personal online profiles of the members of the restaurant’s culinary team:Trolls uploaded pictures of the owner’s family, including her son, on 4chan threads that included death threats . They also posted what seemed to be her personal phone number on a now-archived thread:Another since-archived thread included her personal address and called on people to send her some “love mail”:On Twitter, even though the platform specifically prohibits users from sharing such sensitive information, people shared the restaurant owner’s personal phone number:Pro-Trump pages on Facebook were also part of it:The doxxing has been accompanied by promises of violence, and prominent trolls are already connecting the restaurant to the dangerous “Pizzagate” conspiracy theory and to “Q,” a fictitious person from a related conspiracy theory about the “deep state,” “QAnon.” Pro-Trump trolls pushed the Pizzagate conspiracy theory during the 2016 presidential election, claiming that celebrities and Democratic politicians had links to a pedophilia ring hidden in the basement of a Washington, D.C., pizzeria. Even though the conspiracy theory was debunked, the story still inspired a man to open fire inside the family restaurant, which he claimed he had entered to self-investigate.so looks like it took just 24 hrs for the Red Hen to get Pizzagate'd. jesus. pic.twitter.com/doJfh0mPTi— Charlie Warzel (@cwarzel) June 25, 2018It is extremely worrisome to see trolls sharing the restaurant owner’s personal information, particularly given the dangerous incident that followed the targeted harassment of Parkland shooting survivor David Hogg. After trolls made his personal information public and spread it on message boards, someone made a prank call to the police and claimed there was a hostage situation inside Hogg’s home, prompting deployment of an armed police team. The act is known as “swatting,” and it’s a harassment tool that trolls aim at their targets; on at least one occasion, it has proved fatal .Another terrifying consequence of harassment campaigns unleashed by pro-Trump trolls is that they sometimes target parties with no connection to the situation spurring the attacks. In this case, a D.C. restaurant with the same name as the Lexington establishment has been ""bombarded with calls, emails,"" and ""death threats"" -- and was egged over the weekend -- despite having no connection to the Virginia Red Hen. Similarly, after the February school shooting in Parkland, FL, Infowars host Alex Jones accused an innocent man of being the shooter, unleashing “ridicule, harassment, and threats of violence” against him.Media outlets, however, seem to be focusing their coverage on whether the actions of a private business owner who followed her conscience reflect intolerable incivility. Meanwhile, reporting on the dangerous harassment and attacks that have followed is taking a back seat.The fact that Trumpers physically assaulting a restaurant unrelated to the controversy will attract less coverage than Red Hen declining to serve Sanders is a reminder that the actual issue here is the disproportionate clout of conservative propaganda television and not civility.— Matthew Yglesias (@mattyglesias) June 25, 2018Natalie Martinez provided research for this piece.Short Link",2018/06/25,snopes,1

That partnership ends in 2016.Disney has also agreed to give Netflix nonexclusive streaming rights to more of its older titles â including ""Dumbo,"" ""Pocahontas"" and ""Alice in Wonderland"" â starting immediately.Netflix's chief content officer, Ted Sarandos, called the deal ""a bold leap forward for Internet television.""""We are incredibly pleased and proud this iconic family brand is teaming with Netflix to make it happen,"" he said.Netflix stock soared on the news, rising $10.65, or 14%, to $85.65.Shares in Starz's parent company, Liberty Media Corp., fell $5.49, or 5%, to $105.56.Currently, Netflix has nonexclusive rights to movies from Paramount Pictures, Lionsgate and Metro-Goldwyn-Mayer via a deal with pay channel Epix, as well as an array of library titles from other studios. Its only exclusive movie rights come from independent studios such as Relativity Media and DreamWorks Animation. It also has a wide variety of television reruns.Sarandos and Netflix Chief Executive Reed Hastings have long said the company wanted to get exclusive pay TV rights to films from one of Hollywood's six major studios to boost its online entertainment service.PHOTOS: Disney without PixarHowever, Hastings has also at times downplayed the importance of new movies. Netflix previously had streaming rights to Disney and Sony movies via a deal with Starz. In January, investors expressed their concerns that the pending disappearance of those movies would hurt the service. Hastings said in a letter to investors that Disney films accounted for only 2% of domestic streaming and the loss would not be felt.Since then, though, the Disney movie slate has become more attractive. At that time, Netflix did not have access to movies from Disney's Marvel superhero unit or the ""Star Wars"" titles from its pending acquisition of Lucasfilm Ltd.The end of the Starz agreement accelerated a trend that has seen Netflix evolve into a television company, with reruns of shows such as ""Mad Men"" accounting for about two-thirds of the content streamed by users.With several original programs launching next year, including the Kevin Spacey political drama ""House of Cards,"" and a direct connection to a growing number of Internet-enabled televisions, Netflix is on the verge of standing on par with many TV networks.Netflix charges $8 a month for its streaming service, while premium cable networks such as HBO cost $13 to $18 a month, and that's on top of a monthly bill for other channels that typically exceeds $50. It remains to be seen whether the addition of Disney products and more original programming could lead Netflix to increase its price.PHOTOS: Hollywood back lot momentsThe Netflix spending spree could continue, with Sarandos telling Bloomberg News on Monday that his company would bid for rights to Sony movies when its Starz deal expires.Netflix might have a tougher time wresting away the rights to Warner Bros., 20th Century Fox or Universal Pictures releases from their current deals with HBO, which like Warner is part of Time Warner Inc. Paramount, Lionsgate and MGM are almost certain to stick with Epix, of which the trio are co-owners.Disney's family-friendly films are particularly valuable to Netflix, however, because young viewers are active users of the service. Last year it launched a separate Just for Kids section of its website and apps.Although terms were not disclosed, a person close to the matter said Netflix could ultimately pay more than $300 million annually for Disney movies.This year, HBO cut a deal with 20th Century Fox for its movies, at an estimated price of more than $200 million annually.In so-called output deals, pay TV providers typically pay 10% to 12% of the U.S. box office of each film, up to $200 million.For Starz, losing the Disney movies means the channel will have to create more original content to fill the void, just as rival cable network Showtime did when it lost most of its movie content over the last several years. Showtime, a unit of CBS Corp., has managed to make this work by launching several successful shows, including ""Homeland,"" ""Dexter"" and ""Nurse Jackie.""Starz's track record with original programming has been more mixed. Its show ""Spartacus"" has performed well, but its ambitious political drama ""Boss,"" starring Kelsey Grammer, was recently canceled.""Our decision not to extend the agreement for Disney output ... allows us the opportunity to implement our plan to dramatically ramp up our investment in exclusive, premium-quality original series which will best meet the needs of our distributors and subscribers,"" Starz said in a statement.Janney Capital Markets analyst Tony Wible called the deal a positive for Netflix, writing in a research note, ""This exclusivity should help them defend against competitors and may reinvigorate [subscriber] growth at a substantial cost.""Stern Agee analyst Arvind Bhatia had a more mixed reaction.""From a content perspective, this appears to be a major coup for Netflix,"" he said. ""However, without knowledge of the financial terms, we think it would be premature to assume this is a net positive.""",2012/12/04,snopes,1

Not even concerning the big things. It could be as easy as “I hope that was the kind of sandwich he likes” when packing your son’s lunch.But the worst nightmare of every single parent is having your kids taken away from you.For one mom in Cambridgeshire, this nightmare became reality after she did something most parents have probably done.The mother, who remains unnamed, had her two young children stripped from her hands after “continually ignoring advice.”That advice? Don’t let your kids sleep in your bed.Social workers raised concerns after they saw bruises on both kids. Social workers advised both parents to stop letting their kids sleep in the family bed, but they did not take the advice.A judge says he believes the bruises are unintentional, but were still caused by excessive force and rough handling by both parents. The youngest boy had bruises and a broken wrist when he was just months old.The case is kind of odd, because the judge says he has no doubts this mom loves her kids and keeps saying she wasn’t intentionally hurting her kids, but he says she’s still abusing them by co-sleeping. He also was shown evidence how this mother “always thinks she knows best” and ignores everyone’s advice.The children were both taken from their parents and, at the judge’s discretion, were put up for adoption. The claim is that after being warned by professionals since the birth of her first child to not allow the children to co-sleep with them, neither parent took any measure to protect their children.The entire case seems fishy, and as though they’re not revealing more aspects of the story that would make everything connect.It’s still a scary thought, though.

Can I expunge my California Penal Code 25850 PC conviction?If you are granted probation in a misdemeanor or felony Penal Code 25850 PC case, you may expunge your California criminal record once you successfully complete the probationary period. However, the judge can deny you an expungement if you suffer a probation violation or fail to adhere to all the terms and conditions of probation.50And if you are charged with carrying a loaded firearm in public as a felony, the court may be willing to reduce the wobbler from a felony to a misdemeanor .51 The court may also grant an early termination of probation if you comply with all the terms and conditions of probation for the first year or two.525.3. Can I own firearms after a PC 25850 conviction?A misdemeanor conviction for carrying a loaded firearm in public won't by itself revoke your right to own or possess a firearm. That said, if you are adjudged a ward of the juvenile court based on a Penal Code 25850 PC misdemeanor conviction, you will be prohibited from owning or possessing a firearm until you are 30 years old.53But if you get convicted as a felony, you will be prohibited from purchasing, receiving, owning, or possessing a firearm for life.54 For a more detailed discussion, visit our page on California's “Felon with a Firearm” law, Penal Code 29800 PC .If you are convicted of a felony under one of the “wobbler” subdivisions of Penal Code 25850 PC…and you successfully have the felony reduced to a misdemeanor…your gun rights will be restored. Absent that, there are very few avenues of firearm rights restoration.Typically, a certificate of rehabilitation and/or a governor's pardon would restore your California gun rights . But even those remedies don't apply to offenses that involve the use of a dangerous weapon.55California law defines “dangerous weapon” as any weapon, instrument, or object that is capable of being used to inflict great bodily injury or death.56 A loaded firearm under PC 25850 therefore qualifies as a dangerous weapon.Call us for help…Call us for helpIf you or loved one is charged with Penal Code 25850 PC carrying a loaded firearm and you are looking to hire an attorney for representation, we invite you to contact us at Shouse Law Group.

(a) Nothing in Section 25850 [California's carrying a loaded firearm law] is intended to preclude the carrying of any loaded firearm, under circumstances where it would otherwise be lawful, by a person who reasonably believes that any person or the property of any person is in immediate, grave danger and that the carrying of the weapon is necessary for the preservation of that person or property. (b) A violation of Section 25850 is justifiable when a person who possesses a firearm reasonably believes that person is in grave danger because of circumstances forming the basis of a current restraining order issued by a court against another person who has been found to pose a threat to the life or safety of the person who possesses the firearm. This subdivision may not apply when the circumstances involve a mutual restraining order issued pursuant to Division 10 (commencing with Section 6200) of the Family Code absent a factual finding of a specific threat to the person's life or safety. It is not the intent of the Legislature to limit, restrict, or narrow the application of current statutory or judicial authority to apply this or other justifications to a defendant charged with violating Section 25400 or committing another similar offense. Upon trial for violating Section 25850, the trier of fact shall determine whether the defendant was acting out of a reasonable belief that the defendant was in grave danger.

Gail Philburn of the Michigan Sierra Club told Michigan Live, the new changes effectively remove Right to Farm Act protection for many urban and suburban backyard farmers raising small numbers of animals. Backyard and urban farming were previously protected by Michigans Right to Farm Act. The Commission ruled that the Right to Farm Act protections no longer apply to many homeowners who keep small numbers of livestock.Kim White, who raises chickens and rabbits, said, They dont want us little guys feeding ourselves. They want us to go all to the big farms. They want to do away with small farms and I believe that is whats motivating it. The ruling will allow local governments to arbitrarily ban goats, chickens and beehives on any property where there are 13 homes within one eighth mile or a residence within 250 feet of the property, according to Michigan Public Radio. The Right to Farm Act was created in 1981 to protect farmers from the complaints of people from the city who moved to the country and then attempted to make it more urban with anti-farming ordinances. The new changes affect residents of rural Michigan too. It is not simply an urban or suburban concern.Shady Grove Farm in Gwinn, Michigan is the six and a half acre home to 150 egg-laying hens that provide eggs to a local co-op and a local restaurant. The small Michigan farm also homes sheep for wool and a few turkeys and meat chickens to provide fresh healthy, local poultry. We produce food with integrity, Randy Buchler told The Blaze about Shady Grove Farm. Everything we do here is 100 percent natural we like to say its beyond organic. We take a lot of pride and care in what were doing here. Shady Grove Farm was doing its part to bring healthy, local, organic food to the tables of Gwinn residents, and it mirrors the attitudes of hundreds of other small farming operations in Michigan and thousands of others popping up around the nation. The ruling comes within days of a report by The World Health Organization that stated the world is currently in grave danger of entering a post-antibiotic era. The WHOs director-general Dr. Margaret Chan argued that the antibiotic use in our industrialized food supply is the worst offender adding to the global crisis. The Michigan Agriculture Commission passed up an opportunity to support one of the hottest trends in food in Michigan public demand for access to more local, healthy, sustainable food, Gail Philbin told MLive.Meanwhile, neighboring Indiana Governor Mike Pence signed Senate Bill 179 a few weeks before which freed up poultry and egg sales from local and state regulation. Yesterday, the USDA Secretary Tom Vilsack announced massive funding to support research about small and medium-sized family farms, such as small farms ability to build-up local and regional economic systems. Theres a lot of unnecessary legal action being taken against small farms who are doing good things in their communities, said Randy Buchler, who is also on the board of directors for the Michigan Small Farm Council. The Michigan Small Farm Council actively fought to support Michigan farming freedom, but ultimately the Commission voted to approve the new restrictions.Farm Bureau has become another special interest beholden to big business and out of touch with small farmers, and constitutional and property rights of the little guy, Pine Hallow Farms wrote to the Michigan Small Farm Council. The Michigan Farm Bureau endorsed the new regulatory changes. Matthew Kapp, government relations specialist with Michigan Farm Bureau, told MLive that the members weighed in and felt that people raising livestock need to conform to local zoning ordinances. The Farm Bureau did not feel Michigans Right To Farm Act was meant to protect the smaller farms, and ultimately the Michigan Commission of Agriculture and Rural Development agreed.[Photo courtesy of City Chickens Gone Country]",2014/05/02,snopes,1
https://www.snopes.com/fact-check/ikea-pregnancy-test-ad/,ikea released a magazine ad which includes a pregnancy test.,True,"['akestam holst', ' ikea', ' pregnancy tests']",http://www.nytimes.com/,http://www.nytimes.com/2012/02/19/magazine/shopping-habits.html,2018/01/11,"The desire to collect information on customers is not new for Target or any other large retailer, of course. For decades, Target has collected vast amounts of data on every person who regularly walks into one of its stores. Whenever possible, Target assigns each shopper a unique code — known internally as the Guest ID number — that keeps tabs on everything they buy. “If you use a credit card or a coupon, or fill out a survey, or mail in a refund, or call the customer help line, or open an e-mail we’ve sent you or visit our Web site, we’ll record it and link it to your Guest ID,” Pole said. Also linked to your Guest ID is demographic information like your age, whether you are married and have kids, which part of town you live in, how long it takes you to drive to the store, your estimated salary, whether you’ve moved recently, what credit cards you carry in your wallet and what Web sites you visit. Target can buy data about your ethnicity, job history, the magazines you read, if you’ve ever declared bankruptcy or got divorced, the year you bought (or lost) your house, where you went to college, what kinds of topics you talk about online, whether you prefer certain brands of coffee, paper towels, cereal or applesauce, your political leanings, reading habits, charitable giving and the number of cars you own. (In a statement, Target declined to identify what demographic information it collects or purchases.) All that information is meaningless, however, without someone to analyze and make sense of it. That’s where Andrew Pole and the dozens of other members of Target’s Guest Marketing Analytics department come in. Almost every major retailer, from grocery chains to investmentbanks to the U.S. Postal Service, has a “predictive analytics” department devoted to understanding not just consumers’ shopping habits but also their personal habits, so as to more efficiently market to them. “But Target has always been one of the smartest at this,” says Eric Siegel, a consultant and the chairman of a conference called Predictive Analytics World. “We’re living through a golden age of behavioral research. The reason Target can snoop on our shopping habits is that, over the past two decades, the science of habit formation has become a major field of research in neurology and psychology departments at hundreds of major medical centers and universities, as well as inside extremely well financed corporate labs. “It’s like an arms race to hire statisticians nowadays,” said Andreas Weigend, the former chief scientist at Amazon.com. “Mathematicians are suddenly sexy.” As the ability to analyze data has grown more and more fine-grained, the push to understand how daily habits influence our decisions has become one of the most exciting topics in clinical research, even though most of us are hardly aware those patterns exist. One study from Duke University estimated that habits, rather than conscious decision-making, shape 45 percent of the choices we make every day, and recent discoveries have begun to change everything from the way we think about dieting to how doctors conceive treatments for anxiety, depression and addictions. This research is also transforming our understanding of how habits function across organizations and societies. A football coach named Tony Dungy propelled one of the worst teams in the N.F.L. to the Super Bowl by focusing on how his players habitually reacted to on-field cues. Before he became Treasury secretary, Paul O’Neill overhauled a stumbling conglomerate, Alcoa, and turned it into a top performer in the Dow Jones by relentlessly attacking one habit — a specific approach to worker safety — which in turn caused a companywide transformation. The Obama campaign has hired a habit specialist as its “chief scientist” to figure out how to trigger new voting patterns among different constituencies. Researchers have figured out how to stop people from habitually overeating and biting their nails. They can explain why some of us automatically go for a jog every morning and are more productive at work, while others oversleep and procrastinate. There is a calculus, it turns out, for mastering our subconscious urges. For companies like Target, the exhaustive rendering of our conscious and unconscious patterns into data sets and algorithms has revolutionized what they know about us and, therefore, how precisely they can sell. Inside the brain-and-cognitive-sciences department of the Massachusetts Institute of Technology are what, to the casual observer, look like dollhouse versions of surgical theaters. There are rooms with tiny scalpels, small drills and miniature saws. Even the operating tables are petite, as if prepared for 7-year-old surgeons. Inside those shrunken O.R.’s, neurologists cut into the skulls of anesthetized rats, implanting tiny sensors that record the smallest changes in the activity of their brains. An M.I.T. neuroscientist named Ann Graybiel told me that she and her colleagues began exploring habits more than a decade ago by putting their wired rats into a T-shaped maze with chocolate at one end. The maze was structured so that each animal was positioned behind a barrier that opened after a loud click. The first time a rat was placed in the maze, it would usually wander slowly up and down the center aisle after the barrier slid away, sniffing in corners and scratching at walls. It appeared to smell the chocolate but couldn’t figure out how to find it. There was no discernible pattern in the rat’s meanderings and no indication it was working hard to find the treat. The probes in the rats’ heads, however, told a different story. While each animal wandered through the maze, its brain was working furiously. Every time a rat sniffed the air or scratched a wall, the neurosensors inside the animal’s head exploded with activity. As the scientists repeated the experiment, again and again, the rats eventually stopped sniffing corners and making wrong turns and began to zip through the maze with more and more speed. And within their brains, something unexpected occurred: as each rat learned how to complete the maze more quickly, its mental activity decreased. As the path became more and more automatic — as it became a habit — the rats started thinking less and less. This process, in which the brain converts a sequence of actions into an automatic routine, is called “chunking.” There are dozens, if not hundreds, of behavioral chunks we rely on every day. Some are simple: you automatically put toothpaste on your toothbrush before sticking it in your mouth. Some, like making the kids’ lunch, are a little more complex. Still others are so complicated that it’s remarkable to realize that a habit could have emerged at all. Take backing your car out of the driveway. When you first learned to drive, that act required a major dose of concentration, and for good reason: it involves peering into the rearview and side mirrors and checking for obstacles, putting your foot on the brake, moving the gearshift into reverse, removing your foot from the brake, estimating the distance between the garage and the street while keeping the wheels aligned, calculating how images in the mirrors translate into actual distances, all while applying differing amounts of pressure to the gas pedal and brake. Now, you perform that series of actions every time you pull into the street without thinking very much. Your brain has chunked large parts of it. Left to its own devices, the brain will try to make almost any repeated behavior into a habit, because habits allow our minds to conserve effort. But conserving mental energy is tricky, because if our brains power down at the wrong moment, we might fail to notice something important, like a child riding her bike down the sidewalk or a speeding car coming down the street. So we’ve devised a clever system to determine when to let a habit take over. It’s something that happens whenever a chunk of behavior starts or ends — and it helps to explain why habits are so difficult to change once they’re formed, despite our best intentions. To understand this a little more clearly, consider again the chocolate-seeking rats. What Graybiel and her colleagues found was that, as the ability to navigate the maze became habitual, there were two spikes in the rats’ brain activity — once at the beginning of the maze, when the rat heard the click right before the barrier slid away, and once at the end, when the rat found the chocolate. Those spikes show when the rats’ brains were fully engaged, and the dip in neural activity between the spikes showed when the habit took over. From behind the partition, the rat wasn’t sure what waited on the other side, until it heard the click, which it had come to associate with the maze. Once it heard that sound, it knew to use the “maze habit,” and its brain activity decreased. Then at the end of the routine, when the reward appeared, the brain shook itself awake again and the chocolate signaled to the rat that this particular habit was worth remembering, and the neurological pathway was carved that much deeper. The process within our brains that creates habits is a three-step loop. First, there is a cue, a trigger that tells your brain to go into automatic mode and which habit to use. Then there is the routine, which can be physical or mental or emotional. Finally, there is a reward, which helps your brain figure out if this particular loop is worth remembering for the future. Over time, this loop — cue, routine, reward; cue, routine, reward — becomes more and more automatic. The cue and reward become neurologically intertwined until a sense of craving emerges. What’s unique about cues and rewards, however, is how subtle they can be. Neurological studies like the ones in Graybiel’s lab have revealed that some cues span just milliseconds. And rewards can range from the obvious (like the sugar rush that a morning doughnut habit provides) to the infinitesimal (like the barely noticeable — but measurable — sense of relief the brain experiences after successfully navigating the driveway). Most cues and rewards, in fact, happen so quickly and are so slight that we are hardly aware of them at all. But our neural systems notice and use them to build automatic behaviors. Habits aren’t destiny — they can be ignored, changed or replaced. But it’s also true that once the loop is established and a habit emerges, your brain stops fully participating in decision-making. So unless you deliberately fight a habit — unless you find new cues and rewards — the old pattern will unfold automatically. “We’ve done experiments where we trained rats to run down a maze until it was a habit, and then we extinguished the habit by changing the placement of the reward,” Graybiel told me. “Then one day, we’ll put the reward in the old place and put in the rat and, by golly, the old habit will re-emerge right away. Luckily, simply understanding how habits work makes them easier to control. Take, for instance, a series of studies conducted a few years ago at Columbia University and the University of Alberta. Researchers wanted to understand how exercise habits emerge. In one project, 256 members of a health-insurance plan were invited to classes stressing the importance of exercise. Half the participants received an extra lesson on the theories of habit formation (the structure of the habit loop) and were asked to identify cues and rewards that might help them develop exercise routines. The results were dramatic. Over the next four months, those participants who deliberately identified cues and rewards spent twice as much time exercising as their peers. Other studies have yielded similar results. According to another recent paper, if you want to start running in the morning, it’s essential that you choose a simple cue (like always putting on your sneakers before breakfast or leaving your running clothes next to your bed) and a clear reward (like a midday treat or even the sense of accomplishment that comes from ritually recording your miles in a log book). After a while, your brain will start anticipating that reward — craving the treat or the feeling of accomplishment — and there will be a measurable neurological impulse to lace up your jogging shoes each morning. Our relationship to e-mail operates on the same principle. When a computer chimes or a smartphone vibrates with a new message, the brain starts anticipating the neurological “pleasure” (even if we don’t recognize it as such) that clicking on the e-mail and reading it provides. That expectation, if unsatisfied, can build until you find yourself moved to distraction by the thought of an e-mail sitting there unread — even if you know, rationally, it’s most likely not important. On the other hand, once you remove the cue by disabling the buzzing of your phone or the chiming of your computer, the craving is never triggered, and you’ll find, over time, that you’re able to work productively for long stretches without checking your in-box. Some of the most ambitious habit experiments have been conducted by corporate America. To understand why executives are so entranced by this science, consider how one of the world’s largest companies, Procter & Gamble, used habit insights to turn a failing product into one of its biggest sellers. P.& G. is the corporate behemoth behind a whole range of products, from Downy fabric softener to Bounty paper towels to Duracell batteries and dozens of other household brands. In the mid-1990s, P.& G.’s executives began a secret project to create a new product that could eradicate bad smells. P.& G. spent millions developing a colorless, cheap-to-manufacture liquid that could be sprayed on a smoky blouse, stinky couch, old jacket or stained car interior and make it odorless. In order to market the product — Febreze — the company formed a team that included a former Wall Street mathematician named Drake Stimson and habit specialists, whose job was to make sure the television commercials, which they tested in Phoenix, Salt Lake City and Boise, Idaho, accentuated the product’s cues and rewards just right. February 16, 2012 - In a preview of this Sunday's New York Times Magazine, Charles Duhigg details how some retailers profit by predicting major changes in your life. The first ad showed a woman complaining about the smoking section of a restaurant. Whenever she eats there, she says, her jacket smells like smoke. A friend tells her that if she uses Febreze, it will eliminate the odor. The cue in the ad is clear: the harsh smell of cigarette smoke. The reward: odor eliminated from clothes. The second ad featured a woman worrying about her dog, Sophie, who always sits on the couch. “Sophie will always smell like Sophie,” she says, but with Febreze, “now my furniture doesn’t have to.” The ads were put in heavy rotation. Then the marketers sat back, anticipating how they would spend their bonuses. A week passed. Then two. A month. Two months. Sales started small and got smaller. Febreze was a dud. The panicked marketing team canvassed consumers and conducted in-depth interviews to figure out what was going wrong, Stimson recalled. Their first inkling came when they visited a woman’s home outside Phoenix. The house was clean and organized. She was something of a neat freak, the woman explained. But when P.& G.’s scientists walked into her living room, where her nine cats spent most of their time, the scent was so overpowering that one of them gagged. “It’s usually not a problem,” she said. “No,” she said. “Isn’t it wonderful? A similar scene played out in dozens of other smelly homes. The reason Febreze wasn’t selling, the marketers realized, was that people couldn’t detect most of the bad smells in their lives. If you live with nine cats, you become desensitized to their scents. If you smoke cigarettes, eventually you don’t smell smoke anymore. Even the strongest odors fade with constant exposure. That’s why Febreze was a failure. The product’s cue — the bad smells that were supposed to trigger daily use — was hidden from the people who needed it the most. And Febreze’s reward (an odorless home) was meaningless to someone who couldn’t smell offensive scents in the first place. P.& G. employed a Harvard Business School professor to analyze Febreze’s ad campaigns. They collected hours of footage of people cleaning their homes and watched tape after tape, looking for clues that might help them connect Febreze to people’s daily habits. When that didn’t reveal anything, they went into the field and conducted more interviews. A breakthrough came when they visited a woman in a suburb near Scottsdale, Ariz., who was in her 40s with four children. Her house was clean, though not compulsively tidy, and didn’t appear to have any odor problems; there were no pets or smokers. To the surprise of everyone, she loved Febreze. “I use it every day,” she said. “What smells are you trying to get rid of?” a researcher asked. “I don’t really use it for specific smells,” the woman said. The researchers followed her around as she tidied the house. In the bedroom, she made her bed, tightened the sheet’s corners, then sprayed the comforter with Febreze. In the living room, she vacuumed, picked up the children’s shoes, straightened the coffee table, then sprayed Febreze on the freshly cleaned carpet. “It’s nice, you know?” she said. “Spraying feels like a little minicelebration when I’m done with a room.” At the rate she was going, the team estimated, she would empty a bottle of Febreze every two weeks. When they got back to P.& G.’s headquarters, the researchers watched their videotapes again. Now they knew what to look for and saw their mistake in scene after scene. Cleaning has its own habit loops that already exist. In one video, when a woman walked into a dirty room (cue), she started sweeping and picking up toys (routine), then she examined the room and smiled when she was done (reward). In another, a woman scowled at her unmade bed (cue), proceeded to straighten the blankets and comforter (routine) and then sighed as she ran her hands over the freshly plumped pillows (reward). P.& G. had been trying to create a whole new habit with Febreze, but what they really needed to do was piggyback on habit loops that were already in place. The marketers needed to position Febreze as something that came at the end of the cleaning ritual, the reward, rather than as a whole new cleaning routine. The company printed new ads showing open windows and gusts of fresh air. More perfume was added to the Febreze formula, so that instead of merely neutralizing odors, the spray had its own distinct scent. Television commercials were filmed of women, having finished their cleaning routine, using Febreze to spritz freshly made beds and just-laundered clothing. Each ad was designed to appeal to the habit loop: when you see a freshly cleaned room (cue), pull out Febreze (routine) and enjoy a smell that says you’ve done a great job (reward). When you finish making a bed (cue), spritz Febreze (routine) and breathe a sweet, contented sigh (reward). Febreze, the ads implied, was a pleasant treat, not a reminder that your home stinks. And so Febreze, a product originally conceived as a revolutionary way to destroy odors, became an air freshener used once things are already clean. The Febreze revamp occurred in the summer of 1998. Within two months, sales doubled. A year later, the product brought in $230 million. Since then Febreze has spawned dozens of spinoffs — air fresheners, candles and laundry detergents — that now account for sales of more than $1 billion a year. Eventually, P.& G. began mentioning to customers that, in addition to smelling sweet, Febreze can actually kill bad odors. Today it’s one of the top-selling products in the world. Andrew Pole was hired by Target to use the same kinds of insights into consumers’ habits to expand Target’s sales. His assignment was to analyze all the cue-routine-reward loops among shoppers and help the company figure out how to exploit them. Much of his department’s work was straightforward: find the customers who have children and send them catalogs that feature toys before Christmas. Look for shoppers who habitually purchase swimsuits in April and send them coupons for sunscreen in July and diet books in December. But Pole’s most important assignment was to identify those unique moments in consumers’ lives when their shopping habits become particularly flexible and the right advertisement or coupon would cause them to begin spending in new ways.

In the 1980s, a team of researchers led by a U.C.L.A. professor named Alan Andreasen undertook a study of peoples’ most mundane purchases, like soap, toothpaste, trash bags and toilet paper. They learned that most shoppers paid almost no attention to how they bought these products, that the purchases occurred habitually, without any complex decision-making. Which meant it was hard for marketers, despite their displays and coupons and product promotions, to persuade shoppers to change. But when some customers were going through a major life event, like graduating from college or getting a new job or moving to a new town, their shopping habits became flexible in ways that were both predictable and potential gold mines for retailers. The study found that when someone marries, he or she is more likely to start buying a new type of coffee. When a couple move into a new house, they’re more apt to purchase a different kind of cereal. When they divorce, there’s an increased chance they’ll start buying different brands of beer. Consumers going through major life events often don’t notice, or care, that their shopping habits have shifted, but retailers notice, and they care quite a bit. At those unique moments, Andreasen wrote, customers are “vulnerable to intervention by marketers.” In other words, a precisely timed advertisement, sent to a recent divorcee or new homebuyer, can change someone’s shopping patterns for years. And among life events, none are more important than the arrival of a baby. At that moment, new parents’ habits are more flexible than at almost any other time in their adult lives. If companies can identify pregnant shoppers, they can earn millions. The only problem is that identifying pregnant customers is harder than it sounds. Target has a baby-shower registry, and Pole started there, observing how shopping habits changed as a woman approached her due date, which women on the registry had willingly disclosed. He ran test after test, analyzing the data, and before long some useful patterns emerged. Lotions, for example. Lots of people buy lotion, but one of Pole’s colleagues noticed that women on the baby registry were buying larger quantities of unscented lotion around the beginning of their second trimester. Another analyst noted that sometime in the first 20 weeks, pregnant women loaded up on supplements like calcium, magnesium and zinc. Many shoppers purchase soap and cotton balls, but when someone suddenly starts buying lots of scent-free soap and extra-big bags of cotton balls, in addition to hand sanitizers and washcloths, it signals they could be getting close to their delivery date. As Pole’s computers crawled through the data, he was able to identify about 25 products that, when analyzed together, allowed him to assign each shopper a “pregnancy prediction” score. More important, he could also estimate her due date to within a small window, so Target could send coupons timed to very specific stages of her pregnancy. One Target employee I spoke to provided a hypothetical example. Take a fictional Target shopper named Jenny Ward, who is 23, lives in Atlanta and in March bought cocoa-butter lotion, a purse large enough to double as a diaper bag, zinc and magnesium supplements and a bright blue rug. There’s, say, an 87 percent chance that she’s pregnant and that her delivery date is sometime in late August. What’s more, because of the data attached to her Guest ID number, Target knows how to trigger Jenny’s habits. They know that if she receives a coupon via e-mail, it will most likely cue her to buy online. They know that if she receives an ad in the mail on Friday, she frequently uses it on a weekend trip to the store. And they know that if they reward her with a printed receipt that entitles her to a free cup of Starbucks coffee, she’ll use it when she comes back again. In the past, that knowledge had limited value. After all, Jenny purchased only cleaning supplies at Target, and there were only so many psychological buttons the company could push. But now that she is pregnant, everything is up for grabs. In addition to triggering Jenny’s habits to buy more cleaning products, they can also start including offers for an array of products, some more obvious than others, that a woman at her stage of pregnancy might need. Pole applied his program to every regular female shopper in Target’s national database and soon had a list of tens of thousands of women who were most likely pregnant. If they could entice those women or their husbands to visit Target and buy baby-related products, the company’s cue-routine-reward calculators could kick in and start pushing them to buy groceries, bathing suits, toys and clothing, as well. When Pole shared his list with the marketers, he said, they were ecstatic. Soon, Pole was getting invited to meetings above his paygrade. Eventually his paygrade went up. At which point someone asked an important question: How are women going to react when they figure out how much Target knows? “If we send someone a catalog and say, ‘Congratulations on your first child!’ and they’ve never told us they’re pregnant, that’s going to make some people uncomfortable,” Pole told me. “We are very conservative about compliance with all privacy laws. About a year after Pole created his pregnancy-prediction model, a man walked into a Target outside Minneapolis and demanded to see the manager. He was clutching coupons that had been sent to his daughter, and he was angry, according to an employee who participated in the conversation. Charles Duhigg explains the science of habits. “My daughter got this in the mail!” he said. “She’s still in high school, and you’re sending her coupons for baby clothes and cribs? The manager didn’t have any idea what the man was talking about. He looked at the mailer. Sure enough, it was addressed to the man’s daughter and contained advertisements for maternity clothing, nursery furniture and pictures of smiling infants. The manager apologized and then called a few days later to apologize again. On the phone, though, the father was somewhat abashed. “I had a talk with my daughter,” he said. “It turns out there’s been some activities in my house I haven’t been completely aware of. She’s due in August. When I approached Target to discuss Pole’s work, its representatives declined to speak with me. “Our mission is to make Target the preferred shopping destination for our guests by delivering outstanding value, continuous innovation and exceptional guest experience,” the company wrote in a statement. “We’ve developed a number of research tools that allow us to gain insights into trends and preferences within different demographic segments of our guest population.” When I sent Target a complete summary of my reporting, the reply was more terse: “Almost all of your statements contain inaccurate information and publishing them would be misleading to the public. We do not intend to address each statement point by point.” The company declined to identify what was inaccurate. When I offered to fly to Target’s headquarters to discuss its concerns, a spokeswoman e-mailed that no one would meet me. When I flew out anyway, I was told I was on a list of prohibited visitors. “I’ve been instructed not to give you access and to ask you to leave,” said a very nice security guard named Alex. Using data to predict a woman’s pregnancy, Target realized soon after Pole perfected his model, could be a public-relations disaster. So the question became: how could they get their advertisements into expectant mothers’ hands without making it appear they were spying on them? How do you take advantage of someone’s habits without letting them know you’re studying their lives? Before I met Andrew Pole, before I even decided to write a book about the science of habit formation, I had another goal: I wanted to lose weight. I had got into a bad habit of going to the cafeteria every afternoon and eating a chocolate-chip cookie, which contributed to my gaining a few pounds. Eight, to be precise. I put a Post-it note on my computer reading “NO MORE COOKIES.” But every afternoon, I managed to ignore that note, wander to the cafeteria, buy a cookie and eat it while chatting with colleagues. Tomorrow, I always promised myself, I’ll muster the willpower to resist. Tomorrow, I ate another cookie. When I started interviewing experts in habit formation, I concluded each interview by asking what I should do. The first step, they said, was to figure out my habit loop. The routine was simple: every afternoon, I walked to the cafeteria, bought a cookie and ate it while chatting with friends. Next came some less obvious questions: What was the cue? Hunger? Boredom? Low blood sugar? And what was the reward? The taste of the cookie itself? The temporary distraction from my work? The chance to socialize with colleagues? Rewards are powerful because they satisfy cravings, but we’re often not conscious of the urges driving our habits in the first place. So one day, when I felt a cookie impulse, I went outside and took a walk instead. The next day, I went to the cafeteria and bought a coffee. The next, I bought an apple and ate it while chatting with friends. You get the idea. I wanted to test different theories regarding what reward I was really craving. Was it hunger? (In which case the apple should have worked.) Was it the desire for a quick burst of energy? (If so, the coffee should suffice.) Or, as turned out to be the answer, was it that after several hours spent focused on work, I wanted to socialize, to make sure I was up to speed on office gossip, and the cookie was just a convenient excuse? When I walked to a colleague’s desk and chatted for a few minutes, it turned out, my cookie urge was gone. All that was left was identifying the cue. Deciphering cues is hard, however. Our lives often contain too much information to figure out what is triggering a particular behavior. Do you eat breakfast at a certain time because you’re hungry? Or because the morning news is on? Or because your kids have started eating? Experiments have shown that most cues fit into one of five categories: location, time, emotional state, other people or the immediately preceding action. Where are you? What time is it? What’s your emotional state? Who else is around? What action preceded the urge? The next day I did the same thing. And the next. Pretty soon, the cue was clear: I always felt an urge to snack around 3:30. Once I figured out all the parts of the loop, it seemed fairly easy to change my habit. But the psychologists and neuroscientists warned me that, for my new behavior to stick, I needed to abide by the same principle that guided Procter & Gamble in selling Febreze: To shift the routine — to socialize, rather than eat a cookie — I needed to piggyback on an existing habit. So now, every day around 3:30, I stand up, look around the newsroom for someone to talk to, spend 10 minutes gossiping, then go back to my desk. The cue and reward have stayed the same. Only the routine has shifted. It doesn’t feel like a decision, any more than the M.I.T. rats made a decision to run through the maze. It’s now a habit. I’ve lost 21 pounds since then (12 of them from changing my cookie ritual). After Andrew Pole built his pregnancy-prediction model, after he identified thousands of female shoppers who were most likely pregnant, after someone pointed out that some of those women might be a little upset if they received an advertisement making it obvious Target was studying their reproductive status, everyone decided to slow things down. The marketing department conducted a few tests by choosing a small, random sample of women from Pole’s list and mailing them combinations of advertisements to see how they reacted. “We have the capacity to send every customer an ad booklet, specifically designed for them, that says, ‘Here’s everything you bought last week and a coupon for it,’ ” one Target executive told me. “We do that for grocery products all the time.” But for pregnant women, Target’s goal was selling them baby items they didn’t even know they needed yet. “With the pregnancy products, though, we learned that some women react badly,” the executive said. “Then we started mixing in all these ads for things we knew pregnant women would never buy, so the baby ads looked random. We’d put an ad for a lawn mower next to diapers. We’d put a coupon for wineglasses next to infant clothes. That way, it looked like all the products were chosen by chance. “And we found out that as long as a pregnant woman thinks she hasn’t been spied on, she’ll use the coupons. She just assumes that everyone else on her block got the same mailer for diapers and cribs. In other words, if Target piggybacked on existing habits — the same cues and rewards they already knew got customers to buy cleaning supplies or socks — then they could insert a new routine: buying baby products, as well. There’s a cue (“Oh, a coupon for something I need!”) a routine (“Buy! Buy! Buy!”) and a reward (“I can take that off my list”). And once the shopper is inside the store, Target will hit her with cues and rewards to entice her to purchase everything she normally buys somewhere else. As long as Target camouflaged how much it knew, as long as the habit felt familiar, the new behavior took hold. Soon after the new ad campaign began, Target’s Mom and Baby sales exploded. The company doesn’t break out figures for specific divisions, but between 2002 — when Pole was hired — and 2010, Target’s revenues grew from $44 billion to $67 billion. Pole was promoted. He has been invited to speak at conferences. “I never expected this would become such a big deal,” he told me the last time we spoke. A few weeks before this article went to press, I flew to Minneapolis to try and speak to Andrew Pole one last time. I hadn’t talked to him in more than a year. Back when we were still friendly, I mentioned that my wife was seven months pregnant.

As my wife’s pregnancy progressed, I noticed a subtle upswing in the number of advertisements for diapers and baby clothes arriving at our house. Pole didn’t answer my e-mails or phone calls when I visited Minneapolis. I drove to his large home in a nice suburb, but no one answered the door. On my way back to the hotel, I stopped at a Target to pick up some deodorant, then also bought some T-shirts and a fancy hair gel. On a whim, I threw in some pacifiers, to see how the computers would react. Besides, our baby is now 9 months old. You can’t have too many pacifiers. When I paid, I didn’t receive any sudden deals on diapers or formula, to my slight disappointment. It made sense, though: I was shopping in a city I never previously visited, at 9:45 p.m. on a weeknight, buying a random assortment of items. I was using a corporate credit card, and besides the pacifiers, hadn’t purchased any of the things that a parent needs. It was clear to Target’s computers that I was on a business trip. Pole’s prediction calculator took one look at me, ran the numbers and decided to bide its time. Back home, the offers would eventually come. As Pole told me the last time we spoke: “Just wait.

They think that simply having a concealed weapon permit automatically makes any politician pro-gun.Do you think California Democrat Senator Barbara Boxer is pro-gun? No, I don’t think so, either.But Barbara Boxer used her influence to secure an elusive concealed carry permit from California.I can almost hear her trying to deceive gun owners… “Trust me, I have a permit.”Or how about New York Democrat Senator Chuck Schumer?Schumer himself is reported to possess a New York concealed handgun permit, and both U.S. Senators regularly employed armed guards for their personal protection.Just because a politician recognizes that being armed makes THEM safer, doesn’t mean they support YOUR right to keep and bear arms. They think they’re different than you and me, that because of their title they’re entitled to MORE rights than we are.The Second Amendment is about much more than just carrying concealed… or hunting… or sport shooting.Your right to keep and bear arms is a bulwark against tyranny.Chuck Schumer, one of the most anti-gun Senators in Washington D.C., obtained a permit to carry for self-defense.That’s why the National Association for Gun Rights sends Presidential Candidate Surveys to politicians like Tim Pawlenty and Governor Rick Perry.Gun owners MUST know where they stand on important issues like banning magazine or bans on certain types of semi-automatic rifles, or opposing the United Nations’ Small Arms Treaty gun-grab.Please call Rick Perry’s campaign RIGHT NOW at (858) 483-4300 and demand that he return the National Association for Gun Rights Presidential Candidate Survey.I hope you’ll also take a moment and re-read my article about how AmmoLand readers like you toppled Tim Pawlenty’s Presidential aspirations.Please, don’t forget to call Governor Perry at (858) 483-4300 and demand that he return the National Association for Gun Rights Presidential Candidate Survey.For liberty,Dudley BrownAbout:The National Association for Gun Rights is a nonprofit, nonpartisan, single-purpose citizens' organization dedicated to preserving and protecting the Constitutionally protected right-to-keep-and-bear-arms through an aggressive program designed to mobilize public opposition to anti-gun legislation.

Despite the meal being notoriously known to be high in carbohydrates and fat but very low in protein, fiber, vitamins and minerals, it has somehow retained its global popularity,According to the World Instant Noodles Association (WINA), 52 countries consumed 97.7 billion servings last year alone. Among its highest consumers are China and Hong Kong, which together consumed 40.43 billion servings, followed by Indonesia, with 13.20 billion servings consumed. Unsurprisingly, the U.S. is not too far behind with 4 billion instant noodles consumed in 2015.But its reputation for being a “junk food,” actually gets worse.A Baylor University and Harvard study published in the Journal of Nutrition revealed that eating instant noodles may increase risks of heart disease and stroke, according to Washington Post .The researchers analyzed the health and diet of 11,000 South Koreans between ages 19 and 64. The study showed that South Korean women were at high risk of metabolic syndrome due to the large amounts of ramen they consume. Curiously, the result was not found on male participants, which the scientists attribute to biological differences between the genders.Metabolic syndrome often lead to increased blood sugar and blood pressure levels, causing a higher risk of diabetes, stroke or heart disease.The culprit identified was the substance found in ramen called Tertiary-butyl hydroquinone (TBHQ), a petroleum industry byproduct used to preserve cheap processed foods.“Although instant noodle is a convenient and delicious food, there could be an increased risk for metabolic syndrome given [the food’s] high sodium, unhealthy saturated fat and glycemic loads,” said Hyun Shin, Harvard School of Public Health doctoral candidate and co-author of the study.Separate studies conducted elsewhere have revealed other potential health hazards.In India, Food Safety and Standards Authority of India (FSSAI) found lead contamination in Nestlé’s Maggi brand instant noodles containing 7 times the allowed limit. The agency immediately ordered banning of all nine approved variants of Maggi instant noodles in India, calling them “unsafe and hazardous for human consumption.”In South Korea, the Korea Food and Drug Administration (KFDA) found a cancer-causing substance known as Benzopyrene in six brands of noodles made by Nong Shim back in 2012. The discovery led to a massive recall of the products both local and abroad.Like it? Share with your friends!93",2016/07/04,snopes,1

In November of 1994, five years out of office, doctors diagnosed him with Alzheimer’s disease. A new analysis suggests the signs may have been evident even before he left the White House.The findings hail from Arizona State University and are published in the Journal of Alzheimer’s Disease. They give credence to a method of disease detection that relies on analyzing speech patterns for irregularities, such as the repetition of certain phrases or forgetting them altogether. Alzheimer’s disease carries no reliable diagnostic tool, as scientists have yet to find a way to unlock the so far impenetrable black box of the brain.As a window into dementia, speech analysis can be tricky. Decades of recorded words aren’t usually lying around, waiting to be fed through a computer. But politicians, in their years of documented campaigning and national addresses, can act as a helpful outlier.In their analysis, Visar Berisha and Julie Liss, professors of speech and hearing science at ASU, compared Reagan’s transcripts to those of President George H.W. Bush. The two men acted as a reliable comparison for analyzing speech because they were around the same age during their presidency and served in the same decade. This proximity was important for Berisha and Liss because people speak differently across various time periods and at different stages in life.In parsing both presidents’ many transcripts, they discovered some key differences. Compared to Bush, who has exhibited no signs of dementia, Reagan began relying on crutch words more often toward the end of his presidency, such as using the word “thing” instead of a more specific term. He also repeated himself more often, the researchers found.Berisha and Liss got the idea for their study after coming across a study that analyzed autobiographical essays of nuns living in a convent, some of whom developed Alzheimer’s and tended to project the signs in their writing. “It was surprising that, by analyzing discourse rather than writing samples, similar changes were detectable over the course of two presidential terms,” Berisha told Yahoo .Cognitive decline is best caught early. It isn’t a gradual slide into senility so much as a push off of the edge of a cliff. Once the fall has begun, the amyloid plaques destroying neural connections quickly wipe away speech function and mental reasoning. Vocabulary size begins to shrink and known words elude people’s grasp. For Berisha and Liss, the hope is these kinds of detection methods can apply to the general public. They want to devise a study that can record conversations between physicians and patients to analyze speech patterns over time. They also want to study NFL press conferences among players who have suffered head trauma.“Our goal,” Berisha told Yahoo, “is that one day we can develop health applications that automatically analyze speech and language biomarkers for disease onset or progression.”Source: Berisha V, Wang S, LaCross A, Liss J.

Trump , who received draft deferments through much of the Vietnam War, told the author of a coming biography that he nevertheless “always felt that I was in the military” because of his education at a military-themed boarding school.Mr. Trump said his experience at the New York Military Academy, an expensive prep school where his parents had sent him to correct poor behavior, gave him “more training militarily than a lot of the guys that go into the military.”That claim may raise eyebrows given that Mr. Trump, now a Republican presidential candidate, never served in the military and mocked Senator John McCain of Arizona, a decorated naval aviator, for his captivity of several years during the Vietnam War.“He’s not a war hero,” Mr. Trump said in July. “He’s a war hero because he was captured. I like people that weren’t captured.”Mr. Trump described his education, business life, marriages and childhood in extensive interviews with Michael D’Antonio, a Pulitzer Prize-winning former reporter at Newsday. Mr. D’Antonio’s biography of Mr. Trump, “Never Enough: Donald Trump and the Pursuit of Success,” will be published Sept. 22.In the book, Mr. Trump emerges as a man largely unchanged from his childhood in the wealthy Queens neighborhood of Jamaica Estates, where an exacting father, Fred Trump, schooled him in self-promotion and encouraged a lifetime of fighting. The senior Mr. Trump, a major real estate developer, counseled his son to “be a killer” and told him, “You are a king.”Mr. Trump memorably told Mr. D’Antonio that “when I look at myself in the first grade and I look at myself now, I’m basically the same.”ImageMr. Trump posing with a Sikorsky helicopter in Manhattan in 1988. Despite his flashy lifestyle, a biographer has found, he has displayed unexpected generosity.CreditWilbur Funches/Associated Press“The temperament is not that different,” he said.Mr. Trump’s preoccupation with winning — at anything and everything, big or small — dominated his youth. His mentor at the New York Military Academy, Theodore Dobias, called Mr. Trump “a conniver, even then.”When Mr. Trump’s high school classmates showed up for a Columbus Day parade in New York City, expecting to lead the procession, they were dismayed to find a group of Roman Catholic girls arranged ahead of them. Mr. Trump announced that he would take care of the problem. When he returned a few minutes later, having negotiated a Trump-like deal, the cadets were put at the front of the parade, Mr. Dobias said.Mr. Trump, he said, “just wanted to be first, in everything, and he wanted people to know he was first.”St. Martin’s Press provided an advance copy of the book to The New York Times, and Mr. D’Antonio provided excerpts from his interviews with Mr. Trump. (The author interviewed Mr. Trump for more than six hours. The sessions abruptly ended, he wrote, after Mr. Trump learned that Mr. D’Antonio had spoken with a longtime Trump enemy.)The biography offers candid and sometimes unflattering assessments of Mr. Trump by co-workers, friends, enemies and, most entertainingly, his former wives. “The little boy that still wants attention,” said Marla Maples, his second wife.“He wants to be noticed,” said Ivana Trump, wife No. 1, who recalled sending him into a fit of rage by skiing past him on a hill in Aspen, Colo. Mr. Trump stopped, took off his skis and walked off the trail. “He could not take it, that I could do something better than he did,” she said.Asked if she had ever figured out her ex-husband, Ivana Trump said, “Yeah, I figured it out.” But then she added, “Well, I really don’t know.”",2015/09/08,snopes,1

But the housekeeper lacked the security clearance to handle such material.In fact, Marina Santos was called on so frequently to receive emails that she may hold the secrets to emailgate if only the FBI and Congress would subpoena her and the equipment she used.Clinton entrusted far more than the care of her DC residence, known as Whitehaven, to Santos. She expected the Filipino immigrant to handle state secrets, further opening the Democratic presidential nominee to criticism that she played fast and loose with national security.Clinton would first receive highly sensitive emails from top aides at the State Department and then request that they, in turn, forward the messages and any attached documents to Santos to print out for her at the home.Among other things, Clinton requested that Santos print out drafts of her speeches, confidential memos and call sheets background information and talking points prepared for the secretary of state in advance of a phone call with a foreign head of state.Marina SantosRon SachsPls ask Marina to print for me in am, Clinton emailed top aide Huma Abedin regarding a redacted 2011 message marked sensitive but unclassified.In a classified 2012 email dealing with the new president of Malawi, another Clinton aide, Monica Hanley, advised Clinton, We can ask Marina to print this.Revisions to the Iran points was the subject line of a classified April 2012 email to Clinton from Hanley. In it, the text reads, Marina is trying to print for you.Both classified emails were marked confidential, the tier below secret or top secret.Santos also had access to a highly secure room called an SCIF (sensitive compartmented information facility) that diplomatic security agents set up at Whitehaven, according to FBI notes from an interview with Abedin.From within the SCIF, Santos who had no clearance collected documents from the secure facsimile machine for Clinton, the FBI notes revealed.Just how sensitive were the papers Santos presumably handled? The FBI noted Clinton periodically received the Presidential Daily Brief a top-secret document prepared by the CIA and other US intelligence agencies via the secure fax.A 2012 sensitive but unclassified email from Hanley to Clinton refers to a fax the staff wanted Clinton to see before your Netanyahu mtg. Marina will grab for you.Yet it appears Clinton was never asked by the FBI in its yearlong investigation to turn over the iMac that Santos used to receive the emails, or the printer she used to print out the documents, or the printouts themselves. see alsoHillary's 33,000 emails might not be 'missing' after all For months now, weve been told that Hillary Clintons 33,000... As The Post first reported, copies of Clintons 33,000 allegedly destroyed emails still exist in other locations and could be recovered if investigators were turned loose to seize them. Higher-ups at the Justice Department reportedly have blocked them from obtaining search warrants to obtain the evidence.It also appears the FBI did not formally interview Santos as a key witness in its investigation.This is a major oversight: Santos may know the whereabouts of a missing Apple MacBook laptop and USB flash drive that contain all of Clintons emails archived over her four years in office.In 2013, Hanley downloaded Clintons emails from her private server to the MacBook and flash drive.The two copies of the Clinton email archive (one on the archive laptop and one on the thumb drive) were intended to be stored in Clintons Chappaqua and Whitehaven residences, the FBI said in its case summary.But Hanley says the devices were lost, and the FBI says it does not have either item in its possession.In addition to Abedin, Santos worked closely with Hanley at Whitehaven and could shed light on the mystery if only she were asked about it.follow the storyRussians went after Hillary emails same day Trump called for hackTrump's trade policy, IG report lead to stock market jittersFBI employee blasted Trump voters: 'Uneducated, lazy POS'IG report finds FBI agents have cozy relationships with reporters'But my emails': Hillary Clinton trolls James ComeyClinton directed her maid to print out classified materialsSEE ALL STORIESWhen a Post reporter confronted Santos at her DC apartment Friday, she would say only, I dont speak to reporters.According to a 2010 profile in The Philippine Star, close Clinton friend Vernon Jordan recommended Santos to the Clintons after she worked part-time for him.Bill Clinton gave a speech in Manila as part of his foundation and took time to visit with the family of the mayordoma [housekeeper] of his Washington, DC, home Marina Santos.He was quoted as describing Santos as the wonderful woman who runs our home in Washington, without whom Hillary will not be able to serve as secretary of state. The article ended remarking, without a hint of irony: Marina now runs his house so that he and his wife can better serve interests higher than their own.Santos could turn out to be the Betty Currie of the Clinton email scandal. Currie was the secretary for President Clinton. She also came recommended by Jordan, and became famous as a central witness in the Monica Lewinsky scandal for her handling of gifts given to Clintons mistress.Investigators had sought the gifts, allegedly hidden under Curries bed on orders from Clinton, as evidence.The State Department and Clinton campaign did not respond to requests for comment.Paul Sperry, a former DC bureau chief for Investors Business Daily and a Hoover Institution media fellow, is the author of Infiltration.Share this:FacebookTwitterGoogleFacebook MessengerWhatsAppEmailCopy",2016/11/06,snopes,1

A rare, once-in-a-lifetime Sky Event.This Supermoon will have a dramatic effect on the tides and, for many people, November’s Full Moon will be the largest and brightest Full Moon of a lifetime.The supermoon (perigee full moon) on November 14, 2016, will bring the moon closer to Earth than it has been since January 26, 1948.What’s more, the moon won’t come this close to Earth again until November 25, 2034.

Use this natural trick to prevent stomach flu, even if you’ve been exposed! We’ve been doing this for six years and it has kept us healthy, even when we know we’ve been exposed to the stomach virus. It’s so easy, you’d be a fool not to try it! The stomach flu (not truly the “flu”) by nickname, stomach bug, norovirus, puking flu as my kids like to call it…whatever you call it, it’s NOT FUN. Use this simple, effective trick to prevent the stomach flu! If you need home remedies stomach flu has already hit your house perhaps? This works for anyone who is exposed to the stomach virus, but is not yet showing symptoms. We do this daily in our house. Don’t wait any longer order what you need now! Before you waste any more time run over and order everything you need to prevent the stomach virus daily. This is the best home remedies stomach flu post you’ll find and here are the products you need at the best prices. Plus you’ll save yourself a trip to the store where you will likely pick up more germs! These are the best prices on the products you need plus they’ll ship right to your door. Don’t wait any longer on ordering these. Use them year-round or during peak stomach virus season, it’s up to you! There is a little-known home remedy to prevent the stomach bug altogether. The trick here is PREVENTION! If you are already feeling symptoms of the stomach flu then this will NOT work. You need to do this BEFORE you get sick. However, if you have been EXPOSED to the stomach bug but aren’t showing symptoms yet then this is the trick you need to prevent yourself from getting sick. The best part? It’s natural and doesn’t involve anything containing chemicals. I am all for natural remedies! Okay, this is going to sound a little “out there” but I’ve tried it and believe me this works! On Monday my hubby came down with the stomach flu. He was puking and felt awful. I think heÂ had norovirus which is a highly contagious stomach flu.Â Norovirus has been going around and sure enough, a guy he works with had it right before him.Â Well, of course, he had eaten off my plate that day and I was so worried that the kids and I would all get it too. A friend of mine told me to start drinking grape juice to prevent me from getting sick. The kids and IÂ all started drinking grape juice and here we are 3 days later healthy and well! You may have landed on my page after searching “prevent stomach flu grape juice”. Well, I did some research as there wasn’t much info out there on this. It turns out there is some science behind this grape juice thing and I did a little research. In order to prevent yourself from getting the stomach flu after you know you have been exposed (taking care of a sick person, being around someone that was sick, etc) you need to start drinking 100% Grape Juice, no sugar added, right away BEFORE any symptoms appear. If you are having symptoms then it is too late for thisÂ home remedies stomach fluÂ trick and DO NOT drink the grape juice or you will be puking purple and it won’t be pretty! Drink the grape juice three times a day for a few days after being exposed. I have been drinking a juiceÂ glass full three times a day and filling the kids sippy cups full three times a day. Yes, this is a lot of sugar but I’d rather consume/give my kids sugar than have them get the stomach flu. The grape juice works by changing the pH in your intestinal tract soÂ that the virus can’t multiply. It also harbors various strong anti-viral chemicals in it. Along with the Vitamin C and anti-oxidants in the juice, it’s supposed to flush and kill the virus and/or severely lesson the symptoms. When you get a stomach virus, it actually isn’t in your stomach, it’s all in your large and small intestines. The effects of what it’s doing to those makes you sick to your stomach (changing the acidity in your stomach). Keeping the pH of the intestines slightly more alkaline is supposed to stop the virus from taking hold and thus making you sick. You can drink the grape juice alone or add in grapefruit seed extract for additional virus-killing benefits.Â NutriBioticÂŽ Maximum GSE Liquid Concentrate provides the highest available concentration of Citricidal brand grapefruit seed extract, a natural compound derived from the seed and pulp of grapefruit. The Citricidal seems to be the essential component in helping kill off any stomach virus in your system. I add 2-3 drops to the grape juice each time we drink it. Read the reviews on Amazon and see that this is also good for many, many other uses. It’s not only good for a home remedies stomach flu prevention trick, but so many other things too! So there is the science behindÂ this home remedies stomach flu prevention trick and I’mÂ the living experiment đ We are all healthy and have survived having the stomach flu going through our house! I love that grape juice tastes great and is something my kids will willingly drink. So next time you are around someone with the stomach flu start drinking grape juice! During peak cold and flu season we drink one glass of grape juice a day to prevent the stomach flu. If you know you’ve been exposed to it then up it to three times a day until a few days after the virus is gone from your home. Otherwise, drink a glass daily to prevent the stomach bug from infecting you and your family! In the summer we don’t drink it as we find the stomach bug rarely strikes in summertime.",2012/01/12,snopes,1

Oh, and beg for clear skies. This month’s so-called “Snow Moon” will pass through Earth’s outer shadow just after sunset, turning its face varying shades of grey. Lunar eclipses occur when the Earth is optimally placed between the sun and the moon. With an added dose of serendipity, we’re on our planet’s primo dark side with front-row seats. On the East Coast, the full moon climbs above the horizon around 5:30 p.m., just as it enters Earth’s penumbral (outer) shadow and — ever so slowly — the lunar disk will start to dim and turn gray. Late afternoon twilight gives way to the evening dark skies. For practical purposes, the Eastern time zone will likely perceive the gray shading around 6:14 p.m., according to Alan MacRobert and Kelly Beatty, senior editors at Sky & Telescope magazine. By the middle of the eclipse, at 7:44 p.m. Eastern time, the northern third of moon will be a noticeably darker gray, said astronomer Geoff Chester of the U.S. Naval Observatory. After mid-eclipse, the graying begins to yield to the moon’s normal brightness. The moon fully leaves the penumbral shadow at 9:55 p.m. But wait — there’s more! Let the kids stay up late, because Comet 45P/Honda-Mrkos-Pajdusáková (don’t ask us how to pronounce all those names) makes its closest approach to Earth Friday night. You’ll be able to see the greenish comet by telescope and binoculars in a dark location, but not with the naked eye. Depending on where you’re located, clouds may also prove to be a hindrance. A fairly large portion of the Northeast is forecast to be shrouded this evening, as well as the Great Lakes region and parts of the Southwest. Fortunately you can still watch, because the great folks at slooh.com will be webcasting the eclipse and the comet. And really, even if the skies were clear, that might be the best option if you want to see both events up-close. Slooh’s live feed from various locations begins at 5:30 p.m. with the lunar eclipse. Experts will weigh in with a play-by-play around 7:30 p.m. during the eclipse maximum. At 10:30 p.m. ET, Slooh will begin the comet show. Join astronomers Gerard Monteux and Bob Berman to learn about this seventh-magnitude (not visible with the naked eye) celestial object. For both live shows, send photos of the eclipse and comet to @Slooh on Twitter for a chance to be featured during the webcast. This eclipse is a little like deja vu. Yes, you’ve seen it before — eclipses are dictated by the Saros cycle, where 6,585.3 days slip in between eclipses, according to retired NASA eclipse expert, Fred Espenak. This eclipse series lasts 12 to 15 centuries. This eclipse is Saros 114. It has been around since the year 971 and it will last until June 22, 2233 (at 22:22:33 Universal Time!), according to NASA tables. The previous eclipse in this series occurred on Jan. 31, 1999, and before that, the eclipse occurred in the waning hours of Jimmy Carter’s presidency on Jan. 20, 1981. Facts do not lie, as the next lunar eclipse in this series is Feb. 22, 2035 — George Washington’s 303rd birthday.",2017/02/08,snopes,1

(Photo courtesy of Marilyn Rodriguez)Editor’s Note: This story has been updated to include strong denials from pro-Trump protesters of allegations they singled out dark-skinned individuals, as well as video links showing their interactions during a protest at the Capitol on Jan. 25.Supporters of President Donald Trump singled out dark-skinned lawmakers, legislative staffers and children at the Capitol on Jan. 25 as they protested congressional efforts to pass immigration reform, according to staffers of the Arizona Legislature and two Democratic legislators.Waving large flags in support of Trump while standing between the House and Senate buildings, the protesters, who were also armed, asked just about anyone who crossed their path if they “support illegal immigration.”They called some “illegal” and told them to “go home,” barbs they reserved for those with brown skin, according to the staffers.Two women who said they were part of the protest against illegal immigration at the Capitol vehemently denied accusations that they singled out dark-skinned people and accused them of being illegal immigrants.But Lisette Flores and Selianna Robles, policy advisors for Senate Democrats, said they were yelled at when they walked from the Senate to the House lawn, directly passing the Trump supporters, to get lunch at a farmers market. Three white coworkers offered to escort Flores, Robles, and Democratic staffer Dora Ramirez back to their offices, Robles said.“We’re walking back, and they start yelling again, ‘Get out of the country.’ At that point, they pointed to Lisette, called her an illegal, and said, ‘Get out, go back home!’” Robles said. “But they pointed at Jane (Ahern), who works for the House, and they said, ‘No, you can stay.’”Ahern, a policy advisor for House Democrats, is white.“I was born in California,” said Flores. “I’m obviously of Mexican descent, so I think in that group I’m the darkest one. Selianna and Dora, they’re light-skinned Latinos. So, I think probably that’s why they pointed at me out of a group of six.”“They assume things about you. There’s not much we can do,” said Robles, an Arizona native raised in the town of San Luis. “We work for the state, we’re public servants, and we’re just here to do our job.”Lawmakers said they were also questioned based on their appearance. Rep. Eric Descheenie, D-Chinle, said he was confronted by Trump supporters while helping defend a young student that he said was being harassed.They asked Descheenie, a Navajo lawmaker, if he was in the United States illegally.Rep. Eric Descheenie (D-Chinle)“I’m indigenous to these lands,” Descheenie said. “My ancestors fought and died on these lands. I just told them, ‘Don’t ask me that question.’”Rep. César Chávez, D-Phoenix, said he was approached by a female Trump supporter asking who he was and who he represents. For “the fun of it,” Chávez said, he replied, “I’m an undocumented legislator.” Chávez was brought from Mexico to the United States as a child.He said he wanted the protesters “to understand that in this country, through a process, you, too, can be a part of a nation that provides opportunity to everybody. I wanted them to understand that an individual who came to this country undocumented at the age of three is now a member of the Arizona State Legislature.”Chávez said the woman reacted by calling him “illegal.”“She said something like, “You’re illegal. Once illegal, always illegal,” he said. “I took no offense, no attention. It was just simply one of those things where you’re going to have a stance and I’m going to have a stance and we’re never going to agree on things.”Jennifer Caminiti-Harrison and Lesa Antone said they were at the Capitol to protest activists with Living United for Change in Arizona (LUCHA). The women told the Arizona Capitol Times in a phone interview tonight they’re against illegal immigration and don’t believe the LUCHA activists, who they alleged are undocumented, have the right to lobby state legislators.In denying the allegations, Caminiti-Harrison and Antone countered that their group was harassed by the LUCHA activists. In a live stream of the protest uploaded to Facebook by Antone, a LUCHA member could be heard telling a black Trump supporter, “You’re gonna be the first to get lynched.”“First, we were a group of several white, black and Latina Americans. To make assumptions that we were only calling out Hispanic representatives or ‘non-white’ legislatures (sic) is a disgusting, blatant lie,” Caminiti-Harrison also wrote in an email. “We also had legal immigrants visiting the Capitol who stood in solidarity with us along with Republican lawmakers who thanked us for being there and stopped for a photo.”In a video uploaded to YouTube , Republican Reps. Jay Lawrenece, of Scottsdale, and Bob Thorpe, of Flagstaff, are seen speaking and taking photos with protesters.“We asked every rep, white or otherwise, if they supported illegal immigration and why they put the needs of illegal immigrants over the needs of American citizens,” Caminiti-Harrison wrote. “Never at any time did we ask the representatives if they were illegals. Never.”A 14-minute video of yesterday’s protest uploaded on YouTube shows several interactions initiated by the anti-illegal immigration protesters. Near the beginning of the video, one protester could be heard assuming that members of a group are staying illegally in the U.S.“No, they’re not legal. They’re illegal,” a woman can be heard saying.“Yeah, we know they’re illegal. Get legal or get out of America … They’re illegal, see that?” another woman shouted at the group.In another part of the video, a woman can be heard confronting a group of men.“Why do you want to stay in our country if you hate it so much?” she said.One member of the group, a man, came back to tell the protester that she and others “need to get educated.”They exchanged a few more words, and he said, “This land wasn’t your guys.’” She yelled at him as he walked away, “You are an illegal alien.”When the man denied the accusation, the woman responded: “Those guys are illegal … They do not have any rights here. It is not their time. This is our time. Our nation. Our laws. Our streets.”The video also shows what appeared to be a LUCHA activist shielding a young man who was being questioned by the protester about his stance on immigration.“So, you also believe in ‘No border, No wall, No USA at all? Do you also believe in that? … Because if you do, why are you here? Because if you don’t support America, why are you here?” the protester said.“He’s not talking to you,” the LUCHA activist tells the protester and unleashes a profane word. Another protester then replies, “Get legal or get out. Go in there and fill your [expletive] paper out and get legal.”Trump supporters also disrupted a press conference hosted Thursday morning by LUCHA activists who came to the Capitol to raise awareness about legislation they’re backing.As LUCHA Executive Director Tomas Robles spoke to a crowd of supporters in Spanish, Trump supporters could be heard shouting over him , “Go home.”“I served five years in the Marine Corps. I fought for people’s freedoms to be able to come into this space and to be able to voice their concerns to the representatives that represent their cities and towns,” he said. “The fact that I got called an illegal, the fact that all our constituents were called so many names … every single person has a right to be here.”Antone posted on Facebook a nearly two-hour video showing pro-Trump supporters shouting at the LUCHA activists on the subject of wages. At one point, a woman who was part of the pro-Trump group yelled at the LUCHA activists, “You don’t deserve more money just for showing up … You don’t get more money ’cause you’re brown.”Mary Lou Sandoval, a Maryvale resident who attended the LUCHA event, later saw the protesters screaming at children who were touring the Capitol on field trips.“[It] was a little ridiculous. You can protest peacefully as well, and you can make your own presence [felt] peacefully,” she said.Senate Minority Leader Katie Hobbs (D-Phoenix) (Photo by Katie Campbell/Arizona Capitol Times)Senate Minority Leader Katie Hobbs, D-Phoenix, wrote a letter to Senate President Steve Yarbrough, R-Chandler, and Senate security officials outlining what she called the harassment of staffers who the protesters “perceived not to be white,” and complained about a lack of response from law enforcement at the scene observing the protest.“I can tell you that the Democratic staff who were yelled at by the protesters and called illegals definitely felt harassed and were not satisfied with the response,” Hobbs wrote. “They did not feel safe.”Hobbs said she was told by an officer on Thursday that law enforcement was instructed to stand down while the Trump supporters exercised their First Amendment rights.Their protest went “far beyond” the First Amendment, Hobbs wrote.“This is a public place. When armed protesters aggressively go after members, staff and visitors, there needs to be a response that ensures the safety of everyone involved,” Hobbs wrote. “I have seen instances here at the capital (sic) when peaceful protesters with a different agenda were surrounded by many more law enforcement officers with a much more aggressive response.”“This is unacceptable,” she added.Officials with the Department of Public Safety did not return a request for comment.Read Hobb’s letter below.",2018/01/26,snopes,1

They can range in size, from a tiny grain of sand to, in extreme cases, the size of a golf ball. Patients with kidney stones don't always need treatment, because the stones can pass out of the body on their own, but the process of passing them can be quite painful. The stones must travel from the kidney down the ureter and to the bladder, and then exit the body through the urethra.The authors of the new study, published today (Sept. 26) in the Journal of the American Osteopathic Association , noticed that several of their patients had reported passing kidney stones after going on the Big Thunder Mountain Railroad roller coaster at Disney World in Florida.In one instance, for example, a man told the doctors that he passed a stone after three consecutive rides on the roller coaster, according to the study. [ 16 Oddest Medical Cases ]Studying this phenomenon required a bit of ingenuity from the researchers. To test the effects of riding a roller coaster with kidney stones, they created a 3D model of a kidney that could be taken along for the ride (concealed in a backpack, of course).In the experiment, the researchers placed three real kidney stones and some urine in the model kidney. The kidney stones were different sizes: small (4.5 cubic millimeters), medium (13.5 cubic mm) and large (64.6 cubic mm).The researchers took the model kidney on the Big Thunder Mountain Railroad roller coaster 20 times. They experimented with the position of the different sizes of kidney stones in different parts of their kidney model. On one ride, for example, the largest stone was placed in the upper part of the kidney; on another, the large stone was placed in the middle of the kidney. Ultimately, each stone was placed in each location of the kidney for at least one ride.The researchers noted that one aspect of the experiment that they could not control was where they sat on the roller coaster. Indeed, ""seat assignment on the roller coaster was random and determined as a function of place in the waiting line ,"" they wrote.But seat assignment turned out to be important. When the researchers were seated in the rear car of the roller coaster, the kidney stones, regardless of their size or location in the kidney, passed nearly 64 percent of the time, according to the study.When the researchers sat in the front of the roller coaster, however, the stones passed only about 17 percent of the time, the researchers found.The preliminary study's findings ""support the anecdotal evidence that a ride on a moderate-intensity roller coaster could benefit some patients with small kidney stones,"" Dr. David Wartinger, a professor emeritus of urology at the Michigan State University College of Osteopathic Medicine and a co-author of the study, said in a statement.Riding a roller coaster after having treatments such as lithotripsy — a procedure that aims to break up kidney stones into smaller particles using ultrasound shock waves — could prevent stones from getting larger and causing additional problems, Wartinger said.Originally published on Live Science .You'd Also Like",2016/09/27,snopes,1
