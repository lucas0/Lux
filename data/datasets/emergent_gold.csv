Police could have a hard time catching the man as the town may let go over 50 civilians who answer phones for the cops.

According to the News & Star, the cuts are part of a money saving plan by the city. However, the police department hopes that by having the cops answer the phones they won't have to respond in person as much.

A 15-year-old boy by the name of Kai Thomas was in a coma for nine days, recovering from a brain bleed.

A man in Carlisle who slaps locals if they are caught sneezing is being hunted by police.

The man, who is described as middle-aged, first assaulted a woman on Monday, smacking her around the back of the head after she sneezed, in what police have described as ‘very strange behaviour’.

And on Tuesday, detectives believe that the same man launched an unprovoked attack on a frail 82-year-old woman in Scotch Street, at roughly 11.30 am.

Cumbria Police have described the prime suspect as wearing a tweed jacket and being in his mid-to-late 50s.

They are yet to trace the first victim, who was female, but said they believe that the two crimes are linked.

The limited edition prints were unveiled at the Royal Opera House last month, produced from three original water colour portraits by Chalfont St Peter water colour artist Gordon King.

They were commissioned by Ever English Ltd and 1,000 limited edition prints have been produced of each portrait which will be sold either direct from the company or over the internet.

Ever English hopes to donate more than £50 from the sale of each print to the Alzheimer's Society.

The Darcey Bussell collection was the first venture for Neil Buckley since he set up the company last year.

Mr Buckley, who already has an import business, decided he wanted to start up an export business and at the same time help a charity. He has had personal experience of the effects of Alheimzer's through his late father-in-law and chose to donate part of the proceeds to the charity.

Mr Buckley said: ""I have known Gordon King for about 20 years. I approached Darcey Bussell out of the blue and she was very willing to help from the start."" He accompanied Mr King to the Royal Opera House to do the original sketches and photographs.

The launch also provided the latest project for website design company E-creation, also in Gerrards Cross, which Mr Buckley found through the Register of Accredited Service Providers supported by Thames Valley Business Link.

He said: ""It was not only the quality of service, but the level of support that E-creation provided which was impressive.""

http://www.emergent.info/human-death-GMO	Claim: Doctors confirmed the first case of death by genetically modified food	false	['Fake News', 'Hoaxes', 'World News Daily Report']	2015/03/09	emergent	['http://reseauinternational.net/des-medecins-confirment-le-premier-cas-de-deces-lie-a-lingestion-dogm/', 'http://worldnewsdailyreport.com/doctors-confirm-first-human-death-officially-caused-by-gmos/']	http://worldnewsdailyreport.com/doctors-confirm-first-human-death-officially-caused-by-gmos/	http://worldnewsdailyreport.com/	"Madrid | Doctors of the Carlos III hospital confirmed this morning in a press conference, the first case of human death caused by the ingestion of genetically modified food. Juan Pedro Ramos died from anaphylaxis after eating some recently developed tomatoes containing fish genes, which provoked a violent and lethal allergic reaction.

This surprising announcement comes after the autopsy of the 31-year old Spanish man who died at the Madrid hospital at the beginning of January.

The young man’s health rapidly deteriorated after he suffered an unexplained allergic reaction, and all the drugs used to refrain the anaphylaxis were entirely inefficient.

The team of experts claims to have been able to determine that the genetically modified tomatoes that the victim ingested at lunch were the cause of the allergic reaction that caused his death.

Mr. Ramos was working as a clerk in a Madrid warehouse on January 7, when he started feeling ill just after lunch.

A number of symptoms started to manifest themselves, including a violent itchy rash, some serious swelling of the throat and a drastic drop in blood pressure.

The man, who was known to have allergies, quickly injected himself some epinephrine, but his health condition continued to deteriorate.

The young man was rapidly carried to the hospital by co-workers, but the medical staff was unable to identify the cause of his allergic reaction in time and none of the usual treatments or drugs seemed to work. Mr. Ramos was confirmed dead just over an hour after arriving at the hospital.

The medical examiners and forensic experts at the Carlos III hospital had to execute a lot of tests and analysis before they could precisely determine what caused Mr. Ramos to die of an allergic reaction to seafood since all he had eaten before his death was a bacon, lettuce and tomato sandwich with a diet cola.

They were astonished when they discovered that the tomato he had ingested, not only contained some fish-related allergens, but also some antibiotic resistant genes which had prevented Mr. Ramos’ white blood cell from saving his life.

“At first we thought that there had been some form of contamination of his food, from contact with fish or seafood during the preparation” explained Dr. Rafael Pérez-Santamarina.

“It was only when we tested the tomato itself that we noticed that it contained some allergens usually found in seafood. We did many different analysis and they all confirmed that the tomato was indeed the source of the allergens that killed Mr. Ramos.”

The case of Mr. Ramos is the first human death officially confirmed to be linked to the ingestion of genetically modified food. It contradicts most studies on GMOs which had concluded that genetically engineered crops currently on the market were completely safe to eat.

A team led by University of Nebraska scientists had anticipated this kind of problem in 1996 when they found that a Brazil nut protein introduced to improve the nutritional quality of genetically modified soybeans was able to provoke an allergic reaction in people with Brazil nut allergies.

However, this kind of problem was dismissed by most scientists as very improbable, since it could easily be avoided with proper safety testing.

The soybean injected with the Brazil nut gene was indeed abandoned during development, but it seems that the genetically modified tomato that caused Mr. Ramos’ death had not been submitted to sufficient testing and the lethal risk had not been identified before it was marketed.

The Spanish Ministry of Health, Social Services, and Equality ordered for the tomatoes of Portuguese origin which infected the young man, to be recalled and removed from stores and markets for safety reasons.

More than 7,000 tons of tomatoes will, therefore, be ceased across the country by ministry inspectors and public safety officials.

The ministry also issued a public statement about the death of Mr. Ramos in which it sends its condolences to his family and adds that it will “immediately demand further research on the subject to determine if other genetically modified food products on the European market could represent a risk for the Spanish population”."

Salespeople are being trained to help customers pick out specific models.

This falls in line with what we've already heard regarding Apple's retail strategy for the Apple Watch. Last week, 9to5Mac's Mark Gurman revealed Apple's retail plans for the watch, which included having salespeople ask customers detailed questions about how they plan to use the watch.

Apple has emphasized the fact that it's selling the Apple Watch as a timepiece more than a gadget, so it's not surprising to hear that it's taking a different approach to retail. When it first presented the watch in September, it stressed that the Apple Watch is meant to tell the time before anything else.

It's the first new product category Apple has unveiled since the introduction of the iPad in 2010, and the company's retail strategy will also be telling of how Angel Ahrendts, Apple's new senior vice president of retail, is handling the job.

A patent application (via Leancrew) appears to explain this–and shows that Apple saves money on the gold into the bargain.

18-karat gold isn’t pure gold, it is defined as being 75% gold by weight. The remaining 25% of the mix is usually made up of one or more other metals, with silver and copper popular choices. The Apple patent describes mixing gold with low-density ceramic particles instead of metal.

Because weight, not volume, is what defines the karat gold standards, Apple’s watch could use less than a third the gold of a conventional alloy while still qualifying as 18-karat gold …

The company may also be planning an even more expensive Apple Watch than the $6-10,000 gold Edition model: the WSJ reports that “people familiar with the matter” say the company has studied platinum watch casings. High-end platinum watches typically sell for around three times the price of solid gold ones.

Don’t expect to see it announced today, however. The report makes no mention of Apple reaching any decision on a platinum model, merely saying that “he company isn’t expected to announce that on Monday.”

Daring Fireball‘s John Gruber is among those speculating that Apple may, though, announce a gold Link Bracelet for the Edition model, guessing that the total price of that combo may hit $20,000. His other price guesses seem a bit complex to me, but we’ll of course find out at 10am PT/1pm ET/5pm GMT.

However, it’s not expected to announce the new case during today’s ""Spring Forward"" event. The WSJ also corroborates rumors that Apple will be redesigning its stores to include a space where customers can try on the watch by appointment.

It’s likely that Apple will be limiting the initial buying experience to its own stores, where the company has total control over the sales experience. Reuters reports that Apple resellers, like Best Buy, may not carry the watch at launch, with Macy’s, Saks, Bloomingdale's, and Barney’s expressing the same. Apple held a private event at the luxury retailer Colette in Paris back in September, hinting at a possible store-within-a-store retail strategy for Apple Watch Edition sales. Reuters notes that Nordstrom has been in discussions with Apple.

Will a gold strap be announced today?

The Apple Watch will go on sale in April with 38mm and 42mm cases made from aluminum, stainless steel, and a scratch resistant 18-karat gold. Platinum is the obvious omission, a material commonly used by luxury watch makers such as Rolex and Omega.

Apple Watch strap materials include fluoroelastomer (rubber), leather, and stainless steel. While a gold strap hasn’t been announced yet, some, including Daring Fireball’s John Gruber, have speculated that it could be announced today and push the Watch Edition price to the $20,000 mark. The Watch Sport model features hardened Ion-X glass and a composite (plastic) back, while both the stainless steel Watch and gold Watch Edition models use sapphire crystal and ceramic backs. Apple has yet to detail prices, only announcing a starting price of $349.

Not that this new gold is anything you’d need a new magical alchemy to concoct – this is just a matter of preparation and process.

The Apple Watch comes in several different editions. One of them is called Apple Watch Edition. “The Edition collection,” says Apple, “features six uniquely elegant expressions of Apple Watch.” Apple notes that each of these devices has a watch case crafted from 18-karat gold that they say their metallurgists “have developed to be up to twice as hard as standard gold.”

Jony Ive corroborates this in a story posted by The Financial Times this week. In this story, Ive “explains how the molecules in Apple gold are closer together, making it twice as hard as standard gold.” That’s how hardness works, after all.

As mentioned by Ars Technica’s Jonathan M. Gitlin, Apple filed patent application (USPTO) 20140361670 back in June of 2013 for a “Method and apparatus for forming a gold metal matrix composite” which has an abstract which reads as follows:

“A metal matrix composite using as one of the components a precious metal is described. In one embodiment, the precious metal takes the form of gold and the metal matrix composite has a gold mass fraction in accordance with 18 k.”

“The metal matrix composite can be formed by blending a precious metal (e.g., gold) powder and a ceramic powder, forming a mixture that is then compressed within a die having a near net shape of the metal matrix composite. The compressed mixture in the die is then heated to sinter the precious metal and ceramic powder.”

The abstract also contains mention of diamond powder. So don’t worry about your fabulous 18k gold being lessened by the likes of peasant materials.

“Other techniques for forming the precious metal matrix composite using HIP, and a diamond powder are also disclosed.”

Sound alright to you? Just so long as the gold has a gold mass friction in accordance with 18k, we’re good to go, yes?

Twitter user Sumocat got some blowback for this tweet:

@marco_org Apple has a patent that can reduce the gold content of their 18k gold by half. veg.gy/ZhMF2

It’s inartfully put (140 characters is a bitch), but as a practical matter he’s correct. Apple’s patent application is for a method that allows them to make 18k gold that has, on a volume basis, less gold than regular 18k gold.

How can this be? It’s because Apple’s gold is a metal matrix composite, not a standard alloy. Instead of mixing the gold with silver, copper, or other metals to make it harder, Apple is mixing it with low-density ceramic particles. The ceramic makes Apple’s gold harder and more scratch-resistant—which Tim Cook touted during the September announcement—and it also makes it less dense overall.

The karat measure of gold is based on the mass fraction. One hundred grams of 18k gold has 75 grams of gold and 25 grams of other material. If that “other material” is a low-density ceramic, it takes up a bigger volume than if it’s a high-density metal. Because the casing of a watch is made to a particular size (i.e. volume), not to a particular weight, the Watch will have less gold in it than an 18k case made of a conventional alloy.

As an example, assume a conventional 18k gold alloy with 75% gold (19.3 g/cc), 15% silver (10.5 g/cc), and 10% copper (8.96 g/cc) by weight. The alloy will have a density of

\[\frac{1}{\frac{0.75}{19.3} + \frac{0.15}{10.5} + \frac{0.10}{8.96}} = 15.6\;\mathrm{g/cc}\]

A cubic centimeter of this alloy will contain

\[0.75 \times 15.6 = 11.7\;\mathrm{g}\]

of gold.

Now assume an 18k gold with 75% gold and 25% boron carbide by weight (that’s one of the ceramics mentioned in Apple’s patent). Boron carbide has a density of 2.52 g/cc, so a gold/boron carbide metal matrix composite would have a density of about

\[\frac{1}{\frac{0.75}{19.3} + \frac{0.25}{2.52}} = 7.24\;\mathrm{g/cc}\]

A cubic centimeter of this material will contain only

\[0.75 \times 7.24 = 5.43\;\mathrm{g}\]

of gold. Here, the gold takes up

\[\frac{5.43\;\mathrm{g}}{19.3\;\mathrm{g/cc}} = 0.28\;\mathrm{cc}\]

or 28% of the volume.

Table 1 of Apple’s patent gives other configurations and shows the gold savings.

Some of these numbers look flatly wrong to me. For example, changing from a baseline of 25.8 g of gold in a particular part to 12.1 g is not a savings of 43%, it’s a savings of 53%. Maybe I’m reading the table wrong.

In any event, the patent makes it clear that saving gold is one of the goals of the process. I suppose it’s not surprising that Tim didn’t make a big deal out of that in September.

I realize there’s little purpose to further Apple Watch speculation at this point — in two days, we’ll know most of the answers. But there is one good reason for last-minute speculation: this is fun. Apple tends to be such a predictable company that we often know the basic gist of what to expect before one of their media events. Not this time. The many unknowns surrounding the watch are what makes it so fun to ponder prior to next week’s event. So let’s have some fun.

First, there’s this. The same day I published my piece on Apple Watch pricing, MacRumors forum member “pgiguere1” created a graphic with possible prices, posting it with the comment:

I made this speculative price list based in large part on Gruber’s speculation:

The graphic is a pastiche of genuine Apple marketing material. A trained eye can easily tell it’s not from Apple — the typefaces are ones Apple uses (San Francisco and Helvetica Neue) but the way they’re used is wrong. But it’s close enough to fool many, and the image has now circled the social media globe several times. I’ve received at least 50 emails and tweets from DF readers asking if I’ve seen this “leaked price list”.

So let’s put it to rest. This graphic is not a leaked price list. It’s speculation from a MacRumors forum member who read my piece on Apple Watch pricing. And, I think, it’s off in numerous ways.

But there is one thing about pgiguere1’s speculation that I hadn’t really considered: that the 42mm models might cost more than the 38mm ones, across the board. On pgiguere1’s list, the 42mm Sport models are $30 more expensive than the corresponding 38mm ones: $349/379. I’m torn on whether this will be the case. Apple isn’t referring to the two sizes as women’s and men’s — some women will wear the 42 and some men (and, I suspect, many boys) will wear the 38 — but in broad strokes the 38 is the women’s version and the 42 is the men’s. You can see that in the high-end leather straps. The feminine “Modern Buckle” is only available for the 38mm size, and the “Leather Loop” is only available for 42mm.

“Bigger costs more” makes sense — and it’s true for most Apple products, from iPhones to iPads to MacBooks. But with those products, your choice of device size is a matter of taste and personal preference. With Apple Watch, your choice of size is in large part determined by your anatomy.

If I had to wager today, I’d bet that 42mm models will cost more across all three collections. A nominal difference for Apple Sport — $349/379 looks right to my eyes. The difference for Edition models could be $1000 or more because they’re made from solid 18K gold. I’m not sure what to expect for the steel ones, though. $100 difference?

Bands as Stratifying Differentiators

I think Apple’s messaging back in September was misleading, and I don’t think it was purposeful. I think it was a mistake that they will correct on Monday.

In September, the basic message was something like this: Watches are personal, and different people have different tastes, so we created a wide variety of bands to choose from so you can pick one that reflects your taste, and we made them easy to swap so you can change them depending on your mood or the occasion.

Most people took that to mean that your choice of band will largely be a matter of taste — that the various bands will be close to each other in terms of price. I know for a fact — from my email and tweets — that many Daring Fireball readers are hoping to buy an entry-level Apple Watch Sport and an optional Link Bracelet or Milanese Loop for maybe $150 or $200. And I also think most people expect the steel Apple Watches that come with the Link Bracelet or Milanese Loop to cost only, say, $150-200 more than the entry level models with the rubber — er, fluoroelastomer — bands.

I don’t think this is the case, at all.

I wrote about this two weeks ago, and upon further consideration, I am now thinking that the various Apple Watch bands will be priced in significantly stratified tiers.

Consider Apple’s description of what I am convinced is the highest-end strap, the Link Bracelet:

Crafted from the same 316L stainless steel alloy as the case, the Link Bracelet has more than 100 components. The machining process is so precise, it takes nearly nine hours to cut the links for a single band. In part that’s because they aren’t simply a uniform size, but subtly increase in width as they approach the case. Once assembled, the links are brushed by hand to ensure that the texture follows the contours of the design. The custom butterfly closure folds neatly within the bracelet. And several links feature a simple release button, so you can add and remove links without any special tools. Available in stainless steel and space black stainless steel.

Now, if you start with the assumptions that (a) the various watch bands are largely a matter of personal choice, (b) Apple will encourage Apple Watch buyers to mix and match bands, and (c) even the most expensive of them will only cost $200 or so, the above description reads as marketing braggadocio.

But if you start with the premise that the top-of-the-line steel Apple Watch will cost $1499 or maybe even $1999, the above description makes more sense. It’s an explanation for why the bracelet is so expensive. If it truly takes nine hours to cut the links for each band, and each one is polished by hand, and they’re mechanically complex (and they definitely are), this is not a $200 bracelet. I’m thinking it’s about $1000, judging by the description, and based on the prices for replacement stainless steel link bracelets from Rolex, Tudor, and Omega.

The three collections of Apple Watch — Sport, steel, and Edition — will not, I think, be represented by three basic prices. Instead, the three collections will comprise a continuum of price points, ranging from $349 to $10,000 (or $20,000, if my hunch is correct that there are gold Link Bracelets waiting to be revealed).

Here are my final guesses (38mm/42mm):

Apple Watch Sport (all colors, with Sport Band): $349/399

Apple Watch, steel, Sport Band: $749/799

Apple Watch, steel, Classic Buckle: $849/899

Apple Watch, steel, Milanese Loop: $949/999

Apple Watch, steel, Modern Buckle (38mm only): $1199

Apple Watch, steel, Leather Loop (42mm only): $1299

Apple Watch, steel, Link Bracelet: $1499/1599

Apple Watch, space black steel, Link Bracelet: $1899/1999

Apple Watch Edition, Sport Band: $7499/7999

Apple Watch Edition, Modern Buckle (38mm only): $9999

Apple Watch Edition, Classic Buckle (42mm only): $10,999

And purely based on my own speculation — the following configurations have not been announced, have not even been rumored, and have not been suggested to me by any sort of sources:

Apple Watch Edition, Gold Milanese Loop: $14,999/$16,999

Apple Watch Edition, Gold Link Bracelet: $17,999/$19,999

In my first draft of this piece, I had the regular steel Link Bracelet models at $1899/1999, and the space black ones at $2299/2499, and there’s a notion in my gut that I should have stuck with them. I’m out on a limb here, and it’s quite possible I’ll be serving up some home-cooked claim chowder Monday. Every single number above other than $349 is truly just a guess on my part. My predictions are way higher than almost everyone else’s:

Back in September, I wrote:

When the prices of the steel and (especially) gold Apple Watches are announced, I expect the tech press to have the biggest collective shit-fit in the history of Apple-versus-the-standard-tech-industry shit-fits. The utilitarian mindset that asks “Why would anyone waste money on a gold watch?” isn’t going to be able to come to grips with what Apple is doing here. They’re going to say that Jony Ive and Tim Cook have lost their minds. They’re going to wear out their keyboards typing “This never would have happened if Steve Jobs were alive.” They’re going to predict utter and humiliating failure. In short, they’re going to mistake Apple for Vertu.

The only thing I would change about this is that I now think it’s the steel Apple Watch pricing that is going to cause the massive collective shit-fit. Most people have wrapped their heads around the fact that the gold Edition models are going to cost at least $5000, and so have already written off Apple Watch Edition as something for the wealthy luxury market.

But the steel Apple Watch, that’s something that most people still look at as for them. And so they expect the starting price to be around $500, and the various leather and metal band options to cost $100-300 more.

But if the starting price for the steel Apple Watch is $500, I don’t see why Apple Watch Sport exists at $350. $150 difference does not justify the difference. If they were that close in price, there’d only be one of them. Sport and steel only make sense as separate collections if the steel collection is significantly higher in price, even at the entry level with the rubber Sport band. People are looking at this as a $100-200 upsell, like going from 16 to 64 to 128 GB iPhones and iPads. Technically that’s possible, but it doesn’t make any sense to me strategically or in terms of operational efficiency. With storage tiers in iOS devices, the only difference is the capacity of the flash memory chip. That’s it. All the other components, and the machining and tooling required to produce them, are the same. With Sport and steel Apple Watches, everything you can see or touch is different. Different metal (aluminum vs. steel), different finishes (matte vs. highly-polished), different displays (glass vs. sapphire), different case backs (plastic vs. ceramic and sapphire). If the marketing argument doesn’t persuade you, the operations angle should. I just don’t see why Apple would bother with all this if the starting price for steel Apple Watch wasn’t at least around double that of Sport.

That’s why I think the pricing for the steel Apple Watch collection is what’s going to raise a ruckus, because there are a lot of people who want one and expect that they’ll only have to pay $500 or $600, regardless of their strap preference.

At the introduction event in September, Tim Cook explicitly billed Apple Watch as the next flagship product line in the company’s history: Apple II, Macintosh, iPod, iPhone, iPad, and now the watch. There will be no brushing it off as a mere “hobby” if it isn’t successful.

The thing is, for all the griping about the prices that I expect come Monday, at $349, Apple Watch has the lowest entry-level price for any first-generation flagship product from Apple. The first iPod cost $399. The iPhone was $599 (before the infamous $200 price cut a few months later, which still left the entry model at $399). iPad was $499.

The fact that so many people want the steel Apple Watch and non-Sport bands shows why they will cost more: desire. Apple sets prices not based on what people want to pay, but what people are willing to pay.

This is without question new territory for Apple. They’ve never sold products with the same computing internals at different pricing tiers based solely on the luxuriousness of the materials.

Third-Party Bands

No matter what the pricing is, third-party Apple Watch bands seem like an inevitable thing. But will Apple stock them in its stores? Will there be a Made for Apple Watch program to certify them? I don’t think so.

If Apple’s prices are as high as I’m predicting, demand for third-party link bracelets and leather straps will be high. It’ll be interesting to see how it plays out. I never would have predicted the size and scope of today’s iPhone case market back in 2007.

The Messaging

If I’m even close to correct regarding steel Apple Watch pricing, and if I’m also correct that there’s going to be a vociferous backlash, Apple has only itself to blame. The September event and Apple’s marketing to date have created the impression that the differences between collections are largely about style, not price.

Using the name “Apple Watch” for the stainless steel collection — the collection with the widest variety of straps — clearly establishes it as the “regular” collection. In turn, that has left many with the impression that it will be the best-selling, the most common, the one most people walk out of the store with — and thus priced near the $349 baseline.

“Apple Watch starts at $349” as the one and only mention of price left too much room for bad assumptions, I think.

To play devil’s advocate, perhaps Apple did this deliberately. They showed all these different watch bands knowing that they would spark desire, and that people get their heart set on a certain combination based purely on how it looks — including combinations which they wouldn’t have allowed themselves to consider in the first place if they’d known the eventual price back in September. In other words, someone who’s had their heart set on a model with the Milanese Loop, under the assumption that it would cost, say, $600, might still go ahead and buy it for $1200 even though they wouldn’t have considered it in the first place if they’d known it would cost $1200 back in September.

I think that devil’s advocate take is over-thinking things. It’s just the only explanation I can think of other than that Apple kind of botched the pricing expectations for Apple Watch. Actually, there is one other explanation I can think of: Apple didn’t want its competition to know how much Apple Watch and Apple Watch Edition were going to cost, and they decided the competitive value of keeping prices secret outweighed the value of setting accurate expectations for customers.

Storage Capacity

Apple has revealed nothing about internal storage capacity in Apple Watch. I could see this playing out two ways:

Apple never talks about storage capacity for Apple Watch. It becomes a “secret” tech spec, like the amount of RAM in iOS devices. We’ll figure it out once we get our hands on them, but it won’t be something Apple talks about.

If they do talk about it, each collection will get its own tier. Say, 8 GB for Sport, 32 GB for steel, 64 GB for Edition.

I don’t think Apple Watch will need much storage, but they’ve said you can store music and photos directly on the device. So it’s not like storage doesn’t matter at all. It’s just another upsell to push people to higher-priced models.

The Modular S1 and Upgradeability

There’s been a lot of speculation about the modular nature of Apple Watch’s S1 “computer on a chip”. Why brag about that? Why encase the whole thing in resin? Why make this photograph? My wild guess back in September: perhaps Apple Watch, or at least the Edition models, would be upgradeable in future years. Take it in for service, pay $500, walk out with your “old” Apple Watch Edition upgraded with an S2.

I now think this theory is bunk. Not going to happen.

Take a first generation iPhone. Now imagine if you could upgrade it to today’s A8 SoC. It’d be better than it was before, that’s for sure. But it’d still have a low-resolution non-retina display. It’d still be stuck with EDGE cellular networking. It’d still have a crappy camera that couldn’t even shoot video. Etc. The “computer” inside Apple Watch isn’t centrally important. Everything is important. The health sensors, the display, the battery, the Taptic Engine, the digital crown, the networking capabilities, everything.

A few years from now we might have Apple Watches that support Wi-Fi or even cellular networking. They might go several days on a single charge. None of those improvements would come from an upgrade to an S2 or S3 chip.

I’d love to be wrong on this one, but I don’t think it makes any sense. And if I am wrong, the upgrade would have to include the entire innards of the watch — new display, new electronics, new battery, new sensors. Everything but the case and the bands. That still seems unlikely to me, but it’s at least plausible. And it could put Apple Watch Edition on par with existing luxury watches in terms of lifespan. But even in that case, the modular nature of the S1 doesn’t really have much to do with it.

Lastly, many readers have suggested a trade-in program, where you could bring in your old Apple Watch Edition and get a significant trade-in on a new one. No way. First, as stated earlier, the value of the raw gold in a gold watch is just a small fraction of the price. Second, trading in used goods is not part of a luxury shopping experience.

One More Thing

Holding the event at Yerba Buena instead of the smaller confines of their campus Town Hall makes me think Apple has a lot to show. There must be more to learn about Apple Watch’s software and experience — Tim Cook even said so back in September, explaining that they simply didn’t have enough time then to show more. I’ve heard that Apple has been hosting over 100 third-party developers and designers in Cupertino for the last month, to test and refine WatchKit apps on production Apple Watch hardware, so I expect a bunch of third-party Watch app demos too.

The new Mac version of Photos is in public beta, so I expect a full demo of that and the now-complete iCloud Photos cross-device experience. And if they’re going to talk about Mac software, maybe they’ll reveal the rumored 12-inch thinner-than-ever MacBook Air, too. My gut tells me the new MacBook Air could be ready, and it also tells me that the purported bigger iPad is not.

And I also think most people expect the steel Apple Watches that come with the Link Bracelet or Milanese Loop to cost only, say, $150-200 more than the entry level models with the rubber — er, fluoroelastomer — bands.

I don’t think this is the case, at all.

I wrote about this two weeks ago, and upon further consideration, I am now thinking that the various Apple Watch bands will be priced in significantly stratified tiers.

Consider Apple’s description of what I am convinced is the highest-end strap, the Link Bracelet:

Crafted from the same 316L stainless steel alloy as the case, the Link Bracelet has more than 100 components. The machining process is so precise, it takes nearly nine hours to cut the links for a single band. In part that’s because they aren’t simply a uniform size, but subtly increase in width as they approach the case. Once assembled, the links are brushed by hand to ensure that the texture follows the contours of the design. The custom butterfly closure folds neatly within the bracelet. And several links feature a simple release button, so you can add and remove links without any special tools. Available in stainless steel and space black stainless steel.

Now, if you start with the assumptions that (a) the various watch bands are largely a matter of personal choice, (b) Apple will encourage Apple Watch buyers to mix and match bands, and (c) even the most expensive of them will only cost $200 or so, the above description reads as marketing braggadocio.

But if you start with the premise that the top-of-the-line steel Apple Watch will cost $1499 or maybe even $1999, the above description makes more sense. It’s an explanation for why the bracelet is so expensive. If it truly takes nine hours to cut the links for each band, and each one is polished by hand, and they’re mechanically complex (and they definitely are), this is not a $200 bracelet. I’m thinking it’s about $1000, judging by the description, and based on the prices for replacement stainless steel link bracelets from Rolex, Tudor, and Omega.

The three collections of Apple Watch — Sport, steel, and Edition — will not, I think, be represented by three basic prices. Instead, the three collections will comprise a continuum of price points, ranging from $349 to $10,000 (or $20,000, if my hunch is correct that there are gold Link Bracelets waiting to be revealed).

Here are my final guesses (38mm/42mm):

Apple Watch Sport (all colors, with Sport Band): $349/399

Apple Watch, steel, Sport Band: $749/799

Apple Watch, steel, Classic Buckle: $849/899

Apple Watch, steel, Milanese Loop: $949/999

Apple Watch, steel, Modern Buckle (38mm only): $1199

Apple Watch, steel, Leather Loop (42mm only): $1299

Apple Watch, steel, Link Bracelet: $1499/1599

Apple Watch, space black steel, Link Bracelet: $1899/1999

Apple Watch Edition, Sport Band: $7499/7999

Apple Watch Edition, Modern Buckle (38mm only): $9999

Apple Watch Edition, Classic Buckle (42mm only): $10,999

And purely based on my own speculation — the following configurations have not been announced, have not even been rumored, and have not been suggested to me by any sort of sources:

Apple Watch Edition, Gold Milanese Loop: $14,999/$16,999

Apple Watch Edition, Gold Link Bracelet: $17,999/$19,999

In my first draft of this piece, I had the regular steel Link Bracelet models at $1899/1999, and the space black ones at $2299/2499, and there’s a notion in my gut that I should have stuck with them. I’m out on a limb here, and it’s quite possible I’ll be serving up some home-cooked claim chowder Monday. Every single number above other than $349 is truly just a guess on my part. My predictions are way higher than almost everyone else’s:

Back in September, I wrote:

When the prices of the steel and (especially) gold Apple Watches are announced, I expect the tech press to have the biggest collective shit-fit in the history of Apple-versus-the-standard-tech-industry shit-fits. The utilitarian mindset that asks “Why would anyone waste money on a gold watch?” isn’t going to be able to come to grips with what Apple is doing here. They’re going to say that Jony Ive and Tim Cook have lost their minds. They’re going to wear out their keyboards typing “This never would have happened if Steve Jobs were alive.” They’re going to predict utter and humiliating failure. In short, they’re going to mistake Apple for Vertu.

The only thing I would change about this is that I now think it’s the steel Apple Watch pricing that is going to cause the massive collective shit-fit. Most people have wrapped their heads around the fact that the gold Edition models are going to cost at least $5000, and so have already written off Apple Watch Edition as something for the wealthy luxury market.

But the steel Apple Watch, that’s something that most people still look at as for them. And so they expect the starting price to be around $500, and the various leather and metal band options to cost $100-300 more.

But if the starting price for the steel Apple Watch is $500, I don’t see why Apple Watch Sport exists at $350. $150 difference does not justify the difference. If they were that close in price, there’d only be one of them. Sport and steel only make sense as separate collections if the steel collection is significantly higher in price, even at the entry level with the rubber Sport band. People are looking at this as a $100-200 upsell, like going from 16 to 64 to 128 GB iPhones and iPads. Technically that’s possible, but it doesn’t make any sense to me strategically or in terms of operational efficiency. With storage tiers in iOS devices, the only difference is the capacity of the flash memory chip. That’s it. All the other components, and the machining and tooling required to produce them, are the same. With Sport and steel Apple Watches, everything you can see or touch is different. Different metal (aluminum vs. steel), different finishes (matte vs. highly-polished), different displays (glass vs. sapphire), different case backs (plastic vs. ceramic and sapphire). If the marketing argument doesn’t persuade you, the operations angle should. I just don’t see why Apple would bother with all this if the starting price for steel Apple Watch wasn’t at least around double that of Sport.

That’s why I think the pricing for the steel Apple Watch collection is what’s going to raise a ruckus, because there are a lot of people who want one and expect that they’ll only have to pay $500 or $600, regardless of their strap preference.

At the introduction event in September, Tim Cook explicitly billed Apple Watch as the next flagship product line in the company’s history: Apple II, Macintosh, iPod, iPhone, iPad, and now the watch. There will be no brushing it off as a mere “hobby” if it isn’t successful.

The thing is, for all the griping about the prices that I expect come Monday, at $349, Apple Watch has the lowest entry-level price for any first-generation flagship product from Apple. The first iPod cost $399. The iPhone was $599 (before the infamous $200 price cut a few months later, which still left the entry model at $399). iPad was $499.

The fact that so many people want the steel Apple Watch and non-Sport bands shows why they will cost more: desire. Apple sets prices not based on what people want to pay, but what people are willing to pay.

This is without question new territory for Apple. They’ve never sold products with the same computing internals at different pricing tiers based solely on the luxuriousness of the materials.

Third-Party Bands

No matter what the pricing is, third-party Apple Watch bands seem like an inevitable thing. But will Apple stock them in its stores? Will there be a Made for Apple Watch program to certify them? I don’t think so.

If Apple’s prices are as high as I’m predicting, demand for third-party link bracelets and leather straps will be high. It’ll be interesting to see how it plays out. I never would have predicted the size and scope of today’s iPhone case market back in 2007.

The Messaging

If I’m even close to correct regarding steel Apple Watch pricing, and if I’m also correct that there’s going to be a vociferous backlash, Apple has only itself to blame. The September event and Apple’s marketing to date have created the impression that the differences between collections are largely about style, not price.

Using the name “Apple Watch” for the stainless steel collection — the collection with the widest variety of straps — clearly establishes it as the “regular” collection. In turn, that has left many with the impression that it will be the best-selling, the most common, the one most people walk out of the store with — and thus priced near the $349 baseline.

“Apple Watch starts at $349” as the one and only mention of price left too much room for bad assumptions, I think.

To play devil’s advocate, perhaps Apple did this deliberately. They showed all these different watch bands knowing that they would spark desire, and that people get their heart set on a certain combination based purely on how it looks — including combinations which they wouldn’t have allowed themselves to consider in the first place if they’d known the eventual price back in September. In other words, someone who’s had their heart set on a model with the Milanese Loop, under the assumption that it would cost, say, $600, might still go ahead and buy it for $1200 even though they wouldn’t have considered it in the first place if they’d known it would cost $1200 back in September.

I think that devil’s advocate take is over-thinking things. It’s just the only explanation I can think of other than that Apple kind of botched the pricing expectations for Apple Watch. Actually, there is one other explanation I can think of: Apple didn’t want its competition to know how much Apple Watch and Apple Watch Edition were going to cost, and they decided the competitive value of keeping prices secret outweighed the value of setting accurate expectations for customers.

Storage Capacity

Apple has revealed nothing about internal storage capacity in Apple Watch. I could see this playing out two ways:

Apple never talks about storage capacity for Apple Watch. It becomes a “secret” tech spec, like the amount of RAM in iOS devices. We’ll figure it out once we get our hands on them, but it won’t be something Apple talks about.

If they do talk about it, each collection will get its own tier. Say, 8 GB for Sport, 32 GB for steel, 64 GB for Edition.

I don’t think Apple Watch will need much storage, but they’ve said you can store music and photos directly on the device. So it’s not like storage doesn’t matter at all. It’s just another upsell to push people to higher-priced models.

The Modular S1 and Upgradeability

There’s been a lot of speculation about the modular nature of Apple Watch’s S1 “computer on a chip”. Why brag about that? Why encase the whole thing in resin? Why make this photograph? My wild guess back in September: perhaps Apple Watch, or at least the Edition models, would be upgradeable in future years. Take it in for service, pay $500, walk out with your “old” Apple Watch Edition upgraded with an S2.

I now think this theory is bunk. Not going to happen.

Take a first generation iPhone. Now imagine if you could upgrade it to today’s A8 SoC. It’d be better than it was before, that’s for sure. But it’d still have a low-resolution non-retina display. It’d still be stuck with EDGE cellular networking. It’d still have a crappy camera that couldn’t even shoot video. Etc. The “computer” inside Apple Watch isn’t centrally important. Everything is important. The health sensors, the display, the battery, the Taptic Engine, the digital crown, the networking capabilities, everything.

A few years from now we might have Apple Watches that support Wi-Fi or even cellular networking. They might go several days on a single charge. None of those improvements would come from an upgrade to an S2 or S3 chip.

I’d love to be wrong on this one, but I don’t think it makes any sense. And if I am wrong, the upgrade would have to include the entire innards of the watch — new display, new electronics, new battery, new sensors. Everything but the case and the bands. That still seems unlikely to me, but it’s at least plausible. And it could put Apple Watch Edition on par with existing luxury watches in terms of lifespan. But even in that case, the modular nature of the S1 doesn’t really have much to do with it.

Lastly, many readers have suggested a trade-in program, where you could bring in your old Apple Watch Edition and get a significant trade-in on a new one. No way. First, as stated earlier, the value of the raw gold in a gold watch is just a small fraction of the price. Second, trading in used goods is not part of a luxury shopping experience.

One More Thing

Holding the event at Yerba Buena instead of the smaller confines of their campus Town Hall makes me think Apple has a lot to show. There must be more to learn about Apple Watch’s software and experience — Tim Cook even said so back in September, explaining that they simply didn’t have enough time then to show more. I’ve heard that Apple has been hosting over 100 third-party developers and designers in Cupertino for the last month, to test and refine WatchKit apps on production Apple Watch hardware, so I expect a bunch of third-party Watch app demos too.

The new Mac version of Photos is in public beta, so I expect a full demo of that and the now-complete iCloud Photos cross-device experience. And if they’re going to talk about Mac software, maybe they’ll reveal the rumored 12-inch thinner-than-ever MacBook Air, too. My gut tells me the new MacBook Air could be ready, and it also tells me that the purported bigger iPad is not.

I realize there’s little purpose to further Apple Watch speculation at this point — in two days, we’ll know most of the answers. But there is one good reason for last-minute speculation: this is fun. Apple tends to be such a predictable company that we often know the basic gist of what to expect before one of their media events. Not this time. The many unknowns surrounding the watch are what makes it so fun to ponder prior to next week’s event. So let’s have some fun.

First, there’s this. The same day I published my piece on Apple Watch pricing, MacRumors forum member “pgiguere1” created a graphic with possible prices, posting it with the comment:

I made this speculative price list based in large part on Gruber’s speculation:

The graphic is a pastiche of genuine Apple marketing material. A trained eye can easily tell it’s not from Apple — the typefaces are ones Apple uses (San Francisco and Helvetica Neue) but the way they’re used is wrong. But it’s close enough to fool many, and the image has now circled the social media globe several times. I’ve received at least 50 emails and tweets from DF readers asking if I’ve seen this “leaked price list”.

So let’s put it to rest. This graphic is not a leaked price list. It’s speculation from a MacRumors forum member who read my piece on Apple Watch pricing. And, I think, it’s off in numerous ways.

But there is one thing about pgiguere1’s speculation that I hadn’t really considered: that the 42mm models might cost more than the 38mm ones, across the board. On pgiguere1’s list, the 42mm Sport models are $30 more expensive than the corresponding 38mm ones: $349/379. I’m torn on whether this will be the case. Apple isn’t referring to the two sizes as women’s and men’s — some women will wear the 42 and some men (and, I suspect, many boys) will wear the 38 — but in broad strokes the 38 is the women’s version and the 42 is the men’s. You can see that in the high-end leather straps. The feminine “Modern Buckle” is only available for the 38mm size, and the “Leather Loop” is only available for 42mm.

“Bigger costs more” makes sense — and it’s true for most Apple products, from iPhones to iPads to MacBooks. But with those products, your choice of device size is a matter of taste and personal preference. With Apple Watch, your choice of size is in large part determined by your anatomy.

If I had to wager today, I’d bet that 42mm models will cost more across all three collections. A nominal difference for Apple Sport — $349/379 looks right to my eyes. The difference for Edition models could be $1000 or more because they’re made from solid 18K gold. I’m not sure what to expect for the steel ones, though. $100 difference?

Bands as Stratifying Differentiators

I think Apple’s messaging back in September was misleading, and I don’t think it was purposeful. I think it was a mistake that they will correct on Monday.

In September, the basic message was something like this: Watches are personal, and different people have different tastes, so we created a wide variety of bands to choose from so you can pick one that reflects your taste, and we made them easy to swap so you can change them depending on your mood or the occasion.

Most people took that to mean that your choice of band will largely be a matter of taste — that the various bands will be close to each other in terms of price. I know for a fact — from my email and tweets — that many Daring Fireball readers are hoping to buy an entry-level Apple Watch Sport and an optional Link Bracelet or Milanese Loop for maybe $150 or $200. And I also think most people expect the steel Apple Watches that come with the Link Bracelet or Milanese Loop to cost only, say, $150-200 more than the entry level models with the rubber — er, fluoroelastomer — bands.

I don’t think this is the case, at all.

I wrote about this two weeks ago, and upon further consideration, I am now thinking that the various Apple Watch bands will be priced in significantly stratified tiers.

Consider Apple’s description of what I am convinced is the highest-end strap, the Link Bracelet:

Crafted from the same 316L stainless steel alloy as the case, the Link Bracelet has more than 100 components. The machining process is so precise, it takes nearly nine hours to cut the links for a single band. In part that’s because they aren’t simply a uniform size, but subtly increase in width as they approach the case. Once assembled, the links are brushed by hand to ensure that the texture follows the contours of the design. The custom butterfly closure folds neatly within the bracelet. And several links feature a simple release button, so you can add and remove links without any special tools. Available in stainless steel and space black stainless steel.

Now, if you start with the assumptions that (a) the various watch bands are largely a matter of personal choice, (b) Apple will encourage Apple Watch buyers to mix and match bands, and (c) even the most expensive of them will only cost $200 or so, the above description reads as marketing braggadocio.

But if you start with the premise that the top-of-the-line steel Apple Watch will cost $1499 or maybe even $1999, the above description makes more sense. It’s an explanation for why the bracelet is so expensive. If it truly takes nine hours to cut the links for each band, and each one is polished by hand, and they’re mechanically complex (and they definitely are), this is not a $200 bracelet. I’m thinking it’s about $1000, judging by the description, and based on the prices for replacement stainless steel link bracelets from Rolex, Tudor, and Omega.

The three collections of Apple Watch — Sport, steel, and Edition — will not, I think, be represented by three basic prices. Instead, the three collections will comprise a continuum of price points, ranging from $349 to $10,000 (or $20,000, if my hunch is correct that there are gold Link Bracelets waiting to be revealed).

Here are my final guesses (38mm/42mm):

Apple Watch Sport (all colors, with Sport Band): $349/399

Apple Watch, steel, Sport Band: $749/799

Apple Watch, steel, Classic Buckle: $849/899

Apple Watch, steel, Milanese Loop: $949/999

Apple Watch, steel, Modern Buckle (38mm only): $1199

Apple Watch, steel, Leather Loop (42mm only): $1299

Apple Watch, steel, Link Bracelet: $1499/1599

Apple Watch, space black steel, Link Bracelet: $1899/1999

Apple Watch Edition, Sport Band: $7499/7999

Apple Watch Edition, Modern Buckle (38mm only): $9999

Apple Watch Edition, Classic Buckle (42mm only): $10,999

And purely based on my own speculation — the following configurations have not been announced, have not even been rumored, and have not been suggested to me by any sort of sources:

Apple Watch Edition, Gold Milanese Loop: $14,999/$16,999

Apple Watch Edition, Gold Link Bracelet: $17,999/$19,999

In my first draft of this piece, I had the regular steel Link Bracelet models at $1899/1999, and the space black ones at $2299/2499, and there’s a notion in my gut that I should have stuck with them. I’m out on a limb here, and it’s quite possible I’ll be serving up some home-cooked claim chowder Monday. Every single number above other than $349 is truly just a guess on my part. My predictions are way higher than almost everyone else’s:

Back in September, I wrote:

When the prices of the steel and (especially) gold Apple Watches are announced, I expect the tech press to have the biggest collective shit-fit in the history of Apple-versus-the-standard-tech-industry shit-fits. The utilitarian mindset that asks “Why would anyone waste money on a gold watch?” isn’t going to be able to come to grips with what Apple is doing here. They’re going to say that Jony Ive and Tim Cook have lost their minds. They’re going to wear out their keyboards typing “This never would have happened if Steve Jobs were alive.” They’re going to predict utter and humiliating failure. In short, they’re going to mistake Apple for Vertu.

The only thing I would change about this is that I now think it’s the steel Apple Watch pricing that is going to cause the massive collective shit-fit. Most people have wrapped their heads around the fact that the gold Edition models are going to cost at least $5000, and so have already written off Apple Watch Edition as something for the wealthy luxury market.

But the steel Apple Watch, that’s something that most people still look at as for them. And so they expect the starting price to be around $500, and the various leather and metal band options to cost $100-300 more.

But if the starting price for the steel Apple Watch is $500, I don’t see why Apple Watch Sport exists at $350. $150 difference does not justify the difference. If they were that close in price, there’d only be one of them. Sport and steel only make sense as separate collections if the steel collection is significantly higher in price, even at the entry level with the rubber Sport band. People are looking at this as a $100-200 upsell, like going from 16 to 64 to 128 GB iPhones and iPads. Technically that’s possible, but it doesn’t make any sense to me strategically or in terms of operational efficiency. With storage tiers in iOS devices, the only difference is the capacity of the flash memory chip. That’s it. All the other components, and the machining and tooling required to produce them, are the same. With Sport and steel Apple Watches, everything you can see or touch is different. Different metal (aluminum vs. steel), different finishes (matte vs. highly-polished), different displays (glass vs. sapphire), different case backs (plastic vs. ceramic and sapphire). If the marketing argument doesn’t persuade you, the operations angle should. I just don’t see why Apple would bother with all this if the starting price for steel Apple Watch wasn’t at least around double that of Sport.

That’s why I think the pricing for the steel Apple Watch collection is what’s going to raise a ruckus, because there are a lot of people who want one and expect that they’ll only have to pay $500 or $600, regardless of their strap preference.

At the introduction event in September, Tim Cook explicitly billed Apple Watch as the next flagship product line in the company’s history: Apple II, Macintosh, iPod, iPhone, iPad, and now the watch. There will be no brushing it off as a mere “hobby” if it isn’t successful.

The thing is, for all the griping about the prices that I expect come Monday, at $349, Apple Watch has the lowest entry-level price for any first-generation flagship product from Apple. The first iPod cost $399. The iPhone was $599 (before the infamous $200 price cut a few months later, which still left the entry model at $399). iPad was $499.

The fact that so many people want the steel Apple Watch and non-Sport bands shows why they will cost more: desire. Apple sets prices not based on what people want to pay, but what people are willing to pay.

This is without question new territory for Apple. They’ve never sold products with the same computing internals at different pricing tiers based solely on the luxuriousness of the materials.

Third-Party Bands

No matter what the pricing is, third-party Apple Watch bands seem like an inevitable thing. But will Apple stock them in its stores? Will there be a Made for Apple Watch program to certify them? I don’t think so.

If Apple’s prices are as high as I’m predicting, demand for third-party link bracelets and leather straps will be high. It’ll be interesting to see how it plays out. I never would have predicted the size and scope of today’s iPhone case market back in 2007.

The Messaging

If I’m even close to correct regarding steel Apple Watch pricing, and if I’m also correct that there’s going to be a vociferous backlash, Apple has only itself to blame. The September event and Apple’s marketing to date have created the impression that the differences between collections are largely about style, not price.

Using the name “Apple Watch” for the stainless steel collection — the collection with the widest variety of straps — clearly establishes it as the “regular” collection. In turn, that has left many with the impression that it will be the best-selling, the most common, the one most people walk out of the store with — and thus priced near the $349 baseline.

“Apple Watch starts at $349” as the one and only mention of price left too much room for bad assumptions, I think.

To play devil’s advocate, perhaps Apple did this deliberately. They showed all these different watch bands knowing that they would spark desire, and that people get their heart set on a certain combination based purely on how it looks — including combinations which they wouldn’t have allowed themselves to consider in the first place if they’d known the eventual price back in September. In other words, someone who’s had their heart set on a model with the Milanese Loop, under the assumption that it would cost, say, $600, might still go ahead and buy it for $1200 even though they wouldn’t have considered it in the first place if they’d known it would cost $1200 back in September.

I think that devil’s advocate take is over-thinking things. It’s just the only explanation I can think of other than that Apple kind of botched the pricing expectations for Apple Watch. Actually, there is one other explanation I can think of: Apple didn’t want its competition to know how much Apple Watch and Apple Watch Edition were going to cost, and they decided the competitive value of keeping prices secret outweighed the value of setting accurate expectations for customers.

Storage Capacity

Apple has revealed nothing about internal storage capacity in Apple Watch. I could see this playing out two ways:

Apple never talks about storage capacity for Apple Watch. It becomes a “secret” tech spec, like the amount of RAM in iOS devices. We’ll figure it out once we get our hands on them, but it won’t be something Apple talks about.

If they do talk about it, each collection will get its own tier. Say, 8 GB for Sport, 32 GB for steel, 64 GB for Edition.

I don’t think Apple Watch will need much storage, but they’ve said you can store music and photos directly on the device. So it’s not like storage doesn’t matter at all. It’s just another upsell to push people to higher-priced models.

The Modular S1 and Upgradeability

There’s been a lot of speculation about the modular nature of Apple Watch’s S1 “computer on a chip”. Why brag about that? Why encase the whole thing in resin? Why make this photograph? My wild guess back in September: perhaps Apple Watch, or at least the Edition models, would be upgradeable in future years. Take it in for service, pay $500, walk out with your “old” Apple Watch Edition upgraded with an S2.

I now think this theory is bunk. Not going to happen.

Take a first generation iPhone. Now imagine if you could upgrade it to today’s A8 SoC. It’d be better than it was before, that’s for sure. But it’d still have a low-resolution non-retina display.

I’d love to be wrong on this one, but I don’t think it makes any sense. And if I am wrong, the upgrade would have to include the entire innards of the watch — new display, new electronics, new battery, new sensors. Everything but the case and the bands. That still seems unlikely to me, but it’s at least plausible. And it could put Apple Watch Edition on par with existing luxury watches in terms of lifespan. But even in that case, the modular nature of the S1 doesn’t really have much to do with it.

Lastly, many readers have suggested a trade-in program, where you could bring in your old Apple Watch Edition and get a significant trade-in on a new one. No way. First, as stated earlier, the value of the raw gold in a gold watch is just a small fraction of the price. Second, trading in used goods is not part of a luxury shopping experience.

One More Thing

Holding the event at Yerba Buena instead of the smaller confines of their campus Town Hall makes me think Apple has a lot to show. There must be more to learn about Apple Watch’s software and experience — Tim Cook even said so back in September, explaining that they simply didn’t have enough time then to show more. I’ve heard that Apple has been hosting over 100 third-party developers and designers in Cupertino for the last month, to test and refine WatchKit apps on production Apple Watch hardware, so I expect a bunch of third-party Watch app demos too.

The new Mac version of Photos is in public beta, so I expect a full demo of that and the now-complete iCloud Photos cross-device experience. And if they’re going to talk about Mac software, maybe they’ll reveal the rumored 12-inch thinner-than-ever MacBook Air, too. My gut tells me the new MacBook Air could be ready, and it also tells me that the purported bigger iPad is not.

I realize there’s little purpose to further Apple Watch speculation at this point — in two days, we’ll know most of the answers. But there is one good reason for last-minute speculation: this is fun. Apple tends to be such a predictable company that we often know the basic gist of what to expect before one of their media events. Not this time. The many unknowns surrounding the watch are what makes it so fun to ponder prior to next week’s event. So let’s have some fun.

First, there’s this. The same day I published my piece on Apple Watch pricing, MacRumors forum member “pgiguere1” created a graphic with possible prices, posting it with the comment:

I made this speculative price list based in large part on Gruber’s speculation:

The graphic is a pastiche of genuine Apple marketing material. A trained eye can easily tell it’s not from Apple — the typefaces are ones Apple uses (San Francisco and Helvetica Neue) but the way they’re used is wrong. But it’s close enough to fool many, and the image has now circled the social media globe several times. I’ve received at least 50 emails and tweets from DF readers asking if I’ve seen this “leaked price list”.

So let’s put it to rest. This graphic is not a leaked price list. It’s speculation from a MacRumors forum member who read my piece on Apple Watch pricing. And, I think, it’s off in numerous ways.

But there is one thing about pgiguere1’s speculation that I hadn’t really considered: that the 42mm models might cost more than the 38mm ones, across the board. On pgiguere1’s list, the 42mm Sport models are $30 more expensive than the corresponding 38mm ones: $349/379. I’m torn on whether this will be the case. Apple isn’t referring to the two sizes as women’s and men’s — some women will wear the 42 and some men (and, I suspect, many boys) will wear the 38 — but in broad strokes the 38 is the women’s version and the 42 is the men’s. You can see that in the high-end leather straps. The feminine “Modern Buckle” is only available for the 38mm size, and the “Leather Loop” is only available for 42mm.

“Bigger costs more” makes sense — and it’s true for most Apple products, from iPhones to iPads to MacBooks. But with those products, your choice of device size is a matter of taste and personal preference. With Apple Watch, your choice of size is in large part determined by your anatomy.

If I had to wager today, I’d bet that 42mm models will cost more across all three collections. A nominal difference for Apple Sport — $349/379 looks right to my eyes. The difference for Edition models could be $1000 or more because they’re made from solid 18K gold. I’m not sure what to expect for the steel ones, though. $100 difference?

Bands as Stratifying Differentiators

I think Apple’s messaging back in September was misleading, and I don’t think it was purposeful. I think it was a mistake that they will correct on Monday.

In September, the basic message was something like this: Watches are personal, and different people have different tastes, so we created a wide variety of bands to choose from so you can pick one that reflects your taste, and we made them easy to swap so you can change them depending on your mood or the occasion.

Most people took that to mean that your choice of band will largely be a matter of taste — that the various bands will be close to each other in terms of price. I know for a fact — from my email and tweets — that many Daring Fireball readers are hoping to buy an entry-level Apple Watch Sport and an optional Link Bracelet or Milanese Loop for maybe $150 or $200. And I also think most people expect the steel Apple Watches that come with the Link Bracelet or Milanese Loop to cost only, say, $150-200 more than the entry level models with the rubber — er, fluoroelastomer — bands.

I don’t think this is the case, at all.

I wrote about this two weeks ago, and upon further consideration, I am now thinking that the various Apple Watch bands will be priced in significantly stratified tiers.

Consider Apple’s description of what I am convinced is the highest-end strap, the Link Bracelet:

Crafted from the same 316L stainless steel alloy as the case, the Link Bracelet has more than 100 components. The machining process is so precise, it takes nearly nine hours to cut the links for a single band. In part that’s because they aren’t simply a uniform size, but subtly increase in width as they approach the case. Once assembled, the links are brushed by hand to ensure that the texture follows the contours of the design. The custom butterfly closure folds neatly within the bracelet. And several links feature a simple release button, so you can add and remove links without any special tools. Available in stainless steel and space black stainless steel.

Now, if you start with the assumptions that (a) the various watch bands are largely a matter of personal choice, (b) Apple will encourage Apple Watch buyers to mix and match bands, and (c) even the most expensive of them will only cost $200 or so, the above description reads as marketing braggadocio.

But if you start with the premise that the top-of-the-line steel Apple Watch will cost $1499 or maybe even $1999, the above description makes more sense. It’s an explanation for why the bracelet is so expensive. If it truly takes nine hours to cut the links for each band, and each one is polished by hand, and they’re mechanically complex (and they definitely are), this is not a $200 bracelet. I’m thinking it’s about $1000, judging by the description, and based on the prices for replacement stainless steel link bracelets from Rolex, Tudor, and Omega.

The three collections of Apple Watch — Sport, steel, and Edition — will not, I think, be represented by three basic prices. Instead, the three collections will comprise a continuum of price points, ranging from $349 to $10,000 (or $20,000, if my hunch is correct that there are gold Link Bracelets waiting to be revealed).

Here are my final guesses (38mm/42mm):

Apple Watch Sport (all colors, with Sport Band): $349/399

Apple Watch, steel, Sport Band: $749/799

Apple Watch, steel, Classic Buckle: $849/899

Apple Watch, steel, Milanese Loop: $949/999

Apple Watch, steel, Modern Buckle (38mm only): $1199

Apple Watch, steel, Leather Loop (42mm only): $1299

Apple Watch, steel, Link Bracelet: $1499/1599

Apple Watch, space black steel, Link Bracelet: $1899/1999

Apple Watch Edition, Sport Band: $7499/7999

Apple Watch Edition, Modern Buckle (38mm only): $9999

Apple Watch Edition, Classic Buckle (42mm only): $10,999

And purely based on my own speculation — the following configurations have not been announced, have not even been rumored, and have not been suggested to me by any sort of sources:

Apple Watch Edition, Gold Milanese Loop: $14,999/$16,999

Apple Watch Edition, Gold Link Bracelet: $17,999/$19,999

In my first draft of this piece, I had the regular steel Link Bracelet models at $1899/1999, and the space black ones at $2299/2499, and there’s a notion in my gut that I should have stuck with them. I’m out on a limb here, and it’s quite possible I’ll be serving up some home-cooked claim chowder Monday. Every single number above other than $349 is truly just a guess on my part. My predictions are way higher than almost everyone else’s:

Back in September, I wrote:

When the prices of the steel and (especially) gold Apple Watches are announced, I expect the tech press to have the biggest collective shit-fit in the history of Apple-versus-the-standard-tech-industry shit-fits. The utilitarian mindset that asks “Why would anyone waste money on a gold watch?” isn’t going to be able to come to grips with what Apple is doing here. They’re going to say that Jony Ive and Tim Cook have lost their minds. They’re going to wear out their keyboards typing “This never would have happened if Steve Jobs were alive.” They’re going to predict utter and humiliating failure. In short, they’re going to mistake Apple for Vertu.

The only thing I would change about this is that I now think it’s the steel Apple Watch pricing that is going to cause the massive collective shit-fit. Most people have wrapped their heads around the fact that the gold Edition models are going to cost at least $5000, and so have already written off Apple Watch Edition as something for the wealthy luxury market.

But the steel Apple Watch, that’s something that most people still look at as for them. And so they expect the starting price to be around $500, and the various leather and metal band options to cost $100-300 more.

But if the starting price for the steel Apple Watch is $500, I don’t see why Apple Watch Sport exists at $350. $150 difference does not justify the difference. If they were that close in price, there’d only be one of them. Sport and steel only make sense as separate collections if the steel collection is significantly higher in price, even at the entry level with the rubber Sport band. People are looking at this as a $100-200 upsell, like going from 16 to 64 to 128 GB iPhones and iPads. Technically that’s possible, but it doesn’t make any sense to me strategically or in terms of operational efficiency. With storage tiers in iOS devices, the only difference is the capacity of the flash memory chip. That’s it. All the other components, and the machining and tooling required to produce them, are the same. With Sport and steel Apple Watches, everything you can see or touch is different. Different metal (aluminum vs. steel), different finishes (matte vs. highly-polished), different displays (glass vs. sapphire), different case backs (plastic vs. ceramic and sapphire). If the marketing argument doesn’t persuade you, the operations angle should. I just don’t see why Apple would bother with all this if the starting price for steel Apple Watch wasn’t at least around double that of Sport.

That’s why I think the pricing for the steel Apple Watch collection is what’s going to raise a ruckus, because there are a lot of people who want one and expect that they’ll only have to pay $500 or $600, regardless of their strap preference.

At the introduction event in September, Tim Cook explicitly billed Apple Watch as the next flagship product line in the company’s history: Apple II, Macintosh, iPod, iPhone, iPad, and now the watch. There will be no brushing it off as a mere “hobby” if it isn’t successful.

The thing is, for all the griping about the prices that I expect come Monday, at $349, Apple Watch has the lowest entry-level price for any first-generation flagship product from Apple. The first iPod cost $399. The iPhone was $599 (before the infamous $200 price cut a few months later, which still left the entry model at $399). iPad was $499.

The fact that so many people want the steel Apple Watch and non-Sport bands shows why they will cost more: desire. Apple sets prices not based on what people want to pay, but what people are willing to pay.

This is without question new territory for Apple. They’ve never sold products with the same computing internals at different pricing tiers based solely on the luxuriousness of the materials.

Third-Party Bands

No matter what the pricing is, third-party Apple Watch bands seem like an inevitable thing. But will Apple stock them in its stores? Will there be a Made for Apple Watch program to certify them? I don’t think so.

If Apple’s prices are as high as I’m predicting, demand for third-party link bracelets and leather straps will be high. It’ll be interesting to see how it plays out. I never would have predicted the size and scope of today’s iPhone case market back in 2007.

The Messaging

If I’m even close to correct regarding steel Apple Watch pricing, and if I’m also correct that there’s going to be a vociferous backlash, Apple has only itself to blame. The September event and Apple’s marketing to date have created the impression that the differences between collections are largely about style, not price.

Using the name “Apple Watch” for the stainless steel collection — the collection with the widest variety of straps — clearly establishes it as the “regular” collection. In turn, that has left many with the impression that it will be the best-selling, the most common, the one most people walk out of the store with — and thus priced near the $349 baseline.

“Apple Watch starts at $349” as the one and only mention of price left too much room for bad assumptions, I think.

To play devil’s advocate, perhaps Apple did this deliberately. They showed all these different watch bands knowing that they would spark desire, and that people get their heart set on a certain combination based purely on how it looks — including combinations which they wouldn’t have allowed themselves to consider in the first place if they’d known the eventual price back in September. In other words, someone who’s had their heart set on a model with the Milanese Loop, under the assumption that it would cost, say, $600, might still go ahead and buy it for $1200 even though they wouldn’t have considered it in the first place if they’d known it would cost $1200 back in September.

I think that devil’s advocate take is over-thinking things. It’s just the only explanation I can think of other than that Apple kind of botched the pricing expectations for Apple Watch. Actually, there is one other explanation I can think of: Apple didn’t want its competition to know how much Apple Watch and Apple Watch Edition were going to cost, and they decided the competitive value of keeping prices secret outweighed the value of setting accurate expectations for customers.

Storage Capacity

Apple has revealed nothing about internal storage capacity in Apple Watch. I could see this playing out two ways:

Apple never talks about storage capacity for Apple Watch. It becomes a “secret” tech spec, like the amount of RAM in iOS devices. We’ll figure it out once we get our hands on them, but it won’t be something Apple talks about.

If they do talk about it, each collection will get its own tier. Say, 8 GB for Sport, 32 GB for steel, 64 GB for Edition.

I don’t think Apple Watch will need much storage, but they’ve said you can store music and photos directly on the device. So it’s not like storage doesn’t matter at all. It’s just another upsell to push people to higher-priced models.

The Modular S1 and Upgradeability

There’s been a lot of speculation about the modular nature of Apple Watch’s S1 “computer on a chip”. Why brag about that? Why encase the whole thing in resin? Why make this photograph? My wild guess back in September: perhaps Apple Watch, or at least the Edition models, would be upgradeable in future years. Take it in for service, pay $500, walk out with your “old” Apple Watch Edition upgraded with an S2.

I now think this theory is bunk. Not going to happen.

Take a first generation iPhone. Now imagine if you could upgrade it to today’s A8 SoC. It’d be better than it was before, that’s for sure. But it’d still have a low-resolution non-retina display. It’d still be stuck with EDGE cellular networking. It’d still have a crappy camera that couldn’t even shoot video. Etc. The “computer” inside Apple Watch isn’t centrally important. Everything is important. The health sensors, the display, the battery, the Taptic Engine, the digital crown, the networking capabilities, everything.

A few years from now we might have Apple Watches that support Wi-Fi or even cellular networking. They might go several days on a single charge. None of those improvements would come from an upgrade to an S2 or S3 chip.

I’d love to be wrong on this one, but I don’t think it makes any sense. And if I am wrong, the upgrade would have to include the entire innards of the watch — new display, new electronics, new battery, new sensors. Everything but the case and the bands. That still seems unlikely to me, but it’s at least plausible. And it could put Apple Watch Edition on par with existing luxury watches in terms of lifespan. But even in that case, the modular nature of the S1 doesn’t really have much to do with it.

Lastly, many readers have suggested a trade-in program, where you could bring in your old Apple Watch Edition and get a significant trade-in on a new one. No way. First, as stated earlier, the value of the raw gold in a gold watch is just a small fraction of the price. Second, trading in used goods is not part of a luxury shopping experience.

The report also claims that the Apple Watch will only deliver notifications while worn on the wrist. The smartwatch will not ping you for notifications without being in contact with skin so that the device is not disruptive at unnecessary times. Apple Watch will also stop delivering notifications when the battery reaches 10% or lower in an effort to conserve the remaining power.

""Here’s a tidbit you might not know — in order to receive notifications from apps, the Watch must be on your wrist and locked. They require contact with your skin. There will be no in-app dropdown notifications or constant pinging while it’s off your wrist. Push notifications also cease when the battery reaches 10 percent. Those decisions speak to the care with which Apple is handling notifications.""

Apple continues to tweak Digital Crown on the Apple Watch, giving the button a ""weightier, higher-end feel."" Pressing and holding down the Digital Crown activates Siri, which the report claims works well and can be used for labeling, directions and commands using a paired iPhone. The goal of the Apple Watch, the report describes, is to return some of your attention away from your smartphone by allowing you to communicate from your wrist on the go.

While both reports this afternoon have provided a closer look at the Apple Watch, there are still several question marks surrounding the wrist-worn device. That will change in less than three days, when Apple provides more details about the Apple Watch at its highly-anticipated ""Spring Forward"" media event in San Francisco.

In the state of Colorado, cannabis clinics are big industry – earning some retailers nearly $1 million per year.

Those numbers made an impact on the KFC Corporation, they made the decision to include a pot dispensary to be a part of their Colorado franchise restaurants.

Franchisees have the chance to build a foundation into the business for an additional $35,000 setup fee.

The KFC Corporation was able to get approval on February 3, 2015 for their Cannabis Retail Recreational Marijuana / Medical Cannabis Occupational Business License.

So far, 42 of the almost 100 KFC franchises that are located in the state Colorado have made this “option” an addition to their menu.

Their is actually a humorous comparison due to the south park episode “medicinal fried chicken” having to do with KFC selling marijuana with there famous fried chicken

In the midst of all this a major crisis happens for cartman when his favorite foods at KFC are all replaced with medicinal marijuana stores. Though KFC isn’t going out of business they are adapting to a new trend.

“In order to be successful, a deep understanding of the market is critical to success,” says KFC spokesperson William Rausch. “It’s all about evolution and we are ready to serve the needs of the people of Colorado.”

For the people choosing to buy marijuana they must provide a picture ID showing that they are 21 years or older in order to make a purchase

Coloradans are only allowed to purchase 28 grams at one time, while people who are not citizens of colorado are limited on their purchase only be allowed to buy a quarter at a time

Due to banking restrictions, when making a purchase in dispensaries it is a cash only business . Ounces usually start at a price of 200 and only go up along with a pot tax of 25 %

A British man who went to fight against Islamic State in Iraq has said a mother was made to eat her own son after he was kidnapped and murdered by the group.

Yasir Abdulla claimed that an elderly Kurdish woman went to Mosul, a city captured by Isis, and demanded to see him.

But he said she was fed his body.

Mr Abdulla, from Keighley, West Yorkshire, told The Sun: ‘She was determined to find her son and went to Isis headquarters and asked to see him.

‘The Isis men told her to sit down because she had travelled a long way and said she should have some food before they took her to meet her son.’

She was then given meat, rice and soup.

He continued: ‘But they had killed him and chopped him up and after she finished the meal and asked to see her son they laughed and said “You’ve just eaten him”.’

Sick ISIS militants fed a desperate mum the mutilated remains of her son - after telling her it was cooked meat and rice, it was claimed today.

The son had been captured and taken prisoner by Islamic State militants in Mosul, Iraq.

The worried mum then bravely visited the terror group's headquarters in a bid to speak to her loved one.

ISIS fighters told the mum she should eat before seeing her son because she had travelled a long way.

However, after giving the mother cooked meat, rice and soup, she was horrified to be told she had just eaten her son.

British dad Yasir Abdulla, who left his home in Keighley, West Yorkshire to fight against ISIS, said he joined the battle against the terror group after being told this story.

He said: ""The ISIS men told her to sit down because she had travelled a long way and said she should have some food before they took her to meet her son.

""But they had killed him and chopped him up and after she finished the meal and asked to see her son they laughed and said, 'You've just eaten him'.""

And after witnessing the horrors of the terror group up close, Yasir says they have 'hijacked Islam'.

""ISIS are wrong. They behead, burn and get those they are against do dig their own graves before they execute them,"" he said.

""Nobody wants to get captured by ISIS, that would be the worst thing. If I was defending I would fight to my last bullet and use that on myself.""

Yasir is aware of Brits joining ISIS but has not encountered any in battle. ""I have seen what Jihad John has done and I think that person needs to be captured and executed,"" he said.

""England is a lovely place, the people are lovely and the Government is good. Whatever the British joining ISIS say is wrong about Britain, they just hate.

""They are not Muslims, they have hijacked Islam. Muslim people should not cut the head off an animal in front of another animal, but these ISIS behead people every day in front of other people.""

The incident is the latest atrocity from the terror group.

It emerged this weekend that Islamic State militants blindfolded a 'gay' man, threw him from a roof then stoned his corpse in Syria.

Horrific images revealed by ISIS show the barbaric killing in front of a baying crowd carried out at a building in Raqqa.

It is believed the man was sentenced to death by a sharia court.

The man was described as being a 'child of Lot' and accused of committing acts of sodomy, according to the Daily Mail.

'Lot' is a reference to a prophet of God whose story in the Qu'ran is used to demonstrate Islam's supposed disapproval of rape and homosexuality.

The images appear to show the man was blindfolded and had his feet tied before being hurled onto rubble from a tall building.

Crowds then gather round and pelt the corpse with rocks.

It was the fourth time in a few weeks that the jihadist group has used the brutal execution method for alleged homosexuality .

After claiming they found videos on his mobile phone showing him 'practising indecent acts with males,' a 20-year old man was stoned to death in the Syrian province of Deir Ezzor in late November, according to the Syrian Observatory for Human Rights."

Sick ISIS militants fed a desperate mum the mutilated remains of her son - after telling her it was cooked meat and rice.

The worried mum had bravely visited the terror group's headquarters in a bid to speak to her loved one who had been captured and taken prisoner by Islamic State militants in Mosul, Iraq.

ISIS fighters told the mum she should eat before seeing her son because she had travelled a long way.

However, after giving the mother cooked meat, rice and soup, she was horrified to be told she had just eaten her son.

There have been a number of real-life Hannibal Lecters who murder their victims in order to eat their flesh.

But there have also been people who have eaten human meat by accident such as David Scheiding who unwittingly ate some of a fast food employee's finger which had found its way into his chicken burger.

More sinister are those who have been forced to eat their own flesh or another's as part of a sadistic attack.

From an Irish gang who made their victim eat his own ear, to a mum who forced her sons to eat their own flesh.

Two sick attackers in Russia murdered a man before eating him and then selling the rest of his flesh to a kebab shop.

While alongside a range of disgusting crimes, warlord Joseph Kony forced a group of women to eat their own noses before returning them to their families as a warning to the community not to fight against him.

1. The Irishman who was forced to eat his own ear

A man in Ireland was forced to eat his own ear by a gang who attacked him in 2011.

Brendan Higginbotham needed plastic surgery to repair horrific injuries inflicted on him by thugs in Newbridge, Co Kildare.

He was attacked by a gang in the town where he was dragged down a lane and then beaten with a hammer and a metal bar.

He was injured on his head, jaw and leg, as well as losing part of his ear.

A police spokesman John Joe O'Connell said at the time: ""Part of this man's ear was cut off and he was actually forced to eat it.""

Higginbotham was too traumatised to describe the incident in detail and said he wasn't going to press charges.

He said: ""I just want to recover and get back to keeping myself busy, I'm glad I'm alive.""

2. The pair who killed and ate their victim before selling him to a kebab van

The killers were tracked down after police found human remains on the outskirts of the Russian town of Perm.

Two men confessed to stabbing the victim and then beating him with a hammer.

They then cut up his body and ate part of it, before selling some of it to a kiosk that sold doner kebabs and pies.

Investigators who searched the kiosk found no trace of the human remains.

Investigator Sergei Molchanov said: ""The meat had already been either cooked or sold.""

3. The Mum who helped to torture her own children

(Image: CEN)

Klara Mauerova, 31 and her sister Katerina led the sickening torture of her eight-year-old son Ondrej and his ten year-old brother Jakub.

She tortured her son in a locked cellar while relatives skinned him and forced him to eat his own flesh.

During the court case the two boys had told judges how their mother and relatives had stubbed cigarettes out on their bare skin, whipped them with belts, and tried to drown them.

They were also sexually abused and forced to cut themselves with knives.

The terrified youngsters said they were kept in cages or handcuffed to tables and made to stand in their own urine for days.

Klara, from the Czech Republic was jailed for ten years for her role in the sick torture.

She and her sister, both members of religious cult the Grail Movement, had refused to explain why they had tortured the boys.

4. The finger in the burger

In a genuine accident one fast food fan was sickened when part of the manager's finger ended up in his lunch.

David Scheiding sued the owners of fast food company Arby's after he bit into a burger and tasted the strange meat.

""It looked like I was seeing fingerprints on it,"" he said. ""I got sick and went to the bathroom.""

Health investigators talked to the restaurant manager, who had a bandage on his right thumb and wore a latex glove, according to a health district report.

The manager said he sliced skin from the thumb while shredding lettuce, and sanitized the area but didn't throw away the bin of lettuce, the report said.

Scheiding's sandwich contained lettuce.

5. The tyrant who forced women to eat their own noses

(Image: Reuters)

Notorious Joseph Kony, chief of the Lord's Resistance Army in Uganda, has been responsible for a long list of horrific crimes including ordering the rape of captured women on a massive scale and kidnapping children who are forced to kill or be killed.

One particularly disgusting attack was meted out on a group of women Kony wanted to make an example of.

A woman called Laweel was told that she and 10 others were to be mutilated, and sent home alive as a warning to others not to join the fight against Kony's

They were lined up and kidnapped children were told to sharpen the knives and machetes laid there, and one by one the women had their noses, lips and ears cut off.

They were then made to eat their own flesh."	5 other reluctant cannibals including those forced to eat own body parts	2015-03-02 16:56:05+00:00	['Nicola Bartlett', 'Image', 'Rex', 'Cen', 'Reuters']	['meat', 'cut', 'women', 'parts', 'victim', 'including', 'told', 'body', 'cannibals', 'mum', 'son', 'sick', 'forced', 'reluctant', 'eat']	"ISIS fighters told the mum she should eat before seeing her son because she had travelled a long way.

However, students in the world's richest nation lunches are the unhealthiest with lots of processed items

Korean schools serve hearty fish soup and fermented cabbage, kimchi while Greece, Spain and France all serve fresh meat, vegetables and fish

Mouthwatering photos of school lunches served around the world reveal even children in Ukraine, Estonia and Greece are treated to delectable meals each day. School children in America, meanwhile, aren't nearly so lucky.

Whereas a kid in France might be treated to a juicy steak and a hunk of brie, the richest country in the world's youths are more likely to receive unidentified meat served alongside little more than a starch like white pasta, fries or a roll.

The contrasts between America's school meals and those in far less fortunate economies are stark and suggest Michelle Obama's push for more healthful lunches nationwide may not be enough.

What is it? School lunches in the United States stand in stark contrast to the wholesome and in some cases even decadent meals served to kids in other markedly less fortunate nations

The first new school lunch standards championed by Michelle Obama have been phased in over the last several school years.

In addition to whole grain requirements, the rules set fat, calorie, sugar and sodium limits on foods in the lunch line and beyond. While many schools have had success putting the rules in place, others have said they are too restrictive and costly.

Backlash against the rules have spawned a wave of social media photos along with the tag #thanksMichelleObama. If these pictures are any indication, schools have responded to the rules by cutting down on portions to reduce fat and calories rather than by using potentially more costly ingredients.

Meanwhile, the widely different meals from Spain, Ukraine, Greece, South Korea, Brazil, France, Finland and Italy are all fresh and wholesome, with fish, steak and vegetables featuring prominently.

Photos of the meals appear on Sweetgreen.com.

But in the UK and US, lunch trays feature processed foods such as popcorn chicken, frankfurters, cookies, and beans from a tin.

What children in other countries eat (clockwise from top left): Ukraine's version of sausage and mash; Brazil's plantains, rice and black beans; beetroot salad and pea soup in Finland and steak with beans and carrots in France (photo courtest Sweetgreen)

South Indian school children eat off a thali plate which has white rice, sambar (dhal), smoked gourd vegetable stir-fry, curd, buttermilk and kesari, a type of sweet dessert made from semolina

The school lunch comparisons were revealed by Sweetgreen, a chain of US restaurants, and website Never Seconds, run by Scottish schoolgirl Martha Payne, who logs her thoughts and experiences of eating school meals at her primary school in Lochgilphead, Scotland.

The 12-year-old launched the blog in 2012 as a school writing project with assistance from her father, David,

Written under the pseudonym 'VEG' (Veritas Ex Gustu – truth from tasting), with the subtitle 'One primary school pupil's daily dose of school dinners', the blog features daily entries on the $3 school meal that Martha/ 'VEG' has chosen that day, her thoughts on the food and its quality, a count of the number of hairs, a health rating, a picture, and marks out of 10 based on a 'Food-o-Meter'.

Martha, who has been invited to talk in international conferences is currently raising money for Scottish charity Mary's Meals, through her JustGiving page.

Mary's Meals - which began in 2002 as a one-off school feeding programme - currently provides daily life changing meals to over 989,000 hungry children in Africa, Asia, the Caribbean, Eastern Europe and South America.

The surprising pictures show just how the UK and US measures up to the rest of the world when it comes to feeding schoolchildren.

While the majority of lunches feature fresh foods, US tray is packed with processed items.

Similarly the typical UK school lunch is sadly lacking in fresh vegetables, featuring a baked potato, sausage and beans from a tin, and a half corn on the cob with a melon slice to follow.

Lunch in an Estonian school is rice with a piece of meat and purple cabbage. They also have bread and a get a cup of chocolate drink

Balanced diet: Italian children get pasta, fish, two kinds of salad, rocket and caprese, a bread roll and grapes (courtesy Sweetgreen)

In Finland lunch is mainly a vegetarian affair of pea soup, carrots, beetroot salad, crusty roll and sweet pancake with berries to finish

School lunch in Alba, Spain (left): white flesh peaches, strawberries and yogurt melts, cous-cous, broccoli, cucumbers and roasted salmon; (right): Poached apple pears, strawberries and blue berries, boiled swede and fresh garden peas

In France, children start their meal with a generous slab of Brie.

This is followed by a hearty portion of rare steak, served with two types of vegetables - carrots and green beans.

And you won't find sweets on this lunch tray. The healthy theme continues into dessert, with the young ones tucking into kiwi fruit and apples.

The South Korean lunch is equally as impressive.

A milky fish soup to start followed by a serving of stir fried rice with tofu, broccoli and peppers. On the side is kimchi, the traditional Korean condiment of fermented cabbage.

In Scandinavia, Finnish schools dish up a vegetarian lunch of pea soup, beetroot salad, carrots and a roll. For pudding there is pannakkau, a sweet pancake served with strawberries and blueberries.

A meal of traditional flavours: Brazil's rice and black beans, baked plantain, pork with peppers and coriander, green salad and a seeded roll

In Japan, school children tuck into fried fish, dried seaweed, tomatoes, miso soup with potatoes, rice (in the metal container), and milk

A plump portion of lightly fried fish sits atop rocket salad in the Italian lunch tray. This is accompanied by a small portion of pasta, a simple caprese salad of tomatoes, mozzarella and basil, a crusy roll and a bunch of grapes.

Most of the schools have kept to traditional foods for the school lunch.

Children in Spain start their meal with cold tomato soup, gazpacho, served with shrimp and brown rice. This is served with a seeded roll, peppers with red cabbage and half an orange for dessert.

Children in Greece have baked chicken with orzo, stuffed grape leave, cucumber and tomato salad, yoghurt with pomegranate seeds and oranges.

Wholesome: Seeded roll, shrimp with brown rice, gazpacho and tri-colour peppers. Dessert is half an orange

The Sydney Morning Herald reports the procedures are thought to have taken place around the year 2000, but victims are only coming forward after getting over initial fears of speaking out against the widely-beloved Gurmeet Ram Rahim Singh, who has around 40 to 50 million followers worldwide.

Gurmeet Ram Rahim Singh

Known as ""the guru in bling"" and worth an estimated 40 million USD, Singh reportedly urged his followers that having their testicles removed would allow them to meet God and speak with Him directly.

Witnesses of the castrations say they were conducted at a hospital owned by Singh's spiritual organization.

Several witnesses have agreed to testify in court, possibly putting an end to Singh's history of avoiding conviction.

He was charged with conspiracy involving the murder of an investigative journalist in 2002, and several female followers claim he sexually abused them.

Singh was not jailed, however, supposedly thanks to politicians who believe his authority commands votes.

The current case was brought upon by The Central Bureau of Investigation, which is India's version of the FBI, and accuses Singh of grievous bodily harm.

A source told Indian media,

CBI sleuths met some old Dera followers and were, thus, successful in tracing some others who were castrated in the name of God. Some of the castrated followers, who agreed to record their statements before the judicial magistrate, have left for Delhi where the case has been registered.

The publicizing of the castrations has already tarnished Singh's reputation, at least for movie-goers.

Ticket sales for his latest film, ""MSG: The Messenger,"" are supposedly so low that Singh is reportedly buying them in bulk to maintain profits.

The details of the bizarre incident have only just come to light despite reportedly taking place in 2000 at a hospital run by Ram Rahim in India.

India's Central Bureau of Investigation has reportedly accused Ram Rahim of grievous bodily harm and he is under investigation. He has previously been questioned over the murder of an investigative journalist in 2002 and has also been accused of sexual assault by female followers but has never been charged.

Navkiran Singh, who is the lawyer for Hans Raj Chauhan, the only castration victim so far to come forward, said his client and other victims believed they would become social outcasts if they refused to perform the ""operation"" demanded of them by Ram Rahim.

""They were told that only those who get castrated will be able to meet God,"" said Navkiran, in a report in the Daily Mail.

Ram Rahim, 47, dubbed the ""guru in bling"", is head of the socio-political organisation Dera Sacha Sauda and is estimated to be worth £26m.

The guru stars in a spectacular new movie, Messenger of God, in which he appears to walk on air, tear tree trunks in half and perform other miracles. Though 157,000 people are thought to have attended the film's premiere in Gurgaon, near Delhi, according to the Sydney Morning Herald, the revelations have caused sales of tickets for the movie to dwindle dramatically.

Gurus are big business in India, where their endorsements can help political parties get elected, and where millions of people seek spiritual guidance every year. Sathya Sai Baba, who was said to be able to conjure ash from thin air, was worth an estimated US$7bn when he died.

Even after death, some gurus retain a hold over devotees. Ashutosh Maharaj, who was certified deceased by medical examiners last year, has had his body frozen by followers who apparently believe he is merely in a state of deep meditation called ""samadhi"".

The controversial Indian guru broke down in court on Monday, 28 August, after he was handed down a 10-year prison sentence for raping two of his women followers. The verdict was delivered at a Central Bureau of Investigation (CBI) special court inside a prison building in Rohtak, in the northern Indian state of Haryana.

Security was beefed up in and around the city in the run-up to the sentencing of the 50-year-old self-styled 'godman'. The court has also ordered him to pay financial compensation to the rape victims. Singh is expected to move the high court challenging the sentence.

Ram Rahim, dubbed the ""guru in bling"", is head of the socio-political organisation Dera Sacha Sauda and is estimated to be worth £26m. He commands an estimated 50 million followers worldwide.

On Friday, 25 August, a court found the flamboyant guru guilty of the rape charges. The judgement triggered violent protests among his supporters, leading to the death of about 40 people.

HE is adored by millions of followers worldwide, is the star of a major film and has convinced hundreds of men to castrate themselves.

The so-called “guru in bling” has also been linked to a murder and there are allegations of sexual abuse, but Gurmeet Ram Rahim Singh has always managed to stay one step ahead of authorities.

There are signs though his luck and influence might be running out.

His hold over followers was so powerful he convinced up to 400 followers to have their testicles removed because by doing so they would be able to speak directly to God.

Most feared for their lives and were worried about being social outcasts if they spoke out against him but it appears some have finally broken ranks and are prepared to go on the record with their allegations.

Until now hundreds of followers have been united in protecting him by not speaking with investigators, sources told India’sMail Todaynewspaper.

But it seems the cone of silence is about to smashed open as officers from the Indian equivalent of the FBI, the Central Bureau of Investigation, have reportedly obtained statements from some victims.

They have been building a case against Ram Rahim for months and intend to lay charges of grievous bodily harm against him.

“CBI sleuths met some old Dera followers and were, thus, successful in tracing some others who were castrated in the name of God.

“Some of the castrated followers, who agreed to record their statements before the judicial magistrate, have left for Delhi where the case has been registered,” a source told Mail Today.

Some of the witnesses have told police the castrations happened at a hospital run by Ram Rahim’s organisation.

It’s far from the first time he has come in for attention from authorities. In 2002 he faced conspiracy charges over the murder of a journalist who was investigating him and there have also been allegations of sexual abuse of female followers.

So far he has managed to escape having convictions of any wrongdoing, partly because he is a favourite of politicians, who see his value as a source of votes, Fairfax reported.

Ram Rahim has an estimated fortune of $50 million and as many as 50 million followers worldwide.

But in a sign his grip on followers could be weakening, ticket sales for his new film MSG: The Messenger have fallen since the castration controversy became public.

In January the film opened to a world-record audience of over 150,000 at a public premiere in Gurgaon, a city just outside of Delhi.

The film supposedly shows Ram Rahim breaking a tree trunk with his bare hands and walking on air, among other miracles.

But according to reports in India, audiences have been so low at many cinemas Ram Rahim has been bulk buying tickets to improve box office returns."

The country's top crime fighting agency registered a case against Gurmeet Ram Rahim - known as the 'guru in bling' for his penchant for garish clothes and jewellery - over the operations at his ashram.

The Central Bureau of Investigation (CBI) said Rahim is being investigated for criminal intimidation and causing grievous bodily hurt after an alleged 400 castrations were carried out.

'Guru in bling': Gurmeet Ram Rahim is being probed by India's Central Bureau of Investigation after a former follower alleged he ordered 400 men to submit to castrations he said would bring them closer to god

The guru, who heads the Dera Sacha Sauda organisation based in Haryana state, is already facing trial for conspiracy over the murder of a journalist in 2002, as well as with claims of sexually exploiting female followers.

The latest case was filed after one of his devotees, Hansraj Chauhan, lodged a complaint in court alleging he was manipulated into having the 'painful' operation at the ashram.

'They were told that only those who get castrated will be able to meet god,' Mr Chauhan's lawyer, Navkiran Singh, told AFP. 'We will put all the facts of the case to the court and seek compensation for the victims.'

Such allegations disturb me, when I am doing good for humanity. Me and my legal adviser are going to challenge the allegations Gurmeet Ram Rahim, guru

Mr Singh said doctors carried out the castrations over a period from 2000, but for years his client had been too scared to come forward.

The court asked the CBI to carry out an investigation into the alleged castrations.

The Times of India reports that Mr Chauhan said he was castrated at Rahim's ashram by doctors acting on the guru's orders.

A court-mandated medical examination determined that Mr Chauhan had indeed been surgically castrated.

Rahim, 47, yesterday hit back at the accusations, telling a press conference convened to plug his new movie he is considering legal action of his own against his accusers.

'Such allegations disturb me, when I am doing good for humanity. Therefore me and my legal advisor are going to move the court challenging the allegations,' said Rahim.

Colourful: The guru, who heads the Dera Sacha Sauda organisation in Haryana state, is already facing trial for conspiracy over the 2002 murder of a journalist, as well as with claims of sexually exploiting female followers

The Dera Sacha Sauda says it is a social welfare and spiritual organisation with millions of followers in India and broad.

On its website, the group describes Rahim as a saint as well as an author, inventor, scientist, philosopher, philanthropist, peace activist and 'the ultimate humanitarian'.

Rahim stars in an action movie to be released later this month called 'MSG: Messenger of God' in which the guru fights criminals, sings songs and is shown dousing himself in water in slow motion after a rugby game.

India has been rocked by numerous scandals involving popular godmen who are mostly Hindu ascetics claiming to possess mystical powers.

In November, police arrested Baba Rampal Maharaj after a long and violent siege at his ashram in Haryana when he refused to comply with court orders in a murder case.

A married TV actor who met a young woman and kissed her in a sauna woke up to find his testicles had been stolen.

Dmitry Nikolaev, 30, is believed to be the target of a gang – including a doctor – which may be harvesting organs to sell on the black market.

Nikolaev had a drink with a young blonde woman he met at a bar in a Moscow theatre before she invited him to a sauna, reports MailOnline.

A police source told the website: ‘They kissed and had some more beer and after that the actor remembers nothing.’ They believe Nikolaev’s drink was spiked.

He woke up the next day at a bus stop in acute pain and noticed blood on his trousers.

At the hospital staff told him that his testicles had been removed and that it appeared the operation had been done by a medical professional.

Dmitry Nikolaev, a married TV actor whose testicles were removed by a gang after he was apparently drugged in a bar in Moscow

'They kissed and had some more beer and after that the actor remembers nothing,' said a police source.

He woke up next day at a bus stop, feeling acute pain, and with blood on his trousers.

Rushed to hospital, he was told that his testicles had been removed and that 'it was done like proper surgery by someone with a medical education'.

The operation was conducted in a 'skillful way', said police, who believe his beer was spiked by an unknown drug.

Mr Nikolaev only realised that his testicles had been removed when he woke up at a bus stop in acute pain with blood all over his trousers

They fear a gang seeking to sell human organs on the black market.

The actor, now working as a children's animator, was too embarrassed at first to explain what had happened to his wife, said media reports.

According to The Washington Post, Mohammed Emwazi grew up in a well-to-do family in west London. He is believed to have traveled to Syria around 2012 and to have later joined the militant group.

Channel 4 News has spoken people who knew him at his school and another who says they were with him in the first weeks he was in Syria.

Contemporaries of his at the Quintin Kynaston Academy in west London describe as quiet, intelligent and hard-working. They say he cared for his younger siblings – and was religious though not unduly so.

One of Emwazi’s former teachers spoke anonymously to Channel 4 News.

She remembered a “diligent, hardworking, lovely young man” who was responsible, polite and quiet.

Expressing her shock at the path his life had taken, she recalled: “he was somebody who would always seek the correct way of handling something and when there were any issues, he would come and speak to teachers like me and ask to help him sort things out, he did things in the right way.

“There was never any indication of any kind of violence at all.”

He graduated with a degree in computer programming from the University of Westminster. A contemporary said he was often seen in the prayer room between classes.

‘I am sure it is him’



Channel 4 News has also spoken to a source who says he met and spent time with him in Syria. The source says he was one of a group from London including Ibrahim al-Mazwagi, the first British jihadi known to have died in Syria.

Emwazi initially joined the Migrants Brigade or Mujahideen in 2012. That year he was based in Idlib Province and then outside Aleppo. He then went on to join Al-Nusra and finally ISIS.

The source described him as personable, humorous on occasion but also determined that the fighters were portrayed by the media as people to be afraid of.

The source said he was a keen video games player, and a martial arts practitioner.

The source also recounted an occasion when as one of the best Arabic speakers in the foreign brigade he led the interrogation of a man who was questioned and then badly beaten.

‘Jihadi John’ has appeared in a series of videos in which hostages, including British aid worker Alan Henning, were brutally murdered.

“I have no doubt that Mohammed is Jihadi John,” said one of his close friends who identified him in an interview with The Washington Post. “He was like a brother to me… I am sure it is him.”

Cage report



Asim Qureshi, research director at the rights group, Cage, said after watching one of the videos: “There was an extremely strong resemblance. This is making me feel fairly certain that this is the same person.”

He later clarified that, due to the hood worn in all the videos, there was no way he could be 100 per cent certain.

Scotland Yard has refused to confirm the reports.

Commander Richard Walton, head of the Met’s Counter Terrorism Command, said: “We have previously asked media outlets not to speculate about the details of our investigation on the basis that life is at risk.

“We are not going to confirm the identity of anyone at this stage or give an update on the progress of this live counter-terrorism investigation.”

Emwazi is understood to have arrived in Britain as a young boy, aged six, after being born in Kuwait. Growing up in west London, he was described as a “polite, mild-mannered” man with a penchant for wearing stylish clothes.

It was during a trip to Tanzania in August 2009 that Emwazi’s life direction is thought to have started to change. Once landing in Dar es Salaam on the supposed Safari trip with two friends, he alleged he was detained by gun-wielding Tanzanian police and held overnight.

The trio were eventually refused entry to Tanzania and deported to the Netherlands, where they said they were questioned by MI5 agents who accused them of having links to Islamic extremists.

MI5 terror watch list



An article in The Independent in May 2010 outlines the allegations. Upon returning to the UK, Emwazi was reportedly on the radar of MI5, who warned him that he was on a terror watch list which prevented him travelling to any Muslim country.

He is later understood to have filed a complaint with the Independent Police Complaints Commission over his treatment.

Emwazi later moved to Kuwait, where he got a job at a computer company. But on a visit to London in June 2010, it is understood he was detained once again by counter-terrorism officials and prevented from flying back.

Two years later he was apparently in Syria fighting alongside IS.

Beheadings



His first public appearance was last August in a video of the murder of American journalist James Foley last August, dressed in black with only his eyes visible.

He later reappeared in videos of the beheadings of US journalist Steven Sotloff, British aid worker David Haines, American aid worker Peter Kassig and British charity worker Alan Henning.

British and US security services have previously inferred that they knew his identity, but Thursday morning’s developments and naming appear to have taken authorities by surprise.

A spokesman for the Foreign Office has said: “There is an ongoing police investigation into the murder of hostages by so-called ISIL in Syria. We are not going to give a running commentary on any element of a live operational security investigation.”

The University of Westminster has also released a statement in which a spokesman has said: “A Mohammed Emwazi left the university six years ago. If these allegations are true, we are shocked and sickened by the news. Our thoughts are with the victims and their families. We have students from 150 countries and their safety is of paramount concern. With other universities in London, we are working to implement the Government’s Prevent strategy to tackle extremism.”

The university later tweeted that it was postponing a student union event called ‘who is Muhammad?’"	Mohammed Emwazi: from west London to wielding the IS knife	2015-02-26 00:00:00	[]	['west', 'later', 'worker', 'source', 'knife', 'videos', 'wielding', 'university', 'london', 'emwazi', 'man', 'mohammed', 'syria']	"The masked man who beheaded several hostages held by the Islamic State group has been named as Mohammed Emwazi, a 26-year-old west Londoner who was known to the UK security services.

A spokeswoman for the British Embassy in Washington said: ""Our prime minister has been clear that we want all those who have committed murder on behalf of ISIL to face justice for the appalling acts carried out. There is an ongoing police investigation into the murder of hostages by ISIL in Syria. It is not appropriate for the government to comment on any part of it while this continues."" ISIL is another name for the Islamic State. US officials declined to comment for this report. Emwazi's family declined a request for an interview, citing legal advice.

Credit:Getty The Kuwaiti-born Emwazi, in his mid-20s, appears to have left little trail on social media or elsewhere online. Those who knew him say he was polite and had a penchant for wearing stylish clothes while adhering to the tenets of his Islamic faith. He had a beard and was mindful of making eye contact with women, friends said. He was raised in a middle-class neighbourhood in London and on occasion prayed at a mosque in Greenwich.

The friends, who spoke on the condition of anonymity because of the sensitivity of the investigation, believe that Emwazi started to radicalise after a planned safari in Tanzania following his graduation from the University of Westminster. Emwazi and two friends — a German convert to Islam named Omar and another man, Abu Talib — never made it on the trip. Once they landed in Dar es Salaam, in May 2009, they were detained by police and held overnight. It's unclear whether the reason for the detention was made clear to the three, but they were eventually deported. Emwazi flew to Amsterdam, where he claimed that an officer from MI5, Britain's domestic security agency, accused him of trying to reach Somalia, where the militant group al-Shabab operates in the southern part of the country, according to emails that he sent to Qureshi and that were provided to The Post. Emwazi denied the accusation and claimed that MI5 representatives had tried to recruit him. But a former hostage said 'Jihadi John' was obsessed with Somalia and made his captives watch videos about al-Shabab, which is allied with al-Qaeda. The episode was described in the Independent, a British newspaper, which identified Emwazi as Muhammad ibn Muazzam.

Emwazi and his friends were allowed to return to Britain, where he met with Qureshi in the autumn of 2009 to discuss what had happened. ""Mohammed was quite incensed by his treatment, that he had been very unfairly treated,"" Qureshi said. Shortly afterward, Emwazi decided to move to his birthplace, Kuwait, where he landed a job working for a computer company, according to the emails he wrote to Qureshi. He came back to London twice, the second time to finalise his wedding plans to a woman in Kuwait. In June 2010, however, counterterrorism officials in Britain detained him again — this time fingerprinting him and searching his belongings. When he tried to fly back to Kuwait the next day, he was prevented from doing so. ""I had a job waiting for me and marriage to get started,"" he wrote in a June 2010 email to Qureshi. But now ""I feel like a prisoner, only not in a cage, in London. A person imprisoned & controlled by security service men, stopping me from living my new life in my birthplace & country, Kuwait."" Nearly four months later, when a court in New York sentenced Aafia Siddiqui, an al-Qaeda operative convicted for the attempted murder of US personnel in Afghanistan, Emwazi expressed sympathy for her, saying he had ""heard the upsetting news regarding our sister. . . . This should only keep us firmer towards fighting for freedom and justice!!!""

In the interview, Qureshi said he last heard from Emwazi in January 2012, when Emwazi sent him an email seeking advice. ""This is a young man who was ready to exhaust every single kind of avenue within the machinery of the state to bring a change for his personal situation,"" Qureshi said. In the end, he felt ""actions were taken to criminalise him and he had no way to do something against these actions."" Close friends of Emwazi's also said his situation in London had made him desperate to leave the country. It's unclear exactly when he reached Syria or how. One friend said he believed Emwazi wanted to travel to Saudi Arabia to teach English in 2012 but was unsuccessful. Soon afterward, the friend said, he was gone. ""He was upset and wanted to start a life elsewhere,"" one of the friends said. ""He at some stage reached the point where he was really just trying to find another way to get out.""

Once in Syria, Emwazi contacted his family and at least one of his friends. It's unclear what he told them about his activities there. A former hostage who was debriefed by officials upon release said that 'Jihadi John' was part of a team guarding Western captives at a prison in Idlib, Syria, in 2013. The hostages nicknamed the facility ""the box"". Emwazi was joined by two other men with British accents, including one who was dubbed ""George"". A former hostage said Emwazi participated in the waterboarding of four Western hostages. Former hostages described George as the leader of the trio. 'Jihadi John', they said, was quiet and intelligent. ""He was the most deliberate,"" a former hostage said. Beginning in early 2014, the hostages were moved to a prison in the Syrian city of Raqqa, the Islamic State's de facto capital, where they were visited often by the trio. They appeared to have taken on more powerful roles within the Islamic State. About the same time, Qureshi said, he sent an email to Emwazi.

""I was wondering if you could send me your number,"" he wrote. ""Inshallah [God willing] it will be good to catch up."" There was no response.

British Muslims on safari 'stopped by MI5'

(from The Independent on 01/05/2010)

MI5 agents illegally interrogated British Muslims who were detained while on safari holidays in Africa, it was claimed yesterday.

The new allegations mirror cases first raised by The Independent last year in which the security service was accused of harassing and intimidating north London community workers who had returned from Somalia.

Now two British men from west London who visited Tanzania for a week-long safari in May last year say they were arrested and held for “days” in inhumane detention on the orders of MI5.

Abu Talib and Muhammad ibn Muazzam, both in their mid-20s, and a German friend travelling with them, allege they were threatened with beatings by members of Tanzania's security forces. After being refused entry to Tanzania they were returned to the Netherlands, where they say they were questioned by MI5 agents who accused them of having links to Islamic extremists.

On their return to the UK the next day, the men allege they were harassed by MI5, who warned them they were now on a terror watch list which prevented them travelling to any Muslim country. Another British citizen, Abu Omar, 19, says that in April 2009 his safari holiday to Kenya was interrupted when the house in which he was staying was raided by local security officers.

Mr Omar claims he was held and questioned for four days, also on the basis of intelligence supplied by MI5. He alleges that his interrogators threw a mobile phone at him which they said had his fingerprints on and was linked to phone calls made to Osama bin Laden. Back in London Mr Omar was further questioned by MI5, who took his fingerprints and photographs.

He told the human rights group Cageprisoners: ""I was left in the airport without money, barefoot and my clothes in bin liners.""

The new cases bear striking similarities to allegations made by six youth workers from Kentish Town who allege that they too were harassed and unlawfully interrogated after holidays abroad in 2008. Cageprisoners' executive director, Asim Qureshi, said: ""The last seven years of the 'War on Terror' have seen the profiling and criminalisation of the Arab and Pakistani communities by UK authorities around the world. The policies implemented through counter-terrorism legislation and Prevent [the Government's strategy for combating extremism in the Muslim community] have been counter-productive as Muslim communities feel marginalised. Many Muslims feel besieged and the policies of Government have done nothing to temper that.""

A government spokeswoman said the Security Service ""operated within the law"" and complaints about officers' alleged behaviour should be made to the independent commissioner who has the power to investigate allegations."

The Isis executioner dubbed ‘Jihadi John’ is Mohammed Emwazi, a Londoner from a well-to family, it has been revealed.

The IS frontman is believed to have appeared in a series of shocking videos in which hostages, including British aid worker Alan Henning, are brutally murdered

The 27-year-old was named this morning by the Washington Post and it is understood he is known to British security services.

The paper described him as being from a well-to-do family in West London, graduating from college with a degree in computer programming.

His friend added that he was radicalised after a planned trip to Tanzania following his graduation.

British radicalisation experts said they believed the identity to be ‘accurate and correct’.

A statement from the International Centre for the Study of Radicalisation (ICSR) at King’s College London said: ‘We believe the identity and name published by the Washington Post and now in the public realm to be accurate and correct.’

Dressed all in black with a balaclava covering all but his eyes and the ridge of his nose and a holster under his left arm, ‘Jihadi John’ reappeared in videos of the beheadings of US journalist Steven Sotloff, British aid workers David Haines and Alan Henning, and American aid worker Peter Kassig.

And last month, the militant appeared in a video with the Japanese hostages Haruna Yukawa and Kenji Goto, shortly before they were killed.

A detailed Washington Post article claims Jihadi John is in fact Kuwaiti-born Emwazi, who it says travelled to Syria around 2012 before later joining IS, which has taken control of large swathes of the conflict-torn country, as well as territory in neighbouring Iraq.

The article claims Emwazi started to radicalise after a planned safari in Tanzania following his graduation from the University of Westminster was brought to an abrupt end when he was detained on arrival in Dar es Salaam and deported the following day.

It is claimed that he told friends he was flown to Amsterdam where an officer from MI5 accused him of trying to reach Somalia, where the militant group al-Shabab operates.

According to the article, in 2009/2010, Emwazi decided to move to Kuwait, where he told friends he had a job and marriage waiting for him – but was prevented from travelling there by UK counter-terrorism officials.

Released hostages have told officials that Jihadi John was part of a team guarding Western captives at a prison in Idlib, Syria, in 2013. He was joined by two other men with British accents, including one who was dubbed ‘George’.

The ICSR said: ‘Jihadi John is not special in the sense that all the foreign fighters have tried to hide their identity by using pseudonyms or literally by masking themselves.

‘The fact that ‘Jihadi John’ has been unveiled in this manner demonstrates that whatever efforts are made, the ability to mask one’s identity is limited or in fact impossible, and their true identities will eventually be revealed.

‘This demonstrates what we have long said about radicalisation, that it is not something driven by poverty or social deprivation. Ideology clearly plays a big role in motivating some men to participate in jihadist causes.

‘British fighters have clearly demonstrated that they are not in this conflict to take a back seat. They are full participants in this war, operating as suicide bombers, hostage takers, and executioners.’

Scotland Yard has refused to confirm the reports.

Commander Richard Walton, head of the Met’s counter terrorism command, said: ‘We have previously asked media outlets not to speculate about the details of our investigation on the basis that life is at risk.

‘We are not going to confirm the identity of anyone at this stage or give an update on the progress of this live counter-terrorism investigation.’

Downing Street declined to confirm or deny that the reported name was known to the intelligence and security services.

Emwazi is thought to have killed American journalist James Foley in a video released last August.

The Islamic State militant known as Jihadi John has been named today as Mohammed Emwazi.

The Washington Post and the BBC both named Emwazi as the Londoner seen in a series of horrific beheading videos.

They report that he was known to the security services but they had chosen not to disclose his name for 'operational reasons'.

The Washington Post said Emwazi, a former Westminster University student from west London, was believed to have travelled to Syria around 2012 and to have later joined IS.

Scotland Yard today refused to confirm the reports.

Commander Richard Walton, head of the Met's Counter Terrorism Command, said: ""We have previously asked media outlets not to speculate about the details of our investigation on the basis that life is at risk.

""We are not going to confirm the identity of anyone at this stage or give an update on the progress of this live counter-terrorism investigation.""

Jihadi John has appeared in a number of shocking videos where he is thought to have beheaded a number of western hostages.

Among those were British aid workers David Haines and Alan Henning.

Emwazi, who was given the nickname Jihadi John after freed hostages revealed he and other British ISIS members were 'jokingly' likened to the Beatles, first appeared in a video last August, when he appeared to kill the American journalist James Foley.

It is understood that he was known to British security services who chose not to disclose his name earlier for operational reasons. A US intelligence official confirmed the name to CBS news earlier today. Two US government sources also said that Emwazi was believed to be Jihadi John. A statement from the International Centre for the Study of Radicalisation (ICSR) at King's College London also said: ""We believe the identity and name published by the Washington Post and now in the public realm to be accurate and correct."" A close friend of Emwazi told the Washington Post: “I have no doubt that Mohammed is Jihadi John. ""He was like a brother to me. . . . I am sure it is him."" Downing Street declined to confirm or deny that the reported name was known to the intelligence and security services.

""There is an ongoing investigation. It is absolutely right that we allow the police and security agencies to do all they can to bring those responsible to justice and to help keep British people safe."" Kuwaiti-born Emwazi, who is now in his twenties, is believed to have been raised in a middle-class area of west London, at times attending a mosque in Greenwich. Neighbours from the area where Emwazi is believed to have lived in London gave mixed comments on his family. One described them as ""nice and normal"", while another said: “They are strange people - not like other people around here. He would not say hello he was unfriendly.” He is understood to have graduated with a degree in computer science from the University of Westminster, after which he started to become radicalised.

IG Jihadi John has been identified as a man in his 20s from West London

The Post claims Emwazi started to radicalise after a planned safari in Tanzania following his graduation from the University of Westminster was brought to an abrupt end when he was detained on arrival in Dar es Salaam and deported the following day. It is claimed that Emwazi told friends he was flown to Amsterdam where an officer from MI5 accused him of trying to reach Somalia, where the militant group al-Shabab operates. Several other incidents involving him being prevented from travelling to the country. In 2012 Emwazi passed a SELTA, a qualification for teaching English, and applied to teach at a centre in Saudi Arabia. By 2013 had changed his name to Mohammed al-Ayan and attempted to travel to Kuwait one last time but was prevented and questioned. Three days later he left his parents' home to travel abroad and a further three days later they reported him as a missing person. Four months later, police visited the family to explain they had information he had entered Syria. It is then then he is thought to have joined IS (also known as Isis or Isil).

A spokesperson for the University of Westminster said: ""A Mohammed Emwazi left the University six years ago. If these allegations are true, we are shocked and sickened by the news. Our thoughts are with the victims and their families. ""We have students from 150 countries and their safety is of paramount concern. With other universities in London, we are working to implement the Government’s Prevent strategy to tackle extremism. ""We are setting up a dedicated pastoral team to provide advice and support. In the meantime, we urge any students who are concerned to contact the Student Support and Well-being team."" According to the BBC's Dominic Casciani, Emwazi was a ""person of interest"" to British security services from at least 2011. He apparently featured in ""semi-secret court cases relating to extremism overseas and back in the UK"". Casciani went on to tweet a copy of a court document which suggested that Emwazi was part of a terrorist group linked to Somalia. Independent advocacy organisation CAGE said that they were in contact with Emwazi for two years after he saw his request for a visa refused by Kuwait. He told them: ""I feel like a prisoner, only not in a cage, in London. ""A person imprisoned and controlled by security service men, stopping me from living my new life in my birthplace and my country, Kuwait.""

He added: ""I have been trying to find out the reason for my refused Visa issue from my home country Kuwait, and a way to solve the issue. ""So through my friends in Kuwait, it has been said to me that Kuwait has no problem with me entering, and the reason for my refusal is simply because the UK agents have told them to not let me in."" Several other incidents involving him being prevented from travelling to the country. In 2012 Emwazi passed a SELTA, a qualification for teaching English, and applied to teach at a centre in Saudi Arabia. By 2013 had changed his name to Mohammed al-Ayan and attempted to travel to Kuwait one last time but was prevented and questioned. Three days later he left his parents' home to travel abroad and a further three days later they reported him as a missing person. Four months later, police visited the family to explain they had information he has entered Syria. Jihadi John is thought to have been responsible for the brutal killings of US journalists James Foley and Steven Sotloff, American aid worker Peter Kassig, British aid workers Alan Henning and David Haines and Japanese hostages Kenji Goto and Haruna Yukawa. Each killing was publicised in a series of highly-produced video clips. The masked militant appeared to speak with a British accent, prompting speculation about his identity. The killer gained his moniker after being nicknamed 'John' by a group of his hostages.

He was apparently part of a terrorist cell described as 'the Beatles', with other members known as 'George', 'Paul' and 'Ringo'. The family of Steven Sotloff said in a statement: ""The Sotloff family look forward to the day they can see Mohammed Emwazi sitting in an American courtroom. ""We want to watch him sentenced and see him sent to a supermax prison to spend the rest of his days in isolation. ""That’s American justice, that’s how we deal with things in this country."" Commander Richard Walton of the Met’s Counter Terrorism Command (SO15) said: ""We have previously asked media outlets not to speculate about the details of our investigation on the basis that life is at risk. ""We are not going to confirm the identity of anyone at this stage or give an update on the progress of this live counter-terrorism investigation."" A spokeswoman for the British Embassy in Washington said: ""(The) Prime Minister has been clear that we want all those who have committed murder on behalf of ISIL (Islamic State) to face justice for the appalling acts carried out. ""There is an ongoing police investigation into the murder of hostages by ISIL in Syria. ""It is not appropriate for the Government to comment on any part of it while this continues.”"	Jihadi John UNMASKED: Islamic State killer NAMED as west London graduate Mohammed Emwazi	2015-02-26 11:00:00+00:00	['Sarah Ann Harris']	['islamic', 'jihadi', 'british', 'killer', 'west', 'later', 'kuwait', 'emwazi', 'security', 'known', 'unmasked', 'london', 'state', 'john', 'named', 'mohammed']	"IG•GETTY Jihadi John, now named as Mohammed Emwazi and his ex residence in West LondonIt is understood that he was known to British security services who chose not to disclose his name earlier for operational reasons.

Telegraph The British Islamic State militant known as ""Jihadi John"" believed to be responsible for multiple executions of Western hostages has been identified as 26-year-old Mohammed Emwazi by a report in The Washington Post.

Born in Kuwait, Emwazi comes from a ""well-to-do family"" in West London and studied computer science at the University of Westminster.

The Post talked to multiple friends of Emwazi's who identified him as the jihadist militant responsible for the graphic beheadings of James Foley, Steven Sotloff, and others. Wearing a mask to obscure his identity, the executioner became known by his distinctive British accent, and he was dubbed ""Jihadi John"" by the media.

Emwazi became radicalised after graduating from University, and he was known to authorities. He had been stopped and quizzed twice by security services, once in Tanzania and again in Britain. This first detention frustrated Emwazi, according to one friend, who said, ""Mohammed was quite incensed by his treatment, that he had been very unfairly treated."" An MI5 agent reportedly subsequently tried to ""recruit"" Emwazi.

He then moved to Kuwait, and was detained again when returning to Britain to finalise a marriage, and could not subsequently leave. Emwazi wrote to the friend saying that he felt ""like a prisoner, only not in a cage, in London."" In 2010, he filed a complaint with the Independent Police Complaints Commission, according to the Guardian.

Emwazi is believed to have travelled to Syria in 2012, where he became responsible for guarding prisoners for Islamic State, the militant Jihadist group also known as ISIS or ISIL that now controls large swathes of the country and Iraq. The BBC reports that British security services have previously chosen not to disclose Emwazi's name for ""operational reasons.""

The Guardian reports that Emwazi ""had a penchant for wearing stylish clothes but remained an observant Muslim.""

Asim Querishi, a spokesperson for advocacy group CAGE, held a press conference about Emwazi. He says that he knew him since 2009, and he is a ""beautiful young man,"" and that while Emwazi's family were aware that he travelled to Syria, they do not believe he is ""Jihadi John.""

The US government are refusing to publicly confirm or deny the Washington Post's claim, the Telegraph reports, but a ""former senior intelligence official"" has since ""confirmed"" to ABC News that Emwazi is indeed ""Jihadi John.""

Unmasked: ISIS executioner 'Jihadi John' has been identified as Mohammed Emwazi from west London

The widow of a British hostage who was beheaded by Jihadi John says she wants the terrorist to be caught alive so he can be 'put to justice'.

The Islamic State executioner was today named as Mohammed Emwazi, a university graduate from London who was able to flee to Syria despite being on an MI5 terror watch list.

Emwazi, of Queen's Park, west London, was allegedly spoken to three times in one year by police and security services in Tanzania, the Netherlands and Britain.

The 26-year-old, who studied computer programming at the University of Westminster, is said to have travelled to the Middle East three years ago and later joined ISIS.

Dragana Haines, whose husband David Haines was murdered by the knifeman, has now said the 'last thing' she wants is for the depraved killer to be given an 'honourable death'.

Scottish aid worker Mr Haines, 44, was brutally executed by Emwazi in September after being seized in Syria in 2013.

Mrs Haines told the BBC: 'I hope he will be caught alive.

'That's the only moral satisfaction for the families of all the people that he murdered, because if he gets killed in the action, to put it that way, it will be an honourable death for him and that is the last thing I would actually want for someone like him.

'I think he needs to be put to justice, but not in that way.'

Earlier, Mr Haines's daughter Bethany had said the family would rest until there was a bullet between the killer's eyes.



She welcomed the fact Emwazi's name had now been made public and said: 'It's a good step but I think all the families will feel closure and relief once there's a bullet between his eyes.'

The 17-year-old told ITV News she did not blame the security services for not preventing her father's murder and added: 'If they'd known his name earlier they could've stopped him going - but they can't and once he's captured I think there will be a lot of happy faces.'

Emwazi has also featured in the execution videos British aid worker Alan Henning, as well as U.S. journalists James Foley and Steven Sotloff, Japanese reporter Kenji Goto and Syrian soldiers.

'He needs to be put to justice': Dragana Haines, whose husband David Haines was beheaded by Jihadi John, said she wants the murderer caught alive so he is not given an 'honourable death'

Victim: David Haines (left) was killed by 'Jihadi John' last September. His daughter Bethany (right) said families would only feel closure once 'there was a bullet his eyes'

Scottish aid worker Mr Haines, 44, was brutally executed by Emwazi in September after being seized in Syria in 2013

A spokesman for the family of Steven Sotloff said: 'We want to sit in a courtroom, watch him sentenced and see him sent to a super-max prison.'

His identity was confirmed yesterday by two U.S. government sources. Whitehall sources meanwhile told MailOnline that Emwazi had been known to security services for at least weeks, probably months, but had not made public his identity because the priority was trying to find him.

Arabic speaker Emwazi has one brother and two sisters, and first moved to Britain aged six.

The son of a minicab driver, he was reported to have occasionally prayed at a mosque in Greenwich, south-east London.

A source who claims to have met with Emwazi in Syria told Channel 4 news that they believed Emwazi initially joined the Migrants Brigade or Mujahideen in 2012.

Emwazi was believed to have been based in Syria's Idlib Province and then outside Aleppo, before going on to join Al-Nusra and finally ISIS.

The source described him as personable, sometimes light-hearted but also determined that jihadi fighters were seen in the media as people to be afraid of.

They also described Emwazi as a keen video games player, and a martial arts practitioner.

Ominously, they also described an occasion when Emwazi - as one of the best Arabic speakers in the brigade of foreign fighters - led the interrogation of a man who was questioned before being badly beaten.

Home: Minicab driver's son Emwazi - who has three siblings - most recently lived at a flat in Queen's Park

On the scene: Police officers near the property where Emwazi once lived in Queen's Park, west London

After graduating from university in May 2009, Emwazi flew to Tanzania with friends apparently on a safari - but was arrested by police upon landing in Dar es Salaam and sent back to Britain.

En route he stopped in Amsterdam, where he claimed to have been accused by an MI5 officer of trying to reach Somalia, home of the militant group Al Shabaab.

Emwazi claimed to have been harassed and intimidated by security services - and even complained to the Independent Police Complaints Commission.

He alleged an agent from MI5 knew 'everything about me; where I lived, what I did, and the people I hanged around with' and claimed the organisation attempted to 'turn' him to work for them.

Last night, a neighbour of the family on the estate where they lived said he recalled an incident where Emwazi watched on as his younger brother was attacked by a gang.

Unemployed James Beker, 46, said: 'I remember once the younger brother was being beaten up badly outside the flat by a gang of boys and the older brother just watched.

'I came down stairs and said to the older one, ""Why did you let your brother get beaten?"" and he said ""I'm not bothered"". The whole thing was strange, why would you let your brother get beaten?

'The younger brother, who got beaten, was about 16 or 17. The older one was between 22 and 27.

'The incident happened around two years ago I think. It's the only incident I remember, I don't ever really remember seeing the family other than that.'

As it was claimed Emwazi had spoken to police and security services three times in a year, it emerged that senior members of the security services could be called to give evidence to the Intelligence and Security Committee about contact between him and MI5.

Sir Menzies Campbell, the former Lib Dem leader who sits on the ISC, said there were 'echoes' of the case involving Michael Adebolajo, who was on the radar of security services before he went on to brutally murder Fusilier Lee Rigby with Michael Adebowale.

He told BBC Radio 4: 'One of the difficulties here is you can't keep an eye on everyone all the time and, as the committee found in the case of Lee Rigby, there's no doubt that from time to time the security services have got to prioritise those upon whom they're conducting surveillance.'

In attendance: It was claimed Emwazi had spoken to police and security services three times in a year. Officers are pictured outside his former home in Queen's Park today

The family of another victim, American journalist Steven Sotloff, said they were 'relieved' that Emwazi had been named and now wanted to see him captured and brought to justice.

Video released by the militants last September apparently showed the murder of Mr Sotloff, a 31-year-old freelance reporter for American magazines.

Victim: American journalist Steven Sotloff was also killed by 'Jihadi John'. Tonight, his family said they were 'relieved' his identity had been revealed

A spokesman for Mr Sotloff's family told the BBC: 'We want to sit in a courtroom, watch him sentenced and see him sent to a super-max prison.'

Mr Sotloff was last seen in Syria in August 2013, when it is believed he was abducted close to the border with Turkey near the city of Aleppo.

Meanwhile, Cabinet minister and former foreign secretary William Hague insisted a lack of funding was not to blame for the failure of spies to catch Emwazi.

And it was claimed Emwazi's former university was a 'hotbed of radicalism' where students 'celebrated 9/11'.

A picture began to emerge today of Emwazi's background, including the details that:

He was the son of a mini-cab driver and moved to Britain aged six, having been born in Kuwait

He has three brothers and sisters and they all lived in a council flat in west London

He is thought to have attended Quintin Kynaston Academy in St John's Wood, north London, which was also attended by the singer Tulisa

MI5 apparently persistently tried to recruit him after he graduated from university

He claims counter-terrorism police arrested him in 2010 and put him on a terror watch list

This was to stop him leaving Britain but he still managed to flee the country for Syria in 2012

Reporting: Journalists work today outside the home where Emwazi, a Kuwaiti-born British man, once lived

Horrifying: Jihadi John has featured in the execution videos of American journalists James Foley and Steven Sotloff, aid worker David Haines, 22 Syrian soldiers and Japanese journalist Kenji Goto (pictured)

Emwazi complained of harassment at the hands of MI5 agents for more than a year, similar to Michael Adebolajo, one of the two killers of Fusilier Lee Rigby in south-east London in 2013.

KUWAIT, BRITAIN AND TANZANIA: TRAVELS AND TIMELINE OF EMWAZI 1988: Born in Kuwait c1994: Moved to Britain aged six, where he grew up in Queen's Park, west London, and is said to have later attended Quintin Kynaston Academy in St John's Wood, north London 2009: Graduated from University of Westminster in computer programming May 2009: Flies to Tanzania for 'planned safari' but is detained by police in Dar es Salaam. Eventually deported but he is allegedly accused by MI5 of trying to reach Somalia, en route to Amsterdam Autumn 2009: Returns to Britain but soon moves back to Kuwait and finds work at a computer firm June 2010: Counter-terrorism police detain him upon his return to London to finalise his wedding plans, and he is not allowed to return 2012: Emwazi heads for Syria and joins ISIS

The Washington Post reported Emwazi - who has also been known as Muhammad ibn Muazzam - then moved to his native Kuwait and worked in IT, but he was detained by counter-terrorism police in June 2010 upon a return trip to London.

They allegedly fingerprinted him and searched his belongings, and he was not allowed to fly back to Kuwait. Emwazi was put on a terror watch list and banned from leaving the UK.

The FBI said last September that authorities had been trying to identify Jihadi John using various investigative techniques including voice analysis and interviews with former hostages.

Scotland Yard would not confirm the name, and Downing Street declined to comment on the report. Police attended Emwazi's home in Queen's Park earlier today.

One neighbour, who did not wish to be named, described the family as 'strange people - not like other people around here'.

Another told the London Evening Standard: 'They do not mix with us or socialise, or talk to us. Ever since they moved in a while ago they do not say anything to us.'

Not him: Abdel-Majed Abdel Bary - a London rapper initially identified as a suspect - was ruled out

And another local told the Daily Telegraph: 'It's a big shock, for me at least I'm a neighbour in this estate, it's a big shock for us.'

A spokesman for the International Centre for the Study of Radicalisation at King's College London said: 'We believe that the identity and name published by the Washington Post and now in the public realm to be accurate and correct.

LACK OF FUNDING 'NOT TO BLAME FOR FAILURE TO CATCH EMWAZI' Cabinet minister William Hague today insisted a lack of funding was not to blame for the failure of spies to catch Emwazi. He said the security services have had the biggest increase in funding of any government department, and had the resources needed to catch terrorists at home and abroad. The former foreign secretary refused to speculate on the naming of Emwazi, but admitted: 'We are always learning lessons.' Speaking at a press gallery lunch in Parliament, Mr Hague said that the government has 'kept giving' increases in money to MI5 and MI6. 'Pretty much the best spending settlement of all the departments and agencies was for the security agencies in the last spending round. Certainly we have provided resources to the agencies.' He revealed he had watched some of the videos in which British hostages had been murdered by ISIS fanatics. 'Some of the most difficult decisions for foreign secretaries and prime ministers are about hostage rescue and about how to do deal with these hostage situations. 'We spend an enormous amount of time on these things, sometimes they are successful and sometimes tragically unsuccessful.' He warned that the security services will need to 'keep updating their capabilities', backing Home Secretary Theresa May's call for spooks to be able to access and record details of contacts made between terrorists online. 'Technology is changing all the time. We will need to update legislation so that we can keep this safe, that's been hard to do in a coalition and in the current environment but it will need doing in the next few years.'

'Jihadi John is not special, in the sense that all the foreign fighters have tried to hide their identity by using pseudonyms or literally by masking themselves.

'The fact that Jihadi John has been unveiled in this manner demonstrates that whatever efforts are made, the ability to mask one's identity is limited or in fact impossible, and their true identities will eventually be revealed.'

And a University of Westminster spokesman said: 'A Mohammed Emwazi left the university six years ago. If these allegations are true, we are shocked and sickened by the news. Our thoughts are with the victims and their families.

'We have students from 150 countries and their safety is of paramount concern. With other universities in London, we are working to implement the Government's Prevent strategy to tackle extremism.'

In September, it was revealed Jihadi John was known to MI5 before he travelled to Syria to join ISIS. It emerged security officials had identified him but his name and background were being kept secret to avoid jeopardising any hostage rescue missions.

Police and security agents said they also wanted to gather more information before raiding the homes of the fanatic's family and friends.

Abdel-Majed Abdel Bary – a London rapper initially identified as a suspect – was ruled out after analysis of his voice as well as his height and mannerisms.

The 23-year-old came to prominence last year after he posted a photograph of himself on Twitter holding up a severed head.

Other Britons from Portsmouth, Birmingham and Cardiff have been linked to John, who is said to have overseen the torture of hostages and to have led negotiations for French and Italian captives freed in return for ransoms.

It is claimed he was making street collections for genuine Arab charities based in London at the time he came to MI5's attention.

David Cameron has repeatedly called for the infamous terrorist to be punished for his crimes.

, the Prime Minister revealed how he personally watched videos of the brutal beheadings of British hostages carried out by Jihadi John.

'These videos are absolutely horrific and depraved,' the Prime Minister said. 'And obviously I take the time to see what they are doing so I understand what families have been going through.'

Speaking in November, Mr Cameron said: 'You should be in no doubt that I want Jihadi John to face justice for the appalling acts that have been carried out in Syria.'

The Jihadi John apologists: Outrage as lobby group describes ISIS executioner as a 'beautiful, extremely kind and gentle young man' - then blames BRITAIN for radicalising him

The group who helped name Mohammed Emwazi as ISIS executioner Jihadi John caused outrage today after blaming MI5 for pushing him towards his killing spree in Syria.

Asim Qureshi, research director at the rights group CAGE, described the world's most wanted man as 'extremely kind, extremely gentle and the most humble young person that I ever knew'.

At a press conference today Mr Qureshi was close to tears as he said Emwazi, who is linked to a string of executions of ISIS prisoners, 'was such a beautiful man'.

Defence: Asim Qureshi, research director at the rights group CAGE, described Mohammed Emwazi, who is believed to be Jihadi John, as 'extremely kind' and blamed MI5 for his radicalisation

Mr Qureshi said he was radicalised after the security services harassed him and alienated him because 'the man I knew would never hurt a single person.'

He said: 'When are we going to finally learn that when we treat people as if they're outsiders, they are going to feel like outsiders and they will look for belonging elsewhere.'

Mr Qureshi was asked if he had failed to report him to the authorities if had suspicions that Emwazi was Jihadi John, but he said he had no idea until approached by journalists.

The assertion that MI5 'alienated' Emwazi caused fury online, accusing CAGE of being apologists for 'barbarism'.

Bev Hateley ‏said she was 'enraged and disgusted' by 'excuses' that 'Jihadi John was radicalised by MI5 harassment'.

Anthony Shaw wrote: 'So it's all the fault of MI5 that 'Jihadi John' takes great delight in cutting innocents' heads off.

Dean from Liverpool tweeted: 'How can MI5 in ANY way, even if they did harass him, create a man who cuts people heads off their shoulders'.

Another said: 'You don't go from innocent to executioner because your being harassed. Maybe MI5 had reason to suspect, and he's proved them right'.

Speaking at a press conference today, Mr Qureshi spoke of similarities between the case of Emwazi and that of Michael Adebolajo, who murdered soldier Lee Rigby in Woolwich in 2013.

He said: 'He (Emwazi) was such a beautiful young man, really. It's hard to imagine the trajectory, but it is not a trajectory that's unfamiliar with us.

'We've seen Michael Adebolajo, once again somebody that I have met. He came to me for help, looking to change his situation.

He said the country's national security policy has 'only increased alienation' since the 9/11 terrorist attacks.

Mr Qureshi said: 'A narrative of injustice has taken root. A narrative of impunity that there is no accountability for the way in which our security agencies operate. Unless we arrest that narrative, we are just going to see these things happening over and over again.

'People will feel like they are pushed out, and that they don't have a place to belong. And when somebody is giving them a message 'Come, we will give you a sense of belonging', how can argue against that?'

How did he slip through the net? Police and security services spoke to Jihadi John three times in one year and put him on a terror watch list before he fled to join ISIS

MI5 repeatedly tried to recruit Mohammed Emwazi as an informant and put him on a terror watchlist to stop him leaving Britain but he still managed to flee the country for Syria, it was claimed today.

Emwazi is believed to have become known to the security services in 2009 when he was accused of trying to fight with Somali terror group Al-Shabaab in east Africa.

The British citizen, who was born in Kuwait and moved to the UK aged six, flew to Tanzania with two friends after he graduated from the University of Westminster claiming he was going on safari.

But he was arrested as soon as he touched down in capital Dar es Salaam and deported by Tanzanian's officials.

He flew back to Britain via Amsterdam and told a friend MI5 were waiting for him at Schiphol Airport and tried to recruit him to share information on extremists, Emwazi told a confidant.

Asim Qureshi, research director at the rights group Cage told the Washington Post: 'Mohammed was quite incensed by his treatment, that he had been very unfairly treated'.

Emwazi claimed in emails that he was repeatedly approached by the security services over the course of the following year but he said he refused to co-operate and denied he had any links to terrorism.

Hostages who have survived being held by ISIS in Syria and Iraq have said that Jihadi John is a man 'obsessed' with Somalia and would make them watch Al-Shabaab videos while in captivity.

In June 2010 counter-terrorism officers, linked to the security services and Scotland Yard, allegedly arrested him as he tried to fly to Kuwait. He was fingerprinted and searched, it was said, and put on a terror watchlist preventing him from leaving Britain.

In an email to Mr Qureshi he said: 'I feel like a prisoner, only not in a cage, in London. A person imprisoned & controlled by security service men, stopping me from living my new life in my birthplace & country, Kuwait'.

Another friend said: 'He was upset and wanted to start a life elsewhere. He at some stage reached the point where he was really just trying to find another way to get out.'

Another friend said that Emwazi later tried to travel to Saudi Arabia to teach English in 2012 but again stopped from leaving.

He was 'desperate' to leave Britain and 'was ready to exhaust every single kind of avenue within the machinery of the state to bring a change for his personal situation', Mr Qureshi said.

Mr Qureshi said he last heard from him that year and said the Jihadi John supect believed 'actions were taken to criminalize him and he had no way to do something against these actions'.

Soon afterwards he vanished and is believed to have travelled to Syria, where he may now be ISIS' figurehead.

If Emwazi's account of his contact with MI5 is accurate, his case has drawn parallels with that of Lee Rigby's murderer Michael Adebolajo, who was jailed for life in 2013.

His trial heard that just three months before the appalling murder in Woolwich, MI5 was trying to recruit Michael Adebolajo as an informant.

He had been on their radar for ten years and in 2010 was even arrested with fellow Al Qaeda followers in Kenya.

Adebolajo complained of being 'harassed' by MI5 agents before the killing and it later it emerged that they had failed to watch him carefully enough before he murdered Drummer Rigby with the help of his friend Michael Adebowale.

West London radical at centre of network that influenced 'Jihadi John' passed freely between UK and African terror hot spots for THREE YEARS

The man at the centre of a network that influenced the ISIS executioner identified as 'Jihadi John' was allowed to fly in and out of London to terrorism hot spots unchecked for almost three years.

Bilal al-Berjawi passed through UK Border Control at least five times between 2006 and 2009 as he travelled between London and African terror cells.

Over that period he was rising to prominence as a senior member of Al Shabaab, the Al Qaeda-linked group in Somalia - returning to the UK only to raise funds and to marry.

Bilal al-Berjawi (right) travelled freely between the UK and terror hubs in East Africa as he rose to prominence with al-Qaeda. He is believed to have radicalised Jihadi John (left) on his return visits to London

It is believed that it was during these return visits to London that Al Berjawi became the driving force behind the radicalisation of 26-year-old Mohammed Emwazi, using his growing stature within the terror group to radicalise homegrown extremists.

According to people who have moved in jihadi circles in west London, Emwazi began to be noticed 'five or six years ago', when al-Berjawi was still flying between the UK and Africa.

'That's when he emerged, so to speak,' said one.

Bilal al-Berjawi (above) was killed in Somalia in 2012

Bilal al-Berjawi was killed by a drone strike in Somalia three years ago. By that point he was a key figure in al-Qaeda's East African operations.

Originally from Lebanon, Berjawi first joined militants in Somalia in 2006 and then returned to Britain in 2007 on a fundraising venture.

He left again in February 2009 with his friend Mohammed Sakr, who is of Egyptian origin, to travel to Kenya, telling their families they were going on a safari - the same front used by Emwazi when he flew to Tanzania in 2009.

They aroused the suspicions of the manager of the hotel at which they were staying in Mombasa and when they moved to Nairobi, police raided the premises and they were deported.

A laptop found at the premises contained extremist material including encouragement of jihad and instructions on making car bombs.

Berjawi married a Somali woman in London, and in October 2009, they decided to slip out of the country again, without telling their families that they were leaving.

All three were the subject of a manhunt, accused of crossing into Uganda to plot terrorist attacks that culminated in bomb attacks in Kampala in July 2011 that killed 74 people.

Berjawi was said to be a senior figure with Al Qaeda in East Africa, a radical part of the Al Shabaab movement, and was known as one of its most active fighters.

He was also responsible for securing weapons and for overseeing the contingent of foreign fighters.

In an online obituary published in 2013, Al Shabaab said 'Abu Hafs' had been trained by two top military commanders of al-Qaeda in East Africa, Fazul Abdullah Mohammed and Saleh Ali Saleh Nabhan.

The government stripped both men of their British passports and they were killed in separate drone attacks in 2012.

Jihadi John's old university was a 'hotbed of radicalism where students celebrated 9/11', claims ex-pupil - and extremist was even due to speak there TONIGHT

Extremist: Haitham al-Haddad's speech has been posponed

Jihadi John's former university was a 'hotbed of radicalism' where students 'celebrated 9/11', it has been claimed.

A former student two years older than the Islamic State executioner has lifted the lid on his time at the university - as it's also revealed a talk by a Muslim extremist has been postponed due to 'security concerns'.

Haitham al-Haddad was set to speak tonight, but the event will not go ahead as planned after it was revealed 'Jihadi John' studied computer programming at the university.

Today, the terrorist was named as a university graduate from London who was able to flee to Syria despite being on an MI5 terror watch list.

Emwazi is said to have travelled to the Middle East three years ago and later joined ISIS.

Jihadi John has featured in the execution videos of British aid workers Alan Henning and David Haines, U.S. journalists James Foley and Steven Sotloff, Japanese reporter Kenji Goto and Syrian soldiers.

Former University of Westminster pupil Raheem Kassam, who campaigns against extremism at British universities, said the conditions at the university are right for the radicalisation of someone like Emwazi.

Speaking today, he said: 'I once walked into a meeting of the Islamic Society where they were clapping and cheering the events of 9/11.

'I did not know him, he would have been two years behind me, but I am utterly unsurprised. The university was nothing less than a hotbed of radicalism when I was there.

'Universities across the country, the University of Westminster in particular, are being targeted by radical recruiters.'

A University of Westminster spokesman said: 'We take these allegations very seriously. We condemn any behaviour that promotes terrorism and violence on any of our campuses.

'We have strict policies to promote tolerance among our 20,000 student community, who come to study from over 150 nations. Any student found to be engaging in radicalised activity would be referred to disciplinary procedures.

'As a London-based university operating in a diverse multi-cultural city, we are fully aware of all the influences within this international city. With other universities in London, we are working together to implement the Government's Prevent strategy to tackle extremism.'

How Jihadi John came to Britain aged 6 from Kuwait, attended school and university and went on to become one of the world's most wanted terrorists

A lobby group has released an extensive report on its contact with Mohammed Emwazi - the man reports have named as Islamic State militant Jihadi John.

Cage, which deals with people who believe they have been mistreated at the hands of British authorities in anti-terror operations, claims it first came into contact with Emwazi in 2009 after he was contacted by MI5 on a safari holiday to Tanzania.

The group claim Emwazi's family was told he had travelled to Syria in 2013. Here is a timeline of events in Emwazi's life as reported by Cage:"	David Haines' widow speaks out as Jihadi John is unmasked as Mohammed Emwazi	2015-02-26 10:58:14+00:00	['Mark Duell', 'Martin Robinson', 'Emma Glanfield', 'Laurie Hanna', 'Steph Cockroft For Mailonline']	['widow', 'services', 'jihadi', 'haines', 'mi5', 'security', 'told', 'university', 'david', 'unmasked', 'speaks', 'emwazi', 'john', 'london', 'mohammed', 'syria']	"Widow of David Haines said terrorist must not be given 'honourableUnmasked: ISIS executioner 'Jihadi John' has been identified as Mohammed Emwazi from west LondonThe widow of a British hostage who was beheaded by Jihadi John says she wants the terrorist to be caught alive so he can be 'put to justice'.

Emwazi was known to British security services but they chose not to disclose his name earlier for operational reasons, it is claimed.

He is believed to have travelled to Syria around 2012 and to have later joined the Islamic State of Iraq and the Levant (Isil) , the group terrorising Iraq and Syria.

Jihadi John first appeared in a video last August, when he appeared to kill the American journalist James Foley.

The Isil terrorist apparently studied computer sciences at Westminister University. The Washington Post describes Emwazi as Kuwaiti-born and in his mid-20s.

He was apparently raised in a middle class neighbourhood and occasionally prayed at a mosque in Greenwich.

Emwazi lived in a three-bedroomed flat on the first floor of a contemporary block of flats on Warwick Crescent, Maida Vale, between 1996 and 1997.

The block is sandwiched between the Regents Park canal and the M40, with the maisonettes overlooking both. The flats currently sell for up to £800,000.

Neighbours did not remember the family.

Friends told the Post that Emwazi began to radicalise after a planned safari to Tanzania after he graduated from Westminster.

The Washington Post cite two friends of Mohammed Emwazi as sources who have identified him as Jihadi John. One is an unidentified close friend who says: “He was like a brother to me. . . . I am sure it is him.”

The other is Asim Qureshi, a researcher at Cage, an organisation which campaigns for the rights of Muslim prisoners. Mr Qureshi said he was in contact with Emwazi after he was arrested in Tanzania while claiming to be going on a safari holiday.

He was released and flew to Amsterdam, where he was detained again and accused by MI5 interrogators of having intended to go to Somalia to join al-Shabaab, the militant jihadist group fighting there.

• Who is Jihadi John?

• Does Jihadi John have a body double

Cage has released a statement blaming the British security agency, MI5, for his radicalism.

""Mohammed Emwazi is a British citizen who was subjected to security agency harassment for at least four years.

""He was repeatedly detained at airports, deported, barred from entering countries and even allegedly assaulted by officers. This treatment prevented him from leading a normal life while having no means to obtain redress, even though no evidence was ever presented to suggest he committed any wrongdoing.""

At a press conference in London, Mr Qureshi said he has known Emwazi since summer 2009 and that the terrorist nicknamed Jihadi John, who is wanted for beheading several British and American hostages, was ""extremely kind, extremely gentle...most humble young person I ever knew.

""I wish things could have turned out differently for him.""

Scotland Yard has refused to confirm the reports. Commander Richard Walton, head of the Met's Counter Terrorism Command, said: ""We have previously asked media outlets not to speculate about the details of our investigation on the basis that life is at risk.

""We are not going to confirm the identity of anyone at this stage or give an update on the progress of this live counter-terrorism investigation.""

The man known as Jihadi John rose to notoriety when he first appeared in a video posted online in August, in which he appeared to kill the American journalist James Foley.

Dressed in all black with a balaclava covering all but his eyes and the ridge of his nose and a holster under his left arm, he reappeared in videos of the beheadings of US journalist Steven Sotloff, British aid worker David Haines and American aid worker Peter Kassig, as well as footage of Mr Henning's death.

And last month, the militant appeared in a video with the Japanese hostages Haruna Yukawa and Kenji Goto, shortly before they were killed.

A detailed Washington Post article claims he travelled to Syria around 2012 before later joining Isil, which has taken control of large swathes of the conflict-torn country, as well as territory in neighbouring Iraq.

The article claims Emwazi started to radicalise after a planned safari in Tanzania following his graduation from the University of Westminster was brought to an abrupt end when he was detained on arrival in Dar es Salaam and deported the following day.

A spokesman for University of Westminster confirmed a Mohammed Emwazi studied at the university. He is believed to have studied information technology at the university which said they were shocked by the reports.

“A Mohammed Emwazi left the University six years ago. If these allegations are true, we are shocked and sickened by the news. Our thoughts are with the victims and their families.

“We have students from 150 countries and their safety is of paramount concern. With other universities in London, we are working to implement the Government’s Prevent strategy to tackle extremism.

“We are setting up a dedicated pastoral team to provide advice and support. In the meantime, we urge any students who are concerned to contact the Student Support and Well-being team.”

It is claimed that Emwazi told friends he was flown to Amsterdam where an officer from MI5 accused him of trying to reach Somalia, where the militant group al-Shabaab operates.

The BBC tweeted a court document from a case involving another suspected militant and the Home Secretary, Theresa May, in which Emwazi is named as an associate.

Its home affairs correspondent, Dominic Casciani, says that another ""core member"" of this same group of West London jihadis, Bilal Berjawi, was subsequently killed in a drone strike in Somalia.

Jihadi John: Here's one of the court documents that includes Emwazi, the man known to be the ISIS militant: pic.twitter.com/U2h8WqbcCC — Dominic Casciani (@BBCDomC) February 26, 2015

Downing Street declined to confirm or deny that the reported name was known to the intelligence and security services.

Asked if David Cameron was concerned about Emwazi's name being reported, a No 10 spokeswoman said: ""The Prime Minister would be concerned about information being put into the public domain at any time that might jeopardise ongoing police or security investigations or the safety of British citizens.

""There is an ongoing investigation. It is absolutely right that we allow the police and security agencies to do all they can to bring those responsible to justice and to help keep British people safe.""

A statement from the International Centre for the Study of Radicalisation at King's College London said: ""We believe that the identity and name published by the Washington Post and now in the public realm to be accurate and correct.

""'Jihadi John' is not special, in the sense that all the foreign fighters have tried to hide their identity by using pseudonyms or literally by masking themselves.

""The fact that 'Jihadi John' has been unveiled in this manner demonstrates that whatever efforts are made, the ability to mask one's identity is limited or in fact impossible, and their true identities will eventually be revealed.

""This demonstrates what we have long said about radicalisation, that it is not something driven by poverty or social deprivation. Ideology clearly plays a big role in motivating some men to participate in jihadist causes.

""British fighters have clearly demonstrated that they are not in this conflict to take a back seat. They are full participants in this war, operating as suicide-bombers, hostage-takers, and executioners."""

British police declined to comment, citing ongoing investigations.

In each of the videos, the militant appeared dressed in a black robe with a black balaclava covering all but his eyes and top of his nose.

Speaking with a British accent, he taunted Western powers before holding his knife to the hostages' necks, appearing to start cutting before the film stopped. The victims' decapitated bodies were then shown.

Earlier this month, the militant featured in a video in which the Japanese journalist Kenji Goto appeared to be beheaded. Hostages released by IS said he was one of three British jihadists guarding Westerners abducted by the group in Syria. They were known collectively as ""the Beatles"".

'Jihadi John' movement mapped

Emwazi ""claimed harassment""

In a news conference, Asim Qureshi, the research director of the London-based lobby group Cage, which had been in contact with Emwazi over a number of years, explained how he had been approached by the Washington Post for the story and detailed the difficulties Emwazi had had with security services in the UK and overseas.

Mr Qureshi said Emwazi, who is understood to be about 27, had been ""extremely kind, gentle and soft-spoken, the most humble young person I knew"".

He said he could ""not be 100% certain"" Jihadi John was Emwazi although there were ""striking similarities"".

Image copyright Getty Images Image caption Journalists gathered outside a home in London where Mohammed Emwazi is believed to have once lived

Emwazi's difficulties began when he travelled to Tanzania in May 2009 following his graduation in computer programming at the University of Westminster, Mr Qureshi added.

He and two friends had planned to go on a safari but once they landed in Dar es Salaam they were detained by police and held overnight.

Emwazi then ended up flying to Amsterdam, in the Netherlands, where he claimed to be met by British intelligence agents from MI5 who accused him of trying to travel to Somalia, where the jihadist group al-Shabab operates. He denied the accusation and said the agents had tried to recruit him before allowing him to return to the UK.

Analysis: Frank Gardner, BBC News

US and British counter-terrorism officials discovered the identity of ""Jihadi John"" as far back as last September. The FBI, Britain's MI5 and other intelligence agencies used a combination of voice recognition software, interviews with former hostages and on-the-ground research in London to build up a profile of the man now revealed to be Mohammed Emwazi.

They have always declined to reveal the name for ""operational reasons"". Now that it's out in the public domain, it's emerged that Emwazi was well-known to MI5 and that it even tried to recruit him as an informer, years before he went off to Syria to eventually join Islamic State.

The practice by intelligence agencies of approaching jihadist sympathisers to work for them is likely to continue. It's believed both Britain and the US have informers inside the Islamic State ""capital"" of Raqqa. Yet this seems to have been little help in stopping the actions of Mohammed Emwazi, or bringing him to justice.

Jihadist's 'typical trajectory'

Emwazi later moved to Kuwait, where he got a job at a computer company. But on a visit to London in 2010, he was detained by British counter-terrorism officials and prevented from flying back to Kuwait, his friends said.

""I had a job waiting for me and marriage to get started,"" Emwazi wrote in a June 2010 email to Cage.

Mr Qureshi said Emwazi had made persistent efforts to try to change his situation: ""We had two-and-a-half years of communications talking about what he could do to alleviate his problems.""

He said he did not know what had happened to Emwazi, adding: ""When we treat people as if they are outsiders they will inevitably feel like outsiders - our entire national security strategy for the last 13 years has only increased alienation. A narrative of injustice has taken root.""

Emwazi was believed to have travelled to Syria around 2013 and later joined IS, which has declared the creation of a ""caliphate"" in the large swathes of Syria and neighbouring Iraq it controls.

A spokeswoman for Prime Minister David Cameron would not confirm or deny the latest reports, adding that the police and security services were working hard to find those responsible for the murder of the British hostages.

The University of Westminster confirmed Emwazi had left six years ago, adding: ""If these allegations are true, we are shocked and sickened.""

The BBC's Rajini Vaidyanathan in Washington says the FBI went on record last September to confirm it knew who Jihadi John was. However, US officials said this month they would not name him as they believed this would be the best strategy for finding him and bringing him to justice.

A spokesman for the family of Steven Sotloff said: ""We want to sit in a courtroom, watch him sentenced and see him sent to a super-max prison.""

David Haines's sister, Bethany, welcomed the identification, but told ITV News: ""I think all the families will feel closure and relief once there's a bullet between his eyes.""

Emwazi, or 'Jihadi John' as he became known, is thought to have appeared wearing black robes and a balaclava in a series of disturbing videos depicting the killing of journalists and aid workers.

The families of Emwazi's alleged victims have called for him to be brought to justice, with the daughter of a murdered aid worker saying her family will not rest until there is a bullet between the killer's eyes.

The name 'Jihadi John' came after it was reported that hostages referred to the militant as 'John' during their time captive.

On Thursday, The Washington Post published a lengthy article naming him, quoting a friend who said: “I have no doubt that Mohammed is Jihadi John.""

An international manhunt led by the FBI was launched in August 2014 when he was thought to have appeared in video footage showing the beheading of American photojournalist James Foley.

Foley's death was followed by the brutal killing of four more UK and US aid workers and journalists, all of whom were shown in footage next to a balaclava clad militant dressed in black, believed to be Jihadi John.

Following the disclosure of Emwazi's identity, the daughter of one his alleged victims, British aid worker David Haines, has said her family will not rest until there is a bullet between the killer's eyes.

Bethany Haines said that identifying the masked man was ""a good step"" towards finding justice for her father and Emwazi's other alleged victims.

""But I think all the families will feel closure and relief once there's a bullet between his eyes,"" Bethany Haines said.

The family of Steven Sotloff, an American journalist, said they hope his killer will be caught and sent to prison, and said they felt ""relieved"" after Emwazi's identity was revealed, according to the BBC.

""We want to sit in a courtroom, watch him sentenced and see him sent to a super-max prison where he will spend the rest of his life in isolation,"" the family added.

He is thought to have been featured in videos threatening the lives of Japanese hostages Haruna Yukawa and Kenji Goto, who were later killed by the extremist group.

Reports say Emwazi rose rapidly through Isis ranks and became one of a trio of British men who held European and American nationals hostage.

He was also allegedly a prominent member of training camps for new recruits in Raqqa and was widely believed to have played a major role in the jihadis’ IT security, according to The Guardian.

Emwazi is reported to have started to become radicalised following a trip to Tanzania, where he and two friends were detained by police overnight after landing in Dar es Salaam and eventually deported.

It is claimed that Emwazi told friends he was then flown to Amsterdam where an officer from MI5 accused him of trying to reach Somalia, where the militant group al-Shabaab operates.

Asim Qureshi, research director at the rights group, CAGE, says he met with Emwazi in the autumn after he returned from this trip to discuss what had taken place. “Mohammed was quite incensed by his treatment, that he had been very unfairly treated,” Mr Qureshi told The Post.

The Post reports that Emwazi then moved to Kuwait, his birthplace, for eight months. He returned to London twice during this period before being detained by counterterrorism officials in Britain, who took his fingerprints and searched his belongings.

He was allegedly prevented from returning to Kuwait, telling Mr Qureshi in an email: “I had a job waiting for me and marriage to get started, but now I feel like a prisoner, only not in a cage, in London.

""A person imprisoned and controlled by security service men, stopping me from living my new life in my birthplace and my country, Kuwait. I have been trying to find out the reason for my refused Visa issue from my home country Kuwait, and a way to solve the issue.""

Mr Qureshi was quoted as saying there was an ""extremely strong resemblance"", between the militant in the videos and Emwazi. He later claimed that he had told The Post: ""While there were some striking similarities, that due to the hood, there was no way he could be 100 per cent certain.""

Mr Qureshi last spoke to Emwazi in 2012 when he contacted him for advice. He felt “actions were taken to criminalize him and he had no way to do something against these actions"", according to Mr Qureshi.

In a statement after the news broke, Mr Qureshi attacked British security services for ""suffocating domestic policies"" and for ""systematically"" harassing young Muslims.

""This case should trigger thinking about British domestic and foreign policy,"" he said. ""What risk assessments, if any, have been made about British counter-terrorism policy and the key part it plays in radicalising individuals?""

One friend said he believed Emwazi spoke of wanting to teach English in Saudi Arabia shortly before he disappeared, but had been unsuccessful.

“He at some stage reached the point where he was really just trying to find another way to get out,"" the friend was quoted as saying.

A spokesperson for the University of Westminster confirmed Emwazi left the University six years ago. The spokesperson said that if the allegations are true, the university is ""shocked and sickened by the news"".

""Our thoughts are with the victims and their families,"" the spokesperson said. ""We have students from 150 countries and their safety is of paramount concern.""

18.14 The former head of MI6 has rejected claims the security services played a role in the radicalisation of the terrorist known as Jihadi John.

Sir John Sawers, head of MI6 from 2009 to 2014, said arguments that harassment drove Emwazi to join IS were ""very specious"".

In an interview for the Today programme on BBC Radio 4, Sir John said:

I'm not going to comment on the individuals, but in general I think those are very specious arguments.

These people draw attention to themselves because of their activity, their mixing, participation in extremist and sometimes terrorist circles, so of course they're going to draw attention to themselves and by an approach, if that's what happens, you give an opportunity to the individual to draw back from the terrorist groups that he - it's usually a he, sometimes a she - is about to mix with and you also give them a warning.

But the idea that somehow being spoken to by a member of MI5 is a radicalising act, I think this is very false and very transparent.

17.57 The activist from Cage who praised Emwazi has been previously filmed supporting jihad.

Jihadi John: Activist who praised Mohammed Emwazi as ""beautiful"" caught on video backing jihad

Robert Mendick writes:

Asim Qureshi, research director at Cage, called on Muslims to back jihadists at an anti-US rally held in London in 2006.

In an emotive speech caught on video, Mr Qureshi told a crowd gathered at rally organised by Hizb-ut Tahrir, an Islamist group: “When we see the example of our brothers and sisters fighting in Chechnya, Iraq, Palestine, Kashmir, Afghanistan, then we know where the example lies. When we see Hezbollah defeating the armies of Israel, we know where the solution is and where the victory lies.

“We know that it is incumbent upon all of us, to support the jihad of our brothers and sisters in these countries when they are facing the oppression of the West.”

17.34 Westminster University has launched an investigation in to how Emwazi's student records were leaked (see 16.38).

The image, published by Sky News, is believed to show Emwazi as a teenager staring blankly at the camera wearing a plain white t-shirt and an oversized baseball cap.

A spokeswoman from the university said:

We are investigating how this information has been obtained.

We have no further comments at the moment.

17.22 Channel 4 News have produced an interesting report about extremists' links to west London.

Portobello Rd, Queen's Park, Paddington and Kensal Green are all mentioned.

But does that mean that the area is a ""hotbed of extremism""?

16.38 Emwazi's photo has been obtained by Sky News, from Westminster University records.

16.21 The first adult photograph of Emwazi has been published.

BREAKING - Jihadi John revealed - the first picture of Mohammed Emwazi as an adult pic.twitter.com/rxdU5ycD2D — Mark White (@skymarkwhite) February 27, 2015

15.14 David Cameron spoke out earlier in defence of the intelligence and security agencies, following accusations they played a part in the radicalisation of Emwazi.

Here is what he said:

14.45 Boris Johnson, has also been speaking about possible failures in surveillance.

Her said the Government had made a mistake to replace the control orders regime, which allowed the relocation of terror suspects, with the less-restrictive Terrorism Prevention and Investigation Measures (Tpims).

He told the BBC:

I do think that was a mistake, we are now back on the right track.

The politicians who made that mistake need to think very carefully about why they did it and I think the benefit of the doubt was, I'm afraid, given too much to those who wish us serious harm.

14.21 The intelligence agencies may have made a ""slip up"" in failing to impose tighter controls on Jihadi John due to the sheer number of suspects they have to cope with, the counter-terrorism laws watchdog said.

David Anderson QC said he was not surprised that Mohammed Emwazi, who has been named as the masked militant seen in Islamic State videos, was not subject to measures such as house arrest despite being on MI5's radar because the UK's spies and counter-terrorism police were ""very busy"".

University of Westminster graduate Emwazi was known to the Security Service for some time before leaving for Syria in 2013 and beginning on the road to international notoriety.

Mr Anderson, the independent reviewer of terror legislation, said ""perhaps they did slip up in this case"" but it was ""difficult not to have sympathy"" with the agencies because of the scale of the challenge they face.

14.01 Writing in The Telegraph, Shashank Joshi argues that Mohammed Emwazi was not a fine young man driven to murder.

So if you think that Emwazi was really going on safari, I have a bridge to sell you. And some free travel advice: if you desperately want to see lions and elephants, my suggestion is that you opt for a reputable travel agency rather than a well-established jihadist network.

Cage also quotes Emwazi as complaining that “I feel like a prisoner … in London. A person imprisoned and controlled by security service men”. This is nonsense.

Although the evidence is unclear, it doesn’t seem that Britain barred Emwazi from travel at all. After all, he travelled to Turkey en route to Syria in 2013. Britain may well have passed on to Kuwaiti authorities their own suspicions about the risk posed by Emwazi. Critics will argue that it is wrong for the state to single out citizens who have not been convicted of any crime. But what if Emwazi was refusing to give a complete picture to police? Cage alleges that Emwazi “sought to find redress within the system”. Perhaps this is right. But in light of his previous story of safari-going, we have reasons to be sceptical.

12.38 The Telegraph's video team have put together an explainer about how Emwazi radicalised.

12.23 More from David Cameron, who has defended our security services.

He said they are doing an ""incredibly impressive"" job keeping the country safe.

All of the time, they are having to make incredibly difficult judgments and I think basically they make very good judgments on our behalf.

12.18 This image shows the transformation from West London schoolboy, to mass murderer.

12.03 More from David Cameron, who is at an event in Wales.

I'm not going to talk about specific individuals.

When there are people anywhere in the world who commit appalling and heinous crimes against British citizens, we will do everything we can with the police, with the security services, with all that we have at our disposal to find these people and put them out of action.

12.02 David Cameron has spoken out in defence of the intelligence and security agencies after associates of Emwazi accused them of playing a part in his radicalisation.

Mr Cameron said his ""number one priority"" was to ensure that those responsible for crimes against British citizens were hunted down and ""put out of action"".

Downing Street described as ""reprehensible"" a claim by advocacy group Cage that MI5 was partly to blame for Emwazi turning to violence, because of its alleged harassment and interrogation of the ""beautiful young man"".

11.42 Our Middle East Editor, Richard Spencer, has been looking into the Kuwaiti roots of Emwazi and his family.

Elijah Magnier, chief international correspondent for the Kuwait-based Al-Rai media group, said that Emwazi's family were ""bidoun"".

The bidoun are stateless people living in the Gulf region who were not given citizenship in any of the Gulf states that were formed with the withdrawal of the British empire. The largest number live in Kuwait - several hundred thousand - and complain of having reduced access to education and jobs.

11.06 An unnamed caller to LBC radio has just phoned in with an account of his childhood friendship with Emwazi.

He said:

I used to go with him to that primary school, on Warwick Avenue.

He was a year old than me. This was around 2003.

I remember him very well. His surname I did not remember, but I got a text picture from my sister this morning, showing him in the red sweatshirt. My sister said: ""Do you remember this guy? He's the half Kuwaiti guy who was a good friend of ours at school.""

And when I read further, with two younger sisters and a dad as a taxi driver, I remembered him very well. To be honest, his mum was a very good friend of my mum and used to sell gold in the local community.

We knew the family quite well.

Three years ago there was suspicion of Mohammed Emwazi being involved in terror. So my mum completely broke contact - we didn't want to be involved.

I want to tell you an incident when we were younger - because he used to treat me like a brother, teaching me and stuff.

Basically we were in the playground and Mohammed was running away from someone, I think he was just about to get into a fight. And as he was running another guy blocked his path. And he ran into a goal post and hit his head on a metal goal post and fell to the floor.

This was year six, we didn't see him for six weeks.

He was not the same ever since that brain injury. I am telling you one million per cent. He was not the same.

After secondary school I never had much contact with him. He was one year older than me. But my relationship with him - I told my mum, he was acting a bit weird. And my mum told me ""If he's acting a bit weird, stay away from him.""

10.45 The widow of David Haines, a British aid worker who was murdered last year, said that she wanted Emwazi to be taken alive to deny him the ""honourable death"" of being killed in action. Dragana Haines told the BBC that the unmasking of Emwazi had reopened the wounds caused by her husband's death:

It was a flashback to the very day that we found out that David has been killed. It was basically living through that day again.

I can only hope that he will be caught. Ever since I found out that David has been murdered, I have been hoping that this man will be identified and eventually caught, but it's difficult to be reminded of it all again. We just started picking up the pieces and we started trying to have as normal a life as possible

I hope he will be caught alive. I think that is the only moral satisfaction for the families of all the people he murdered. If he gets killed in action, it will be an honourable death for him, and that is the last thing I would actually want for him. I think he needs to be put to justice.

10.30 Camilla Turner is at the west London primary school attended by Mohammed Emwazi in the late 1990s this morning:

Standing at the school gate to welcome in pupils as they came in for the day, Tonnie Read, the headteacher of St Mary Magdalene Church of England primary school, said she did not wish to make any comments about Mohammed Emwazi.

The school is adjoined to St Mary Magdalene Church, just set back from Grand Union Canal and five minutes away from Little Venice in one of the smartest parts of West London.

For some of the time that Emwazi went to this primary school he lived just five minutes away with his family in a three-bedroomed flat on the first floor of a contemporary block of flats on Warwick Crescent, Maida Vale.

School friends remembered him as a reserved young boy who did not speak much English when he arrived, but was always keen to join in with football at lunch time and after school.

10.13 The family of Steven Sotloff, an American-Israeli journalist murdered by the Islamic State group, said they were relishing seeing his killer face justice after the apparent executioner was named on Thursday. Barak Barfi, the Sotloff family's spokesman, said in a statement:

The Sotloff family was informed of John's identity. This is one step on a long road to bringing him to justice.

If indeed Mohammed Emwazi is the man who executed Steve, the Sotloffs have full faith that the American intelligence community and law enforcement agencies will apprehend him.

They look forward to the day that John will be prosecuted and convicted for the crime of executing Steve.



Shirley Sotloff in her video appeal to release her son Steven, right (Reuters)

09.53 Two British trainee medics who say they met ""Jihadi John"" in Syria said he hated Britain and was ""always ready for war"".

The men claimed they met Emwazi when he visited friends in a hospital they worked in months before his alleged role in Isil execution videos emerged.

They said he wore full combat gear at all times, even in safe areas during the full heat of summer, and earned his high-ranking position through his aggressive behaviour.

But they also spoke of how he visited his friends in hospital, bizarrely bringing them shopping bags full of sweets and ice cream.

One told ITV News: ""I remember he was quiet, not reserved quiet, he had a lot of friends and was social.

09.11 Isil sympathisers on Twitter last night claimed that Jihadi John appeared in the horrific video of a Jordanian pilot being burnt alive published by the group last month. His role in the killing has never been confirmed.

One user claimed Emwazi's appearance in the video had been missed because viewers ""were so filled with fear"".

The Telegraph has not been able to verify those claims, but the below image taken from the video appears to bear a strong resemblance to Emwazi:

08.44 Diane Foley, the mother of murdered Isil hostage James Foley, has said she ""forgives"" Emwazi ""as a mum"" for his crimes. She told The Times:

It saddens me, his [Emwazi's] continued hatred. He felt wronged, now we hate him - now that just prolongs the hatred. We need to end it.

As a mum I forgive him. You know, the whole thing is tragic - an ongoing tragedy.

08.30 It emerged last night that MI5 blunders allowed Jihadi John to slip through the net prior to his departure for Syria, where he has murdered at least five Western hostages:

MI5 and police came into contact at least a dozen times with the man identified yesterday as Jihadi John before he was able to flee Britain for Syria, it emerged last night.

The security services made a botched attempt to “turn” Mohammed Emwazi after he was first intercepted when they feared he was trying to join a Somali terrorist group six years ago.

However, Emwazi, who grew up in west London and is likely to have been radicalised in this country, rejected the advances and slipped out of the country, despite being on a terrorist watch list, to become one of the world’s most wanted men. The 26-year-old computer programmer has now murdered at least five Western hostages.

08.00 Good morning. Welcome back to day two of our live coverage of the unmasking of Isil militant Mohammed Emwazi, aka 'Jihadi John', as more details and revelations about his early life and radicalisation emerge.

For a summary of events so far, read our wrap from this morning's Telegraph newspaper, 'Jihadi John: From ordinary schoolboy to world's most wanted man', from Robert Mendick:

Perhaps the most remarkable thing about ‘Jihadi John’, the world’s most wanted man, is just how ordinary he actually is.

‘Jihadi John’ - the barbaric executioner of Western hostages held in Syria - has been unmasked as a computer studies graduate who grew up in a leafy and affluent suburb of west London.

His real name is Mohammed Emwazi, the eldest of six children, who took pride in his appearance, wore nice clothes, and appears - on the face of it at least - to have been a diligent student. He doesn’t even have a criminal record.

Nevertheless over the course of six years following his graduation, Emwazi undertook a journey that transformed him from benign teenager to the most demonic of killers, a blood-thirsty murderer who beheaded hostages, including Britons David Haines and Alan Henning, broadcast to the world in propaganda videos for the Islamic State.

However, little has been known about the woman-behind-the-hands of the popular YouTube channel. In fact, her face is never shown in the video, only her voice, toys and hands. However, a recent report reveals the true identity of the YouTube hit and the identity is somewhat shocking. A former Brazilian porn star is behind the wholesome Disney videos and it is noted that during the early years of “Disney Collector,” the woman was filming both Disney unboxing videos and porn in the same Florida home.

The Daily Mail reports that Brazilian Daiane DeJeus, also known as Sandy Summers in the porn industry, is the woman behind the hit Disney Collector Youtube videos. Reporters tracked down information on DeJeus that aligns with public records information regarding the widely popular DC Toy Collector YouTube channel. After tracking down DeJeus, the reporters spoke with family and friends who confirmed that Daiane was behind the million dollar videos.

DeJeus has went to unfathomable measures to ensure her identity remained secret and for good reason. The target market of the YouTube channel, which caters to Disney lovers such as children and families, may not remain viewers if they knew the owner’s secret. DeJeus was not only a Disney fanatic, but also a porn star. Going by the name Sandy Summers, Dejeus filmed numerous x-rated videos for the adult film industry in the same home that she filmed some of her early DC Toy Collector features.

Family and friends have identified DeJeus as the mystery unboxer and note that certain physical features on the woman’s hands and arms can be seen in many of the YouTube videos.

“They pointed to a tell-tale scar on her left elbow and a mole just above her elbow joint as being identical to those that can be seen on Summers in many of her lingerie photo shoots.”

Aside from the physical similarities, former neighbors say DeJeus has an unmistakable voice and say that many people on the street knew what she was up to.

‘That is Daiane. She has a very childlike voice and I would recognize it anywhere. Most people in the street eventually knew what she was up to.”

Would you have ever imagined that the popular DC Toy Collector videos were being filmed in the same house as adult films by a porn star?

Brazilian Daiane DeJeus was named by a family friend as the woman behind the wildly successful collection of children's videos that have been watched a staggering 2.8billion times.

And former neighbours of the mysterious internet star have revealed to Daily Mail.com her secret past - which could explain her desire to remain completely anonymous.

For years they knew her as Daiane DeJesus who lived in a suburban home with her long-term partner Messias Credido.

But they also discovered she was once a porn star called Sandy Summers.

DeJesus' videos, in which a mysterious woman 'unboxes' toys while narrating as she does so, have been watched a staggering 2.8billion times on YouTube, bringing the 29-year-old an annual income of almost $5m

The Brazilian went by the name Sandy Summers but is now living under the name Daiane de Jesus

Are these the hands of DC Toys Collector? Daiane DeJesus and her husband are apparently behind the site that has become a YouTube sensation

Seen here with a Teletubbies toy, the woman's nails always appear differently in each DC Toys Collector video

The couple behind DC Toys Collector - previously known as 'Disney Collector' and one of the most popular videos on YouTube - has gone to extraordinary lengths to make sure their identities are not known.

Attempts by the New York Times and BuzzFeed website to establish their identity failed, though they were able to pinpoint Florida as the location of those behind the channel - which is nothing to do with Disney itself.

But Daily Mail.com has been told the identities of the pair by former neighbours and a close friend - and has used publicly available property records.

Former neighbours who listened to the videos of DC Toys Collector are convinced that DeJesus is the voice behind You Tube's most successful channel.

They became aware of her career as adult film star after she was spotted taking part in a photo shoot by the swimming pool in her back garden.

They also watched some of the graphic adult-only videos and instantly recognised the pouting young blonde as their suburban neighbour.

DeJesus, 32, never mentioned what she did for a living and the neighbours never asked.

Daily Mail.com tracked DeJesus, who quit the porn industry at least seven years ago, to her new home in an upscale gated community in Orlando, Florida.

Four people who were independently shown a photograph of DeJesus taken by Daily Mail.com this week and published here said that it was their former neighbour.

They pointed to a tell-tale scar on her left elbow and a mole just above her elbow joint as being identical to those that can be seen on Summers in many of her lingerie photo shoots.

One neighbour who listened to the DC Toys Collector video and said immediately: 'That is Daiane. She has a very childlike voice and I would recognize it anywhere.'

The neighbour, who declined to be named, said: 'Most people in the street eventually knew what she was up to.

The DC Toys Collector formula is simple, with the woman simply removing the toys from their packaging, demonstrating each part and sometimes assembling them for the benefit of her massive online audience

The videos are essentially a virtual tour of each toy, such as this Play Doh with a Finding Nemo theme

Maribel Barreto, an associate and ex-wife of Daiane DeJesus' partner Messias Credido, was approached by Daily Mail.com and showed the photos of DeJesus and Summers. She said they are behind the DC Toys Collector videos

In the DC Toys Collector videos only the narrator's hands and the product being unboxed are usually seen

This still is from the channel's most successful video, which has been viewed more than 200million times

DeJesus' career change means neighbours say she is now the figure behind the most lucrative account on YouTube

The user unboxes everything from Disney princesses to tubs of Play-Doh, including this Cars themed toy

'Her husband said he ran a photographic business but he never left the house. That was strange.

'We just thought they were so secretive we thought something had to be going on.

'Then someone said we should look at Sandy Summers' website and it all clicked into place.'

His wife added: 'In the photo you have of Daiane she has put on a bit of weight but that is unmistakably her.

'That is our former neighbour. I used to chat with her quite a lot and was shocked when I learned what she did and what might have been going on at the house.'

Another neighbour, who is in his 70s and asked not be named, said no one in the quiet suburban street spoke to DeJesus or her husband about their work in the porn industry.

'We heard what they did but it was none of our business,' he said.

Credido's ex-wife Maribel Barreto was also approached by Daily Mail.com and viewed the photos of DeJesus and Summers.

The effect [of DC Toys Collector] is somewhat akin to crack for toddlers because of how you see them pining for it after its over.'

When asked if DeJesus and Summers were the same person the 44-year-old went ashen-faced and hurried away.

'I have nothing to say,' she said as she sprinted into her apartment.

But Barreto, who was divorced in 2011, had earlier confirmed that her ex-husband and his wife Daiane ran the DC Toys Collector site from their home in Orlando.

She said: 'Yes, they are the Disney Collectors. I can't say any more.'

While DeJesus has done nothing illegal, many parents who allow their children to watch the videos might be dismayed to learn about the other graphic videos and photo shoots DC Toys Collector apparently took part in a decade ago.

Attempts by Daily Mail.com to speak with DeJesus and her husband have failed as they have no phone listing and they do not accept unsolicited callers to the gated community where they now live.

Neighbours in the upscale gated community confirmed that they know the blonde woman who lives with Messias Credido as Daiane DeJesus.

The couple, who have an 18 month old son, were married on December 26th 2013, according to records lodged with Seminole County Court.

Credido, who is also from Brazil, is behind another successful You Tube site called BluCollector.

It is identical to the DC Toys Collector channel except it focuses mainly on toys for young boys.

Both the BluCollector and the DC Toys Collector site are produced in exactly the same way.

Shipping receipts seen by Daily Mail.com show toys being sent from Germany to the home address of Credido.

Former neighbours in the Orlando suburb of Winter Springs where DeJesus and Credido lived said they would see deliveries from UPS and Fed Ex almost daily at their home.

'There would be delivery trucks up to three times a day. We all wondered what was going on and what was being dropped off,' said a neighbour.

Credido has been named as the man behind the Blu Collector by other media outlets.

But until now the identities behind DC Toys Collector have been a closely guarded secret.

The videos first began appearing on YouTube in 2012.

They quickly became an online sensation attracting millions of page views and popular with children aged three and under because of their simplicity.

The most watched video is called 'Play Doh Sparkle Princess' and has had more than 200 million views.

Five other videos have received more than 40 million views, and another 15 have more than 20 million.

The channel's 1,600 videos have been watched more than 2.4 billion times since being uploaded.

One of the most recent, called 'LUNCH BOX SURPRISE Magnetic Dress-Up FROZEN', has already notched up more than 260,000 page views.

The DC Toys Collector channel has more than 3.7m subscribers with a new video posted almost every day.

Like others on YouTube, DC Toys Collector is able to make money from the site from pop-up and banner adverts on the site.

With so many children watching the videos on a daily basis it is an obvious choice for companies advertising toys to place their adverts within the short videos.

Each time the DC Toys Collector site is watched, the producers are paid.

Industry experts say they get between .60cents and $5 each time the page is viewed.

Google, which owns YouTube, takes 45 per cent of any money earned.

The company Open Slate, which analyses YouTube, estimated that in 2014 DC Toys Collector earned $4.9m.

They reached the figure by looking at the account's subscribers, social media reach and average monthly view count.

I call it first-person toy porn. I think it works because it's Christmas morning every minute.

In the videos DC Toys Collector's face is never seen. Viewers only ever see her hands and hear her slightly accented voice.

Each video always begins with the words: 'Hey guys, Disney Collector here'.

The narrator, who has a slight accent, regularly uses the words 'adorable' to describe the toys and carefully unwraps each item before explaining its features.

The videos are expertly produced with professional sound and lighting.

A focal point of the videos are the brightly coloured fingernails that often feature toy characters intricately painted on them.

The videos are said to have an entrancing effect on children who sit mesmerized as the toys are slowly opened in front of their eyes.

Technology strategist David Williams told the NBC Today show in July 2014 that the effect on kids, including his own, was like 'crack for toddlers'.

He told the show: 'The effect is somewhat akin to crack for toddlers because of how you see them pining for it after it's over'.

Williams also told Buzz Feed: 'I call it first-person toy porn. I think it works because it's Christmas morning every minute.'

Others have called the DC Toy Collector 'The Toy Whisperer'.

But the couple have gone to great lengths to guard their privacy. No phone number is listed and their names are not even on the phone entry system at the gated community where they now live in Orlando.

Property records listed with Seminole County list 44-year-old Credido as the buyer of a four-bedroom home set on a cul de sac in Orlando in April 2013.

DeJesus' name does not appear on the records.

Neighbours in the development contacted by phone confirmed that DeJesus lives at the address and is mum to an 18-month-old boy.

According to fan websites DeJesus, or Summers, began her porn career when she was 20 years old in 2006.

She lists her hometown as Lages in Santa Catarina, Brazil, and her date of birth as April 1986.

On a webpage called Babepedia she says: 'I was born in a small town in Brazil called Lages. I love the sun, so when I moved to the US Florida seemed like the right place.

'I miss some of my friends in Brazil, but I just love living here! I enjoy the simple life, but big cities have so much to offer; shopping for one! I am a shopoholic, definitely!

'I speak Portuguese and English. What else can I say about myself? Just that I love to get naked.'

In her career she has appeared on the cover of Penthouse magazine and other adult magazines as well as dozens of graphic videos.

It appears she quit or reduced her involvement in the adult film business in 2009 with one fan asking on a site: 'Anyone know what has happened to Sandy Summers?'

Daily Mail.com tracked down Daiane DeJesus' partner Messias Credido's former wife Maribel Barreto

Ms Barreto confirmed that Mr Credido and Daiane de Jesus are behind the DC Toys Collector videos. She is pictured being shown a document with the reported annual income of DC Toys Collector

But when asked if DeJesus and Summers were the same person the 44-year-old went ashen faced and hurried away

Some of the photographs of Summers on adult sites appear to have been taken at their home in Winter Park.

Many of the backdrops in the pictures are identical to those now being shown on the estate agent's webpage advertising the home for sale.

In one she is draped across a stone fireplace. That same fireplace is pictured on the estate agent's webpage advertising the home for sale.

DeJesus and Credido, who ran a now defunct photographic business called High Tec Photography, lived in Winter Park for almost seven years.

The couple aroused the curiosity of neighbours as they were ultra secretive.

One said: 'Messias said he was a photographer but he never left the house. They always made sure that no one would come into the house.

'They were friendly when you bumped into them in the street, but they would not go out of their way to be talkative.'

Another said: 'Word soon got around that Daiane was involved in some sort of adult work. No one liked to ask any questions but once we knew her working name we looked her up.'

Publically available records with Seminole County show that the couple moved in April 2013 from Winter Park to a gated community in Orlando, paying $690,000 for a four-bedroom home.

Daily Mail.com knows the exact location but has declined to publish it.

It is also possible that Ms Barreto works with the couple on the DC Toys Collector website or even plays the part of the hands herself. However, she claimed to DailyMail.com that the couple are behind the production of the videos.

Credido has also recently paid $300,000 for a plot of land in another gated community where he is expected to build a multi-million dollar home.

Records filed with Seminole County court show that DeJesus and Credido were married on December 26, 2013. DeJesus is listed as a single woman while Credido is divorced.

A fisherman has reeled in a monster 19 stone catfish, which could be the biggest in the world caught with a rod and reel.

Dino Ferrari hooked the whopper wels catfish, which was 2.67m in length, last week in the Po Delta in Italy.

While the fish might set a new record for the biggest caught on a line, it is far from the heaviest ever landed. The biggest was 22st and 2.78m long, and was also from the Po Delta.

Wels catfish can grow as long as 4m and up to 62st. However, it is rare to catch one that is over two meters long.

The fish has a ferocious appetite and will consume anything it comes across. They have been filmed eating pigeons that get too close.

In December 14-year-old Sam Lee caught a 15st catfish while on holiday in Spain.

The Chester schoolboy was with dad Peter when the 2.5m carnivorous fish snatched the live bait at the end of his line.

It immediately bolted 100m downstream, but Sam hung on - and eventually landed it after a 35 minute battle.

He then posed for a traditional photo to secure bragging rights before letting the creature swim back into the water at the River Ebro in Catalonia."

According to USA Today Sports, Dino Ferrari caught the huge fish in Po Delta. While the catfish caught by Ferrari was 8.7 feet in length and weighed 280 pounds, the largest catfish ever caught weighed 300 pounds. That does not mean that this wasn’t a record-breaking fish, however. According to the report, this might be the largest catfish ever caught using a generic fishing rod.

According to the San Antonio Express-News, any catfish over 6.5 feet is considered extremely rare. Ferrari isn’t some small time fisherman, either. According to Grind TV, the Italy native is a pro at catching big Wels catfish, and many of these fish frequent the waters where Ferrari casts his line.

“The wels catfish is the second-largest freshwater fish in its region, ranking behind the beluga sturgeon. The largest beluga sturgeon on record is reportedly 3,463 pounds.”

The 280 pound catfish is certainly a sight to see, as it looks as if it could swallow Ferrari whole. He posed for photos with the fish, clearly very proud of his catch (even appearing to hug it while his brother took some pictures), which took him a tiring 40 minutes to reel in. It is almost hard to believe that catfish can get that big!

Animal lovers may be happy to know that Ferrari did not keep the catfish, nor did he sell it for money. After his brother took a couple of pictures of the creature, the guys released it back into the river, where it swam off, happy to live another day.

As previously reported by the Inquisitr, these Wels catfish aren’t exactly harmless; this certainly is not the type of sea creature that you would want to swim into. And it is definitely not a “gentle giant” by any means.

“Dino’s monster catch is not the sort of fish you’d want to accidentally swim into while skinny dipping. The fish has a ferocious appetite and will consume anything that happens to cross its path. These surly catfish have even been filmed eating pigeons after our feathery friends happened to fly too close to these cold-blooded killers.”

Pictures of the 280 pound catfish are making waves on the internet today. Have you ever seen a catfish so big? Would you want to see a Wels catfish in person?

This giant catfish, which weighed 20 stone (127kg) was caught by twin brothers Dino and Dario Ferrari in the Po River of northern Italy .

Dino Ferrari caught the 127 kg catfish in the Po delta of Italy (Sportex Italia)

Believed to be one of the largest of its kind ever caught, the creature was pulled from the river on Feb 19 with a rod and line after a battle lasting 40 minutes.

The nine foot-long creature, a wels catfish, has been dubbed “the monster of the Po” by the Italian media.



The fish was released after the trophy photos (Sportex Italia)

After catching, weighing and photographing it, the brothers released it back into the river, which flows across northern Italy to the Adriatic.

“It’s a silurus glanis [the Latin name for the species],” Dino Ferrari said. “The American catfish doesn’t grow to such large dimensions – at most it can weigh 50kg.” He estimated the fish to be about 30 years old, based on its size, adding that the species can live for up to 50 years.

“They don’t range over very large distances, they tend to live in the same stretch of river, moving just a few kilometres either way. They eat all types of fish.

""To catch them you need a lot of patience but also physical strength. We fought for 40 minutes to reel it in. We tired it out and then lifted it out of the water.”

The wels catfish, also known as the sheatfish, lives in fresh and brackish water.

It is native to eastern Europe and parts of Asia but was introduced to western Europe.

The fish prey on other fish, as well as worms, crustaceans, frogs and water fowl.

“Who knows, maybe we will manage to catch it again in a year’s time, and it will be even more gigantic,” said Mr Ferrari."

In December schoolboy Sam Lee, 14, caught an 8ft 14 stone catfish while on a fishing holiday in Spain with his father Peter.

The giant catfish immediately bolted 100 metres downstream, but Sam, from Chester, hung on and after a 35 minute battle finally landed the 2.5 metre-long fish.

In time honoured tradition, he then posed for a photo to secure bragging rights before letting the creature swim back into the water at the River Ebro in Catalonia.

Mr Ferrari (pictured) poses with his monster catch. Wels catfish can grow as long as 13ft and weigh up to 62st

The wels catfish can live for thirty years and live off annelid worms, gastropods, insects, crustaceans and fish

Mr Ferrari took this photo after hauling in his catch, showing it to measure 2.67m in length

In October a Cornish pensioner caught an 8ft-long, 15 stonepart-albino catfish, thought to be the biggest of its kind ever caught.

The aptly named Tom Herron, 68, from Launceston, battled the cream-coloured monster fish in the River Segre, Mequinenza, Spain, for 40 minutes before finally hauling it in.

The wels catfish is scaleless and lives in fresh and brackish water.

It is recognisable by its broad, flat head and wide mouth.

«È stato un combattimento durato 40 minuti», racconta Dino. Prima d’ora nessuno era mai riuscito a catturare una preda così grande con la tecnica dello spinning, un tipo di pesca sportiva con un’esca artificiale. Quando hanno avvertito il momento opportuno, lo hanno tirato verso l’imbarcazione e poi, tra mille difficoltà da parte del siluro, lo hanno agganciato e trainato a riva.

In verità, i due sono parecchio noti nell’ambiente della pesca al siluro per aver effettuato altre catture eccezionali in passato: «In 20 anni ne abbiamo pescati circa 1800». La gioia per questo colpo sensazionale è stata talmente grande che Dino ha voluto abbracciare il possente pesce per le foto di rito. Si pensa che il siluro possa raggiungere persino i quattro metri di lunghezza, sebbene finora non ci siano prove certe. E la preda, che fine ha fatto? Il gigante è ancora nel Po. Dopo alcuni scatti lo hanno ributtato in acqua. «Chi sono io per togliergli la vita?» afferma Dino Ferrari. Forse tra un anno riusciranno a pescarlo di nuovo.

TRUE

On facebook there’s a photo posted of a man with a HUGE fish… looks like a catfish. I believe it’s photoshopped…can you verify this?



Origins: On 19 February 2015, fisherman Dino Ferrari reeled in an enormous 280-pound catfish from the Po Delta in Italy:

The above-displayed photograph, which was posted by Ferrari’s sponsor Sportex Italia on their Facebook page, quickly went viral on social media sites and left many viewers in a state of disbelief.

While this single photo may have been hard to believe on its own, Sportex Italia provided several additional photos of Ferrari’s catch:







According to Sportex Italia, Dino Ferrari’s enormous catfish was measured at 2.67 meters (approximately 8 feet, 9 inches) and weighed 127 kg (about 280 pounds). While this is certainly an impressive catch (and possibly a record for a catfish caught with a rod and reel), it is not a world record catch. According to Heartland Outdoors, that honor goes to a 297-lb. catfish pulled out of the River Po in 2010:"	280-Pound Catfish		['David Mikkelson']	['po', 'ferraris', 'enormous', 'facebook', 'posted', '280pound', 'catfish', 'photograph', 'record', 'italia', 'sportex']	"Claim: Photograph shows a 280-pound catfish caught by an Italian fisherman.

“The Iraqi Parliament’s National Security and Defense Committee has access to the photos of both planes that are British and have crashed while they were carrying weapons for the ISIL,” Head of the committee Hakem al-Zameli said, according to a Monday report of the Arabic-language information center of the Islamic Supreme Council of Iraq.

He said the Iraqi parliament has asked London for explanations in this regard.

The senior Iraqi legislator further unveiled that the government in Baghdad is receiving daily reports from people and security forces in al-Anbar province on numerous flights by the US-led coalition planes that airdrop weapons and supplies for ISIL in terrorist-held areas.

The Iraqi lawmaker further noted the cause of such western aids to the terrorist group, and explained that the US prefers a chaotic situation in Anbar Province which is near the cities of Karbala and Baghdad as it does not want the ISIL crisis to come to an end.

Earlier today, a senior Iraqi provincial official lashed out at the western countries and their regional allies for supporting Takfiri terrorists in Iraq, revealing that US and Israeli-made weapons have been discovered from the areas purged of ISIL terrorists.

“We have discovered weapons made in the US, European countries and Israel from the areas liberated from ISIL’s control in Al-Baqdadi region,” the Al-Ahad news website quoted Head of Al-Anbar Provincial Council Khalaf Tarmouz as saying.

He noted that the weapons made by the European countries and Israel were discovered from the terrorists in the Eastern parts of the city of Ramadi.







Al-Zameli had also disclosed in January that the anti-ISIL coalition’s planes have dropped weapons and foodstuff for the ISIL in Salahuddin, Al-Anbar and Diyala provinces.

Al-Zameli underlined that the coalition is the main cause of ISIL’s survival in Iraq.

“There are proofs and evidence for the US-led coalition’s military aid to ISIL terrorists through air(dropped cargoes),” he told FNA in January.

He noted that the members of his committee have already proved that the US planes have dropped advanced weaponry, including anti-aircraft weapons, for the ISIL, and that it has set up an investigation committee to probe into the matter.

“The US drops weapons for the ISIL on the excuse of not knowing about the whereabouts of the ISIL positions and it is trying to distort the reality with its allegations.

He noted that the committee had collected the data and the evidence provided by eyewitnesses, including Iraqi army officers and the popular forces, and said, “These documents are given to the investigation committee … and the necessary measures will be taken to protect the Iraqi airspace.”

Also in January, another senior Iraqi legislator reiterated that the US-led coalition is the main cause of ISIL’s survival in Iraq.

“The international coalition is only an excuse for protecting the ISIL and helping the terrorist group with equipment and weapons,” Jome Divan, who is member of the al-Sadr bloc in the Iraqi parliament, said.

He said the coalition’s support for the ISIL is now evident to everyone, and continued, “The coalition has not targeted ISIL’s main positions in Iraq.”

In late December, Iraqi Parliamentary Security and Defense Commission MP disclosed that a US plane supplied the ISIL terrorist organization with arms and ammunition in Salahuddin province.

MP Majid al-Gharawi stated that the available information pointed out that US planes are supplying ISIL organization, not only in Salahuddin province, but also other provinces, Iraq TradeLink reported.

He added that the US and the international coalition are “not serious in fighting against the ISIL organization, because they have the technological power to determine the presence of ISIL gunmen and destroy them in one month”.

Gharawi added that “the US is trying to expand the time of the war against the ISIL to get guarantees from the Iraqi government to have its bases in Mosul and Anbar provinces.”

Salahuddin security commission also disclosed that “unknown planes threw arms and ammunition to the ISIL gunmen Southeast of Tikrit city”.

Also in Late December, a senior Iraqi lawmaker raised doubts about the seriousness of the anti-ISIL coalition led by the US, and said that the terrorist group still received aids dropped by unidentified aircraft.

“The international coalition is not serious about air strikes on ISIL terrorists and is even seeking to take out the popular (voluntary) forces from the battlefield against the Takfiris so that the problem with ISIL remains unsolved in the near future,” Nahlah al-Hababi told FNA.

“The ISIL terrorists are still receiving aids from unidentified fighter jets in Iraq and Syria,” she added.

Hababi said that the coalition’s precise airstrikes are launched only in those areas where the Kurdish Pishmarga forces are present, while military strikes in other regions are not so much precise.

In late December, the US-led coalition dropped aids to the Takfiri militants in an area North of Baghdad.

Field sources in Iraq told al-Manar that the international coalition airplanes dropped aids to the terrorist militants in Balad, an area which lies in Salahuddin province North of Baghdad.

In October, a high-ranking Iranian commander also slammed the US for providing aid supplies to ISIL, adding that the US claims that the weapons were mistakenly airdropped to ISIL were untrue.

“The US and the so-called anti-ISIL coalition claim that they have launched a campaign against this terrorist and criminal group – while supplying them with weapons, food and medicine in Jalawla region (a town in Diyala Governorate, Iraq). This explicitly displays the falsity of the coalition’s and the US’ claims,” Deputy Chief of Staff of the Iranian Armed Forces Brigadier General Massoud Jazayeri said.

The US claimed that it had airdropped weapons and medical aid to Kurdish fighters confronting the ISIL in Kobani, near the Turkish border in Northern Syria.

The US Defense Department said that it had airdropped 28 bundles of weapons and supplies, but one of them did not make it into the hands of the Kurdish fighters.

Video footage later showed that some of the weapons that the US airdropped were taken by ISIL militants.

The Iranian commander insisted that the US had the necessary intelligence about ISIL’s deployment in the region and that their claims to have mistakenly airdropped weapons to them are as unlikely as they are untrue."

“The Iraqi Parliament’s National Security and Defense Committee has access to the photos of both planes that are British and have crashed while they were carrying weapons for the ISIL,” Head of the committee Hakem al-Zameli said, according to the Arabic-language information center of the Islamic Supreme Council of Iraq.

The incident was reported by foreign and alternative media but not mentioned by the establishment media in the U.S. Europe.

Hakem al-Zameli, a senior Iraqi legislator, added that the current government in Baghdad is receiving daily reports from security forces in al-Anbar province about flights airdropping weapons to ISIS.

He said the U.S. wants to promote chaos in Iraq and does this by supporting the Islamic State.

Other Iraqi lawmakers are complaining about the situation.

“We have discovered weapons made in the US, European countries and Israel from the areas liberated from ISIL’s control in Al-Baqdadi region,” the al-Ahad news website quoted the head of the al-Anbar Provincial Council Khalaf Tarmouz as saying.

Weapons made in Europe and Israel were also discovered in Ramadi, Tarmouz said.

“The US drops weapons for the ISIL on the excuse of not knowing about the whereabouts of the ISIL positions and it is trying to distort the reality with its allegations,” he said.

In December Iranian state media claimed U.S. military aircraft dropped weapons in areas held by the Islamic State for a second time.

Infowars.com reported:

Iraqi volunteers fighting against IS in the Yathrib and Balad districts in Iraq’s Salahuddin Province reported the air drops. Iraq claims it now has the upper hand in the battle to regain territory from the terrorist group. In October a purported errant airdrop of weapons fell into the hands Islamic State fighters outside Kobani in Syria. In November Iraqi intelligence sources said the U.S. is actively supplying ISIS with weapons. “The Iraqi intelligence sources reiterated that the US military planes have airdropped several aid cargoes for ISIL terrorists to help them resist the siege laid by the Iraqi army, security and popular forces,” a report stated. “What is important is that the US sends these weapons to only those that cooperate with the Pentagon and this indicates that the US plays a role in arming the ISIL.”

In July, Infowars.com reported on the large amount of U.S. weapons captured by ISIS.

In addition to combat ground vehicles and artillery previously acquired from the Iraqi military, the trove taken form U.S. bases included more than 50 155mm M-198 artillery batteries and 4,000 PKC machine guns.

The acquisition of sophisticated weapons converted ISIS from a terrorist group into an army capable of waging conventional war in Iraq and Syria.

From Fars News Agency:

Iraq’s army has shot down two British planes as they were carrying weapons for the ISIL terrorists in Al-Anbar province, a senior lawmaker disclosed on Monday.

“The Iraqi Parliament’s National Security and Defense Committee has access to the photos of both planes that are British and have crashed while they were carrying weapons for the ISIL,” Head of the committee Hakem al-Zameli said, according to a Monday report of the Arabic-language information center of the Islamic Supreme Council of Iraq.

He said the Iraqi parliament has asked London for explanations in this regard.

The senior Iraqi legislator further unveiled that the government in Baghdad is receiving daily reports from people and security forces in al-Anbar province on numerous flights by the US-led coalition planes that airdrop weapons and supplies for ISIL in terrorist-held areas.

The Iraqi lawmaker further noted the cause of such western aids to the terrorist group, and explained that the US prefers a chaotic situation in Anbar Province which is near the cities of Karbala and Baghdad as it does not want the ISIL crisis to come to an end.

Earlier today, a senior Iraqi provincial official lashed out at the western countries and their regional allies for supporting Takfiri terrorists in Iraq, revealing that US and Israeli-made weapons have been discovered from the areas purged of ISIL terrorists.

“We have discovered weapons made in the US, European countries and Israel from the areas liberated from ISIL’s control in Al-Baqdadi region,” the Al-Ahad news website quoted Head of Al-Anbar Provincial Council Khalaf Tarmouz as saying.

He noted that the weapons made by the European countries and Israel were discovered from the terrorists in the Eastern parts of the city of Ramadi.

Al-Zameli had also disclosed in January that the anti-ISIL coalition’s planes have dropped weapons and foodstuff for the ISIL in Salahuddin, Al-Anbar and Diyala provinces.

Al-Zameli underlined that the coalition is the main cause of ISIL’s survival in Iraq.

“There are proofs and evidence for the US-led coalition’s military aid to ISIL terrorists through air(dropped cargoes),” he told FNA in January.

He noted that the members of his committee have already proved that the US planes have dropped advanced weaponry, including anti-aircraft weapons, for the ISIL, and that it has set up an investigation committee to probe into the matter.

“The US drops weapons for the ISIL on the excuse of not knowing about the whereabouts of the ISIL positions and it is trying to distort the reality with its allegations.

He noted that the committee had collected the data and the evidence provided by eyewitnesses, including Iraqi army officers and the popular forces, and said, “These documents are given to the investigation committee … and the necessary measures will be taken to protect the Iraqi airspace.”

Also in January, another senior Iraqi legislator reiterated that the US-led coalition is the main cause of ISIL’s survival in Iraq.

“The international coalition is only an excuse for protecting the ISIL and helping the terrorist group with equipment and weapons,” Jome Divan, who is member of the al-Sadr bloc in the Iraqi parliament, said.

He said the coalition’s support for the ISIL is now evident to everyone, and continued, “The coalition has not targeted ISIL’s main positions in Iraq.”

In late December, Iraqi Parliamentary Security and Defense Commission MP disclosed that a US plane supplied the ISIL terrorist organization with arms and ammunition in Salahuddin province.

MP Majid al-Gharawi stated that the available information pointed out that US planes are supplying ISIL organization, not only in Salahuddin province, but also other provinces, Iraq TradeLink reported.

He added that the US and the international coalition are “not serious in fighting against the ISIL organization, because they have the technological power to determine the presence of ISIL gunmen and destroy them in one month”.

Gharawi added that “the US is trying to expand the time of the war against the ISIL to get guarantees from the Iraqi government to have its bases in Mosul and Anbar provinces.”

Salahuddin security commission also disclosed that “unknown planes threw arms and ammunition to the ISIL gunmen Southeast of Tikrit city”.

Also in Late December, a senior Iraqi lawmaker raised doubts about the seriousness of the anti-ISIL coalition led by the US, and said that the terrorist group still received aids dropped by unidentified aircraft.

“The international coalition is not serious about air strikes on ISIL terrorists and is even seeking to take out the popular (voluntary) forces from the battlefield against the Takfiris so that the problem with ISIL remains unsolved in the near future,” Nahlah al-Hababi told FNA.

“The ISIL terrorists are still receiving aids from unidentified fighter jets in Iraq and Syria,” she added.

Hababi said that the coalition’s precise airstrikes are launched only in those areas where the Kurdish Pishmarga forces are present, while military strikes in other regions are not so much precise.

In late December, the US-led coalition dropped aids to the Takfiri militants in an area North of Baghdad.

Field sources in Iraq told al-Manar that the international coalition airplanes dropped aids to the terrorist militants in Balad, an area which lies in Salahuddin province North of Baghdad.

In October, a high-ranking Iranian commander also slammed the US for providing aid supplies to ISIL, adding that the US claims that the weapons were mistakenly airdropped to ISIL were untrue.

“The US and the so-called anti-ISIL coalition claim that they have launched a campaign against this terrorist and criminal group – while supplying them with weapons, food and medicine in Jalawla region (a town in Diyala Governorate, Iraq). This explicitly displays the falsity of the coalition’s and the US’ claims,” Deputy Chief of Staff of the Iranian Armed Forces Brigadier General Massoud Jazayeri said.

The US claimed that it had airdropped weapons and medical aid to Kurdish fighters confronting the ISIL in Kobani, near the Turkish border in Northern Syria.

The US Defense Department said that it had airdropped 28 bundles of weapons and supplies, but one of them did not make it into the hands of the Kurdish fighters.

Video footage later showed that some of the weapons that the US airdropped were taken by ISIL militants.

The Iranian commander insisted that the US had the necessary intelligence about ISIL’s deployment in the region and that their claims to have mistakenly airdropped weapons to them are as unlikely as they are untrue.

>> L'histoire du prêtre était fausse. Lire ici notre article rectificatif.

Et si Dieu était une femme? C'est ce qu'affirme le père John Micheal O’neal, prêtre de 71 ans dans le Massachusetts. Le 29 janvier dernier, il est amené d’urgence à l’hôpital, victime d'une crise cardiaque. Quelques minutes après son arrivée, il est déclaré cliniquement mort. Les médecins parviennent finalement à le «ramener à la vie en redémarrant son cœur, 48 minutes après qu’il s’est arrêté, rapportent plusieurs médias américains.

Le religieux américain a prétendu avoir des souvenirs clairs de ce qui lui était arrivé pendant ces longues minutes de mort clinique. Il explique avoir eu la sensation d’être sorti de son corps, entouré par une lumière écrasante, et éprouvé un sentiment d’intense amour autour de lui. Des sensations souvent évoquées par ceux qui ont fait l’expérience de mort imminente (EMI).

Dieu, une «figure maternelle chaleureuse et réconfortante»

Mais John Micheal O’neal va plus loin. Il affirme être monté au ciel et avoir rencontré le Tout-puissant. Celui-ci serait un «être de lumière», mais surtout, une «figure maternelle chaleureuse et réconfortante».

«Sa présence était à la fois immense et réconfortante», déclare le prêtre catholique. «Elle avait une voix douce et apaisante et sa présence était aussi rassurante que l'étreinte d'une mère. Le fait que Dieu soit une Sainte=Mère au lieu d'un Saint-Père ne me dérange pas, elle est tout ce que j'espérais et même plus encore».

Ces déclarations ont provoqué l’émoi dans le clergé catholique de l'archidiocèse, obligeant le cardinal Sean P. O’Malley à faire une déclaration publique, pour expliquer que Dieu n’était pas une femme et que le père O’neal avait subi des hallucinations."

A Catholic priest from Massachussetts who was officially dead for more than 48 minutes before medics were able to miraculously re-start his heart has revealed a shocking revelation about God.

According to 71-year-old cleric Father John Micheal O'neal claims that God is a warm and comforting motherly figure, whom he met in the heaven.

Father John Micheal O'neal was rushed to the hospital on January 29 after a major heart attack, but was declared clinically dead soon after his arrival.

With the aid of a high-tech machine called LUCAS 2, that kept the blood flowing to his brain, doctors at Massachusetts General Hospital managed to unblock vital arteries and return his heart to a normal rhythm, reported starrfmonline.com



He claims that at that point in his experience, he went to heaven and encountered God, which he describes as a feminine, mother-like ""Being of Light"".

The declarations of the cleric caused quite a stir in the catholic clergy of the archdiocese over the last few days, causing the Archbishop to summon a press conference to try and calm the rumors.

During that time, Father John Micheal O’Neal claims he went to heaven and met God, which he describes as a warm and comforting motherly figure.

The 71-year old cleric was rushed to the hospital on January 29 after a major heart attack but was declared clinically dead soon after his arrival.

With the aid of a high-tech machine called LUCAS 2, that kept the blood flowing to his brain, doctors at Massachusetts General Hospital managed to unblock vital arteries and return his heart to a normal rhythm.

The doctors were afraid he would have suffered some brain damage from the incident, but he woke up less than 48 hours later and seems to have perfectly recovered.

The elderly man claims that he has clear and vivid memories of what happened to him while he was dead.

He describes a strange out-of-body experience, experiencing an intense feeling of unconditional love and acceptance, as well as being surrounded by an overwhelming light.

He claims that at that point in his experience, he went to heaven and encountered God, which he describes as a feminine, mother-like “Being of Light”.

“Her presence was both overwhelming and comforting” states the Catholic priest. “She had a soft and soothing voice and her presence was as reassuring as a mother’s embrace. The fact that God is a Holy Mother instead of a Holy Father doesn’t disturb me, she is everything I hoped she would be and even more!”

The declarations of the cleric caused quite a stir in the Catholic clergy of the archdiocese over the last few days, causing the Archbishop to summon a press conference to try and calm the rumors.

Despite the disapproval of his superiors, Father O’Neal says that he will continue dedicating his life to God and spread the word of the “Holy Mother”.

“I wish to continue preaching” says the elderly cleric. “I would like to share my new knowledge of the Mother, the Son and the Holy Ghost with all catholics and even all Christians. God is great and almighty despite being a woman…”

The Roman Catholic Archdiocese of Boston has not confirmed, however, if they will allow Father O’Neal to resume his preaching in his former parish in South Boston."

MGM Resorts International unintentionally outed Vice Media CEO Shane Smith’s ridiculously expensive $300,000 dinner at the Bellagio casino’s Prime Steakhouse in January. Asked yesterday about spending levels at the company’s casinos, MGM CEO James Murren bragged about the tab to Nomura analyst Harry Curtis: “$300,000 for dinner at Prime. That’s a pretty good check. You would have liked the wine, Harry.”

Murren didn’t identify the person who ran up the six-figure bill, but Bloomberg reporters quickly connected the dinner to Smith, who at the time of the meal was in the midst of a hot run at the blackjack tables, which was apparently witnessed by the late New York Times media columnist David Carr:

The Times’ Dealbook blog later reported that Smith’s gambling winnings exceeded $1 million, citing anonymous people who attended the dinner.

With accounts of the guestlist ranging from 12 to 30, it’s hard to imagine how the outspoken Smith and his guests ran up such a stupendous tab without buying some monumentally expensive booze. A 28 oz. bone-in rib eye, Prime’s most expensive dish, sells for $85, pan-roasted Dover sole will run you $66, and a lobster tail goes for $62—but the steakhouse’s wine list includes bottles that sell for more than $20,000.

A Vice spokesman did not respond to requests for comment. The media company recently secured a $500 million funding round that values it at more than $2.5 billion.

Smith also has yet to comment on the dinner. Perhaps he thinks MGM has already said enough."

MGM Resorts International revealed on an earnings call Tuesday that unidentified guests had enjoyed a $300,000 meal in January.

On Wednesday, Bloomberg reported that the guest was Smith, citing an anonymous source who attended the private feast at the Bellagio casino’s Prime Steakhouse.

— Andrew Fitzgerald (@magicandrew) February 18, 2015

MGM spokesman Clark Dumont told Bloomberg in an e-mail that it was a party of 12. But one of the guests at the dinner estimated it to be a party of closer to 25.

The majority of the bill was spent on wine, with some bottles costing $20,000, Dumont said.

Smith was in town attending the Consumer Electronics Show, and had a very successful run at the blackjack table prior to the meal.

David Carr, the New York Times columnist who died unexpectedly last week at age 58, hinted at Smith’s hot hand in a pair of tweets last month.

“No brainer quiz,” Carr tweeted. “What media co exec did I watch win $100k at blackjack last nite? Hint: gambling not his only vice.”

Carr and Smith famously clashed when Carr interviewed some Vice execs for the 2011 documentary, “Page One.”

The legendary New York Times media critic put Smith in his place when Smith criticized the Times for what he thought was a lack of coverage in genocide-stricken areas like Africa.

“Before you ever went there, we've had reporters there reporting on genocide after genocide,” Carr told Smith. “Just because you put on a f***ing safari helmet and looked at some poop doesn't give you the right to insult what we do.”

In May, a Gawker report accused Vice of paying its employees lowly wages, citing salary numbers provided by anonymous former Vice staffers.

""A company as successful as Vice should be paying decent wages. Vice doesn't,"" the report said. ""The company pays shitty wages to low-level employees, compensating them instead with the sheer coolness of working for Vice Media.""

One former Vice editorial employee told Gawker that Smith was a ""jackass” who “makes an insane amount of money” as the public figurehead of the company.

Vice responded to the allegations by pointing out that former Gawker interns had brought a class-action lawsuit against the company’s founder, Nick Denton, for allegedly violating federal wage laws.

Then, at the Vice company holiday party in December, Smith gave each full-time employee an envelope with $1,500 cash inside, amounting to $1 million total, Business Insider reported.

The Brooklyn-based Vice has grown into a media titan. Technology Crossover Ventures and A+E Networks each invested $250 million for 10 percent stakes in the company last year, on top of a $70 million investment from Rupert Murdoch's 21st Century Fox."

He then spent $300,000 of his winnings on a meal for more than 30 employees and business partners.

The lavish meal at Bellagio’s Prime Steakhouse took place during the Consumer Electronics Show. It included bottles of wine costing $15,000 each and was so expensive it merited a mention on the quarterly earnings call of MGM Resorts, the group which owns the Bellagio and other Las Vegas casino hotels.

The most expensive food item on the menu at the Prime Steakhouse, a Jean-Georges Vongerichten restaurant, is a 28-ounce bone-in rib eye for $85.

Jim Murren, MGM Resorts chief executive, said he had not seen a meal with such a hefty price tag since 2007. “It tells you there is a release valve that has opened,” Mr Murren said. “That isn’t a trend, but it’s a sign people are ready to spend money again.”

Despite the meal’s eye-watering price tag, Mr Smith is not the biggest spending media chief executive to play the Las Vegas tables. Kerry Packer, the late Australian billionaire, was a regular in Las Vegas and was known to bet as much as $150,000 a hand. His visits to casinos often made the difference between gaming operators reporting profits or losses in their quarterly earnings.

Mr Smith declined to comment on the meal.

However, Vice Media is not lacking in confidence. The youth-focused company will go on a “deal spree” in 2015 and explore an initial public offering if market conditions remain favourable, Mr Smith told the Financial Times in December.

The company has strengthened its senior management team with the appointment of James Schwab, a mergers and acquisitions lawyer, as co-president, who will help oversee a $500m “war chest” for content, technology and distribution deals.

“Vice will go on a deal spree in 2015,” said Mr Smith. “Our war chest is the size of the full valuation of our competition so we will see some major ... deals happen.”

The $500m fund came from A&E Networks, which invested $250m in Vice recently for a 10 per cent stake, valuing the company at $2.5bn. Technology Crossover Ventures, the Silicon Valley fund that has stakes in Facebook and Netflix, also invested $250m in the group.

Vice, which in 2013 also took a strategic stake from 21st Century Fox, wanted to stay independent, said Mr Smith. “We would be stupid not to think about an IPO.”

The company has recently been engaged in a war of words with Gawker, a rival site, which has in several stories accused Vice of underpaying its employees. Vice hit back in a blog post, accusing Gawker of “garbage, click-bait journalism” and “inaccurate and irresponsible” reporting.

An Indian bride has married a guest at her wedding after her groom-to-be had a seizure and collapsed.

Reports said the groom, Jugal Kishore, was epileptic and he had kept the information from the bride, Indira, and her family.

While Mr Kishore was taken to hospital, the angry bride decided to switch husbands.

She asked a member of her brother-in-law's family, who was a guest, to step in and marry her instead. He agreed.

The incident took place in Rampur town in the northern Indian state of Uttar Pradesh.

According to a report in The Times of India, Mr Kishore, 25, fell to the ground in front of the wedding guests just as he was reaching out to garland Indira.

On his return from the hospital, Mr Kishore pleaded with Indira to change her mind, telling her that he would be ridiculed by friends and relatives if he went home without a bride, but she refused.

Local police official Ram Khiladi Solanki told the BBC that Mr Kishore and his family were initially upset and lodged a complaint with the police.

""But since the bride is already married now, what can anyone do? So the families have resolved the matter and the complaint has been withdrawn,"" he added."

Kishore fell to the ground and was soon rushed to a nearby hospital.

The unexpected event enraged the bride who felt cheated that the groom and his family had concealed Kishore's health issues from her, and prompted her to dump him on the spot.

She declared she would marry any person among the guests, who was willing to accept her as his wife.

A man from the gathering quickly obliged and the couple exchanged garlands and completed the rituals necessary to officially become husband and wife.

However, the high voltage wedding drama did not end there.

The groom who had fallen ill came back from hospital only to find his would-be-wife had become another man's better half.

He tried convincing the young woman to marry him, even pleading he would not be able to face friends or family if she refused.

The situation soon escalated into a major fight between the two parties, which could only be resolved after the intervention of the police and elders.

""Both families have amicably resolved the matter,"" the local police head RP Solanki told the Times of India.

After the swap, the wedding ceremony continued as planned until Mr Kishore returned from hospital.

When diplomacy failed, the family allegedly resorted to violence and entered into a brawl involving plates and cutlery.

Multiple news outlets reported that the bride, upon realising that the groom and his family had kept this serious medical condition from her, was furious. In her angered state, she allegedly declared that she would happily marry Harpal Singh, one of the guests at the wedding. The reports further state that Singh, incidentally, was her sister's brother-in-law.

But once the varmala ceremony – where the groom garlands his wife to be – started, the groom suddenly had an epileptic fit, and fell to the ground.

Singh, dressed in a leather jacket and jeans, was completely taken aback by the strange situation, and after a bit of hesitation, declared that he would willingly marry Indira.

The ceremony continued with the substitution of grooms, Singh and Indira together participating in the varmala ceremony, after which the pandit, officiating the ceremony, recited the mantras and asked the new couple to take the seven pheras, a ritual in Hindu weddings in which the couple make several rounds around a sacred fire.

Kishore, meanwhile, had been rushed to the hospital, and when he regained consciousness, returned to find his fiancée already wed.

The Times of India reported that Kishore requested that Indira reconsider her decision, for fear that he wouldn't be able to face anyone after this ordeal. His relatives also interjected, and soon the scene turned violent, with plates and cutlery being used as weapons as guests aggressively tried to change Indira's mind.

The woman allegedly stood by her decision.

An FIR was later filed at the Milak police station in Rampur district by the groom's family, but it was reportedly withdrawn soon after.

A wedding punch-up was sparked when a bride opted to marry a guest instead after her husband-to-be had an epileptic fit during the ceremony.

Jugal Kishore, 25, and 23-year-old bride Indira were about to perform the traditional 'varmala' ceremony during their Hindu wedding, when he suddenly fell ill.

Kishore fell to the ground as he extended his arms to exchange garlands with his bride.

But Indira, angry that her family had not been told of Kishore's epilepsy, decided to marry one of her wedding guests instead...Harpal Singh, her sister's brother-in-law.

Singh and Indira exchanged garlands in the traditional way in front of the guests, as Kishore, was taken to a doctor for treatment.

When he returned to the wedding venue, he found that his wife-to-be was now married to someone else.

Kishore pleaded with Indira, to change her mind, but she stood firm - sparking a punch-up between guests, involving spoons, plates and dishes, the Times of India reports.

Police in Rampur district of India, said they had detained several people who were there at the wedding.

""Both families have amicably resolved the matter,"" an officer said.

""The complaints have been withdrawn. Kishore and his family have now returned in peace to Moradabad.""

RAMPUR: All was going well at the wedding ceremony of 25-year-old Jugal Kishore, a resident of Moradabad, and his 23-year-old bride Indira from Rampur. That's until the ""varmala"" ceremony, where the groom garlands his would-be wife, began.Just as he extended his arms to do that, Kishore had an epileptic fit, falling to the ground in front of the whole gathering.The young bride, angry that her family had been kept in the dark about Kishore’s medical condition, promptly changed her mind and announced that she would happily marry at the same ceremony a guest at the wedding, a man called Harpal Singh. The latter, incidentally, turned out to be her sister's brother-in-law.Singh, caught unawares and dressed in jeans and a leather jacket, fumbled for a moment before declaring he would willingly take Indira as his wife. This time the ""varmala"" was exchanged between Singh and Indira, which went off without any hitch, with the pandit reciting the mantras and asking the new couple to take the seven ""pheras"".Meanwhile, Kishore, who had been rushed to a doctor by his relatives, went back to the venue after he regained consciousness to see that his wife-to-be was now someone else's.Kishore pleaded with Indira, telling her that he would not be able to face friends and neighbours if he returned without her. His relatives, too, tried to intervene on his behalf. Where persuasion failed, violence was used — spoons, plates and dishes became weapons as wedding guests tried to force the bride to change her mind. But all in vain.

The Islamic State (ISIS) is harvesting organs of its victims to finance its terrorist army, the Iraqi ambassador to the United Nations said Tuesday.

“We have bodies. Come and examine them,” said Ambassador Mohamed Alhakim, referring to the U.N. Security Council. “It is clear they are missing certain parts.” Here is how he described bodies as missing kidneys and showing marks of surgical incisions:

When we discover mass graves, we look at the bodies. Some of those bodies are killed by bullets, some of them by knives. But when you find pieces of the back is [sic] missing and the kidneys is [sic] missing, you will wonder what it is.

His report reveals that the ISIS never fails to shock the world. He declared that the ISIS executed a dozen doctors in Mosul because they refused to cooperate to remove organs.

Alhakim is replacing outgoing ambassador Nikolay Mladenov, who told the Security Council, “It’s very clear that the tactics ISIS is using expand by the day.”

The ISIS controls territory that includes the airports in Mosul in Iraq and Aleppo in Syria, giving it the ability to ship human organs to traffickers.

He said IS has access to airports in Mosul and in the Syrian city of Aleppo, from which it could transport the illicit organs to international middlemen and buyers.

No less shocking is that the Western world is treating the report as if it did not know months ago that the Islamic State has resorted to harvesting human organs.

Al-Monitor reported last December 5:

The third funding source [besides oil sales and taxes on residents] was exposed by otolaryngologist Siruwan al-Mosuli. He said that lately he noticed unusual movement within medical facilities in Mosul. Arab and foreign surgeons were hired, but prohibited from mixing with local doctors. Information then leaked about organ selling. Surgeries take place within a hospital and organs are quickly transported through networks specialized in trafficking human organs. Mosuli said that the organs come from fallen fighters who were quickly transported to the hospital, injured people who were abandoned or individuals who were kidnapped.

The Western world, not least of all the Obama administration, chose not to disseminate the information in hopes of postponing the inevitable – a declaration of war on the ISIS.

IS is hiring foreign doctors to harvest organs in hospitals in Iraq and Syria

Islamic State has turned its hand to human organ trafficking to fund terror across the Middle East, it has been claimed.

The jihadist group has until now filled its $2million-a-year war chest from a variety of shadowy sources including oil production, human trafficking and drug smuggling.

But it was revealed today that it has been recruiting foreign doctors for months to harvest the internal organs not only from the bodies of their own dead fighters but also from living hostages - including children - snatched from minority communities in Iraq and Syria.

Lucrative: The terror organisation even set up a specialist organ-smuggling division whose sole responsibility is to sell human hearts, livers and kidneys on the lucrative international black market

Evil: The jihadist group has until now filled its $2million-a-year war chest through a variety of shadowy sources including oil production, human trafficking and drug smuggling.

The shocking news was revealed in a report by al-Monitor news website, citing an Iraqi ear, nose and throat doctor named Siruwan al-Mosuli.

He told the site that IS commanders have hired foreign doctors to run an extensive organ trafficking system from a hospital in the captured city of Mosul, northern Iraq, that is already beginning to generate huge profits.

It claims the terror organisation has even set up a specialist organ-smuggling division whose sole responsibility is to sell human hearts, livers and kidneys on the lucrative international black market.

The report went on: 'Surgeries take place within a hospital and organs are quickly transported through networks specialized in trafficking human organs. Mosuli said that the organs come from fallen fighters who were quickly transported to the hospital, injured people who were abandoned or individuals who were kidnapped.'

Most of the organs are then smuggled out of Syria and Iraq into neighboring countries like Saudi Arabia or Turkey where criminal gangs sell them on to shady buyers across the globe, the Assyrian International News Agency reported.

While organ harvesting may be the most shocking of IS' revenue streams, the report highlights a string of others that contribute to the group's $2million annual income.

One tactic is smuggling families and individuals into other countries. The report highlights one instance when a family paid ISIS over $8,000 per individual to sneak them into Turkey.

Drugs in Europe: IS' drug business has become so successful in recent months that the Russian Federal Drug Control Service claims that IS now supplies half of Europe's entire heroin market

Drug smuggling is another. Al Monitor's report claims that IS traffics Afghan heroin into Europe from the city of Nineveh, which the Russian Federal Drug Control Service (RFDCS) says is generating 'significant revenues.'

Its drug business has become so successful in recent months that the RFDCS claims that IS now supplies half of Europe's entire heroin market.

'The large-scale movement of Afghan heroin acts as an ongoing financial base aiding the functioning of the Islamic State, which secures huge profits by providing half of the total heroin supplied to Europe via destabilized Iraq and some African heroin, which is sent from Iraq to Europe,' the Russian Federal Drug Control Service issued in a statement.

Mohamed Alhakim claimed that dozens of bodies with surgical incisions and missing body parts have been found in shallow mass graves near ISIS stronghold Mosul over the past few weeks.

ISIS' horrifying trade in human organs, which was revealed by MailOnline last December, is just the latest way for the terrorist organisation to finance its activities, with other major sources of the group's $2 million-a-day income being the sale of oil, ransom payments, and smuggled antiques.

Speaking of ISIS' organ harvesting operations, Mr Alhakim said: 'We have bodies. Come and examine them. It is clear they are missing certain parts.'

He also said a dozen doctors have been 'executed' in Mosul for refusing to participate in organ harvesting.

Mr Alhakim briefed the UN Security Council on the overall situation in Iraq and accused ISIS of 'crimes of genocide' in targeting certain ethnic groups.

The outgoing UN envoy to Iraq, Nikolay Mladenov, also told the council that last month alone, 790 people were killed by terrorism and armed conflict in the country.

He also noted the increasing number of reports and allegations that IS is using organ harvesting as a financing method, but he said only that 'it's very clear that the tactics ISIL is using expand by the day'. He used an acronym for the group.

Making them rich: Mohamed Alhakim claimed that dozens of bodies with surgical incisions and missing body parts have been found in shallow mass graves near ISIS stronghold Mosul (pictured) over the past few weeks

Mr Mladenov said Iraq's most pressing goal is to win back the vast territory that ISIS has seized over the past year.

The Sunni militants currently controls around a third of both Iraq and neighbouring Syria and imposed its strict interpretation of Sharia law in its self-declared caliphate - subjecting a population of around four million people to a brutal campaign of rape and massacre.

'Especially worrying is the increasing number of reports of revenge attacks committed particularly against members of the Sunni community in areas liberated from ISIL control,' Mr Mladenov said, using an alternative acronym for the group known as ISIS in the West and Daesh in Arab nations.

The shocking news of ISIS trade in human organs was first revealed in a report by al-Monitor news website in December, citing an Iraqi ear, nose and throat doctor named Siruwan al-Mosuli.

He told the site that ISIS commanders hired foreign doctors to run an extensive organ trafficking system from a hospital in Mosul that is already beginning to generate huge profits.

The al-Monitor report also claims the terror organisation has even set up a specialist organ-smuggling division whose sole responsibility is to sell human hearts, livers and kidneys on the lucrative international black market.

'[Al-Mosuli] said that lately he noticed unusual movement within medical facilities in Mosul Arab and foreign surgeons were hired, but prohibited from mixing with local doctors,' the report's author wrote. 'Information then leaked about organ selling.'

IS LIBYAN BEACH EXECUTIONER AN AMERICAN? EXPERTS CLAIM ISIS JIHADI SPOKE WITH U.S. ACCENT Intelligence chiefs are investigating claims the Islamic State jihadi who led the executions of 21 Egyptians was an American recruit. The militant, who spoke English with a U.S. accent, appeared in a horrific video on Sunday showing the beheadings of a group of Coptic Christians on a beach in Libya. Brandishing a knife, he declares: 'All crusaders... the sea you have hidden Sheikh Osama bin Laden's body in, we swear to Allah we will mix it with your blood.' The men are then forced to lie face-down before they are beheaded simultaneously. U.S. officials are understood to be analysing the militant's facial features and speech patterns as has been done in the hunt for the British executioner known as Jihadi John, who has appeared in a number of beheading videos in Syria. Professor Erik Thomas, a linguistics expert at North Carolina State University, believes he 'sounds like an American' with some Arabic influence, based on some of word pronunciations.

One tactic is smuggling families and individuals into other countries. The report highlights one instance when a family paid ISIS over $8,000 per individual to sneak them into Turkey.

Drug smuggling is another. Al Monitor's report claims that IS traffics Afghan heroin into Europe from the city of Nineveh, which the Russian Federal Drug Control Service (RFDCS) says is generating 'significant revenues.'

Yesterday it was revealed that militants fighting for ISIS in Syria are making millions of pounds selling ancient statues and mosaics to wealthy Westerners using a complex system of smugglers and middle men.

Looted from ancient buildings in ISIS strongholds, such as the group's de facto capital city Raqqa, the antiquities are up to 10,000-years-old and can exchange hands for more than $1 million each.

The most expensive items are covertly smuggled overseas - usually on the orders of wealthy Europeans - but there is also a lucrative trade in less historically important objects, which often find their way into tourist shops and markets in neighbouring Lebanon and Turkey.

The trade in antiquities is one of ISIS' primary sources of funding, along with oil and ransom payments, and is estimated to fills the terrorists coffers with tens of millions of pounds every year.

The finer points of ISIS trade in antiquities was uncovered in an investigation by the BBC."

According to data, there are two funding sources: internal and external. The latter includes a wide variety of funding schemes, including through medical facilities, oil and human trafficking mafias. According to sources in Mosul, the money supplied internally is allocated to local and foreign fighters, to encourage them to join up and continue fighting. IS took control of Mosul in June and then expanded in August to control large swaths of the country.

Residents of Mosul say that the sale of oil extracted from wells controlled by the organization in both Iraq and Syria has provided a sustained source of funding. The organization also opened trade canals through Kurdish [territories in] Iraq and Turkey, with the help of Kurdish, Turkish and Iranian traders.

In addition to oil sales, a secondary source of funding stems from the imposition of royalties on residents in IS territories. Members of the organization collect 50,000 dinars [$41.60] from each family as service and protection fees. The amount doubles for families whose sons did not join IS. One of the prominent tribal figures in Nineveh province, Sheikh Mohammad Abu Thayyab, said, “The IS gangs imposed 50,000 dinars worth of royalties on every family if one of their sons did not join these terrorists.”

Sources in the city say that oil prices have skyrocketed. The price of gas tanks used for cooking has reached 75,000 dinars, [about $62] while coal oil is sold at 5,000 dinars a liter [$4.16]. Meanwhile, the price of food has quadrupled.

The third funding source was exposed by otolaryngologist Siruwan al-Mosuli. He said that lately he noticed unusual movement within medical facilities in Mosul. Arab and foreign surgeons were hired, but prohibited from mixing with local doctors. Information then leaked about organ selling. Surgeries take place within a hospital and organs are quickly transported through networks specialized in trafficking human organs. Mosuli said that the organs come from fallen fighters who were quickly transported to the hospital, injured people who were abandoned or individuals who were kidnapped.

He said that organ sales yield large profits. A specialized mafia is engaged in these operations, in addition to medical institutions working in other countries. Without coordination among these parties, such a trade cannot be sustained, he said. According to the Office of the High Commissioner for Human Rights (OHCHR), the organization sells bodies and organs of injured people they arrest.

The fourth source of funding is transforming the city of Nineveh, adjacent to Turkish borders, into a new center for drug trafficking. The Russian Federal Drug Control Service said IS was gaining significant revenues by smuggling and marketing Afghan heroin, which is sent from Iraq to Europe.

“The large-scale movement of Afghan heroin acts as an ongoing financial base, aiding the functioning of the Islamic State, which secures huge profits by providing half of the total heroin supplied to Europe via destabilized Iraq and some African countries,” the Russian body said in a statement.

For its part, the Times of London exposed a human trafficking network established by IS in Mosul, where women and children were sold for money. This also constitutes a funding source for the fighters. According to the newspaper, women and children of Yazidi, Christian and other minority backgrounds are also sold through a networking hub in Syria’s Raqqa.

A report by OHCHR confirmed that more than 25,000 women and children have been imprisoned, sexually violated and sold by IS.

The sixth funding source is human smuggling rings, especially for families who wish to emigrate to other countries. One family reached Turkey after reportedly paying $8,000 for each individual that escaped.

Livestock seized by IS during the occupation of Yazidi, Turkmen and Shiite villages has also been smuggled. According to Ali Abdel Razzak, the majority of the residents in these villages worked in large-scale livestock ranching. So far it has not been established how much IS members seized as spoils of war when the villagers fled.

When it comes to foreign funding, the organization has developed schemes that are difficult to uncover, despite intensive local and international monitoring. One such method, however, uses established trading routes. The organization has networks tasked with collecting donations from wealthy individuals under the pretext of supporting jihad. According to some sources in the trading industry, products are sold in the markets in IS at lower prices than within the countries of origin, a discrepancy that points toward money laundering."

In the order was a Quarter Pounder with cheese they had bought for a friend.

He never turned up, instead asking the pair to keep it safe for when he was in the city next.

Now 20 years later, it remains under lock and key and bears an uncanny resemblance to its far fresher contemporaries.

""We're pretty sure it's the oldest burger in the world,"" Mr Dean said.

""It started off as a joke, you know we told our friend we'd hold his burger for him but he never turned up and before we knew it six months had passed.

""The months became years and now, 20 years later, it looks the same as it did the day we bought it, perfectly preserved in its original wrapping.""

The pair showed off the mould-free specimen on The Project tonight, teasing that they might take a bite after all these years in the name of charity.

But common sense prevailed when the show’s hosts protested, and they left the decades-old meal for another day.

When Eduard Neetz and Casey Dean were 13 an 14 respectively, they took a trip to their local McDonald's restaurant in Adelaide to grab some food after a party.

The men picked up an extra for their mate Jono who never showed. That was 20 years ago.

Jono told the boys to hold on to his meal until next time he came to visit as a joke, and 'he hasn't been back yet', the men told The Project.

They showed off their prized possession on The Project on Monday evening

Eduard and Casey have kept the burger under lock and key for the past two decades, and though it looks as though it was picked up at a Maccas just moments ago, the Quarter Pounder is 'rock hard'.

'It's rock hard, absolutely solid as a brick' the friends said while showing off their prized possession.

After all that time kept behind closed doors, Casey told the program it was time to 'free the burger' and boys have released a song on iTunes dedicated to their 'Senior Burger'.

'As opposed to a Junior Burger', Casey joked.

They have now released a song in honour of 'Senior Burger' with all proceeds going to Beyond Blue

All proceeds raised from sales of their song go directly to BeyondBlue and Carry Bickmore soon asked the pair how much she would have to donate for them to sample the burger.

Despite all The Project hosts trying to get Eduard and Casey to take a bite out of the age-old snack and the men playing along, quite quickly they flat out refused.

A video which supposedly proves that TBS speeds up its Seinfeld reruns by 7.5 percent in order to squeeze in two extra minutes of commercials has been online for a few months, but over the weekend it recirculated through Reddit, gathering a lot more attention. YouTube user ""ltclassics"" explains that the episode in the upper right hand corner is a recent TBS syndicated Seinfeld rerun. The episode on the lower right hand corner was supposedly a decade-old digitally recorded Seinfeld rerun.

So. Let's talk about efficiency. In the last two decades, American productivity has improved at striking levels, with very little benefit for the American worker. Some of this has to do with automation, and a lot of it has to do with the spread of personal computers. As the workplace is measured, re-measured, and examined to the point of indecency—look at the conditions Amazon warehouse employees have to work under—efficiency is slowly chipping away at our lives.

Even if this Seinfeld thing turns out to be a hoax—I am hedging my bets here, because I do not own a stopwatch or rent cable television—it's such a great symbol for America in the 21st century. You can picture some stuffed suit in middle-management watching the same Seinfeld episode sped up to various percentages—3.5, 10, 12.5—to see how the jokes land. They probably focus-tested specific jokes in midwestern malls in order to find the razor's edge of comedy, the exact line before Jerry Seinfeld turns into Alvin and the Chipmunks and the timing of all the jokes is ruined. Quantifiably it's the same show, but in reality it's stretched to just before the breaking point, analyzed and efficiency-tested in order to cram more salable real estate into a lot that refuses to change size. The life is being sucked out of it, one decimal point at a time."

They’ve started new episodes during the credits of the previous episode. They’ve plastered ads at the bottom of the screen in the middle of the episode. Now they’re playing dirty by speeding through the episodes just to get in a few more minutes of precious ad time.

An intrepid Seinfeld fan [via reddit] noticed that everyone’s favorite show about nothing seemed to be running slightly faster. To check, he compared the airing of a recent episode to a digital recording of the same episode from ten years ago on the same hardware. He found that the show was running 7.5% faster, which amounts to freeing up two minutes of ad time.

Watch the video below. Can we finally get all of Seinfeld on a streaming service?

The subtle speeding up can slice a couple of minutes from a 22 minute sitcom with little noticeable difference–and broadcasters can plug in two more minutes of commercials per half hour! It’s a last ditch effort, perhaps, to extract money out of a dying media delivery system before streaming obliterates the advertising model. TBS does it with Seinfeld reruns (see below) and worldwide it happens all the time–from the BBC to India.

But is that all there is to it–trying to make more money? Actually many viewers point out that TV shows (and everything else) move faster now in the age of the 6-second Vine. The speeding up actually helps the content itself seem more contemporary. Here’s one commenter: “Honestly, shows move a lot faster now and the sped up version feels a little more updated than the original slower version. But who even watches actual TV anymore?

The nomenclature seems to have developed around the concept of IVTC filters, since the general ""best practise"" technique in computer circles is to undo any field or frame repetition in order to restore the original progressive frames in any video. Originally Posted byThe nomenclature seems to have developed around the concept of IVTC filters, since the general ""best practise"" technique in computer circles is to undo any field or frame repetition in order to restore the original progressive frames in any video.

Quote: As such, any video with an altered framerate is expected to undergo IVTC to restore the progressive frames and decimation to remove duplicate ones, whereas material that is truly interlaced is more difficult to decomb.

Quote: Since you seem knowledgeable in this area, one thing I've yet to understand is what happens with US dramas shown at 720p60. Material on stations that broadcast 1080i60 can be restored through IVTC to achieve 1080p24 frames, but if the source is already progressive, I don't know if the frames are simply duplicated (rather than the fields), which would then mean that only decimation would be needed to restore the original framerate, or if there is a separate way to IVTC progressive content to restore its original framerate.

Yes - I think because 24fps film content that has been telecined to video in the US has 3:2 pull-down that is introduced by the telecine, the addition of 3:2 pulldown (the pulldown refers to the physical act of pulling down the film during blanking on early telecines which didn't employ continuous scanning) has become intertwined with the telecine process. However 3:2 repetition can be added to 24p video, which has never been near a telecine, and in Europe we use 2:2 pull-down, where there are no duplicate fields to detect and remove/cope with.There's so much misinformation and poor explanation of broadcast video - and in particular interlacing and de-interlacing - it gets a bit annoying. Particularly when a phrase appears that is based on a standard broadcast production process (Telecine-ing is the act of transferring film to video using a telecine machine) is used to mean something else (removing 3:2 pull-down/repetition which may or may not have been caused by a telecine)Yes - though in 50i/60i they are both forms of de-interlacing. 24p/25p content with 3:2/2:2 can be restored losslessly with the right de-interlacing algorithm, whereas native interlaced content will always be ambiguous (there is spectrum folding in the vertical spatial and temporal domains that cannot be undone - though some good guesswork can be made) Obviously native interlaced 50i/60i content should be de-interlaced to 50p/60p not 25p/30p if you want to keep the full motion (i.e. temporal resolution) of the original. How you do this depends on the quality you want to achieve (particularly the vertical resolution) and the processing power you have. The best de-interlacers will use stuff like Phase Correlation Motion Compensation to detect which areas are moving, and in what direction, to create the ""missing"" fields that need to be created to generate a decent 50p or 60p result.(These processes aren't new, and in fact have been an issue in broadcast production since the 80s. High quality DVEs (Digital Video Effects devices) used in production control rooms, that zoom and shrink, rotate, page peel etc. pictures have used realtime de-interlacing to generate the highest vertical resolution pictures they can when you zoom into a live native interlaced source. If you process fields individually (which lower cost DVEs do) you end up with noticeably poorer quality results (particularly when you enlarge a picture))They're both very similar. In interlaced 3:2 you are looking for the repeated field (which will be alternating between field 1 and field 2) in a pair of source frames which you simply discard to give you 2:2 (which you can de-interlace to 1:1 with a simple field-merge - aka weave). You obviously need to continuously detect the field duplication - as 3:2 content edited in the video domain could break the 3:2 cadence (i.e. you could end up with edits that break the repeated 3:2:3:2:3:2 pattern) by comparing fields and where two are identical you discard one.The same techniques can be done in the 3:2 60p domain, but in this case you also need to detect the repeated pairs of frames as well as the repeated triple frames as you need to go from 3:2 to 1:1 without any de-interlacing. You are still detecting and discarding repeated images - but you have 3 repeated frames rather than 1 repeated field to detect per pair of source frames. With a 3:2 regular cadence 24p within 60p you detect 2 repeated frames followed by 1 repeated frame.Some compression systems optionally also allow you to flag 3:2 sources so you don't have to send redundant content (though repeated fields/frames compress quite well) so rather than sending the duplicate fields or frames, you flag them for duplication in the receiver. If you have access to the compressed stream you can detect the flags and thus recreate the 24p source without having to run any content-based repeated field/frame detection."

Both Fisher and Ford recently reprised their iconic roles for Star Wars: The Force Awakens.

In her new memoir, The Princess Diarist, Fisher writes that she began an affair at the age of 19 with the then-33-year-old Ford after a birthday party for Star Wars creator George Lucas, and their fling continued for three months during filming, reports Entertainment Tonight.

""It was so intense,"" Fisher told People magazine. ""It was Han and Leia during the week, and Carrie and Harrison during the weekend. I was so inexperienced, but I trusted something about him. He was kind.""

After spending their first night together, ""Fisher was wracked with self-doubt"", says the magazine.

""I looked over at Harrison. A hero's face - a few strands of hair fell over his noble, slightly furrowed brow,"" she writes. ""How could you ask such a shining specimen of a man to be satisfied with the likes of me?""

But the actress has appeared to go back on some aspects of the affair in a series of tweets in which she describes the excerpts as ""out of context"".

Rumor has it that director J.J. Abrams is getting fed up with the constant plot and image leaks, The Telegraph said quoting yet other industry sources. Disney has, for its part, started to go after those illegally releasing content from the film, when it asked a judge to subpoena a website that displayed a blurred image of what appeared to be a ""Sith Lord"" last week, the same report stated.

There are apparently very real fears that the story may become public knowledge even before the movie actually hits theaters before yearend. So, advancing the release date may be the director's idea of averting a potentially costly, not to mention embarrassing catastrophe, by mounting a Death Star-level pre-emptive strike on spoilers!

With a quick search of You Tube, fans can watch a one and a half minute ""official trailer"" supposedly released by Disney last November. This particular video clip begins with a helmetless Storm Trooper wandering about what could possibly be the desert of planet Tatooine. However, there could also be dozens of unofficial material floating about the Internet today!

The big question, therefore, is exactly when will the Force Awaken? Speaking at the Visual Effects Society Awards 2015 recently, director Abrams was quoted as saying that he is pushing for a summer release date for Star Wars Episode 7, according to MoviePilot.

They happen all the time in China, for example. While they undoubtedly happen in the United States, people don’t brag about them. At least they didn’t.

It’s hard to believe this is real, but according to the website “Injustice Stories,” a woman named Lana, a self-described feminist, boasted of aborting her baby because it was a boy. Then, after making that declaration, claims to be shocked that some people might have a problem with that.

Lana, who only uses her first name, appears to be a child of privilege. She boasts of involvement in “fighting for women’s rights” being all-consuming, “even to the point of eschewing a career.” Yet that lack of a career hasn’t stopped her from travelling to “many different places” to continue that “fight.

She tells the story of a flight to an Occupy Wall Street event in San Francisco where she screamed “Assault” because the man sitting next to her said “B******* like you need to learn their place.”

Putting the unlikeliness of that exchange aside, Lana then demanded to be moved to another seat. That’s when she was told the only empty seats were “both back in economy.” At which point she demanded the man be moved.

When the flight attendants came running, one of whom was male, they refused to force the man to move because he hadn’t done anything. Lana, regretfully, relented and, in tears, moved herself.

The encounter left her “having felt as though I had been verbally and emotionally raped.”

That flight, according to Lana, left her forever changed. “By the time we landed, my outlook had changed, I could no longer depend on men to be an ally of the cause,” she wrote.

Lana was pregnant at the time, and thought she “had a good idea” who the father, or as she puts it, “the donator” happened to be. She was convinced she was having a girl because, well, she wanted a girl. Or at least a baby with a vagina, the “gender” part would be up to the child. “I had already started buying gender neutral clothing since I did not want outside influences affecting what gender she would ultimately become,” she writes.

After researching all-girl daycares and schools with the plan to make sure that “No man will be around to hurt her progress, no boys there to demean her or call her names,” Lana got horrible news from her doctor – her baby had a penis.

She spent the next two days in fit of crying rage. How could this happen to her? She says, “My home became my prison and my fetus became my warden.”

Within a few days she had aborted the baby. “My body’s betrayal was no more, I was free, and for the first time since the airplane incident, I felt strong,” Lana claims. “I had done something positive, something that would actually make a difference, something good.”

Lana informs readers that she is now the mother of “a beautiful 1 year old female who will hopefully grow up to be just as strong and driven as her mother.”

She ends her post with:

I stand by my decision to abort my baby because it was a male. I don’t hate men, I hate the patriarchy, what men, and even some women, turn into, I wasn’t going to let that happen with my offspring. The chances were greater that it would with a male, it was unacceptable. If the curse returns, I would do the exact same thing all over again.

The backlash was immediate, and harsh. Lana, much to her shock, was on the receiving end of negative comments and even death threats.

At the request of the editors of the website, Lana returned to answer critics. She was as unrepentant the second time as she was the first.

She starts:

I cannot believe some of the emails that have been forwarded to me, do people really exist who want to see me dead because of what I chose to do with my own body? Those are the minds of mentally disturbed individuals.

She then offers advice to those who have a problem with her proud proclamation:

I suspect that many of you reading this will be the kind of people who are sending emails from their mom’s basement, leaving comments on here and on social media websites as you degrade mentally more and more while sitting on your crusty computer chairs. Do everyone a favor: GROW UP!

This charming woman then claims not to hold animosity toward anyone. “I find it hard to hate anybody, their faults are not their own, but usually rather the product of an environment or social circle they have been exposed to,” she writes.

In the end, Lana remains Lana, the spoiled, selfish brat she appears to have always been. “I beg most of you, for your own good, take a look at yourself and decide right now if you want to spend the rest of your life angry on the internet, or if you want to fight for a woman’s right to do what she wants with her body.”"	Feminist Aborts Baby For Being A Boy, Shocked People Don’t Approve	2015-02-09 00:00:00	[]	['aborts', 'men', 'shocked', 'claims', 'man', 'baby', 'dont', 'lana', 'hate', 'happen', 'male', 'gender', 'flight', 'feminist', 'approve', 'boy']	"It’s hard to believe this is real, but according to the website “Injustice Stories,” a woman named Lana, a self-described feminist, boasted of aborting her baby because it was a boy.

A ""feminist"" blogger has provoked outrage after claiming she aborted her baby because it was a boy.

The author, known only as Lena, said in her blog that she was ready to have a child but because of her ""bad experiences with men"" she had an abortion when she discovered the baby's sex, the Metro has reported.

In the blog she says she found out she was pregnant in 2012 and describes the father as ‘the donator’.

She also claims to be a feminist, fighting women’s rights ""to the point of eschewing a career"".

The woman wrote when she found out she was having a boy, she was ""in shock, I started crying, weeping at the thought of what I was about to curse the world with"".

She continued: ""A few days later, I went in for the procedure, as it was fairly later in my pregnancy, I was aware there were certain risks, but it went off without a hitch...I felt strong. I had done something positive, something that would actually make a difference, something good, even though as I would find out, many others wouldn’t see it that way.""

The blogger says she went on to give birth to a ""beautiful"" baby girl.

She says: ""I have endured a lot regarding my first pregnancy, but I don’t care. Sometimes, even allies will turn on you, but I don’t care.

""I stand by my decision to abort my baby because it was a male.

""I don’t hate men, I hate the patriarchy, what men, and even some women, turn into, I wasn’t going to let that happen with my offspring. The chances were greater that it would with a male, it was unacceptable.

""If the curse returns, I would do the exact same thing all over again.""

But her comments have triggered a backlash online and speculation as to whether her comments are genuine.

Sex selection abortion is expected to be made officially illegal in the UK under an amendment to the Serious Crime Bill, which has the backing of 70 MPs.

The bill has completed its committee stage in the Commons and is intended to clarify the law on sex selective abortion.

It also contains new measures to combat domestic violence and female genital mutilation (FGM).

An alliance of faith and women's groups representing Muslims, Sikhs and Hindus has backed the amendment and said ""not enough is being done"" to stop the practice, the Daily Telegraph reported today."

A blogger has claimed that she aborted her baby when she discovered it was a boy because of bad experiences with men.

In her blog, the author, known only as Lena, wrote that she found out she was pregnant in 2012 and describes the father as ‘the donator’.

Describing the pregnancy as a ‘diagnosis’ she said that she was ready to have a child.

She also claims to be a feminist, fighting women’s rights ‘to the point of eschewing a career’.

But from her writing – if what she’s saying is actually true – she appears to be something of a misandrist.

She wrote: ‘One of the more prominent themes that I saw in these places was that men generally would look down on us, refuse to help us, or hardly even lend an ear so that we could air our grievances.’

So when she went for an ultrasound on the baby and it turned out to be a boy, she reacted with the man-hating bile that the rest of her blog seems to follow.

This was her reaction: ‘I was in shock, I started crying, weeping at the thought of what I was about to curse the world with.’

MISANDRY The dislike of, contempt for, or ingrained prejudice against men (i.e. the male sex).

And the lack of perspective just got worse: ‘Crying, sobbing, uncontrollable weeping, mental anguish the likes of which may only be experienced by those who have had their lives destroyed by war, I was a refugee, and my home was my refugee camp, an unfamiliar place that was just… sheltering me.’

Thankfully after mourning for three days at the thought of bringing another ‘monster’ into the world, she regained her mental health.

So she popped along to an abortion clinic and had the foetus removed.

I now know that these are “adults” who just cannot handle the fact that I have the right to make choices, and that these choices ultimately hardly even affect them.

1/17/15 – Editor’s note: Due to the large number of interview requests, I have extended an invitation to the author to post her response to the comments and general negative feelings towards her. I will post an update as soon as she responds.

In the spring of 2012, I found out that I was pregnant. I had a good idea who the donator was, but money wasn’t really an issue, and I knew that I would be a good mother-like figure for the child by myself. I have always believed in the right for all women to have a choice in terminating their pregnancy, but when I confirmed the diagnosis about a month into into it, I decided that I WAS ready to have this child.

My journey has taken me to many different places fighting for women’s rights and carrying the banner of the Feminist Movement, even to the point of eschewing a career. One of the more prominent themes that I saw in these places was that men generally would look down on us, refuse to help us, or hardly even lend an ear so that we could air our grievances. This didn’t surprise me, the patriarchy has been well entrenched since the dawn of time, but here I was, here I am, ready to change it.

One of the more alarming incidents happened while I was on my way to San Francisco to participate in an Occupy Wall Street rally. I sat down in my seat on the plane, which happened to be extra full for that day, and a particularly well dressed man happened to be sitting in the seat beside me, in the aisle. After takeoff, he asked me what I was going to San Francisco for, while I generally wouldn’t talk to a man sitting next to me on an airplane, I told him I was going to the OWS rally.

The man literally scoffed when I spoke those words and leaned in and quietly said to me “B****** like you need to learn their place”. Stunned, I screamed “ASSAULT!” while other passengers looked at us, the woman across the aisle from him immediately told him to get away from me, but not 5 seconds passed before a flight attendant had rushed over to intervene.

As I explained to the flight attendant what had happened and I demanded to move seats, I was told that there were only 2 other open seats available, both back in Economy.

*Trigger warning* – Extreme patriarchy

By this time, a male flight attendant was on the scene and I told him to have the man moved. The woman-hater just laughed as the flight attendant continued to press me on if he made any physical contact with me. For a moment, I contemplated bending the truth in order to get the woman-hater away from me. His words had violated both my feelings, and my trust, perhaps as much of a violation as actual physical touch. In the end, I confirmed that no physical contact was made, to which both flight attendants told me they couldn’t make him move.

I was flabbergasted, and then betrayed as they recommended that I move to one of the empty seats. This left me in tears. I knew the only way to get away was to move seats so I did so tearfully and having felt as though I had been verbally and emotionally raped.

By the time we landed, my outlook had changed, I could no longer depend on men to be an ally of the cause.

As spring turned into summer and my belly started to grow, my mind ran wild with the thoughts of teaching my daughter from a young age tolerance and feminist ideals. Choosing the right all-girls daycare, then elementary school, all so that she could grow up and thrive in an environment where women are told that they can do anything that they want to do. No man will be around to hurt her progress, no boys there to demean her or call her names.

I had already started buying gender neutral clothing since I did not want outside influences affecting what gender she would ultimately become. My research on nannies one day came to an abrupt end when my cell phone alarm went off – time for my 5 month appointment. These early appointments had gone well enough, my baby was progressing in a healthy manner.

Today, my doctor, who I will call “Sandy” did an ultrasound and everything appeared to be fine. “Would you like to know the gender?” Sandy asked. I thought to myself “That machine is an ultrasound, not a crystal ball, you couldn’t tell me the gender of my baby even if you wanted to”

“Sure” was my response.

“It’s a boy”…..

……

“What?” I managed to sputter. Sandy then showed me on the ultrasound how exactly my body had betrayed me even worse than the misogynistic suit jockey on the airplane so many months before. I was in shock, I started crying, weeping at the thought of what I was about to curse the world with.

On my way home, my driver asked if I was ok and if I needed anything. “JUST STOP RIGHT HERE” I yelled. Deciding to walk the 4 blocks back home. My home became my prison and my fetus became my warden the next 48 hours. Crying, sobbing, uncontrollable weeping, mental anguish the likes of which may only be experienced by those who have had their lives destroyed by war, I was a refugee, and my home was my refugee camp, an unfamiliar place that was just….sheltering me.

By the third day, I started regaining some of my mental strength and knew what I had to do. I couldn’t bring another monster into the world. We already have enough enemies as it is. It didn’t matter that I would be raising a son, he would still come into contact with boys, men, perhaps even the suit jockey who would inevitably twist his carefully constructed upbringing with their kindness. He would think “These men aren’t so bad, why would mom say that they are holding me down?”

Not all men are bad, my driver showed genuine concern for my well-being that day and I may have taken my anger out on him. That may have been uncalled for. But I knew what I had to do.

A few days later, I went in for the procedure, as it was fairly later in my pregnancy, I was aware there were certain risks, but it went off without a hitch. My body’s betrayal was no more, I was free, and for the first time since the airplane incident, I felt strong. I had done something positive, something that would actually make a difference, something good, even though as I would find out, many others wouldn’t see it that way.

Today, I have a beautiful 1 year old female who will hopefully grow up to be just as strong and driven as her mother. I have endured a lot regarding my first pregnancy, but I don’t care. Sometimes, even allies will turn on you, but I don’t care.

I stand by my decision to abort my baby because it was a male.

I don’t hate men, I hate the patriarchy, what men, and even some women, turn into, I wasn’t going to let that happen with my offspring. The chances were greater that it would with a male, it was unacceptable.

You know you’re in trouble when Tom Brokaw is out for your blood.

NBC’s most revered journalist is furious that Brian Williams is still in the anchor chair after he sheepishly admitted he hadn’t traveled on a helicopter hit by enemy fire.

“Brokaw wants Williams’ head on a platter,” an NBC source said. “He is making a lot of noise at NBC that a lesser journalist or producer would have been immediately fired or suspended for a false report.”

On Wednesday, Williams, 55, acknowledged that he had repeatedly said he was aboard a chopper that had been hit by a rocket-propelled grenade during a 2003 reporting trip to Iraq, when he was actually safely traveling in a different aircraft.

Brokaw, 74, was still the “Nightly News” anchor when Williams came back from his Iraq expedition — and an insider said he knew the story Williams later spouted was bunk.

“Tom Brokaw and [former NBC News President] Steve Capus knew this was a false story for a long time and have been extremely uncomfortable with it,” the source said.

NBC News execs had counseled him to stop telling the tale.

Williams still took the anchor’s seat for his “Nightly News” broadcast Thursday evening — and was working at 30 Rock all day despite calls for his dismissal. He didn’t address the issue during the broadcast.

“He is not going to be suspended or reprimanded in any way. He has the full support of NBC News,” a network source said.

Many of Williams’ colleagues believe his claim that he simply “conflated” two versions of what happened in 2003.

“There have been meetings about it all day. They are taking it very seriously,” the NBC source said.

“But we believe that Brian’s apology on the air speaks for himself. He admitted over time he conflated the events.”

NBC brass hasn’t been talking to lower-level employees about the situation, leaving people in a panic, the insider said.

“NBC bosses don’t understand how serious this is. Nobody in a leadership position is talking to the troops. Nobody has addressed it,” the source said.

One longtime NBC employee who has worked with Williams on several occasions had a few dirty words to describe the celebrated anchor, calling him a “real pompous piece of s–t.”

“He’s an a–hole,” he fumed. “He’s not a journalist. He’s a reader.”

“Oh, the fireworks that are going off inside,” he said. “It’s embarrassing. He’s the face on NBC. He’s a liar.

“Everyone knew it.”

On Friday, Brokaw responded to reports that he wanted Williams axed.

“I have neither demanded nor suggested Brian be fired,” Brokaw said in an email to The Huffington Post. “His future is up to Brian and NBC News executives.”

AFP An Egyptian man has reportedly delivered a financial blow to the Islamic State (Isis) by becoming ""emir"" of its alms department and then fleeing with almost one million US dollars to Turkey.

Abu Obeida (or Ubaidah) al-Masri, secretary of the Zakat (charity) bureau and treasurer of IS Syrian branch, eloped with the funds amounting to ""billion Syrian pounds"" which have been collected by his department in Deir Ez Zour province, Al-Masry Al-Youm newspaper reported, citing Syrian Press Center news site.

According to some rumours, IS militants have issued an order to stop recruiting Egyptian jihadists because of the incident.

The claim could not be independently verified by IBTimes UK.

IS imposed a Zakat tax on merchants and industrialists in the areas under its control in the north-eastern countryside of Aleppo.

The Syrian Observatory for Human Rights said Isis ""has forced the merchants and industrialists to pay 2.5% of each sale.""

The merchants told the militants that they are already paying money to the poor families, but IS responded that those families should report to the Zakat bureau instead.

Hunter would not say which part of ""Unforgiven"" the king quoted, but noted it was where Eastwood's character describes how he is going to deliver his retribution. There is a scene in the picture in which Eastwood's character, William Munny, says, ""Any man I see out there, I'm gonna kill him.

“He mentioned ‘Unforgiven’ and he mentioned Clint Eastwood, and he actually quoted a part of the movie,” Republican Rep. Duncan Hunter Jr., a Marine Corps veteran of two tours in Iraq and one in Afghanistan, who was in the meeting with the king, told Fox News Channel in an interview aired Wednesday.

King Abdullah had to cut his U.S. trip short after hearing the news that Moaz al-Kasasbeh was burned alive.

During a private session with members of the House Armed Services Committee lawmakers, the king expressed his anger by citing American movie icon Clint Eastwood.

“He said there is going to be retribution like ISIS hasn’t seen,” said the Marine Corps veteran.

However, Hunter would not say which part of “Unforgiven” the king quoted, but noted it was where Eastwood’s character describes how he is going to deliver his retribution.

“He’s angry,” Hunter said of King Abdullah. “They’re starting more sorties tomorrow than they’ve ever had. They’re starting tomorrow. And he said, ‘The only problem we’re going to have is running out of fuel and bullets.’”

“He’s ready to get it on,” Hunter added. “He really is. It reminded me of how we were after 9/11. We were ready to give it to them.”

Hunter also said that the lawmakers and King Abdullah did not make any mention of U.S. President Barack Obama.

He added: “ISIS is now going to regret this … because King Abdullah is not Barack Obama.”

The Jordan Times reported that thousands of Jordanians gathered on Wednesday to receive King Abdullah.

The Jordan times also reported that mosques and churches around the Kingdom held prayers on Wednesday in memory of al-Kasasbeh.

Meanwhile, a Jordanian government official on Thursday denied social media reports that King Abdullah flew missions against ISIS earlier on Thursday.

She got mad after a video of them having sex went viral.

The girl apparently cannot be named as she is under age. According to African Eye News Service (AENS), on January 17, after discovering a pornographic video of her and her boyfriend having sex had gone viral online, she went to a tavern in Cork village, close to Hazyview in Mpumalanga, South Africa where her boyfriend was drinking with friends.

South Africa – Girl poured acid on boyfriend Humphrey Khoza’s penis after he released sex tape | Metro News http://t.co/FhP8qLIBw4? — Mark Nixon (@markalannixon) February 3, 2015

Metro reports on arrival at the tavern the South African schoolgirl immediately doused Humphrey Khoza’s genitals with battery acid. Khoza himself said everything happened in the blink of an eye

“Everything happened in a blink of an eye because I saw her when she was coming with a bottle but I didn’t realize that she was carrying acid. She just angrily called me a dog.” “She asked how in the world I could have done such an evil thing to her. It was only then that I realized that she was talking about the video that I took while we were having sex.”

According to Khoza, the pair had been dating since December and while they agreed to have sex, the girl was unaware that he was filming it using his laptop computer, but he never meant to show it to anyone else.

“I did not intend to show anyone the video and I still don’t know how it got onto social media.”

According to Times Live, AENS has seen the offending video to verify the claim. In it Khoza can be seen pushing the girl, wearing her school uniform, on to the bed. They report that she didn’t appear to notice they were being filmed while having sex, but that it was consensual.

Khoza did say that he was lucky to be alive, despite the fact that his penis will never work again. He apparently now has to urinate through a tube and is facing further surgery.

Even though he has been advised to press charges against the girl, the South African man doesn’t see any point.

“Even if I press charges it is useless because it won’t bring back my manhood. Her being in jail will just ruin her future because she is still young and I do not have the energy to attend courts.”

Hazyview - A 17-year-old Mpumalanga girl who poured acid on her boyfriend's genitals to punish him for distributing a pornographic video he made of her without her knowledge, has blamed anger for her actions. “I never intended to kill his penis. I was just angry and all I wanted was to make him feel the pain I was feeling,” she told a Sapa correspondent. “I heard about the video from one of my classmates and I thought that they were joking, but then I saw the video myself and lost my mind.” The girl, whose name is known to a Sapa correspondent but cannot be published because she is a minor, attacked Humphrey Khoza, 25, with battery acid while he was drinking beer with friends at a tavern in Cork village, near Hazyview, on January 17. She said Khoza had tricked her because she was not aware he was not using a condom or that he was filming them.

“I had to do something to show him that I was angry and wanted to hurt him so that he can see that he messed with the wrong girl,” she said.

She searched in her father's tools for a wheel spanner she could use to teach Khoza a lesson.

“While I was searching I came across an old acid bottle. I took it and went straight to his regular drinking place and when I got there I became angrier. I didn't hesitate to pour the acid on him,” she said.

Khoza, who had no problem with his name being published, but asked not to be photographed, said he had been dating the girl since December.

“Everything happened in a blink of an eye because I saw her when she was coming with a bottle, but I didn't realise that she was carrying acid. She just angrily called me a dog,” he said.

“She asked how in the world I could have done such an evil thing to her. It was only then that I realised that she was talking about the video that I took while we were having sex.”

In the video, Khoza is seen pushing the girl, in her school uniform, onto a bed. He added that the sex was consensual.

“We agreed to have sex, but she was not aware that I was filming the sex using my laptop computer. I did not intend to show anyone the video and I still don't know how it got onto social media,” he said.

The remorseful Khoza added that although his penis would never work again due to the damage caused by the acid, he was lucky to be alive.

He said he was advised to press charges against the girl, but does not see the point.

“Even if I press charges it is useless because it won't bring back my manhood. Her being in jail will just ruin her future because she is still young and I do not have the energy to attend courts,” said Khoza.

He now has to urinate through a tube and has to undergo surgery.

The girl said she was also considering pressing charges relating to his creation of pornography.

According to the Film and Publications Act, child pornography is defined as “any image or any description of a person, real or simulated, who is, or who is depicted or described as being, under the age of 18 years, engaged in sexual conduct”.

When asked for comment Calcutta police said they would open a case if either of the two came forward.

The remorseful Khoza added that although his penis would never work again due to the damage caused by the acid, he was lucky to be alive.

He said he was advised to press charges against the girl, but does not see the point.

""Even if I press charges it is useless because it won't bring back my manhood. Her being in jail will just ruin her future because she is still young and I do not have the energy to attend courts,"" said Khoza.

He now has to urinate through a tube and has to undergo surgery.

The girl said she was also considering pressing charges relating to his creation of pornography.

According to the Film and Publications Act, child pornography is defined as ""any image or any description of a person, real or simulated, who is, or who is depicted or described as being, under the age of 18 years, engaged in sexual conduct"".

An elementary school suspended a boy who arrived at school last week with what he alleged was a powerful ring that appears in J.R.R. Tolkien's 'The Hobbit' and 'The Lord of the Rings' fantasy books.

Aiden Steward was suspended from Kermit Elementary School in Kermit, Texas, over a Thursday incident, The New York Daily News reported.

While speaking to another boy, 9-year-old Steward said he would able to use the One Ring and turn the fellow student invisible, according to the newspaper.

Powerful: Aiden Steward was suspended from school after telling a boy he had the One Ring and could make a student become invisible, like in J.R.R. Tolkien's fantasy books

Speaking to The New York Daily News, father Jason Steward said 'It sounded unbelievable.'

The One Ring, as it is known, features in both Tolkien's prequel 'The Hobbit' as well as 'The Lord of the Rings.' At various points in the books, characters Bilbo Baggins and Frodo Baggins put on the ring to make it seem as if they have vanished into thin air.

'The Lord of the Rings' trilogy follows a group of characters that set to destroy the One Ring, since it can also be used to control other peoples and kingdoms.

Steward told The New York Daily News 'Kids act out movies that they see. When I watched Superman as a kid, I went outside and tried to fly.'

The newspaper reported that the Steward family recently viewed 'The Hobbit: The Battle of the Five Armies.' Peter Jackson directed film adaptations for both 'The Lord of the Rings' and 'The Hobbit.'

Magical: Bilbo Baggins (portrayed here by Martin Freeman) is able to get his hands on the One Ring after an encounter with the creature Gollum

Scene: The incident took place at Kermit Elementary School, pictured

Jason Steward told the newspaper 'I assure you my son lacks the magical powers necessary to threaten his friend’s existence. If he did, I'm sure he'd bring him right back.'

Speaking to The Odessa American, he said the school considered his son's behavior to be a threat.

Principal Roxanne Greer did not comment to the website, and said 'All student stuff is confidential.'

The website reported 'The 9-year-old has been in in-school suspension for referring to another student’s skin color and got in trouble for bringing a kids’ book about pregnancy to school.'"

They warned that the detainees risked returning to Afghanistan, and to militancy. Obama, with the backing of the government of Qatar that had agreed to host the men, promised that they would be kept far from the battlefield. Seems that the men may have had other ideas. According to CNN, U.S. military and intelligence officials now suspect that at least one of the detainees has made contact with Taliban associates in Afghanistan, suggesting that he, and perhaps the others, may be planning a return.

Considering that 29 percent of all U.S. detainees who were held in the Guantanamo detention center are either suspected of or confirmed to have returned to the fight, according to a March 2015 assessment by the Office of the Director of National Intelligence, it shouldn’t be all that surprising. TIME’s Massimo Calabresi predicted as much back in June, just after Bergdahl was released. The recidivism rate, he wrote, “suggests that statistically at least one of the Taliban leaders will return to the field to fight Americans in Afghanistan, or elsewhere.”

At the time of the exchange, Taliban commanders who had been involved in Bergdahl’s capture, captivity and release, told TIME that the exchange — five of theirs for one of America’s — would encourage them to seek out more P.O.W.s. So far, that hasn’t happened. It’s not clear which of the five former detainees was reaching out to associates in Afghanistan, but as high-ranking commanders and former comrades-in-arms of Taliban leader Mullah Omar, any one of them could galvanize a movement that is slowly making gains in the wake of the U.S. drawdown in Afghanistan. Even if those plans have now been foiled, the incident may have one other far reaching consequence: as Obama attempts to close down Guantanamo for good, his opponents now have more ammunition for why he should not.

Domino’s was still killing it with the Noid in the ‘90s when McDonald’s rolled out McPizzas to get in on “the dinnertime business.” The fast-food chain made clever signs by tipping Golden Arches sideways into serviceable Zs, and Pizza Hut’s copywriters predicted, “Every place you see a McDonald’s pizza, you’re going to see a war.” Formidable as all that seemed, that war never came and McPizza became a nostalgic slice for countless millennials, which is why it’s insane that two locations owned by a guy along the Ohio–West Virginia border are still cranking out the “pizza you won’t believa.”

Two decades ago, the chain’s “patented” ovens needed five and a half minutes to bake pizzas — time-consuming McPizzas were the the McWraps of their day — so most were gone by 2000. It’s not clear where Greg Mills’s locations in the very small towns of Pomeroy, Ohio, and Spencer, West Virginia, are getting their raw materials for the discontinued menu items, but mysteriously, they’re still selling.

Domino’s was still killing it with the Noid in the ‘90s when McDonald’s rolled out McPizzas to get in on “the dinnertime business.” The fast-food chain made clever signs by tipping Golden Arches sideways into serviceable Zs, and Pizza Hut’s copywriters predicted, “Every place you see a McDonald’s pizza, you’re going to see a war.” Formidable as all that seemed, that war never came and McPizza became a nostalgic slice for countless millennials, which is why it’s insane that two locations owned by a guy along the Ohio–West Virginia border are still cranking out the “pizza you won’t believa.”Two decades ago, the chain’s “patented” ovens needed five and a half minutes to bake pizzas — time-consuming McPizzas were the the McWraps of their day — so most were gone by 2000.
It’s not clear where Greg Mills’s locations in the very small towns of Pomeroy, Ohio, and Spencer, West Virginia, are getting their raw materials for the discontinued menu items, but mysteriously, they’re still selling.

It was the explosion in popularity of drive-through restaurants that brought about the demise of the pizza. The ovens were said to have slowed down sales and restaurants weren’t pushing enough pizzas out to justify the expense.

And the stringy cheese, with a slightly sweeter-than normal marinara underneath?

Maybe you shoved french fries in it like birthday candles. Or ate it crust first, as was the style at the time.

In any case, if you’re a child of the nineties, you remember it well: McDonald’s pizza.

And, like pogs and Beanie Babies, it too disappeared with the innocence of your childhood.

Except, in two magical locations in Ohio and West Virginia, where one hero owner has kept the McDonald’s pizza ovens burning all these years later.

So bust out a gel pen to jot down these directions, because I’m about to tell you where you can still buy McDonald’s pizza.

Neslted on the banks of the Ohio River, along the border with West Virginia sits the village of Pomeroy, population 1,852 in the 2010 census. And its McDonald’s, located along Main Street on the riverbank, still pumps out pizza — in five minutes or less, of course.

It’s just a seven-and-a-half hour drive from Toronto in zero traffic, according to Google Maps.

And, thanks to owner Greg Mills, there’s another McD’s where you can still get a slice, just over ninety kilometres away, across the state border. Spencer, West Virginia also boasts a McDonald’s that’s still lighting the pizza fires — or electrical coils, as the case may be.

According to employee Judy Norman, it’s the same pizza as they sold when she started there 11 years ago and it’s presumably the same that children everywhere enjoyed throughout the 1990s. She said the location sold 13 pizzas yesterday, but there are “days when everyone wants pizza and there are days where just every so often you get a pizza [order].”

Mills, who it’s pretty safe to call an American hero for preserving this very unique pizza, couldn’t not be immediately reached for comment, but this post will be updated should he return our calls.

Whatever actually happened to McDonald’s pizza, you ask?

Well, for starters, it turned out adult palates didn’t quite take to it the same way kids did. When McDonald’s first launched its pizza in the Canadian market in the early ’90s, it was tapping into a growing appetite for pizza as burger sales dwindled. It even launched hockey-themed TV ads.

The market for the savoury pie topped $2 billion in the early 90s, according to a 2004 National Post article on the death of McDonald’s pizza. And the company poured $25 million into the ovens alone across Canada, to moderate success throughout the decade. Then the-drive through took over — remember waiting for your pizza to be delivered with a plastic number on top of your car? — and pizza slowed things down as its own sales were dragging.

So the ovens were scrapped and McDonald’s turned its sights on other gimmicky productions — like the Arch Deluxe, which I think we can blame for Jessica Biel becoming a thing.

The saddest clarification of all time: As first reported by Metro Montreal and translated by Emergent, it appears there’s some confusion as to whether the pizza being sold at these two locations is the McPizza we all remember. Unfortunately, McDonald’s headquarters says it’s not the exact recipe, but it’s also reviewed online as being very close. So, the only way to sure is a road trip followed by a taste test. Canada.com will surely keep you abreast if we ever get around to doing that."

Previously: http://www.freerepublic.com/focus/f-news/3251260/posts Michelle is not impressed: The First Lady does not look happy to be meeting Saudi king who presides over widespread repression of women EXCERPT When the group lined up to greet the president and his wife, some of the Saudis shook the First Lady’s hand while others just nodded their head.

Reporters who were travelling with the president and First Lady told ABC News that Mrs Obama bowed to cultural differences and stood slightly behind her husband during the greeting line.

If one of the men would offer to shake her hand, the First Lady would oblige but mostly stood back and smiled while they passed.

She was also criticized by Saudis and the Muslim world at large on Twitter for not covering her hair.

According to tweets gathered by Al-Ahram, Egypt’s largest daily newspaper, many Saudis expressed outrage that Mrs Obama wore a veil to visit a mosque in Indonesia, but went without one on this condolence trip to their country. Mrs Obama also donned a sheer black veil when she met the Catholic Pope in Vatican City.

Maybe they are not all that bad.

She is blurred anyway...

The new Saudi king shook hands with President Obama at the Erga Palace but did not acknowledge the first lady at all during a brief aside at the funeral for King Abdullah, Bloomberg View reported.

Mrs. Obama did not wear a head scarf during the funeral, as is custom for any woman appearing in public in Saudi Arabia. Visitors to the kingdom are not required to abide by its strict dress code, but the first lady was still criticized on social media by Saudis using the hashtags #Michelle_Obama_Immodest and #Michelle_Obama_NotVeiled, Politico reported.

Several videos posted on Saudis’ Facebook pages obscured Mrs. Obama’s face but were removed shortly after they were posted, Bloomberg reported.

Nail al-Jubeir, information director at the Saudi Embassy in Washington, denied the claim that state television censored the first lady.

“Saudi TV has been showing the total arrival ceremony at the airport and at the Palace, and nowhere is anything blurred,” the director told Bloomberg.

PHOTOS: Shocking celebrity breakups

CNN’s Hala Gorani tweeted that her colleague in Riyadh saw non-altered images of the meeting on Saudi TV. Other news organizations, such as Al Jazeera, also showed the meeting without censoring Mrs. Obama’s face, Bloomberg reported.

The president and first lady cut short their trip to India to attend the funeral Tuesday. Mr. Obama praised the late king in a statement following his death, saying “King Abdullah’s vision was dedicated to the education of his people and to greater engagement with the world,” Bloomberg reported.

The company said that it had already announced it would take a $600 million charge for restructuring.

-----

IBM is expected to go through a massive reorg next month that will reportedly see 26% of its 430,000-strong work force let go, or 111,800 people. If that figure holds true, that would make it far and away the largest corporate layoff event in history, breaking the record previously held by IBM, when it cut 60,000 in 1993.

The report comes from long-time Silicon Valley journalist Robert X. Cringely, who recently published an eBook on IBM's issues entitled The Decline and Fall of IBM. He blamed past CEOs Louis Gerstner and Sam Palmisano for making the mess and current CEO Virginia Rometty has done nothing to address them.

The problem is a complex stew of bad management – like laying off important people in the middle of a project – to unrealistic expectations from commercializing Watson and failing to adjust to the new era. The ""M"" in IBM may mean machines, but hardware is less than 10% of its business. Two-thirds of its business is in services, and the services pipeline has dried up.

Why? Well, according to an ex-IBMer I spoke to some time ago, who confirmed what Cringely wrote in his book, IBM is still wedded to services contracts in an age where companies are shutting down their internal data center entirely and moving everything to the cloud. If you don't have a data center, you don't need an IBM service contract to manage it.

That's why IBM grabbed Softlayer, the cloud services provider. It needed to get into the cloud fast because it was behind Microsoft, Google and Amazon. Since the purchase 18 months ago, IBM has put a huge amount of money into SoftLayer and there has been a number of announcements around SoftLayer services.

Cringely said the mainframe and storage areas will see deep cuts, which would be counterproductive considering IBM announced the new Z13 mainframe and hopes it will stimulate sales. That won't be easy when you cut the people who are supposed to sell it. Cutting storage in the era of Big Data and Data Lakes, where storage is vital to these concepts, also seems shortsighted.

And you have to wonder what a layoff of 110,000 people will do to the firm. That has to be jarring. I remember an old advertisement from the print days that said ""What's worse, getting laid off on a Friday or being told to pick up the slack on the following Monday?"" This will be undeniably upsetting to the survivors.

The question I have to ask is why isn't Rometty one of the 110k. IBM has seen 11 straight quarters of declining revenue and it's hemorrhaging customers, according to both my source and Cringely. It's becoming apparent she is not up for the job and can't pull the company out of its nose dive.

Cringely said the layoffs will begin next week and by the end of February, all of the employees will be gone. If nothing else, IBM's first quarter numbers will take a monstrous hit from the severance packages for 111,000 employees. To say nothing of what this will do to its customer confidence."

Update 1: IBM flatly denies reports it will axe 111,000 jobs

In what is being called the largest corporate jobs cull in history, IBM is set to axe more than 111,000 of its staff this week (26 January 2015).

Dubbed Project Chrome internally at IBM, the process will see 26% of the company's workforce laid off in one fell swoop, meaning that 111,800 people could lose their jobs before the end of January based on IBM's global workforce of 430,000.

News of the job cuts come from veteran Silicon Valley reporter Robert X. Cringely, who recently published a book entitled The Decline and Fall of IBM.

In his report on Project Chrome, Cringely says that those affected by the cuts ""will all be gone by the end of February"". He said that while there would be a significant number of jobs lost in the US, the axe would fall on all of IBM's locations around the world. The cuts in the US are likely to affect the company's mainframe and storage divisions most dramatically.

Falling revenue

Currently the record for the largest single corporate lay-off is also held by IBM, having fired more than 60,000 of its workforce in 1993, but this would be dwarfed if Cringely's predictions come true.

Last year Microsoft hit the headlines when it had its largest ever jobs cull when it laid off more than 18,000 staff in one go.

IBM's problems were underscored last week when it announced another set of weak quarterly revenue figures, its eleventh straight quarter of declining revenue.

Following those results, CEO Ginni Rometty said the company was in transition but made no mention of the huge job cuts: ""We are making significant progress in our transformation, continuing to shift IBM's business to higher value, and investing and positioning ourselves for the longer term.""

IBM's problems stem from the fact that customers are moving their storage infrastructure to the cloud, meaning they no longer need physical data centres on site and therefore don't need service contracts with IBM to help maintain them - a business which accounts for two-thirds of IBM's revenue.

In light of all these financial issues and job culling, it was announced that Rometty would be pocketing a $4.5 million bonus plus millions in company stock for her performance in 2015."

The Apple news site is basing its report off rumours heard by the Japanese-language UDN and its ""ever-reliable sources in the Asian supply chain.""

Currently the iPhone — like almost every other smartphone — makes use of digital zoom. With digital zoom, zooming in doesn't add any extra detail to your photo — it just enlarges and enhances what's already captured. In contrast, optical zoom uses an actual lens to to magnify and capture significantly more detail without sacrificing image quality.

The camera in the iPhone 6 is already highly praised, but the rumoured new version will reportedly make use of a new dual-lens system to aid magnification — like compact cameras and professional SLRs.

It's a rumour in keeping with what we've already heard about the next iPhone. Blogger and developer John Gruber, who has an excellent track record on Apple product news, said that the next model may have ""the biggest camera jump ever.""

""I've heard that it's some kind of weird two-lens system where the back camera uses two lenses,"" Gruber said, ""and it somehow takes it up into DSLR quality imagery.""

And that's not the only new prediction about the next iPhone from UDN. The Apple smartphone is also reportedly to include ""Force Touch,"" a pressure-sensitive touchscreen which is also included in the Apple Watch.

One citizen in the Province of Tarif used his snow camel to promote the colours of local teams, drawing praise from the fans, while another opted for the traditional ghitra and agal to cover the head of the snowman he built.

However, it was not all fun for Saudis after a religious scholar said that building snowmen or snow animals was not acceptable in Islam.

The fatwa, by Mohammad Saleh Al Minjed, said that building snowmen or any replica of an animal, even if it is for fun or recreation, could not be condoned. Only lifeless things, such as ships, fruit and buildings could be imitated, the fatwa said.

No date was mentioned about when the fatwa was issued, but it was widely circulated on social networks, triggering a wide and often heated online debate mainly among Gulf nationals.

Those who supported the fatwa said that building snowmen was a crude imitation of the West.

“It has no value in our traditions, and those who are fascinated by the West should emulate their inventions and sciences, not their culture,” a blogger said, Al Marsad news site reported on Monday.

However, Mishaal, an angry blogger, blasted the fatwa.

“We have snow for fleeting days, maybe even hours, and there is always someone who wants to rob us of the joy and the fun,” he posted. “It seems that the only thing left for us is to sit down and drink coffee,” he said."

Plenty if you ask a scholar of Islam in Saudi Arabia. A prominent Saudi Arabian cleric apparently issued a religious ruling, officially called as a ‘Fatwa,’ forbidding the building of snowmen. According to the cleric the practice is highly anti-Islamic.

The religious scholar, Sheikh Mohammed Saleh al-Munajjid strongly believes that building snowmen isn’t an acceptable Islamic practice and it should cease with immediate effect. The leader confirmed his viewpoint on a website where one of the members had asked whether it was OK for fathers to build snowmen for their children. To this, the cleric replied in the negative, saying,

“It is not permitted to make a statue out of snow, even by way of play and fun.”

Sheikh Munajjid had an explanation ready to back his fatwa. He argued that to build a snowman was to create an image of a human being. Under the Saudi kingdom’s strict interpretation of Sunni Islam, such an action is considered a sin. While noting his ruling, he added.

“God has given people space to make whatever they want which does not have a soul, including trees, ships, fruits, buildings and so on.”

In simpler terms, the cleric was OK with building snow figurines representing anything non-human or animals for that matter. As amusing as it might sound, children might now be left with other “inanimate” objects only. How does one have fun building a snow sculpture of a tree, isn’t what the religious leader pondered much upon.

null

Fortunately for the children, the fatwa hasn’t been accorded a date of implementation and moreover, no local government authority has officially confirmed or denied the same. Apparently, any cleric in Saudi Arabia is entitled to issue a fatwa. However, they are to strictly base their rulings on the teachings of Islam and must have valid basis under Saudi law.

The country’s northern regions have been recently lashed by multiple snowstorms leaving in their wake sporadic accumulations of snow that will soon melt away. Despite being the second hottest country in the world snow has covered a few upland areas of Tabuk province near Saudi Arabia’s border with Jordan for the third consecutive year as cold weather swept across the Middle East.

Though this is a rare opportunity for children to enjoy the snow, perhaps the cleric has put a severe dampener on their plans to build a big snowman.

Apparently, any cleric in Saudi Arabia is entitled to issue a fatwa."

http://www.emergent.info/banksy-hebdo-charlie-cartoon	Claim: Artist Banksy drew a cartoon about the Charlie Hebdo murders	false	['Banksy', 'Cartoons']	2015/01/08	emergent	['http://variety.com/2015/film/news/paris-massacre-europes-creative-community-remains-defiant-1201395305/']	http://variety.com/2015/film/news/paris-massacre-europes-creative-community-remains-defiant-1201395305/	http://variety.com/	"As the world reacted to the killings at French satirical newspaper Charlie Hebdo, the European media community took to social media to express outrage, sympathy and solidarity with the slogan #jesuischarlie (I Am Charlie). Thousands also took to the streets of Paris and other European capitals, and political cartoonists around the world also published reactions. Artist Banksy’s sketch of what many have tried to put into words drew more than 1 million retweets.

One of Paris’ most prominent Arab filmmakers, Nabil Ayouch, who operates out of Paris and Casablanca, said he certainly wouldn’t back down after the Charlie Hebdo slaughter. “It’s a sad day. I’m still very shocked. This attack will reinforce my determination to move forward by denouncing in my films the craziness of those who believe that they can act and kill in the name of a religion,” Ayouch told Variety.

Ayouch’s last film, 2012’s “The Horses of God,” was a frontal attack on religious fundamentalism as it analyzed what drives four kids from the slums to become the suicide bombers behind the 2003 Casablanca terrorist attack that left 45 dead. “Horses,” one of the French film industry’s highest-profile cinematic denunciations of terrorism, was co-financed by France’s Pierre Ange Le Pogam and Wild Bunch, and unspooled in Cannes’ Un Certain Regard.

“As a film director, my only duty is to express what I think with no censorship of any kind, like I did in ‘Horses of God.’ Freedom of speech is not negotiable,” Ayouch added.

Mark Herbert, CEO of U.K. production company Warp Films, produced Chris Morris’ “Four Lions,” a satire about British Muslim suicide bombers.

The film, which played at Sundance in 2010 and won Morris a BAFTA for outstanding debut by a British writer, director or producer, mocks the jihadists. Would Herbert make the film now? He says yes.

He told Variety: “If I had another script as funny as ‘Four Lions’ land on my desk tomorrow, I would still use all my energy and resources to try and make it. We made that film because it was funny and entertaining and only poked fun at stupid groups of men, who are everywhere still.”

Germany — which is home to about 3-3.5 million Muslims, second only to France — has seen anti-Islam demonstrations that have drawn tens of thousands in the last week as well as huge counter-demonstrations. On Wednesday, many TV networks pre-empted their regular schedules with special programming about the Paris killings. Executives at Arte, the German-French TV network, issued a statement relaying their shock about the attack and their solidarity with the staff of Charlie Hebdo.

In Italy’s creative community the first to react to the Paris massacre have been the country’s cartoonists. Popular political satirist Vauro updated his Twitter profile with the hashtag #JeSuisCharlie and published a cartoon in which a cloaked character with a sickle laughs while turning the pages of Charlie Hebdo magazine.

The Italian film community is proving a bit slower to respond, but the Cinecitta News trade website and several Italian artists have expressed their solidarity with the thousands gathered in Paris in protest.

Concerns in Italy about whether the Paris massacre may lead film and TV producers to avoid tackling topics that might offend Islamic terrorists seem to be marginal mainly because Islam has not featured frequently in current Italian cinema so far.

That said, Islamic fundamentalism-themed comedy “Che bella giornata” (What a Beautiful Day) broke the Italian box office record for a locally made film in 2011 , pulling in more than $50 million via Medusa, a unit of Silvio Berlusconi’s Mediaset. The mildly politically incorrect feel-good pic is about a lovably goofy security guard at Milan’s Duomo who becomes romantically entangled with a young Arab female terrorist who plans to bomb the Madonna statue on the cathedral’s spire.

In 2004, controversial helmer Theo van Gogh, the enfant terrible of the Dutch film industry who was notorious for his anti-Islamic views, was shot and stabbed to death by Muslim Mohammed Bouyeri.

Van Gogh was notorious for his anti-Islamic views. After the screening on Dutch TV in August of his film “Submission,” which focused on violence against women within Islamic society, Van Gogh received numerous death threats. The film caused an uproar among those in the Dutch Muslim community.

According to Snopes.com:

The claim was upsetting to many social media users, but thankfully for cat fanciers, World News Daily Report is one of many fake news outlets known to fabricate outrageous stories in the hopes Facebook users will pass the tales on to friends. A reverse image search of the picture appended to the article revealed it to have been lifted from a 2013 news story about the arrest of a 79-year-old Georgia woman named Norma Cheren on charges unrelated to cats.

Get the full breakdown here.

Original Story from December 2014

An 85-year-old woman in Waco, Texas has been been arrested for allegedly kidnapping neighbor’s cats and making them into fur coats.

Local residents couldn’t figure out where their cats were disappearing, so one or more residents decided to hire a private investigator. Some even thought they saw their own cats as a part of her fur coats. Eventually, the investigator successfully videotaped the woman stealing a neighbor’s cat.

According to World News Daily Report, the woman admitted in court that she tried to raise her own cats, but became too attached to them.

Prior to being caught on tape, the woman denied all allegations.

Prosecutors allege that the retired fashion designer skinned the cats in her basement. The following is a photo of the woman wearing one of her fur coats:

Investigators estimate that a total of 30 coats were required to make a single jacket. Additionally, they report that 20 skinned cats were found at the crime scene.

If found guilty, the unnamed woman could spend up to 18 months in prison."

NEW YORK, New York –

Vladimir Kershov, publicist of R&B singer Bruno Mars, has been fired today after he revealed a shocking secret regarding the pop and R&B singer. Kershov leaked private information that revealed that Michael Jackson is Mars’ biological father.

In a statement emailed to news and media outlets across the world, Kershov revealed that he was told by the singer that DNA testing had proven that Jackson, known across the world as the King of Pop, was without a doubt his biological father. After pleading with Mars, born under the name Peter Hernandez, to go public with the revelation, Mars refused to do so. Kershov insisted that it be made known to the public, and that the news would catapult the singer’s fame and boost record sales. Mars remained adamant that the information not be released. According to Kershov, he then took it upon himself and emailed the shocking news to media sources all over the world.

“DNA testing has proven that Michael Jackson is the biological father of Bruno Mars,” Kershov said in the statement. “Against his wishes, I have decided to relay this message for the greater good and betterment of Bruno’s life and extravagant music career.”

In a statement released by Mars’ new publicist, Jacqueline Pryor, it has been announced that Kershov was immediately fired by the singer, and may seek legal action against his former publicist. “The job of a publicist is indeed to better the career of their clients by persuading them to take part in things that cause their popularity to grow, however, the client must trust their publicist. The artist has the final say, no matter what.”

When asked about the validity of Kershov’s statement, Pryor surprisingly made it clear that the information is accurate. “It is true. Doesn’t mean he was right in saying so, but it is true. When it comes to 29-year-old Bruno Mars, Michael Jackson is the father!”

Saudi Arabia’s national carrier Saudia intends to ban gender-mixing aboard all its flights in line with rules enforced by the conservative Gulf kingdom.



The airlines said it decided to act following recurrent complaints from passengers objecting to have males seated next to their wives and other female family members.



“There are solutions to this problem…we will soon enforce rules that will satisfy all passengers,” Saudia assistant manager for marketing Abdul Rahman Al Fahd said, quoted by the Saudi Arabic language daily ‘Ajel’.



He did not elaborate, but the paper said it would include instructions to flight booking staff at the Gulf kingdom’s airports to ensure males and females are separated aboard Saudia’s flights unless they are closely related.

Saudi Arabia's national airline plans to keep men and women apart after passengers objected to on-board gender mixing, the Emirates247 news website reported Wednesday.

""There are solutions to this problem,"" said Abdul Rahman Al Fahd, the assistant manager of national carrier Saudia. ""We will soon enforce rules that will satisfy all passengers,"" Saudi daily Ajel quoted him as saying.

The paper said flight staff at Saudi Arabia's airports would be instructed to keep men and women segregated on board Saudia planes, unless they are close relatives.

Complaints about mixed-gender sitting are also common on planes flying to Israel, with some ultra-Orthodox Jewish men refusing to sit next to unrelated women and some women objecting to being asked to move so that the men won't have to sit next to them.

A Delta flight from New York to Israel was delayed earlier this month when ultra-Orthodox passengers refused to sit between two women, Israel Radio reported on Friday.

A number of similar incidents were reported in the media earlier this year, bringing the controversial issue into the headlines. In some cases, the men reportedly offered to pay the female passengers to switch their seats.

In September, a petition on Change.org urged Israeli carrier El Al to stop allowing female passengers to be ""bullied, harassed, and intimidated into switching seats."" El Al told Haaretz that its policy is ""to try to accommodate any customer request.”

Abdul Rahman al-Fahd, assistant manager at Saudia Airlines, briefly commented: ""There are solutions to this problem. We will soon enforce rules that will satisfy all passengers.""

The new rules follow Saudia Airline's strong flight code of not offering any alcoholic beverages or pork dishes to customers flying with the airline.

Saudia Airlines chooses not to employ Saudi women as members of the cabin crew, although female flight desks are operating in their offices in the Murooj district in the Saudi capital of Riyadh.

Other Islamic observations are maintained by the airline: most notably a verse of the Quran is read out as prayer prior to take-off. Designated prayer areas for men are also often available on many of its flights.

Many of the airlines run by the Gulf countries abide by Islamic laws, although some country airlines are more lenient than others.

The plan is being implemented by Saudi Airlines due to a rash of complaints from men who said they did not want their wives sitting next to other men, the Daily Mail reported, citing Gulf media.

“There are solutions to this problem… we will soon enforce rules that will satisfy all passengers,” Saudi Airlines’ assistant manager for marketing, Abdul Rahman Al Fahd, was quoted as saying.

According to the report, close relatives will be allowed to sit together.

The plan reportedly also follows recent complaints from male passengers about a “flirty” flight attendant.

Saudi women are not employed as flight attendants by the airline, which instead hires women from other countries, the report said.

Saudi Arabia enforces a strict segregation of the sexes in public spaces, and famously forbids women from driving motor vehicles.

Women are required to wear a headscarf and loose, black robes in public.

Operators of flights to and from Israel have faced similar complaints from men who refused to sit next to women.

An international flight from New York to Tel Aviv was delayed for half an hour on December 20 after ultra-Orthodox Jewish men refused to sit between two women.

The flight crew of Delta Flight 468 departing John F. Kennedy Airport attempted to find other seats for the men. But other passengers refused to swap seats in protest at their refusal to sit next to female passengers, according to a Friday report by Israel Radio.

The men were finally accommodated by an American passenger who agreed to switch seats.

According to Federal Aviation Authority regulations, a flight is not permitted to take off until all passengers are seated.

In September, an El Al flight was grounded after a group of ultra-Orthodox men refused to sit next to a female passenger, resulting in an 11-hour delay described as a “nightmare” by passengers.

That incident sparked a petition calling on EL AL to protect its female travelers by reserving “a few rows of separate sex seating on every flight, where for a fee, those passengers who need such seating can pre-book their seats and not annoy or coerce other passengers before take-off to change seats with them — thereby avoiding arguments, bullying, and delayed take-off.”"	Saudi Airlines to segregate sexes		[]	['men', 'segregate', 'female', 'refused', 'women', 'saudi', 'airlines', 'passengers', 'seating', 'sit', 'flight', 'sexes', 'seats']	"Saudi Arabia’s national carrier has reportedly decided to impose separate seating on its male and female passengers.

Rabat – Following some men’s complaints about male strangers sitting next to their wives, Saudi Arabian national airline Saudia is moving forward to segregate men and women on its airplanes.

According to news360, Saudia will order staff to keep men and women segregated on board their planes, unless they are close relatives.

Multiple reports suggest that the policy change came in response to complaints from men unwilling to allow other males to sit next to their wives and other female family members.

Saudi daily Ajel quoted Saudia assistant manager for marketing Abdul Rahman Al Fahd as saying that “there are solutions to this problem…we will soon enforce rules that will satisfy all passengers.”

This policy comes as part of Saudi Arabia’s culture of gender segregation, which is deeply rooted in the mentality of minimizing the exposure of women in society.

The national airline of Saudi Arabia could be set to segregate sexes on board its flights amid claims men have lodged complaints about male strangers sitting next to their wives.

Saudia will order staff to keep men and women seated apart on its aeroplanes unless they are close relatives, according the news website Emirates247.

Speaking to the Saudi daily, Ajel, assistant manager for marketing Abdul Rahman Al Fahd, said: ""There are solutions to this problem, we will soon enforce rules that will satisfy all passengers.""

The airline carrier already complies with strict Islam practices including not serving alcohol or pork products, providing a men's prayer area on most international flights and not employing Saudi women as cabin crew.

But the airline does employ women of other nationalities.

Many Saudi women require approval from a male guardian before they can travel or work outside the home.

Gulf media report that Saudia will keep men and women segregated onboard, unless they are close relatives.

The move follows a spate of complaints from male fliers unwilling to allow other males to sit next to their wives and other female family members.

Complaints were also recently made when male passengers claimed a flight attendant was being too 'flirty'.

'There are solutions to this problem…we will soon enforce rules that will satisfy all passengers,' Saudia assistant manager for marketing Abdul Rahman Al Fahd, told Saudi daily, Ajel.

It is thought that the airline will include instructions to flight booking staff at Gulf airports to keep these new rules in place.

The carrier's policies are already in tune to the strict Islamic practices of Saudi Arabia: no alcoholic beverages or pork dishes are served onboard, a prayer of verse from the Quran is read before take off, and many international flights have a designated men's prayer area.

In addition, Saudia does not employ Saudi women as cabin crew, opting to recruit women from other countries such as Pakistan, the Philippines, Albania and Bosnia instead.

But moves are being made to employ females on the ground in November, the airline opened its fourth women's section staffed by entirely by females at its office in the Murooj district of Saudi capital, Riyadh.

The country is known for its gender segregation, with women requiring a male guardian approval to travel or work outside of the home.

In public spaces such as restaurants, beaches, amusement parks or banks, women are required to enter and exit through special doors.

Women who are seen socialising with a man who is not a relative can even be charged with committing adultery, fornication or prostitution.

The majority of Gulf operated airlines abide by Islamic laws, but vary over strictness.

For example United Emirates carrier, Etihad's new A380 aircraft includes a prayer area in Business class, but the new cabin crew uniform, launched last month, does not feature a veil.

Chief Commercial Officer, Peter Baumgartner, told MailOnline Travel: ‘Modern Arabia is what is going on in Abu Dhabi, we are inspired by what’s going on in the rest of the world, but through the lens of the local DNA.

Due to religious and modesty regulations, the airline plans to “enforce” separation, according to a spokesman for the company.

The airline in question is Saudi Arabia’s national airline, Saudia as reported on the RT website. Saudia wants to separate male and female air travellers, mainly due to complaints from husbands who don’t like unknown men sitting next to their wives.

Saudia assistant manager for marketing Abdul Rahman Al Fahd told reporters, “There are solutions to this problem…we will soon enforce rules that will satisfy all passengers.”

As such, the airline hopes to begin arranging for check-in staff at the airport to assign separate seating for their passengers, unless they are closely related.

As widely reported, it isn’t just Muslims who have these modesty issues as Orthodox Jews also have similar laws calling for the separation of men and women in public.

Back in September, an El AL flight from New York to Israel’s Tel Aviv Ben Gurion Airport was delayed because some orthodox male flyers refused to sit next to women.

But while these religious practices are all fine for some people, they are not suitable for others, and certainly not on a public place like an airplane, where flight crews are constantly working against the clock to ensure their aircraft takes off on time.

It terms of the FAA’s rules for this type of crew disruption, Federal Aviation Regulations 91.11, 121.580 and 135.120 state that “no person may assault, threaten, intimidate, or interfere with a crewmember in the performance of the crewmember’s duties aboard an aircraft being operated.”

It therefore remains to be seen what course of action will be taken by Saudia airlines, and if plans to separate people based on gender is even legal, not to mention the logistical and ethical nightmare."

The country’s national airline is introducing new seating assignments that will be based on gender separation. The commercial flight service, in keeping with Saudi Islamic law, is responding to complaints from passengers about males sitting next to their wives, according to a Daily Mail news report.

Saudi Arabia’s national airline fielded a string of complaints from a number of male fliers who are protesting other males sitting next to their spouses and other female relatives. Accordingly, the airline met over creating rules for passengers in order to remain in strict compliance with laws that govern Islam in the Gulf kingdom.

Future plans are to institute segregation rules aboard Saudi Arabia Airlines flights. In short, males and females will not be allowed to sit adjacent to one another unless they are closes relatives. The concern is that the rules will clash with passengers who represent other nationalities and do not practice Islamic laws. Saudi assistant manager for marketing Abdul Rahman Al Fahd weighed in on the subject.

“There are solutions to this problem…we will soon enforce rules that will satisfy all passengers.”

Although the new plans for separating men and women aboard flights is part of a new initiative, most Saudi Arabia customs are already practiced aboard commercial airlines in the region. Several examples; pork dishes and alcohol, which are served aboard passenger planes in the West and other nation states, are forbidden on Middle Eastern and Sharia observant flights. Additionally, a verse from the Qur’an is read with accompanying an prayer before every flight, and international flights offer an on-board prayer room for men only.

Although the country does not allow Saudi women to work as cabin crew members, they employ the services of women from other countries. Moreover, Saudi Arabia Airlines’ segregation extends to the ground. In November, the company opened its fourth all-women office in the Murooj district of Saudi capital, Riyadh, wrote DM.

Some say the move to segregate women and men aboard Saudi airliners violates United Nations laws on human rights. Nonetheless, practitioners of Islamic law point to custom and religion, saying it’s not used to oppress women.

Still, many others say it’s pure gender inequality and has no place in the modern world. It’s known that women in Gulf states are required to enter and exit using special doors in public spaces. Months ago, Inquistir reported that women with “pretty eyes” are being forced to cover them up to prevent temptation.

Additionally, women are forbidden to socialize with another male unless he is a close relative. If she does, charges can include prostitution, fornication and adultery. The penalties are harsh and can include stoning and death. The new Saudi Arabian airline segregation policy will undoubtedly fan the flames in the ongoing debate between what many view as oppressive religious laws and human rights.

NORTH HOLLYWOOD, California –

Kurt Sutter, creator of the hit FX drama Sons of Anarchy, has announced plans to turn the popular television series into a major motion picture.

Sutter, who was also a writer, producer, and director on the series, said in an interview with Hollywood Today magazine that he has long contemplated taking S.O.A. to the big screen following its run on television. “People absolutely loved the show, as did I, and I have put a lot of thought into the matter, and we are going forward with turning it into a feature film” Sutter said.

Sons of Anarchy ran for seven seasons on FX, from 2008-2014, and in the process built a huge following. Sutter said the film will star Charlie Hunnam, who played the lead character Jax Teller, as well as Ryan Hurst who played Opie Winston, and Katey Sagal as Gemma Teller. The film, which is a prequel to the storyline of Sons will also introduce fans to Jax’s father, John, who will be played by Brad Pitt.

“I am most excited about bringing Brad (Pitt) on as John Teller, he is absolutely perfect for the role. The movie will take place from the day Jax was born, and leads up to the era just before Sons Of Anarchy began as a series.”

Sutter also said that he is really happy to bring Ryan Hurst back as Opie Winston, and hopes fans will forgive him for killing Opie off. “Man I tell ya, when we killed Opie off, it was like the thing turned real. I’ve never gone public with this, but I’ve had people get really crazy when they see me in public,” said Sutter. “They shout at me, and they get angry – ‘You shouldn’t have killed Ope! I hope you rot in Hell!,’ that sort of thing. I had people try to run me off the road when they recognized me, although that just might be because I’m kind of a dangerous driver. Anyway, my hope is that this film will help them cope.”

Sutter says pre-production on film will begin in the middle of 2015, and will begin shooting sometime in the fall. “For a movie of this scope, with this much storyline attached, you should expect to see the film by the end of 2016,” said Sutter. “In the mean time, buy all the official Sons of Anarchy merchandise you can. Every dollar goes to helping get this movie completed. Brad Pitt isn’t cheap, you know.”

US officials believe the hackers were backed by North Korea.

Those hackers promised not to leak any more private Sony data unless Sony reverses its decision and distributes the movie anyway.

Kids these days.

New York Magazine recently profiled Mohammed Islam, a 17-year-old senior at Manhattan’s Stuyvesant High School who decided to start trading stocks during his lunch break and found himself all the richer for it.

Get push notifications with news, features and more.

$72 million richer, to be precise.

Islam, the son of Bengali immigrants from Queens, is the president of the school’s Investment Club and has been profiled by Business Insider for his financial acumen. Mo, as he’s known, won’t disclose his full net worth but says it’s in “the high eight figures.”

Mo’s got an apartment in Midtown Manhattan, though his parents won’t let him move out of their house until he’s 18. He bought a BMW, but he doesn’t have a license to drive it – his dad drives him on inspirational tours past the home of his idol, billionaire Paul Tudor Jones, a hedge-funder and private asset manager who’s ranked the 108th richest American, according to Forbes.

Islam recalls that, when he first experimented with penny stocks (at the tender age of 9), he lost some of the money he’d saved up from tutoring, which caused him to swear off trading briefly. But he was reinvigorated by Jones’s story and quotes his idol: “You learn more from your losses than from your gains.”

From all appearances, Islam’s learned plenty.

As the New York Post reports, Islam, a teenager from Queens, still lives at home with his parents, but has been trading on the stock exchange on his lunch breaks at Stuyvesant High School. The Teen Wolf is the son of immigrants from Bengal in South Asia. Mohammed trades with two other friends, and they hope to start a hedge fund when the Teen Wolf turns 18 and graduates from high school.

Islam started with penny stocks at the unbelievable age of 9. When most kids are in the fourth grade, they’re learning to play sports, and figuring out fractions. Mohammed was putting his tutoring earnings to work. As often happens on the stock exchange, Islam lost his initial investment. He describes the event as “paralyzing,” and swore off the market thinking he just didn’t have the required nerves of steel.

Bengal region of Asia

Perhaps to better understand the losses that crippled him, Islam turned to studying modern finance, and became enthralled with Paul Tudor Jones. Jones is a billionaire from Connecticut who manages hedge funds and private assets. As is often the case, much of Jones’ success came on the heels of failure. Thousands and thousands of dollars lost, over and over, but Jones kept coming back for more, and ultimately captured overwhelming success. That fortitude, paired with his positive outlook, inspired Mohammed to give the game another try. And like the man who inspired him, Mohammed Islam has become a resounding success in his own right.

The Teen Wolf moniker is a reference to Leonardo DiCaprio’s portrayal of Jordan Belfort — called the “wolf of Wall Street,” another young trader who had an uncanny ability to make money on the stock exchanges. Islam and his trading buddies intend to become billionaires by next year.

“What makes the world go round? Money. If money is not flowing, if businesses don’t keep going there’s no innovation, no products, no investments, no growth, no jobs.”

But according to Mohammed Islam and his friends, it’s not just about the money.

“We want to create a brotherhood. Like, all of us who are connected, who are in something together, who have influence.”

The Post reported that despite his resounding success, Islam is shy and modest, and only gave a rough estimate of his earnings. While he has a very bright future, and grand dreams for his journey into it, for now he has to content himself with expensive meals at Morimoto (an upscale Japanese restaurant), a high end BMW that he has no license to drive, and a swanky Manhattan apartment that he’s not old enough to move into.

The real “Wolf of Wall Street” wasn’t exactly role model material, and as the Inquisitr pointed out, even the movie was beleaguered in controversy and monetary fraud.

New York magazine has retracted the story and apologized.

He’s the teen wolf of Wall Street.

A kid from Queens has made tens of millions of dollars — by trading stocks on his lunch breaks at Stuyvesant High School, New York magazine reports in its Monday issue.

Mohammed Islam is only 17 and still months away from graduating — but worth a rumored $72 million. “The high eight figures,” is as specific as the shy and modest teen would get when asked his net worth.

Islam bought himself a BMW but doesn’t have a license to drive it. And he rented a Manhattan apartment, though his parents, immigrants from the Bengal region of South Asia, won’t let him move out of the house yet.

Still, the cherubic prodigy is living, and dreaming, large.

“What makes the world go round?” Islam asked in the interview, explaining his preference for trading and investment over startups. “Money. If money is not flowing, if businesses don’t keep going, there’s no innovation, no products, no investments, no growth, no jobs.”

Islam and a pair of other young, Wall Street wolf-cub buddies eat regularly at hot spot Morimoto, where they enjoy $400 caviar and fresh-squeezed apple juice.

They hope to start a hedge fund in June, after Islam turns 18 and can get his broker-dealer license.

“Mo’s our maestro,” one of the kids explained.

The three pals intend to make a billion dollars by next year. All while attending college. “But it’s not just about the money,” Islam told the mag, which ranked his spectacular success story as No. 12 in its 10th annual “Reasons to Love New York” issue.

“We want to create a brotherhood. Like, all of us who are connected, who are in something together, who have influence.

“Like the Koch brothers,” he added, referring to sibling oil magnates Charles and David, worth $40 billion each.

Islam’s biggest inspiration, though, is Paul Tudor Jones, a billionaire hedge-funder and private asset manager from Connecticut who ranks as the 108th-richest American, according to Forbes.

Battered by losses, Jones would jump back in the game again and again. It was a lesson Islam found instructive when, while dabbling in penny stocks at age 9, he lost a chunk of the money he’d made tutoring. Islam swore off trading, realizing, “I didn’t have the balls for it,” he said.

We want to create a brotherhood … who are connected, who are in something together, who have influence. - Mohammed Islam

Fortunately, he turned to studying modern finance, reading up on the titans of trading and ultimately finding inspiration in Jones. “I had been paralyzed by my loss,” Islam remembered of his 9-year-old self.

“But [Jones] was able to go back to it, even after losing thousands of dollars over and over,” he said.

And while Islam still needs to rely on Dad to chauffeur him on inspirational drives past the magnate’s Greenwich mansion, he’s quick to quote from the guru whom he credits with getting him back in the game and making him “who I am today.”

“Paul Tudor Jones says, ‘You learn more from your losses than from your gains.’ ”"	High school student scores $72M playing the stock market	2014-12-14 00:00:00	['December']	['york', '72m', 'market', 'tudor', 'high', 'student', 'playing', 'dollars', 'worth', 'money', 'jones', 'school', 'wall', 'islam', 'trading', 'stock', 'scores', 'magazine']	"Mohammed Islam has since admitted he lied to New York Magazine and did not make any money on the stock market, an Observer interview reveals.

This time the info comes from Taiwan and allegedly quotes parts suppliers for Apple, who claim that next year the company will unveil a new 4"" iPhone.

The iPhone 5s (and 5c to some extent) has been holding down the fort for fans of small phones since Apple doubled down on large screens with 4.7"" and 5.5"" iPhones. The new 4"" model aims to bring the iPhone back to its one-hand use roots and it is suggested will gain more popularity among women compared to the larger models.

There are several rumors that Apple will be discontinuing the iPhone 5c next year, while the iPhone 5s will likely live on (dropping to $0). This raises the question how the new 4-incher will be positioned  compact premium or budget offering?

Either way, the new big iPhones have been selling great, so this is certainly not Apple backing out of large screens.

On the Microsoft Bay Area blog, the company explained that it hosted an event at its Silicon Valley campus earlier this month where Knightscope demonstrated its robots in its parking lot. The robots will not be returning to the campus as security personnel, however.

""Unfortunately, some media were so excited about the technology that they misinterpreted the story,"" the blog post reads. ""At Microsoft, we love robots of all shapes and sizes. However, we do not have robots providing security on our campus.""

So it looks like any of Microsoft's campuses will be guarded by robots. Yet.

If you ever visit the Microsoft campus in the Silicon Valley and hear a mechanical voice shout ""Ex-ter-min-ate!"", don't be too spooked. It just means some geek humor has gone a little crazy.

Microsoft's campus in Silicon Valley will be patrolled by a team of five security guard robots from a company called Knightscope. The robot, dubbed K5, is five feet tall, weighs 300 pounds, and looks disturbingly like the Daleks of ""Doctor Who"" fame.

Fortunately, they are not armed with lasers. They use cameras and sensors to monitor their assigned area and look for suspicious activity. They are armed with high-definition cameras and audio recorders, able to record events and voices, analyze faces, read license plates, and even detect biological and chemical agents.

The K5s also use laser scanning and GPS for navigation, have weather sensors, and communicate via Wi-Fi. Their batteries run for about 24 hours and the K5 will return to a dock/power station to recharge.

Should they spot a problem, they call a human security guard. I'm just waiting for Knightscope to decide to cut out the middle man. Or for bored Microsofties to try and hack the thing to play pranks on people.

That sounds like the plot of a bad SyFy movie, doesn't it?"

Microsoft recently installed a fleet of 5-feet-tall, 300-pound robots to protect its Silicon Valley campus. The robots are packed with HD security cameras and sensors to take in their organic, protein-based surroundings. There’s also an artificial intelligence on board that can sound alarms when the robot notices something awry. It can also read license plates and cross-reference them to see if they’re stolen.

The K5 robots come from a California company called Knightscope, which calls the robots “autonomous data machines” that provide a “commanding but friendly presence.” Sounds like something a robot manufacturer would say.

Let’s be honest though, the robots look pretty damn cool. They’re like modern versions of R2-D2.

Thankfully—or sadly, depending on how you look at it—the K5 robots don’t have any weapons on them. All they can do is assess a situation, sound an alarm to defuse it, or call a human security officer to the scene. There are, however, plans equip the robots with tasers sometime in the future.

Microsoft’s new protectors are fairly autonomous. A single charge will last 24 hours, and if the robot notices that its battery is getting low, it will return to a charging port and plug itself in. It can fully recharge in 20 minutes, which is pretty insane.

There are plans to one day expand the use of Knightscope’s robots and have them patrol the streets as part of human police units. We can’t even imagine what would happen if Elon Musk heard about this.

A robotics firm in Mountain View says it is already using the robots - and say dozens could be on patrol by the end of the year.

Called the Knightscope, the robots are designed to spot suspicious behaviour and alert controllers.

The five foot tall robots are designed to spot suspicious behaviour and alert controllers.

KNIGHTSCOPE SPECS Height - 60 Inches (1,524 mm) Length - 36 Inches (914 mm) Width - 32 inches (813 mm) ) Weight - 300 pounds (136 kg) Fitted with surveillance cameras and sensors, odor detectors, thermal imaging system, and scanners. When on a patrolling duty, uses lasers and GPS to calculate distances.

Its inventors hope it could eventually patrol malls, office and even local neighbourhoods - and say they believe it will cut crime by 50%.

'Imagine a friend that can see, hear, feel and smell that would tirelessly watch over your corporate campus or neighborhood, keep your loved ones safe and put a smile on everyone passing by.

'Imagine if we could utilize technology to make our communities stronger and safer…..together,' the firm says.

The five foot tall robots have a combination of laser scanning, wheel encoders, inertial measurements, and GPS that allows fully autonomous operation and charging.

It also has odour detectors, and can even monitor air pollution as it travels around.

Using cameras they can also read upto 300 car numberplates a minute, allowing them to monitor traffic.

The Knightscope K5 robot security guards are 5ft tall robots that come with GPS, lasers, and heat-detecting technology.

They are designed to function without any human manipulation and are built with surveillance cameras and sensors, odor detectors, thermal imaging system, and scanners which can read an impressive number of 300 car registration plates every single minute. When on a patrolling duty, it uses lasers to calculate the distance and also relies on its GPS system.

The robots are autonomous and designed to avoid confrontations.

When someone steps right in front of one, the robot will stop, and move around them - while sending video inside to a control center where a human is monitoring.

The robots are currently being trialled by Microsoft at its San Francisco office

The robot also has an emergency button people can press to talk to an operator if they are in distress

If a would-be burglar persists, co-founder Stacy Stephens said: 'Then, the robot is looking at the video, listening for glass breakage, any loud sound that breaking in would cause. We'll get the license plate, picture of the vehicle, geotag location, and time.'

The robots patrol using a similar technology as the self-driving Google car.

'It has a LIDAR (light image detection and ranging) that's doing a 3D map,' Stephens told CBS.

'It will geofence itself and give itself a perimeter within which it will operate. And it moves around within that perimeter freely and it chooses its own path.'

The robots will be deployed in outdoor settings, such as corporate campuses, college campuses and open air malls.

The robots patrol using a similar technology as the self-driving Google car.

So far, the company has built seven robots and plans to deploy four of them towards the end of the year.

The K5 robot is also built with a button on top of its head.

This button can be pressed down by anyone who needs some help, and the firm has even addressed fears it will put human security guards out of work."

According to ExtremeTech, each of the K5 security guard robots from robotics company Knightscope stands 5 feet tall and weighs 300 pounds, so you probably don’t want to mess with one.

The K5 robots don’t come with any weapons onboard—thankfully—but they use a suite of alarms, sirens, and cameras to monitor and patrol the grounds of Microsoft’s campus. If one spots trouble, it’ll either sound an alarm or dispatch a human security guard to its location.

ExtremeTech notes that the K5 can run for up to 24 hours on a single charge, and can recharge in only about 20 minutes. Its battery won’t die out in the field, though—these bots will return to the charging station by themselves when their batteries start to run dry.

The story behind the story: Robots are playing an increasingly large role in security and military operations. Google-owned robotics company Boston Dynamics, for example, has been working with DARPA to develop various robots to aid soldiers in combat settings. Meanwhile, South Korea deployed a robotic sentry to guard its side of the Demilitarized Zone in 2010. Unlike K5, though, South Korea’s guard robot came fully armed."

Microsoft is the first company in Silicon Valley to dispatch a fleet of the K5 policing robots. Each 5-foot tall, 300-pound K5 is equipped with arrays of high-definition camera, sensors, debilitating sirens, Wi-Fi and artificial intelligence.

The squat policing robots are the product of Knightscope, a startup firm from Mountain View, Calif. William Santana Li, chairman and CEO of Knightscope, sees a world in which his company's policing robots move out of the private sector and start working alongside law enforcement officers.

""Technology and robotics are making the concept of Precision Policing -- a systematic, proactive and almost precognitive approach to ensuring public safety -- a real possibility,"" said Li in a March blog post.

The K5s can use their sensors to track down threats and their Wi-Fi connection to call in bipedal backup, aka security guards. Their AI and camera rigs enable the K5s to do a good deal of profiling, scanning license plates and faces to compare against databases available to them over Wi-Fi.

The K5 robots are only tools to surveil, assess and report suspicious activity, for now at least. There are plans in the works that could see the K5s brandishing and using Taser guns -- ""you are being neutralized.""

The K5s sensors enable them to recognize and analyze alphanumeric text, heat signatures, sounds, air quality and infrared light. The robots are equipped with both radar and Lidar to help them make measurements, while GPS helps them maintain their bearing and report their positions. Lidar, which stands for light detection and ranging, is a remote-sensing technology used to measure distance by illuminating a target with a laser and then analyzing the reflected light.

The robots are fully autonomous and can even refuel at a charging station without the guidance of humans. The K5s leverage their machine learning abilities for predictive analytics, analyzing and accounting for risks in real time.

To keep people assured that the machines aren't abusing their abilities or beginning to learn too much, Knightscope plans to let people keep an eye on the machines by making the K5s' video feeds available to the public online.

""I believe robots are the perfect tools to handle the monotonous and sometimes dangerous work in order to free up humans to more judiciously address activities requiring higher-level thinking, hands-on encounters, or tactical planning,"" states Li.

The Knightscope K5 is one of four drones now patrolling Microsoft's Silicon Valley Campus.

Matt Stambaugh, the Calgary Eyeopener's science and technology columnist, spoke about how the five feet tall robots learn.

""You take them to an area, apparently an operator has to walk around the perimeter where they're supposed to patrol once, then they go about learning their environments,"" said Stambaugh. ""What they're using is a variety of different sensors essentially to take the role of what a lot of private security contractors do today.""

According to Stambaugh, the robots are capable of detecting anomalies and making decisions.

""It's not quite as advanced as what Google is doing with their self-driving car, but they've got different sensors on board to make a map of the area and then they've got code on board to decide what is something that should be reported back.""

""They've got thermal imaging if you need. They've got chemical sensors, licence plate recognition software [and] facial recognition software,"" said Stambaugh. ""It looks kind of like a large Roomba. And so instead of looking for dust bunnies it's looking for, you know, criminals.""

K5s to hit the market in 2015

According to Stambaugh, the robots will be hitting the market starting 2015.

""What the company Knightscope is trying to do is to lease these out on a per-hour basis,"" said Stambaugh. ""So $6.25 an hour they'll lease you one of these K5s and that's about half the price of the average security guard.""

There are many advantages to a robot over a human patrol.

""They'll work triple shift, 24 hours a day. The battery is supposed to last around a day and when it runs out they go back to a charging carpet and in 20 minutes they are charged up again.""

Stambaugh also said the robots do not have any weapons, but that may change in the future.

""Basically what it's doing is calling back to a manned response centre if something is going wrong,"" he said."

The e-commerce giant will roll out a new ad-supported streaming offering early next year that will be separate from its $99-a-year Prime membership, which includes a video service, sources said.

The ad-supported option — part of an overhaul of its media offerings — poses a serious challenge to streaming rivals such as Hulu and Netflix, analysts said.

“If they do an ad-supported service, they will decouple it from Prime and that is a Netflix killer,” Wedbush Securities analyst Michael Pachter said. “It won’t be $99 a year.”

Pachter suggested Amazon would undercut Netflix’s current monthly price of $7.99.

“Who wouldn’t switch if you were poor or you’re a cord-cutter?” he added.

Although it will be separate from Prime, the ad-supported service is ultimately a bid by Amazon to lure people to eventually pay up for Prime membership, said one ad source familiar with Amazon’s plans.

“The main point is to bring in more users that you can eventually up-sell to Prime, or to get to a broader audience that doesn’t want to pay for Prime, in order to increase their video share,” the source said.

The Wall Street Journal reported in March that Amazon was weighing such a move, but sources confirmed that it’s a definite go.

Amazon is prepping a new attack at a time when its video service is gaining ground, sources said. Amazon doesn’t disclose the number of Prime members, but RBC Capital analyst Mark Mahaney estimates it has 50 million global customers.

While Prime’s big draw has been two-day shipping, about half of Prime subscribers use the video service that is included with it, or around 25 million, sources said. By comparison, Netflix has 33 million domestic subscribers.

A recent Sandvine study also shows that Amazon is making major strides — but has a long way to go before catching Netflix. Amazon’s broadband traffic on fixed networks grew from 1.61 percent to 2.58 percent, the study showed. One change is that Amazon snagged popular HBO content, including “The Wire,” “True Blood” and “Boardwalk Empire.” Netflix accounts for 32.39 percent of aggregate traffic.

Rumors have been rampant that Amazon plans to let advertisers into its media ecosystem. Amazon has already experimented with ads in some shows, according to tech site Re/code.

For advertisers, the service could be the Holy Grail in terms of targeting. In theory, Amazon could tell if ads viewed online led to purchases on its retail site.

The news that Nielsen will start rating shows on subscription video services starting with Netflix is likely to encourage advertisers who want to make the leap without forcing Amazon to give up its own data.

Amazon will also have leverage over content producers when it comes to the way it chooses to promote shows and movies within its growing ecosystem, a Hollywood source said.

This Is What The Sun Baby From 'Teletubbies' Looks Like Now

18 years is a long time to keep a secret, and first-year dance education student Jess Smith couldn’t hold her tongue any longer.

""So I've recently celebrated my 19th birthday and after a lot of thought, I've decided it's time to tell everyone,” Smith wrote on Facebook. ""I used to hide it but after a lot of encouragement from my friends at university, I've gained the confidence to come out with it. I am the sun from Teletubbies. There has been quite a few people pretending to be 'the sun' but only I could tell you the real story.""

Smith’s ""Teletubbies"" revelation that she was the laughing sun baby that watched over Tinky-Winky, Dipsy, Laa Laa and Po in Teletubbyland, comes on the heels of the news that the BBC will make 60 new episodes of the television show.

A lot has changed since the British TV series first aired in March 1997. For one, actors will likely be paid more than the £250 and box of toys Smith was paid back then.

Smith’s decision to break her silence was prompted by an assignment at Canterbury Christ Church University, when students were supposed to reveal something about themselves that no one else would guess.

“I thought I may as well tell them as I’m going to be spending the next three years with them,” Smith told The Telegraph.

So how did the show’s producers get Smith to laugh for her signature shot? They didn’t. Her father Bill, a furniture deliver, made her laugh by playing with a teddy bear off camera.

“They just sat her in front of a camera and she just laughed and smiled at her dad,” her mother Anji Smith said.

Even though almost two decades have passed, Smith’s smiling face hasn’t changed a whole lot.

As the BBC prepares to make 60 new episodes of the hugely popular Teletubbies, the laughing tot in the sun – who featured in all 365 programmes – is now 19 and a university student.

At the age of nine months, Jess Smith was selected to be the giggling Baby Sun who looks over Teletubbyland.

The news will come as no surprise to people who have known Jess for a long time, but she said it is not something she really talked about as she was quite a shy child and “everyone knowing would have been a bit scary”.

The former Chatham South and Horsted Primary School pupil made the decision to tell people during her first week at university, when they all had to say something about themselves that no one else would guess.

She said: “I thought I may as well tell them as I’m going to be spending the next three years with them.”

Jess, a first-year dance education student at Canterbury Christ Church University, then broke the news on Facebook.

She wrote: “So I’ve recently celebrated my 19th birthday and after a lot of thought, I’ve decided it’s time to tell everyone. I used to hide it but after a lot of encouragement from my friends at university, I’ve gained the confidence to come out with it.

“I am the sun from Teletubbies. There has been quite a few people pretending to be ‘the sun’ but only I could tell you the real story.”

In 1996, her mother, Anji Smith, took her to Edenbridge Hospital to be weighed and a health visitor, who had been asked by Ragdoll Productions to find smiley babies, put Jess’s name forward.

Mrs Smith said it was never intended to be a big thing: “It was just something a bit different to do and we didn’t expect it to be as big as it was.

“They just sat her in front of a camera and she just laughed and smiled at her dad. We didn’t hear anything until we got a letter when she was 18 months old saying she’d been picked. It was really weird seeing her on television.”

And as no one could predict the success of the show, Jess was paid just £250 for filming and given a box of toys to take home.

Jess Smith, from Chatham, Kent, was selected to be the giggling baby sun who looks over Teletubbyland when she was just nine months old.

The show was a global hit and Miss Smith, a first-year dance education student at Canterbury Christ Church University, became one of the most famous faces in the world - but only her family knew it was her.

Jess Smith (pictured left and right as a baby) was chosen as the giggling baby sun who looks over Teletubbyland when she was just nine months old - but kept her role a secret for 19 years

There were rumours the true identity of the baby was another Jessica Smith - the 27-year-old star of American teen soap Laguna Beach.

But Miss Smith has finally gone public and spoken for the first time about her role in the TV show which featured characters Tinky-Winky, Dipsy, Laa Laa and Po.

Miss Smith only revealed her secret during a game with her university friends - where they all had to say something about themselves that no one else would guess.

She then used Facebook to confirm it was her - and photos show she still has the same cheeky face.

Miss Smith said: 'I thought I may as well tell them as I'm going to be spending the next three years with them. My mother is really chuffed.'

Miss Smith added: 'Everyone says they can see the likeness between my face now and me as a baby. I still have a baby face. I haven't changed much either. I am still giggly.'

Miss Smith posted a picture of a letter her parents received from Courtyard Productions in Four Elms, Kent, on June 17, 1996, on Facebook proving she was the baby - not the American TV star Jessica Smith.

She said: 'I'm not sure why the actress is claiming to be the face or why people think she is.

'She would have been 10 at the time of filming - and she doesn't even look like the baby.

'My neighbours said I should put everyone right as they would be annoyed if it was them. But I wasn't that bothered until I told my uni friends.

'I am not sure why they picked me - I assume because I was more giggly than everyone else.'

She added: 'I do remember watching the Teletubbies when I was a child.

'When I was young I used to laugh along with the sun but it was only when I got older that I understood it was me.

Her name was put forward when her mother Anji Smith, 44, a recruitment consultant, took her to be weighed at Edenbridge Hospital, Kent.

A health visitor had been asked by Ragdoll Productions to find smiley babies.

Miss Smith was put in a high chair for the filming so she would be looking down like the sun.

Her father Bill, 49, made her giggle by playing with a teddy bear behind the camera.

As no one could predict the success of the show, Jess was paid just £250 for filming and given a box of toys to take home.

Delighted Mrs Smith said: 'It was just something a bit different to do and we didn't expect it to be as big as it was.

'They just sat her in front of a camera and she just laughed and smiled at her dad.'

Miss Smith said she is not disappointed by her small payment of £250.

The production company also sent the family a video of her performance and told them when the first show would be aired on TV.

She said: 'I am sure I loved the box of toys.

'No one knew how big the show was going to be so we didn't get offered royalties. '

She added: 'People told my mum that I should have gone into modeling but she thought it wasn't the right move to make as I was quite shy.'

Luckily Jess' little sister Lucy, now 17, hadn't been born when she took part in the filming so there were no arguments over who got the part."

Does Jess Smith look familiar? If so, it's probably because she's still recognisable as the Teletubbies sun baby - almost 20 years after she starred in the kids' show.

After 19 years, the student has finally broken her silence and outed herself as the the baby face in mega-popular children's TV show.

She was selected to be the giggling baby sun, who looks over Teletubbyland at the age of nine months.

The show was a global hit and Jess, now 19, became one of the most famous faces in the world - but only her family ever knew it was her.

There were even rumours the true identity of the baby was another Jessica Smith - the 27-year-old star of American teen soap Laguna Beach.

But Jess has finally gone public and spoken for the first time about her iconic role in the TV show, which featured characters Tinky-Winky, Dipsy, Laa Laa and Po.

Jess only revealed her secret past during a game with her university friends - where they all had to say something about themselves that no one else would guess.

She then used Facebook to confirm it was her - and photos show she still has the same cheeky face.

Jess said: ""I thought I may as well tell them as I'm going to be spending the next three years with them.

""My mother is really chuffed.""

The first-year dance education student at Canterbury Christ Church University then made the news public on Facebook.

She wrote: ""So I've recently celebrated my 19th birthday and after a lot of thought, I've decided it's time to tell everyone.

""I used to hide it but after a lot of encouragement from my friends at university, I've gained the confidence to come out with it.

""I am the sun from Teletubbies.

""There has been quite a few people pretending to be 'the sun' but only I could tell you the real story.""

Jess added: ""I am really happy, cheerful and giggly. When I told my friends they said they could see me in the sun baby face.""

Jess' name was put forward when her mother Anji Smith, 44, a recruitment consultant, took her to be weighed at Edenbridge Hospital, Kent.

A health visitor had been asked by Ragdoll Productions to find smiley babies.

Jess Smith, 19, was just nine months old when she became one of the most familiar faces on British television in March 1997.

As the BBC prepares to make 60 new episodes of the Teletubbies, the laughing tot in the sun, who featured in all 365 episodes, has now revealed herself.

Jess was selected to overlook Teletubbyland as Tinky-Winky, Dipsy, Laa Laa and Po had fun below.

Her decision to come out and 'say hello' came after her first week at Canterbury Christ Church university, when students were told to say something about themselves that no one else would guess.

After holding back due to shyness, she eventually said: ""I thought I may as well tell them as I'm going to be spending the next three years with them.""

Jess, a first-year dance education student, then broke the news on Facebook.

In 1996, her mother, Anji Smith, 44, took her to Edenbridge Hospital to be weighed and a health visitor, who had been asked by Ragdoll Productions to find smiley babies, put Jess's name forward.

Mrs Smith said it was never intended to be a big thing: ""It was just something a bit different to do and we didn't expect it to be as big as it was.

Sometimes just quitting your job isn’t enough, sometimes you have to make a lasting statement on the way out. That’s exactly what one iPhone game developer did in the game ‘Electric Boogie’ by dumping all over his boss and Apple.

In the iPhone game ‘Electric Boogie’ one developer managed to sneak in a few hidden animations of the characters banging each other, something that would be strictly forbidden by Apple, as well as a message to what he deemed to be his shitty boss. It’s basically the single greatest letter of resignation ever…only it’s not a letter at all, it’s a hilarious game animation that’s likely to get pulled by Apple as soon as they find out:

The legitimacy of the note, which is noteworthy for its egalitarian tone, has been called into question – but we can now confirm its authenticity.

Advertisement

UPDATE: LEGO has responded to our request for comment, and the note is authentic. See below for details.

A photo of the note was posted to imgur yesterday by redditor fryd_, where it's received a lot of attention. It's also gained purchase on Twitter. As of this posting, this tweet by @henrywarren has been retweeted over three-thousand times:

Advertisement

Pretty great, right? We think so, too. So do a lot of other people. But the legitimacy of the note has been called into question. ""Not because the message is bad, but I'd be skeptical about the authenticity of this,"" reads one of the top comments from the original post. On Twitter, others have flagged the note's typesetting and LEGO logo as anachronistic. At Boing Boing, Rob Beschizza wonders aloud how likely it is ""that Lego would have used a proportional Times-esque typeface—with such sloppy layout—in the early 1970s.""

There's also the lack of evidence from the original photographer, who writes:

I had no idea this would blow up so much, so didn't take more photos but this was at my partner's Grandma's house, on the back page of a pamphlet that came with a set from 73 she still has. There was a blonde girl on the front with a white Lego house. Sorry I don't have more info...

So – is it a fake? Probably not! Update: Most definitely not! It took LEGO a little while to get back to us, but Roar Rude Trangbæk of LEGO corporate communications has confirmed to io9 that the document is real:

Is the text authentic? Yes, the text is from 1974 and was a part of a pamphlet showing a variety of LEGO doll house products targeted girls aged 4 and up from the 1970’s The catalogue was included with select sets in the doll house series in 1974. The text remains relevant to this day – our focus has always been, and remains to bring creative play experiences to all children in the world, based on the LEGO brick and the LEGO system – ultimately enabling children to build and create whatever they can imagine. This is visible today across the entire product range from the LEGO Group – every LEGO product is based on the LEGO system and this creative building experience.

I've also included the evidence we originally presented in the leadup to LEGO's official response:

The logo in the note is the one you would expect to find in a LEGO pamphlet from the seventies, and is subtly but noticeably different from the more modern LEGO logo, which was updated in 1998:

As for the doubts raised regarding the note's font and layout, there's plenty of evidence that LEGO used Times-like font and sloppy typesetting in the 1970s.

But the most compelling evidence of all comes in the form of several scans, made of the German version of the same 1974 LEGO pamphlet. Here's the corresponding page:

Here's Google's translation of the analogous excerpt, which begins at the end of the first paragraph:

Whether boy or girl, LEGO sets no limits to the imagination. A girl builds a spaceship. A boy plays with the doll's house; because a dollhouse is human. Playing with a spaceship, however, is more interesting and exciting. But the important thing is that you get the right match material in the hands. Only then you can feel free to create and play.

It's worth pointing out that this is not the only example of LEGO's egalitarian marketing techniques from this time period. Consider the now-famous ad pictured below, which originally ran in 1981:

LEGO's shift toward more gender-targeted marketing strategies – beginning in the late seventies, and ramping up in the mid-eighties – has also been well-documented by Anita Sarkeesian in her two part series on LEGO and Gender:

Its more recent gaffes not withstanding, LEGO has taken a number of steps as of late to bridge the gender gap in its minifig sets.

Most of them involved convincing my parents to name me Hermione or stockpiling on what I called ""giant, lonely people cookies"" you could make in the microwave that got discontinued a few years ago. But today I discovered, after reading a LEGO notice to parents from the 1970s, that I have one more reason to want to travel back in time. The note is short but sweet, and manages to nail gender stereotyping taboos that parents still struggle with today. It urges parents to remember that imagination is more important than skill, and that boys and girls should be encouraged to create whatever they want to create. LEGO, bless you.

What I love more than anything about the note is that it manages to convey all of this without sounding like it was condescending to either gender. We have seen failed attempts at this before from LEGO, for its lack of female mini figurines and for the misrepresentation of female careers like journalism revolving around ""being pretty"" more than the actual, you know, job. Even now that LEGO has started creating sets more oriented toward girls, it has seemed a little problematic that it feels the need to make them pink or frilly. Only recently did the company seem to be returning to the roots of the message it put out in the '70s with the creation of female scientist minifigs, which was, unsurprisingly, one of LEGO's top-selling products.

Here is the note that I wish LEGO had kept in mind over these last few decades:

This is not a revolutionary concept, not imposing gender stereotypes onto young children, but it's still a thing that happens more often than not, and I am glad to see LEGO making strides to reclaim this kind of representation. Hopefully one day, we'll realize that equal representation in toys shouldn't take too much work. Women are people — represent them that way and the products will sell.

A letter that supposedly accompanied Lego boxes in 1974 has been making the rounds on the Internet this week. The letter reminds parents that ""the urge to create is equally strong in all children...boys and girls."" Take a look:

Imgur

The letter was first posted by Reddit user fryd_, who said he unearthed the letter ""with his niece and nephew at their Grandma's house"" in a box with a ""blonde girl on the front with a white Lego house.""

If real, this letter perfectly aligns with Lego's history of egalitarian advertising that hasn't pigeonholed its products to just boys.

But like everything on the Internet, the legitimacy is being questioned. The writers at iO9 are less skeptical, pointing to the letter's use of Lego's 1970s logo, which is slightly different than the one used presently. As for further evidence for authenticity, Lego's ads in that era used similar fonts. Lastly, there's a German version of the letter that reads almost identical to this one.

The evidence is convincing that it's legitimate and it would be a bizarre thing to fake. It's a compelling statement to make for the 1970s — and more importantly, it still holds true today.

Reddit / fryd_ True then, true now.

The pamphlet’s authenticity was questioned after it went viral over the weekend, but Lego spokesman Roar Rude Trangbæk confirmed to Quartz that the document is real, and was included with a series of Lego dollhouses. (If the dollhouse figures look a little strange in the photo above, it’s because Lego’s iconic “minifigure” wasn’t invented until 1978.)

“The pamphlet was contained in the product line regarding Lego dollhouses, it was targeted primarily at girls age four and up,” he said in a phone interview. “To us it’s expressing what we’ve always been about, which is about encouraging creative play.”

Lego became the world’s biggest toymaker this year, due in large part to the enormous success of The LEGO Movie. But it has also drawn criticism from fans for its reliance on licensed products from the Star Wars franchise and other Hollywood properties, and it has struggled at times to appeal to girls as well as boys. One seven-year-old girl wrote a letter to the company complaining about the girl-oriented Lego Friends: “All the girls did was sit at home, go to the beach, and shop, and they had no jobs but the boys went on adventures, worked, saved people, and had jobs, even swam with sharks.”

Trangbæk argued that Lego Friends, which is now two years old, along with the company’s many Hollywood-themed toys, all share a common DNA with classic Lego sets, including the 1974 dollhouses.

“It’s not about what type of play we’re offering, it’s all about children having the materials in their hands to create whatever they want,” he said. “When you open the box, it’s just Lego bricks.”"	Forty years ago, Lego wrote a powerful letter to parents about how gender works		['Adam Pasick']	['girls', 'powerful', 'dollhouses', 'lego', 'went', 'ago', 'true', 'gender', 'letter', 'parents', 'wrote', 'pamphlet', 'jobs', 'friends', 'boys', 'weekend', 'works']	"A Lego pamphlet from 1974, unearthed and posted on Reddit this weekend, has some advice for parents that rings true 40 years later:Reddit / fryd_ True then, true now.

According to a post on the online community platform reddit.com, Lego sent a message addressed “To parents” inside the box of assorted building blocks, explaining how “the urge to create is equally strong in all children… boys and girls”.

TRUE

Example: [Collected via e-mail, November 2014]



LEGO released letter in the 1970s about gender and creativity. Just wanted to see if this was accurate. It sure smells like a fake.



Origins: On 22 November 2014, an image originally posted on Reddit showing a letter from The Lego Group to parents started circulating on the Internet:

The image quickly went viral, but many viewers were skeptical about its authenticity. According to the Reddit user who uploaded the photo, the Lego letter was printed on the back of a pamphlet that came with a set from 1974:



To Parents To Parents The urge to create is equally strong in all children. Boys and girls. It’s the imagination that counts. Not skill. You build whatever comes into your head, the way you want it. A bed or a truck. A dolls house or a spaceship. A lot of boys like dolls houses. They’re more human than spaceships. A lot of girls prefer spaceships. They’re more exciting than dolls houses. The most important thing is to put the right material in their hands and let them create whatever appeals to them.



Emma Owen, part of Lego’s public relations team in the UK and Ireland, confirmed the Redditor’s story on 24 November 2014 in a statement to the Telegraph:



The text is from 1974 and was a part of a pamphlet showing a variety of Lego doll house products targeted girls aged 4 and up. The text remains relevant to this day. Our focus has always been, and remains to bring creative play experiences to all children in the world, based on the Lego brick and the Lego system, ultimately enabling children to build and create whatever they can imagine.



Owen said that Lego letter was attached to a pamphlet included with a variety of doll house products in the 1970s. The Lego sets were aimed at girls, but the company wanted to ensure parents knew the toys were also suitable for boys:

Publishing house Condé Nast have just moved into a new home at 1 WTC - the tallest skyscraper in the Western Hemisphere - and there's a nasty problem occurring, according to Page Six.

The reported rodent situation - which was first reported by People back in November - isn't going away. But according to Page Six, Vogue boss Anna Wintour is determined to ignore it.

A source told Page Six that editors noticed a rat on the loose in the office - so they informed their notoriously frosty fashion boss, as you would.

But Wintour allegedly told the staff: ""I don’t want to hear about it.""

A different source also told Page Six that the rat problem is ongoing.

However, another Vogue source denies that there's a rodent presence in the Vogue offices, telling Page Six: ""That conversation never happened.""

Rats still roam at Vogue!

We’re told by several insiders that staffers at the fashion bible are still seeing rodents at Condé Nast’s new 1 WTC digs, which are still under construction.

A source told us editors spotted at least one critter this week under a desk, and immediately notified Anna Wintour.

“They were petrified, and told Anna, ‘We found rats under our desk,’” a source claims. “One said, ‘There’s a rat on top of my desk.’”

But Wintour replied, “I don’t want to hear about it,” according to our source. A different source also told us there’s “still a rat problem” at the office.

But a Vogue insider insisted there’s no rat issue and Wintour did not dismiss employees’ concerns. “That conversation never happened,” the source sniffed.

Vogue was one of the first glossy titles to move into Condé’s new downtown headquarters, but the rodents seemed to have beaten Wintour and her team to the tower’s 25th and 26th floors.

An insider quoted in People magazine in November said, “The girls that work there see the droppings everywhere. It’s nasty.” Reports say the magazines have issued an edict not to eat at desks to help starve out any Rodentia.

Some felt spooked by the tragic history of the site. They didn’t reckon on rats.

But one month after decamping from their old HQ off Times Square, the glamorous crews of titles like Vogue and Vanity Fair are waging a daily battle against a positive rat rampage. All employees have been banned from eating at their desks for fear of dispensing inadvertent treats to the roaming rodents.

Sources have told the Daily News that Vogue editor Anna Wintour, who likes a world of red carpets and sparkle not droppings and thick tails vanishing into cracks, has refused to show up in her office until the problem is bought under control.

While rat sightings are common in New York City’s ageing subway system, few would have imagined their invading a building as brand new and prestigious as One World Trade. But there they are, it seems, in ever multiplying numbers, happily scaling what is now the tallest building in the Western hemisphere.

""They ate through his rug to fit under his door."" Another disgusted staff member told the paper that the rats at Vogue had essentially “taken over”.

Pests are now 'taking over' the newly-developed New York City premises and Anna Wintour no longer wants to step foot inside at all, reports claim.

This week, after rat droppings were allegedly found on an editor's computer keyboard, staff of all Conde Nast's titles were issued with a new rule: no eating at your desk.

New digs, big problem: While the US Vogue offices are moving to 1 World Trade Center in New York City, Anna Wintour may not be making the transition anytime soon

'A bunch ate through the ceiling of a sports editor's office and crawled all over his desk and left poops on his keyboard,' a source told the New York Daily News.

'They ate through his rug to fit under his door.'

After numerous failed extermination attempts, the city's health authority has now been notified.

The setback means staff are unlikely to see the eponymous magazine editor in the building until well into the new year.

That's one famous mover: The Instagram feed for the Conde Nast owned publication showed rapper Will.i.am carrying boxes for them

According to Gawker, Wintour, 65, has allegedly informed her staffers that the vermin must be removed before she sets foot in their new home.

The staff member told Gawker the most pressing dilemma facing them had to do with fashion: 'A serious concern (laughable but I guess it makes sense) is all the clothing that could get nibbled through.'

The timing of the infestation comes after Vogue created an online campaign advertising their move to the new offices: 'Batten the hatches, lower Manhattan, because we're coming for you.'"

Pests are now 'taking over' the newly-developed New York City premises and Anna Wintour no longer wants to step foot inside at all, reports claim.
This week, after rat droppings were allegedly found on an editor's computer keyboard, staff of all Conde Nast's titles were issued with a new rule: no eating at your desk.
The setback means staff are unlikely to see the eponymous magazine editor in the building until well into the new year.

You might want to sit down.

Radar, for example, said that the rats are actively shitting on staffers’ desks and other belongings:

According to insiders, the pesky rodents have invaded the infamous accessories closet and made their presence known by leaving droppings on desks, computers, and pricey couture! ... “The famed accessories closet, which was being put together with the designer wares from the old office, was taking shape when the rats got into it,” the source revealed. “There were droppings all over the floor, and some of the shoe boxes had been chewed into.”

People magazine, meanwhile, suggested that the magazine’s employees are literally surrounded by rat droppings:

“It’s true,” an insider confirms to PEOPLE. “The girls that work there see the droppings everywhere. It’s nasty.”

How did the rodents penetrate the fashion bible’s new office? Radar confirmed what we’ve heard from at least one other source: The rats let themselves in via 1WTC’s ventilation system:

“The rats appear to have gotten in via the venting, which was being worked on even as staffers were moving in,” the source explained. “Walls were being moved to accommodate last-minute design changes by Anna and Condé Nast, and it’s assumed this is how the rats got in.”

What we currently lack, however, are photos of the damage. So: are you a Vogue staffer affected by the current rat crisis? Send us an email. Anonymity guaranteed."

They are both crawling with rats! Sorry to ruin your pre-Thanksgiving appetite. Last Friday, Gawker reported that Vogue 's new digs at 1 World Trade Center were rat-infested, and it seems the problem is only getting worse.

According to Gawker's sources, there are so many rats swarming the Vogue offices on the 25th and 26th floors of the building (click through for a handy map of 1WTC provided by New York Magazine's Daily Intelligencer) that Anna Wintour herself refuses to set foot inside until her office has been officially cleared of rodents. Radar Online reported that the rats got in through vents that are still under construction due to some last-minute changes requested by Wintour herself.

As if the image of these fuzzy critters running amok throughout the most stylish office in the world wasn't hilarious enough, there's more: the rats found their way into the magazine's fashion closet and are having a field day pooping on handbags and gnawing on couture. Does that not sound like the delightful plot of Disney's latest animated film?

""The famed accessories closet, which was being put together with the designer wares from the old office, was taking shape when the rats got into it,” a source told Radar. “There were droppings all over the floor, and some of the shoe boxes had been chewed into.”

Ewwww. As much as I love reading Vogue, I find the concept of rats running loose throughout the office, leaving droppings wherever they please, perversely satisfying. It's just too perfect, almost as if Harper's Bazaar staffers decided to play a little joke on their fellow fashion authorities (they definitely didn't, I just made that up).

Too bad the rats don't realize how lucky they are when they're cozying up with some Jimmy Choos in the accessories closet. A million girls would certainly kill for that job, indeed!

RadarOnline.com has learned that New York City’s dirtiest rats have rolled out the red carpet to welcome Anna Wintour and Vogue staffers to their swanky new offices at the Freedom Tower. According to insiders, the pesky rodents have invaded the infamous accessories closet and made their presence known by leaving droppings on desks, computers, and pricey couture!

“The office is over-run and the Vogue staff is secretly whispering that the rats could be cosmic payback for Anna’s decision to put Kim Kardashian and Kanye West on the cover,” a Vogue staffer revealed. “There was so much backlash, and now this!”

Condé Nast and Vogue recently decamped from Times Square to the new digs at One World Trade Center, and the move has not gone off without a hitch.

Vogue occupies floors 25 and 26, and “this is where the rats have taken up residence,” a source said. “Condé Nast has floors 20 through 44, but the rats are confined to the Vogue floors only. Hey, New York City rats are smart: they know where the good stuff is!”

“The famed accessories closet, which was being put together with the designer wares from the old office, was taking shape when the rats got into it,” the source revealed. “There were droppings all over the floor, and some of the shoe boxes had been chewed into.”

“The rats appear to have gotten in via the venting, which was being worked on even as staffers were moving in,” the source explained. “Walls were being moved to accommodate last-minute design changes by Anna and Condé Nast, and it’s assumed this is how the rats got in.”

Now, the source said, “A strict no food or drinks policy at people’s work stations has been issued until the infestation is gone.” (The source said pin-thin Wintour does, in fact, normally allow staffers to eat in the office.)

But meanwhile, “It’s very unnerving to come to work in the morning, and find rat droppings on computers, and desks!” the source said. “Anna isn’t amused and top pest control experts have been hired to get the problem dealt with quickly.”

Gawker, which broke the story, says Wintour has told assistants that her pristine office must be rat-free before she enters.

New York City rats are notorious for being able to survive floods, snow storms, and any other force of nature….have they finally met their match in Anna?”

According to Radar Online, some of the dirtiest rats have decided to move into Anna’s new office for herself and Vogue staffers at the Freedom Tower.

Insiders claim that rodents invaded the beloved accessories closet, leaving an abundance of rat droppings all over their pricey couture, computers, and desks. Further reports claim that the decision to put Kanye West and Kim Kardashian on the cover of Vogue magazine may have something to do with the infestation.

“The office is over-run and the Vogue staff is secretly whispering that the rats could be cosmic payback for Anna’s decision to put Kim Kardashian and Kanye West on the cover. There was so much backlash, and now this!”

As previously reported by the Inquisitr, critics were not very happy with Anna Wintour and the Vogue staff making the “disgusting” decision to place the reality starlet and her husband on the cover. The couple was photographed for the April 2014 cover by Anne Leibovitz.

Vogue and Condé Nast relocated from Times Square to One World Trade Center. However, the rat infestation has not made the Vogue relocation as smooth as they would have liked – especially since reports claim that the rats are only located on the Vogue floors of the building.

“There were droppings all over the floor, and some of the shoe boxes had been chewed into… The rats appear to have gotten in via the venting, which was being worked on even as staffers were moving in. Walls were being moved to accommodate last-minute design changes…and it’s assumed this is how the rats got in.”

Even though Anna Wintour usually allows employees to eat and drink inside of the office, reports claim that a strict policy restricting food and drinks has been issued and enforced until the infestation problem is resolved.

Gawker, the media outlet that initially broke the story, reports that Anna Wintour refuses to even enter her office until it is in pristine condition and completely freed of its rat infestation.

Anna Wintour has made headlines recently by expressing how she felt about the Kim Kardashian and Kanye West cover shoot experience. Huffington Post reports that Wintour even hopes that “another Kim Kardashian comes along this year.”

In her own words, Anna Wintour did not feel that the cover photo was “disgusting” at all. On the contrary, she believes that it was touching and charming."

The fashion bible’s got a decidedly unglamorous rat problem.

The new 1 World Trade Center offices of Vogue magazine are infested with rodents and editor-in-chief Anna Wintour is not happy, according to a report.

The 25th- and 26th-floor digs of the Condé Nast publication are overrun with vermin, and Wintour has ­issued an edict to staffers to clear her glass-walled office of the long-tailed pests before she steps a stiletto heel on the premises.

Luckily, Wintour is not expected to take up full-time residence at America’s tallest building until after the New Year.

A Vogue employee wrote to Gawker Friday afternoon to say that there are so many creatures scuttling around 1 WTC that the editorial department may be postponing its move from the old Times Square offices.

“A serious concern (laughable but I guess it makes sense) is all the clothing that could get nibbled through,” the staffer said.

Vogue tracked its downtown relocation in a special online story declaring, “Batten the hatches, lower Manhattan, because we’re coming for you.”

The mag’s Instagram account has photos of models and singer Will.i.am hauling boxes.

The article describes the moving scene as a “living Lego set of natty Hermès-colored Rent-a-crates” at 4 Times Square.

Busybodies in a chatroom on the Web site SkyscraperCity.com delighted in the vermin problem that has brought a highbrow publication to a new low.

“Security couldn’t even stop BASE jumpers from ­entering the building and leaping from the top. You think they could stop some rats?” a commenter named “4npower” wrote.

Another commenter, “Lady­Amanita,” speculated that the scourge is overblown.

“Rats probably wouldn’t want to live on the 25th and 26th floors of a high-rise,” she wrote, adding, “It’s possible that they have mice and freaked-out Condé Nasties are confusing their rodents.”"	WTC rats scare off Anna Wintour	2014-11-21 00:00:00	['November']	['share', 'windowclick', 'vermin', 'wintour', 'wtc', 'wrote', 'stop', 'vogue', 'times', 'rats', 'anna', 'rodents', 'opens', 'scare']	"Click to email this to a friend (Opens in new window)Click to share on Twitter (Opens in new window)Click to share on Facebook (Opens in new window)The fashion bible’s got a decidedly unglamorous rat problem.

He was a member of the Sugarhill Gang, famous for their hit ""Rapper's Delight""

The 1979 song was the first rap tune to reach the Top 40 on the U.S. charts

A member of the Sugarhill Gang, whose pioneering hit ""Rapper's Delight"" brought hip hop to mainstream audiences 35 years ago, died Tuesday of complications from cancer.

""Big Bank Hank,"" whose real name was Henry Jackson, died early Tuesday in Englewood, New Jersey, according to David Mallie, who manages the two surviving Sugarhill Gang members. The New York native was 57.

A beefy, boisterous presence onstage, Hank handled vocals in the early to middle portion of "" Rapper's Delight ,"" which despite its extended length -- one version was more than 14 minutes long -- became the first rap song to reach the Top 40 on the U.S. Billboard charts.

Jackson traded rhymes with bandmates ""Wonder Mike"" Wright and Guy ""Master Gee"" O'Brien and spoke some of the song's catchiest lines, including ""Ho-tel, mo-tel, Holiday Inn/If your girl starts acting up, then you take her friend.""

Wonder Mike and Master Gee issued a statement Tuesday:

""Big Bank Hank"" spoke some of the catchiest lines from ""Rapper's Delight,"" including ""Ho-tel, mo-tel, Holiday Inn/If your girl starts acting up, then you take her friend.""

""So sad to hear about our brother's passing. The 3 of us created musical history together with the release of Rapper's Delight. We will always remember traveling the world together and rocking the house. Rest in peace Big Bank.""

The three friends were unknown MCs when producer Sylvia Robinson recruited them to record the song for her rap label, Sugar Hill Records

Released in fall 1979, ""Rapper's Delight"" became a novelty hit and a staple at dance clubs well into 1980. It was born from the emerging New York hip-hop scene of the late '70s, in which young rappers gathered in clubs and exchanged rhymes over instrumental breaks from popular songs, most notably Chic's hit ""Good Times.""

""Rapper's Delight"" also borrowed its bass line and other flourishes from ""Good Times,"" prompting threats of legal action by Chic co-founders Nile Rodgers and Bernard Edwards. After a settlement, Rodgers and Edwards were listed as co-writers of the song.

""It felt like a new art form,"" Rodgers said later of ""Rapper's Delight."""

It was in Henry “Big Bank Hank” Jackson’s lyrical wobble, the way he rapped through the Sugarhill Gang’s “Rapper’s Delight,” the singular hit that propelled a movement when it was released in 1979.

Jackson, 57, died Tuesday morning after complications from cancer, but his influence remains.

The news was confirmed by David Mallie, the business manager for the two surviving members of the original Sugarhill Gang, Guy “Master Gee” O’Brien and “Wonder Mike” Wright.

“They say that miracles never cease, I’ve created a devastating masterpiece,” rapped Big Bank Hank on “Rapper’s Delight,” a boast that codified one of rap’s central themes -- self-aggrandizement. Little did he know at the time how accurate he was, and that through said devastation Hank was introducing a flow that in the decades to come would move through culture one boasted rhyme at a time.

As seen on a widely circulating YouTube clip in performance on a local dance show, Big Bank Hank performs with a violet Kangol-style hat and a too-tight T-shirt. The hearty emcee grooves as he rhymes (lip-synced though it may be), lost in music with a fluid pelvic wobble. Next to the more restrained Wonder Mike and Master Gee, he is rap-funk personified. Hank embodies his verse as he raps of out-lasting Superman with a funny line belittling the superhero’s manhood. It’s no match for Hank’s “super sperm.”

“I’m here, I’m there, I’m Big Bank Hank, everywhere,” he raps. Again, he had no idea how true that was, though he witnessed the music’s evolution over the following decades as the hip-hop style he helped popularize become a form as vital to the ever-evolving story of American music as jazz and country and western.

This line, from the same verse, part of a larger bit involving a sexy reporter, further underscores his import: “She said she’s heard stories and she’s heard fables/That I’m vicious on the mike and the turntables.” That little turn of phrase carved into wax rap’s ongoing love-affair with turntables and microphones.

In the formative “Apache,” the Gang harnessed the titular brass and bongo breakbeat while they shouted, “Tonto, jump on it! Kemosabe, jump on it!” Big Bank Hank then made another claim: “I’m the one who shot Jesse James!”

To call the Sugarhill Gang the “big bang” of hip-hop diminishes the contributions of an entire community that imagined the music at its inception. Big Bank Hank, after all, got his start in the business as a bouncer and managing an act that would become the Cold Crush Brothers. He landed a spot in the Sugarhill Gang when the late music executive Sylvia Robinson tapped him to be part of a pop-oriented rap trio she was putting together.

Jeff Chang’s essential history of hip hop, “Can’t Stop, Won’t Stop,” describes the song as standing out amid party-oriented rap of the time due to the group’s birth as a studio creation.

Writes Chang, “Their raps on ‘Rapper’s Delight’ were the stuff that sounded good not in the parties, but on the live bootleg cassettes playing in the OJ cabs and on the boom-boxes --- the funny stories, the hookish slang, the same kind of stuff that would strike listeners around the world as both universal and new, not local and insular.”

“Rapper’s Delight” is considered the best selling 12-inch single of all time, though that’s tough to confirm in the era before Soundscan began in 1991 (and various litigation involving the track’s unapproved sampling of Chic’s “Good Times” further blurred the issue of numbers).

As happened with most first-generation rap teams (and second-, third-, fourth- and fifth-), Sugarhill Gang failed to sustain a bankable post-hit career, and didn’t receive royalty checks equal to its influence. In the years following the track’s success, the style morphed in dozens of different directions, though, becoming politicized through Grandmaster Flash and the Furious Five, electro-fied through Afrika Bambaataa and popularized through Run-DMC and the Beastie Boys.

Reverse engineer virtually any rap song since, and the circuitry leads back to ""Rapper’s Delight,” and by extension, Big Bank Hank. His phrasing, his fluid, funky tone, has endured, passed down from rapper to rapper, an invisible but essential presence.

The performer, real name Henry Jackson, died from kidney complications due to cancer, according to reports.

Jackson formed the Sugarhill Gang with Master Gee and Wonder Mic, having a big hit in 1979 with Rapper's Delight.

The record sold several million copies worldwide and helped establish rap as the genre it is today.

The full version of Rapper's Delight ran nearly 16 minutes long and was recorded in a single take.

The song - famous for its ""hip, hip, a hop"" refrain - featured 'Big Bank' introducing himself as ""six foot one and tons of fun"".

The trio continued to perform together and spent three weeks in the UK singles chart in 1982 with The Lover In You.

Jackson's death was reported by website TMZ and confirmed to Fox News by David Mallie, who manages the two remaining band members.

The music world is mourning the death of rapper Big Bank Hank, who delighted fans and changed the course of hip-hop with the Sugarhill Gang's 1979 classic, Rapper's Delight.

Big Bank Hank, who was born Henry Jackson but was also known as Imp the Dimp, died early Tuesday after a battle with cancer, according to TMZ.

David Mallie, who manages the group's two remaining living members, told Fox News that Jackson died from kidney complications due to cancer. Mallie confirmed the news to USA TODAY, saying that he had seen Hank ""several times"" over the last several years and that his health had been declining as he went through chemotherapy and dialysis treatments.

Wrote DJ Funkmaster Flex on Instagram.

""Rest in peace... Big Bank Hank... Hip hop pioneer dies of Cancer .... Legend... Sugarhill gang August 5th-1957 / Nov11th-2014 ..... InFlexWeTrust.Com,"" wrote Flex.

Said Hank's fellow Sugarhill Gang members, Michael ""Wonder Mike"" Wright and Guy O'Brien, known as Master Gee:

""So sad to hear about our brothers passing. The three of us created musical history together with the release of Rapper's Delight. We will always remember traveling the world together and rocking the house. Rest in peace Big Bank.""

Before Rapper's Delight became a multiplatinum hit — one of the first rap songs played on the radio and the first hip-hop single to become a Top 40 Billboard chart hit — rap music was seldom heard outside the neighborhood block parties of its Bronx birthplace.

Sylvia Robinson, founder of Sugar Hill Records, brought together the Englewood, N.J.-based trio of Big Bank Hank, Wonder Mike and Master Gee in 1979 for the label's debut record to capitalize on the new trend. In doing so, what began as a novelty song, with the catchphrase ""hip hop and you don't stop"" and lyrics chanted over a repetitive bass-line, gave rise to a new music genre that has since exploded worldwide.

Hip Hop Wired.com notes that Rapper's Delight wasn't just a catchy hit song. It was ""the song is considered the moment that hip-hop became commercially viable.""

The information about the aborted Led Zeppelin reunion tour came from an exclusive report in Britain’s Daily Mirror newspaper, which said that the 66-year-old Plant — who during the 1970s heyday of Zeppelin was one of the world’s most successful and recognizable rock stars — simply didn’t believe it was “the right thing to do.”

“They have tried to talk him round but there is no chance,” said an anonymous source said by The Mirror to be close to Robert Plant. “His mind is made up and that’s that.”

According to the Mirror story, the other two surviving members of Led Zeppelin — guitarist Jimmy Page, 70, and 68-year-old bass player/musical arranger John Paul Jones — had already signed their mega-contracts and were ready to set out on the tour, which would have taken them to London’s O2 Arena as well as Berlin and New Jersey.

But Plant just wasn’t into it.

Jason Bonham, the 48-year-old son of original Led Zeppelin drummer John Bonham, has also signed on to play drums as a salaried musician on the Zep reunion tour.

Led Zeppelin formed in 1968 and were considered the biggest rock act in the world through the early and mid-1970s. But they broke up in 1980 after John Bonham died in his sleep at age 32 following a heavy drinking binge.

Jason Bonham played drums with Led Zeppelin for the band’s one-off reunion performance during the Ahmet Ertugun Tribute Concert in 2007. Ertugun was the record label boss who signed Led Zeppelin to Atlantic Records, sight unseen, launching the then-unknown band’s meteoric career.

Branson, according to the Mirror, guaranteed the band more than $900 million to be split among the three original members, for the proposed Led Zeppelin reunion tour.

Plant’s share alone would have nearly tripled his current, already-formidable net worth, which is reported at $170 million.

According to the Mirror’s source, Page, Jones, and Bonham were stunned by Plant’s refusal to take part in the tour.

“It was a no-brainer for them but Robert asked for 48 hours to think about it. When he said no and ripped up the paperwork he had been given, there was an enormous sense of shock,” The Mirror quotes the source as saying. “There is no way they can go ahead without him.”

Led Zeppelin fans can still get their dose of the legendary band through an ongoing series of remastered reissues of the original Led Zeppelin albums, a project being coordinated by Page."

British tycoon Sir Richard Branson had planned to reunite the Stairway to Heaven rockers and promoters had even gotten the green light from the other band members.

The mega deal would have paid Plant, Jimmy Page and John Paul Jones roughly $346 million apiece, before taxes, according to The Mirror.

Group members lobbied hard for Plant to join in but he wouldn’t change his mind.

“They have tried to talk him round but there is no chance,” a source close to the group told The Mirror. “His mind is made up and that’s that.”

A big payday would have also gone to Jason Bonham, 48, the son of late drummer John Bonham.

The 35 shows would have been split between London, Berlin and a site in New Jersey, according to The Mirror.

Robert Plant didn’t have a whole lotta love for this deal.

He and the other living founding members of legendary hard-rock band Led Zeppelin were about to ink an $800 million contract with Virgin Atlantic billionaire Richard Branson to play a reunion tour, but the iconic band’s singer ripped the contract to shreds in the final moments, a report said.

Founding members Jimmy Page and John Paul Jones signed on immediately when the flamboyant investor offered the Rock and Roll Hall of Famers the staggering amount to perform just 35 tour dates in three locations including London, Berlin and New Jersey, according to the UK’s Mirror.

But Branson was left stunned when the 66-year-old Plant tore the agreement to pieces right in front of the concert promoters, the newspaper said.

“There was an enormous sense of shock,” a source told the Mirror. “He said no and ripped up the paperwork he had been given.”

Guitarist Page and bassist Jones were all set to perform along with drummer Jason Bonham, who has filled in for his late father, John Bonham, in the past.

They gave their cranky frontman two days to think about the historic reunion, and he turned into a real heartbreaker for fans who have dreamed of another reunion tour.

“It was a no-brainer for them, but Robert asked for 48 hours to think about it,” the source said. “They have tried to talk him ’round, but there is no chance. His mind is made up and that’s that.”

And it’s not likely that the band can hire a replacement for Plant’s unique voice.

“There is no way they can go ahead without him,” the source said.

Branson, a tremendous fan of the ’70s rock band, reportedly pulled out all the stops to get the “The Song Remains the Same” rockers back on stage together.

The founder of Virgin Group was planning on renaming one of his jumbo jets “The Starship” and having the craft ferry the stars around to their gigs.

He was even going to have the staircase of the jet renamed the Stairway to Heaven after the band’s landmark hit.

“Even his money was not enough to get Plant to sign up,” the source said, adding that the tycoon was very upset by the singer’s diss.

The band last played together, with Jason Bonham filling in on drums, during a tribute concert at London’s O2 arena in 2007.

The band has been notoriously cranky about whether it would ever reunite, with Plant even calling one reporter a “schmuck” during a press conference in 2012."

Christian Bale is in line to play Jobs himself, the famed technology guru who died on 5 October 2011 of cancer. The Oscar-winning writer of Facebook movie The Social Network, Aaron Sorkin, is writing the screenplay for Britain’s Danny Boyle to direct.

Rogen’s appointment is said to be in no way a done deal, especially given that Bale has not yet signed on the dotted line. The Canadian star of This Is the End and Neighbours is best known for his work in comedic fare, and would be taking a rare step into the dramatic spotlight with the untitled biopic.

Sorkin’s take is effectively the “official” Jobs biopic, since it adapts the bestselling official biography of the technology icon, Walter Isaacson’s Steve Jobs: The Exclusive Biography. Isaacson’s book is based on more than 40 interviews with its subject conducted over two years, as well as interviews with more than 100 family members, friends, adversaries, competitors and colleagues.



A rival biopic, titled Jobs, was released in 2013 with Ashton Kutcher as the Apple founder and Josh Gad as Wozniak. It received mostly negative reviews and was not a hit at the box office."

Danny Boyle of Slumdog Millionaire, 28 Days Later, and Trainspotting fame will direct the drama—which at one point was going to be a David Fincher affair—and it sounds like the whole film will offer a somewhat unconventional approach to the life of this tech icon.

Sorkin told Business Insider earlier this year: ""It's not a biopic."" Okay! So, that already sets it apart from the Ashton Kutcher joint. But also: ""It's not the story of Steve Jobs—it's something much different than that."" It's been rumored that the whole film will be three looong backstage scenes set right before big product launches, so maybe that means an epic walk-and-talk sequence that spans the full feature-length?

Other actors haven’t been announced for the Steve Jobs film, but Scott Rudin Mark Gordon and Guymon Casady have been tapped as producers, with shooting rumored to start in Spring of 2015."

Variety reported on Oct. 15 that Bale was in talks to star in “Jobs,” Sony’s biopic about the late Apple co-founder. Writer Aaron Sorkin recently confirmed the Bale casting.

Jessica Chastain is being eyed for an unspecified role.

Based on Walter Isaacson’s biography “Steve Jobs,” the real-life drama is directed by Oscar-winner Danny Boyle.

Scott Rudin is producing the tech drama along with Mark Gordon and Guymon Casady.

Sorkin, who also penned the Facebook drama “The Social Network,” has publicly said the movie will be divided into three long scenes, each taking place backstage before one of Apple’s famous product launches.

Sony acquired rights following the Apple mogul’s death in 2011.

Wozniak founded Apple with Jobs and Ronald Wayne and is credited with launching the Apple I and Apple II computers in the late 1970s, which had a profound impact on the microcomputer revolution. He left Apple as a full-time employee in 1987.

Last year’s independently financed “Jobs” starred Ashton Kutcher as Jobs and Josh Gad as Wozniak and covered the era from 1974 to 2001 when the iPod launched. Worldwide box office was modest at $36 million.

Rogen starred this year in Universal’s “Neighbors” and will be seen next with James Franco in Sony’s “The Interview.”

Metro police Lt. Mark Reddon says officers responded to a call of an accidental shooting shortly after 2:30 p.m. Tuesday.

Reddon says Canseco told police he was cleaning his gun in the kitchen when it fired, shooting a finger on his left hand. He was taken to University Medical Center of Southern Nevada.

Agent Jose Melendez says Canseco was resting at home Wednesday, and friends and family were hoping his finger would respond well to a surgery.

Canseco played 17 years in the major leagues, starring for the Oakland Athletics as one of the ""Bash Brothers"" in the late 1980s. He was part of the A's 1989 World Series championship team and last played for the Chicago White Sox in 2001.

The right-handed outfielder and designated hitter had 462 career home runs and was a six-time All-Star. He also played for Texas, Boston, Toronto, Tampa Bay and the New York Yankees.

He later admitted to performance-enhancing drug use, with his 2005 book, ""Juiced: Wild Times, Rampant 'Roids, Smash Hits & How Baseball Got Big,"" amplifying MLB's doping issues.

Canseco Tweets About Shooting Incident

Jose Canseco may have accidentally shot himself, but the former slugger is staying positive about the situation as evidence by the string of tweets he unleashed on Monday:

Unfortunately for Canseco, eBay rules prohibit the ability to sell human body parts:

We don't allow humans, the human body, or any human body parts or products to be listed on eBay, with two exceptions. Sellers can list items containing human scalp hair, and skulls and skeletons intended for medical use.

Over the last year, however, the center of gravity of the organization has shifted, as Omidyar and his Silicon Valley braintrust have exerted control over budgets and vacillated over the journalistic mission. Over the summer, Omidyar appointed a longtime confidante, John Temple — a former newspaper editor who previously led an Omidyar-financed civic journalism venture in Hawaii — to be the president for audience and products, putting him in a position above Eric Bates, the former Rolling Stone editor who was brought on as a First Look editorial director, who is close to Taibbi.

Matt Taibbi is taking a ""leave of absence"" from Pierre Omidyar's First Look Media, according to New York Magazine . The move comes ""after disagreements with higher-ups inside Omidyar's organization, a source close to First Look confirmed today.""The ""leave of absence"" also comes three months after I first reported that Omidyar had apparently ordered Taibbi to change his strategy away from purely covering corporate fatcats (like, uh, Pierre Omidyar) to a wider mission, involving more comedy than reporting. Around the same time I heard rumors that Eric Bates was also unhappy at the organization.

I've previously had a... uh... spirited email conversation with Taibbi about both claims, although Taibbi would only engage on the condition that his words were ""not for publication"" -- a strange demand coming from an editor at a site that's about leaking confidential documents. I emailed Taibbi again today to ask if I can publish his responses in the light of today's news. He replied: ""No, you may not.""

Here then, for what little it's worth, is my side of the correspondence, from back in July, in which I laid out the state of First Look as I saw it (with a little help from some well placed sources.) The discussion was... uh... spirited on both sides. All words below are mine -- you'll just have to try to infer what Taibbi's stated position might have been.

A note on not for publication / off the record: I thought carefully about the ethics of publishing even my half of a ""not for publication"" conversation. Given First Look's own policy of publishing confidential documents and the fact that it seems clear Taibbi wasn't being entirely truthful about his place at the company, I ultimately came down on the side of publishing my own responses, with Taibbi's words redacted. I'm sure some readers with disagree -- I welcome the discussion.

Also, an important disclosure: Taibbi previously worked with Pando's Mark Ames on Russian ex-pat newspaper, the Exile. It has been widely reported that the two are no longer on speaking terms. I didn't discuss this post with Mark before publishing.

Ok, here are the emails...

[The email thread began with Taibbi's emailing me to deny that Omidyar had changed his strategy. I had emailed First Look for comment on my story before publication but received no reply. Taibbi's email was headed ""Not for publication.""]

From: Paul Carr To: Matt Taibbi Date: Tue, Jul 29, 2014

[Redacted Taibbi quote, denying my story]

Right, but that's not the part that seems to have changed. What's changed is that Omidyar's description of the site yesterday made zero mention of wall street. It's gone from finance first to politics first.

More broadly, and happy to stay off the record, there's clearly something weird going on over there. Why does a 250m journalism project have to shift focus before it's launched? It suggests PO has no clue how to handle talent and so is retreating back to technology. [Taibbi responded, with questions of his own. Here's my reply...]

From: Paul Carr To: Matt Taibbi Date: Tue, Jul 29, 2014

I don't think [Omidyar] took you aside and ordered you not to cover his friends. I think either you made the decision yourself for reasons of an easier life, or his blog post was the first you heard about the change and he just publicly fucked you over. Knowing what I do about his management style I'm leaning towards the latter. But I emailed you because I actually want to understand what's going on. [Taibbi responded again. And I replied again...]

From: Paul Carr To: Matt Taibbi Date: Tue, Jul 29, 2014

[Redacted.]

If I waited for Pierre and his staffers to respond to questions I’d never publish a thing about First Look. I’ve given PO 48hrs to respond before, and still got nothing. I’m sure you’ve always held stories indefinitely until you receive a response?

As for your bizarre chain of straw man arguments — I didn’t say he’d hired you to shut you up. So, no, I don’t [believe] something you just made up. As you say, that would be real [redacted] analysis.

Here’s what I believe…

I don’t think Pierre has any idea why he hired you, and I don’t think you’re entirely sure either. Perhaps he was looking for names that looked good on a press release and you fit the bill. I think you’re tired, and I think you knew the Rolling Stone gig wasn’t going to last for ever. I think PO offered you complete editorial freedom and promised you a blank check to build your own team. For that reason, I think Omidyar’s announcement yesterday should be terrifying to you, and to anyone else who works at FLM. He’s lost his nerve — for a combination of reasons — and is retreating to something he understands: Technology and platforms. I’ve spoken to people who have known Omidyar for decades and people who have worked with him on previous publications — if you seriously think he’s going to have your back when you go after his pals you’re more naive than… well, than you are.

I’m tired of this conversation now. I honestly can’t tell if you’re being a team player, or if you believe any of this crap. I’m sure I’ll continue to cover FLM and I’ll continue to ask for comment when I do. It’s entirely up to you if you respond before publication or wait until afterwards and then bitch on Twitter. Either way, I’ll continue to read your Wall St stuff if/when you publish it — just as I read, and enjoyed, your most recent book on a long flight a few weeks back.

Best of luck,

Paul [Taibbi responded again.]

From: Paul Carr To: Matt Taibbi Date: Wed, Jul 30, 2014

I’m tired of it because you refuse to actually engage in conversation. I’ve laid out my position, clearly and honestly, and asked follow up questions. You won’t actually address any of my points — you just keep lobbing back straw men and not engaging with what I’m saying. At the very least you’ve turned into a corporate flack for First Look: Continuing to hammer away at a caricatured version of what I said, while refusing to answer questions, and demanding that the whole thing stay off the record so that readers continue to be left in the dark. The last person who tried that line of attack over a Pando story was Lanny Davis.

[Redacted]

I’ve told you what I believe, but I’ll humor you — and your enjoyment at playing PR flack — by saying it again, this time line by line…

[Redacted Taibbi quote]

I think it’s unlikely Pierre *ordered* you to stop writing about Wall Street. I’d say the odds [are] almost zero. He’s not that fucking stupid. Here’s what I said ""No, of course I don't think he took you aside and ordered you not to cover his friends. I think either you made the decision yourself for reasons of an easier life, or his blog post was the first you heard about the change and he just publicly fucked you over.”

Here’s my question, which you don’t seem keen to answer: Did you know Pierre was going to leave finance out of his post about what your editorial mission would be? If not, doesn’t that worry you? If so, what is the reasoning behind not mentioning the thing that you are best known for but which is likely to make your sole funder and boss the most uncomfortable?

A follow-up question: What are we to make of the fact that First Look journalists — Greenwald in particular — insist that Pierre has no control over editorial (indeed you’ve insisted similar in this conversation) and yet he’s the one laying out the company’s editorial plan? Why wouldn’t that be the job of the actual editors? Instead we have your $250m funder issuing a statement that marginalizes the one aspect of your work that might sting him while reassuring the world that — don’t worry! — he intends to permit you and Greenwald to continue doing your jobs, but that he has decided to axe plans for all the other editorial sites he previously (in a video starring him) said he would fund. What does the phrase “editorial independence” actually mean at First Look?

[Redacted Taibbi quote]

I think that’s what he told you when you were first hired, yes. People are told lots of things on first dates.

[Redacted Taibbi quote]

I’ve never said otherwise. That’s a total red herring.

[Redacted Taibbi quote]

[Redacted] I didn’t mention anything in my story about Pierre ordering you to stop writing (because, as I’ve made clear, I don’t believe that would make any sense); I didn’t mention what I suspect you might have been told when you were hired (because, again, I don’t know. What I know — and what I wrote — is that the public statements about your mission have changed); I didn’t mention it being a satirical publication because that hasn’t changed.

[Redacted Taibbi quote]

A press release about what your job and focus will be, written by the man who writes your pay checks and who is backing down on almost all of the editorial strategy that was in place when you were hired. A press release that was at odds with all previous statements about what your focus will be; specifically leaving out the one thing that would seem to have the potential to make Omidyar most concerned. Yes, I believe that means you will be focussing far less on that aspect of things and, yes, I believe that it’s either a choice you’ve consciously made, or a choice Pierre is attempting to make for you through passive aggressive public messaging.

Your choice of denial is interesting. ""[Redacted]"" That’s the same line Greenwald used when he was challenged on whether he would write about Pierre’s business interests. Clear enough to sound like a denial, but general enough to allow you to focus most of your energies away from Wall Street.

Do you at least concede that previously the chief focus of your site was to be on finance and now it’s on politics and “culture”? If the *main focus* of the site still on uncovering financial corruption? Yes or no? If yes, why did your boss mischaracterize the site so badly in his blog post, and if no, why not?

[Redacted Taibbi quote]

Pierre has been interfering with First Look’s editorial plans from the start. Every single editorial plan First Look has exists only at Pierre’s pleasure. He is your sole funder and he is the one making public statements about how he intends to allocate those resources. How is it possible you understand Wall Street so well but don’t understand that?

[Redacted Taibbi quote]

Yes, that is what’s apparent from Omidyar’s statement.

[Redacted Taibbi quote]

I had plenty of information, and printed what I knew, after giving you the opportunity to respond before publication. I’d have plenty more information to set the record straight if you’d answer any of the questions above. Or better still, stop hiding behind “not for publication.” Why, if you’re being so unfairly maligned, won’t you let any of the above be shared with readers? Isn’t the whole basis of First Look to make all the information public and let readers decide? Why doesn’t that apply to conversations about First Look and its billionaire owner?

Which leads me to my last question: Have you, or any first look staffer to the best of your knowledge, signed an NDA or non disparagement contract — either as a standalone or as part of your employment contract(s)?

You’re right, this is an enjoyable conversation! Now let’s shift it up a gear and get to some real answers.

Paul Despite previously saying he was enjoying our conversation, Taibbi stopped responding when I asked him he had signed any kind of contract restricting his freedom to talk openly about First Look.

When I emailed him earlier today, I asked if he had anything to add to his previous comments. He replied: ""Just that your story was wrong then and still is."""

Matt Taibbi on leave of absence from First Look Media

Journalist Matt Taibbi is on a leave of absence from First Look Media after disagreements with executives, New York Magazine's Andrew Rice reports.

Taibbi is supposed to launch a publication this fall called Racket, focused on financial and political corruption. According to Rice, Taibbi has been absent for several weeks from the New York headquarters of eBay founder Pierre Omidyar's media company, which also hosts Glenn Greenwald's The Intercept. Omidyar hired Taibbi away from Rolling Stone in February.

""Taibbi's absence, the term of which is unknown, is only the latest in a series of shifts inside First Look,"" Rice reports. ""Omidyar initially committed $250 million to the project and began laying plans for a large general interest website and a number of more narrowly focused 'digital magazines.' In July, the billionaire announced he was scaling back the plan for the time being, choosing instead to focus on Racket and the Intercept as prototypes for a new technological model of journalism.""

While the Intercept has been publishing regularly, Racket has been ""slower to materialize, leading to rumors of staff anxiety,"" Rice reports.

John Temple, president of audience and product at First Look Media, told Rice that he won't comment on personnel matters.

Matt Taibbi, the star magazine writer hired earlier this year to start a satirical website for billionaire Pierre Omidyar’s First Look Media, is on a leave of absence from the company after disagreements with higher-ups inside Omidyar’s organization, a source close to First Look confirmed today. (UPDATE: Taibbi has left the company. See statement below.)

Taibbi’s abrupt disappearance from the company’s Fifth Avenue headquarters has cast doubt on the fate of his highly anticipated digital publication, reportedly to be called Racket, which First Look executives had previously said would launch sometime this autumn.

When he was hired, amid much fanfare, Taibbi’s website was meant to be the second in an envisioned fleet of titles to be published by First Look, an ambitious digital journalism company funded by Omidyar, the founder of eBay and one of the richest tech moguls in America. Like its counterpart the Intercept, launched earlier this year by Glenn Greenwald and others to pursue investigations of NSA surveillance and the intelligence world, it was a venture centered around a brand-name polemicist without much management experience. Prior to joining First Look, Taibbi made his name by gleefully skewering fat targets for Rolling Stone — most famously, he described Goldman Sachs as “a great vampire squid wrapped around the face of humanity” — and he said at the time of his departure that he was lured away by the chance to lampoon the financial industry in the “simultaneously funny and satirical voice” associated with the legendary magazine Spy. Over the succeeding months, the mission of the publication broadened to encompass political satire as well, and it brought on a number of high-profile names from the New York digital scene, including deputy editor Alex Pareene, formerly of Salon; Laura Dawn, a digital video producer who formerly worked with Moveon.org; and Edith Zimmerman, editor of the Hairpin.

“Journalists should be dark, funny, mean people,” Taibbi told New York in an interview in March. “It’s appropriate for their antagonistic, adversarial role.”

Omidyar originally conceived of First Look as a network of interlinking sites run by “independent” journalists, many of whom took a similarly adversarial approach to journalism. Over the last year, however, the center of gravity of the organization has shifted, as Omidyar and his Silicon Valley braintrust have exerted control over budgets and vacillated over the journalistic mission. Over the summer, Omidyar appointed a longtime confidante, John Temple — a former newspaper editor who previously led an Omidyar-financed civic journalism venture in Hawaii — to be the president for audience and products, putting him in a position above Eric Bates, the former Rolling Stone editor who was brought on as a First Look editorial director, who is close to Taibbi. The confrontational approach that made Taibbi’s name at Rolling Stone — and before that, as a co-founder of the gonzo Moscow expatriate magazine The eXile — appears to have contributed to internal trouble at First Look.

Sources confirmed that Taibbi has been absent from the office for several weeks, only returning on one brief occasion to address the staff. Although those hired have been reassured that the project would continue on during the unspecified term of Taibbi’s absence, the launch date for Racket — which Taibbi indicated in September would be coming “in a month” — now appears to have been pushed off.

“We have a target date but I wouldn’t make a launch date public,” said Temple, who is based in San Francisco, when reached by phone this morning. “I don’t comment about internal matters and I don’t comment on personnel matters. … I mean we’re a private company, so why would we … no.”

Taibbi’s absence is only the latest in a series of shifts inside First Look, which Omidyar founded last year, originally in response to the disclosures of NSA surveillance leaked by Edward Snowden to Greenwald and his Intercept colleague Laura Poitras. Omidyar initially committed $250 million to the project and began laying plans for a large general interest website and a number of more narrowly focused “digital magazines.” In July, the billionaire announced he was scaling back the plan for the time being, choosing instead to focus on Racket and the Intercept as prototypes for a new technological model of journalism. The Intercept has lately been publishing vigorously, breaking several major stories — federal investigators are reportedly pursuing the alleged leaker responsible for a story on the site about the government’s voluminous terrorist watch list. But Racket has been much slower to materialize, leading to rumors of staff anxiety.

In August, Temple told me Taibbi’s site was experimenting with a variety of journalistic approaches — not just satire and humor but also investigative journalism. For instance, Ellen Miller, head of the campaign finance watchdog the Sunlight Foundation — a nonprofit also heavily financed by Omidyar — met with the staff over the summer to discuss how it might dig into issues of money in politics.

“We’re supporting Matt in creating something unique — and it’s Matt’s,” Temple told me. “He’s building a team and there’s great esprit in Matt’s team.”

Taibbi’s clashes with those at the top are likely to drive further speculation about the fate of the long-incubating project and about the journalist’s own continued involvement. Nonetheless, the site is apparently still hiring.

UPDATE: Omidyar announced on Tuesday night that Taibbi has left the company.

UPDATED: OK, we're somehow supposed to live on earth eating sandwiches and believing that a man who walks like Paul Rudd, wears Paul Rudd's face and (we assume) quacks like Paul Rudd is not actually Paul Rudd.

Vanity Fair reached out to the actor's reps, who denied that the man in the video was Rudd. We're calling shenanigans, because superheroes never want their true identities revealed.

So, update -- wink wink, nudge nudge -- the man in the video is definitely not Paul Rudd. Either that, or we have a much bigger clone problem on our hands than we initially assumed.

---

EARLIER: Look, we've always suspected that Paul Rudd was a super nice guy. While we would normally be suspicious of someone who doesn't age (seriously, take a look at ""Clueless"" and then remember that was 19 years ago), his adorable stories about teenage kegger antics, being too ripped for his ""Ant-Man"" costume and punnily helping people announce their impending offspring help keep those suspicions at bay.

And now a new video, coupled with a little bit of investigative Twitter journalism (twournalism), really drives the point home, hard. Recently a unnamed man went on a homophobic rant at the Dallas airport, eventually trying to get violent with the man he was yelling at. As he lashed out, a group of passers by tackled him and pinned him to the ground, restraining him until police could come and handcuff him. And guess what! One of those randos was none other than Paul Rudd.

Yep, keep an eye out for him in a blue checked shirt and olive-colored jacket, jumping on and holding the dude down. Wonkette has the backstory of how we figured out it was Ant-Man himself.

Just add this incident to the growing list of reasons we suspect Rudd is an actual superhero."

http://www.emergent.info/banksy-arrested-hoax	Claim: Anonymous street artist Banksy was arrested	false	[]	2014/10/20	emergent	['http://nationalreport.net/banksy-arrested-identity-revealed/#sthash.JBpE0Utc.dpuf']	http://nationalreport.net/banksy-arrested-identity-revealed/#sthash.JBpE0Utc.dpuf	http://nationalreport.net/	"London, England — The elusive graffiti artist, political activist, film director, painter and long time fugitive that for years has gone by the pseudonymous name of Banksy, was arrested early this morning by London’s Metropolitan Police. After hours of questioning and a raid of his London art studio, his true name and identity have finally been revealed.

The City of London Police say Banksy’s real name is Paul Horner, a 35-year old male born in Liverpool, England. The BBC has confirmed this information with Banky’s PR agent Jo Brooks along with Pest Control, a website that acts as a handling service on behalf of the artist.

London Police Chief Lyndon Edwards held a press conference to answer questions about Banksy and how Horner was finally apprehended after all these years on the run.

“We had a 24-hour Anti-Graffiti Task Force monitoring different groups where Banksy was known to frequent. We received word that around 2am a group of individuals left a flat speculated to be one of Banky’s art studios. This group was followed by agents and once vandalism had occurred, we then arrested the group, 5 men total. These individuals all had ID on them except for one, and that is the one we believed to be Banksy,” Edwards said. “We then raided the studio where this group was last seen leaving from. Inside we found thousands of dollars of counterfeit money along with future projects of vandalism. We also found a passport and ID of a Paul Horner who matched the description of the man that we are currently holding.” Edwards continued, “Horner is currently being held without bail on charges of vandalism, conspiracy, racketeering and counterfeiting. We are also holding the other four individuals whose names we are not releasing at this time.”

Horner was arrested by London Police in Watford, a town and borough in Hertfordshire, England, about 17 miles northwest of central London.

The graffiti artist that goes by the name Space Invader told reporters he does not agree with the arrest or outing of Banksy’s identity.

“He’s just doing art, spreading joy and making political statements the best way he knows how. That is what he was doing and I hope that is what he’ll continue to do,” Invader said. “For the London Police to setup some 24-hour task force just to catch Banksy is ridiculous. I hope we hear plenty of noise from the good tax-paying citizens of London about this.”

After today’s arrest it is unclear who else will be sought in connection with Banksy’s arrest. CNN spoke with John Hawes who is a project manager for Banksy says he is worried that charges could be brought against him also.

“If they spent this many man-hours and brought this many charges against Banksy, I can’t imagine that he’ll be the only one to go down in all of this,” Hawes said. “All the beauty Paul Horner brought to this world, unfortunately the London Police just see it as vandalism and want to lock him up. It’s such a shame.”

Banksy’s identity was long speculated to be Robin Gunningham, a man born in Bristol, England in 1973. Known for his contempt for the government in labeling graffiti as vandalism, Banksy displays his art on public walls and even goes as far as to build physical prop pieces. He does not sell his work directly; however, art auctioneers have been known to attempt to sell his street art on location and leave the problem of its removal in the hands of the winning bidder.

Police apprehended the famous street artist while in the middle of finishing a piece about a mascot for a Christian organization named Fappy The Anti-Masturbation Dolphin.

“I’m just happy to be a part of this whole thing,” Fappy told CNN. “I’m not familiar with this Banksy character, honestly if it’s not in the Bible I probably haven’t heard of it, but if this arrest spreads awareness of the harmful effects of self-rape, then that is a good thing. Hopefully news of this ordeal will bring the much needed attention to the dangers and consequences of playing with your sin stick or ringing the Devil’s doorbell. Hopefully, God willing, one day, masturbation will be illegal and people will finally be free of playing on the Devil’s playground. To find out more about finding a cure to this deadly disease, please visit STOP Masturbation NOW.”

Local resident 27-year old Matthew Williams told reporters he was disgusted when he heard news of the arrest.

“What a waste of taxpayers money. Wouldn’t it be better spent fighting the war against drugs or violence ? What harm has this man done except produce beautiful thought provoking artwork? The counterfeit money thing has either been planted or its part if his art and not actual real counterfeit cash.” Williams continued, “This is just another move by the Five-Oh to crush anything good and free. People need to work out what side they’re on and if they’re on the side of beauty and freedom, they need to start fighting back. There are simply not enough heroes like Banksy to do it for you. I hope this blows up in the cops’ faces and the rest of the government as well.”

One Of The More Memorable Quotes By Banksy

“People are taking the piss out of you everyday. They butt into your life, take a cheap shot at you and then disappear. They leer at you from tall buildings and make you feel small. They make flippant comments from buses that imply you’re not sexy enough and that all the fun is happening somewhere else. They are on TV making your girlfriend feel inadequate. They have access to the most sophisticated technology the world has ever seen and they bully you with it. They are The Advertisers and they are laughing at you.You, however, are forbidden to touch them. Trademarks, intellectual property rights and copyright law mean advertisers can say what they like wherever they like with total impunity. F*ck that. Any advert in a public space that gives you no choice whether you see it or not is yours. It’s yours to take, re-arrange and re-use. You can do whatever you like with it. Asking for permission is like asking to keep a rock someone just threw at your head. You owe the companies nothing. Less than nothing, you especially don’t owe them any courtesy. They owe you. They have re-arranged the world to put themselves in front of you. They never asked for your permission, don’t even start asking for theirs.”

In 2011, Banksy was a no-show to accept his Oscar for his documentary Exit The Gift Shop, though his artwork was seen all over Hollywood in days leading up to the awards.

As soon as news of the arrest was made, the City of London Police say they began receiving dozens of phone calls from people either claiming to be Banksy, or claiming to be with him. As of 6 PM London time, hundreds of people were gathered outside the London Police Department chanting “I’m Banksy!” and holding signs demanding his release. Various local news stations have reported witnessing the crowd parting for a blind woman who attempted to turn herself into authorities claiming that she was in fact the real Banksy.

Horner was born in Liverpool is a city in Merseyside, England, on the eastern side of the Mersey Estuary. Horner is currently being held without bail on charges of graffiti, public vandalism, criminal mischief, public indecency, resisting arrest, money laundering, criminal conspiracy and racketeering. More charges may follow.

This self-contradiction was encapsulated in the suspension of Bill Simmons for opining on what ESPN’s own reporting had concluded about the NFL.



In that spirit, ESPN will feature Monday night a Deep Meaningful on domestic violence (not the network’s first). But per Esquire’s Ben Collins:

The panel for that discussion will include the following people: Chris Berman, Cris Carter, Mike Ditka, Adam Schefter, Tom Jackson, Keyshawn Johnson, Jon Gruden, Mike Tirico, Stuart Scott, Steve Young and Ray Lewis. Up to 11 men, all between the ages of 39 and 74 will sit at the table for a domestic violence discussion on ESPN. Zero women. Victims of domestic violence in America are most likely to be women aged 20-24. When the show has updates from the field—brief reports about injuries and the upcoming game—they’ll cut to female sideline reporters, Lisa Salters and, on some weeks, Suzy Kolber. These people are not allowed at the table.

Collins reads this as part of a widespread practice at ESPN of marginalizing female voices, a tendency that enables the network to submit to the powerful league at the moments when it most needs its editorial independence. Read the full piece.

UPDATE 12:54 pm.: ESPN says there’s no there there:

Contrary to published reports in Esquire, there was no panel on domestic violence ever planned for tonight’s Monday Night Countdown. We will present our normal Monday Night Football pre-game show, with Suzy Kolber hosting and Lisa Salters reporting. ESPN is proud of the work it has done covering the issue of domestic violence, and is committed to continued coverage. Much of that work has been informed by several talented female colleagues from our television and espnW platforms, including Hannah Storm, Jemele Hill, Jane McManus, Kate Fagan, Sarah Spain and more.

The discussion will feature the opinions of up to 11 men and zero women, in a remarkable showing of the exact flavor of dumb meathead that ESPN is so adept at that it should trademark.

The panel was ostensibly was conceived of and approved of by several people who get paid money to do their jobs. Their jobs creating television programs that are good and informative. They are bad at their jobs. A domestic violence panel involving 11 men and 0 women when women constitute the vast majority of domestic violence victims is neither good nor informative.

Understandably, this has upset many people with brains that they use to think rather than promote ESPN programming, including Esquire's Ben Collins. Collins has had about enough of ESPN's blatant NFL defense. He argues that ESPN's pre-Monday Night Football man only domestic violence discussion is even more insidious when you consider just how pathetically cowardly and craven the network is.

[...] you will not hear these words: ""Roger Goodell is a liar."" You will not hear these words because ESPN has a $15.2 billion broadcasting agreement with the NFL. You will not hear these words because it would interfere with the amount of money both ESPN and the NFL can make. You will not hear these words because ESPN is not a company in the business of journalism. It is an entertainment outlet that sometimes reports convenient, timely information to drive interest in future programming. You will not hear these words because ESPN has intimidated its on-air staff into standing down against domestic violence.

The pre-game show was to run as normal, with a segment on domestic violence. We regret the error.

Actual women.

With ongoing outrage over the NFL's recent slew of scandals, it made perfect sense when ESPN announced it will hold a panel on domestic violence Monday night. But as the two organizations geared up this discussion about women and abuse in the world of sports, it quickly became painfully clear that women had been completely excluded from the table.

As Esquire's Ben Collins pointed out last week, the panel will consist entirely of male commentators, while female reporters will be literally sidelined in the discussion.

""Up to 11 men, all between the ages of 39 and 74 will sit at the table for a domestic violence discussion on ESPN. Zero women. Victims of domestic violence in America are most likely to be women aged 20-24,"" Collins wrote.

""When the show has updates from the field — brief reports about injuries and the upcoming game — they'll cut to female sideline reporters, Lisa Salters and, on some weeks, Suzy Kolber. These people are not allowed at the table.""

What an oversight. The utter failure to include a single woman in a discussion about domestic violence has already attracted a ton of criticism online:

But that's not all. While it might be easy to dismiss an incident like this as unintentional, Collins rightly points out that ESPN's track record on holding the NFL accountable is not that great. And why should it be, given the lucrative, multibillion-dollar partnership the two organizations enjoy?

""You will not hear these words because ESPN is not a company in the business of journalism. It is an entertainment outlet that sometimes reports convenient, timely information to drive interest in future programming,"" Collins writes. ""There are 11 seats at the table at ESPN. All of them go to men. Women get their own table, but only sometimes — and ESPN has placed that table where no one can hear them.""

This scandal has given ESPN the chance to decide whether it wants to be an outlet for responsible sports journalism or a profit-driven hype man for the NFL. And we may already have the answer."

A federal report released Monday reveals that the Manhattan clinic that treated Joan Rivers made numerous serious mistakes before her death. And it confirms that a selfie had been taken of a surgeon and the comedian while she was under sedation.

No names are listed in the report, but the description of that patient and the procedures she underwent match what's known about Rivers, including her age and the date of her appointment. CMS declined to say whether the patient referenced in the Yorkville Endoscopy is Rivers.

New York City's medical examiner found Rivers' cause of death to be brain damage due to lack of oxygen after she stopped breathing during an endoscopy on Aug. 28. She died Sept. 4 at age 81.

Among the major errors in the 22-page report, issued by the Centers for Medicare & Medicaid Services (CMS):, as noted by CNN:

• Failing to identify deteriorating vital signs and provide timely intervention.

• Failing to record Rivers' weight, prior to the administration of medication for sedation.

• Failing to consistently document the dose of Propofol, a sedative, administered.

• Failing to get Rivers' informed consent for each procedure performed.

• Failing to ensure that she was cared for only by physicians granted privilege in accordance with the clinic's bylaws.

• Failing to abide by its own cellphone policy (the report found that a photograph was taken of a surgeon and Rivers while she was under sedation).

Melissa Rivers responded to the news through her lawyers, telling USA TODAY is a statement she ""is outraged by the misconduct and mismanagement. Moving forward, Ms. Rivers will direct her efforts towards ensuring that what happened to her mother will not occur again with any other patient.""

Yorkville Endoscopy issued a statement, too, in response to the report, which is dated Sept. 5. According to CNN, the clinic says it has already ""submitted and implemented a plan of correction that addressed all issues raised. The regulatory agencies are currently reviewing the corrective plan of action and have been in regular contact with Yorkville. In addition, the physicians involved in the direct care and treatment referenced in the report no longer practice or provide services at Yorkville.""

Disgusting! Joan Rivers Doc Gwen Korovin's Sick Selfie EXPOSED — Last Photo Of Comic Icon, When She Was Under Anesthesia, At Center Of Medical Investigation

The world was outraged yesterday when RadarOnline.com confirmed that Joan Rivers doctor Gwen Korovin took a selfie in the operating room just moments before Rivers stopped breathing on the table. Now, only RadarOnline.com has all the details of the sick shot — and why investigators are now cracking down on the shady doc after Rivers’ tragic death.

Staff from Yorkville Endoscopy, the clinic where Rivers was treated, told medical investigators looking into the death of the 81-year-old that “Dr. Korovin took the selfie with her personal cell phone,” an insider tells Radar.

What’s more, an unconscious Rivers “was in the shot,” the source reveals. “She was under anesthesia at this point. Everyone in the operating room was just stunned as they had never witnessed anyone do that before.”

It was only a few minutes later that Dr. Korovin performed the unauthorized biopsy ​that preceded Rivers’ death.

“Joan never consented to the procedure,” the source says. “And Dr. Korovin never should have been in the operating room to begin with — certainly not to perform any procedure on Joan, since she didn’t have privileges to do so at the clinic.”

Medical investigators are now “eager to talk to Dr. Korovin about the events leading up to and after Joan’s death,” the source claims. “They will certainly be asking what the purpose of taking the selfie was for, and they will want to see it.”

Meanwhile, “Joan’s daughter Melissa has been telling friends that she is a spineless monster,” the source said.

Under the care of Dr. Lawrence Cohen, who performed the endoscopy on Rivers, and her E.N.T. Specialist Korovin, Rivers stopped breathing and later died.

Dr. Cohen, who doubled as the clinic’s medical director, has since parted ways with Yorkville. The clinic confirmed his departure, stating, Dr. Cohen “is not currently performing procedures…nor is he currently serving as medical director.”

The source added, “Melissa just can’t believe a doctor would be so cavalier, especially someone with Dr. Korovin’s credentials. Joan was completely vulnerable while under anesthesia, and for her privacy to be violated like that just makes Melissa sick.”"	Disgusting!

Explosive New Details Of Joan Rivers’ Medical Crisis: Doctor Snapped Selfie With Legendary Comic & Performed Unauthorized Biopsy While She Was Under Anesthesia!

Although Joan Rivers went to Yorkville Endoscopy for a routine procedure, her time spent there was anything but routine.

As RadarOnline.com has previously reported, Rivers’ female ear, nose and throat doctor stepped in once Dr. Lawrence Cohen, Rivers’ gastroenterologist, discovered something on her vocal cords. The ENT, who wasn’t authorized to perform any medical procedures at the clinic, took over and began a biopsy.

The biopsy was not authorized, as Rivers never signed a consent form. And once it began, her vocal cords began to swell, Anderson 360 revealed Tuesday night. But that’s not all. Not only was the ENT not supposed to be treating the comedienne, 81, at this time, medical staffers have also told investigators that the ENT snapped a selfie with the Fashion Police star while she was under anesthesia – a major violation of privacy, given she did not give her consent to have her picture taken.

Dr. Cohen, who doubled as the clinic’s medical director, has since parted ways with Yorkville. The clinic confirmed his departure, stating, Dr. Cohen “is not currently performing procedures…nor is he currently serving as medical director.”

As Radar has reported, Rivers’ daughter Melissa is now considering a lawsuit against the clinic and associated doctors.

A staffer at Manhattan’s Yorkville Endoscopy clinic said the doctor who performed a biopsy on Rivers’ vocal cords, right before her death, took a selfie while Rivers was under anesthesia.

It's believed that Rivers went into cardiac arrest during the unauthorized biopsy because of a lack of oxygen flow to her lungs. After that Rivers was taken to Mt. Sinai hospital where she passed away a week later.

The unidentified doctor is believed to be Rivers' ear-nose-throat doctor who was not certified to perform that procedure.

An investigation of the Yorkville clinic is still ongoing.

Rivers, who passed away a week following her emergency hospitalization on Sept. 4, was at the clinic for a routine endoscopy performed by gastroenterologist Dr. Lawrence Cohen. After Cohen assessed the Fashion Police host's throat to help diagnose her hoarse voice, Rivers' personal doctor, who according to CNN's source is not a throat specialist or certified to perform biopsies at the clinic, then performed a biopsy on her vocal chords without her consent.

Investigators believe that Rivers' vocal chords began to swell during the biopsy, cutting off her oxygen flow and leading to cardiac arrest.

Last week, Yorkville Endoscopy issued a statement denying reports that any vocal cord biopsy has ever been done at the clinic. In the statement, the clinic didn't mention Rivers' name due to confidentiality rules. A day after the denial was issued, the clinic also stated that Dr. Cohen had resigned from his position as medical director."

New information suggests that Rivers should not have gone into cardiac arrest on that fateful August day. According to Radar Online, Joan’s daughter Melissa is ready to take legal action against the clinic that performed a “routine endoscopy” that went terribly wrong.

“It’s become very clear to Melissa and experts she has spoken to that her mother didn’t have to die. This was a routine endoscopy that went wrong. Melissa has also been told that staff members at Yorkville Endoscopy revealed a shocking detail to medical investigators looking into Joan’s death — something occurred during the procedure that wasn’t medically related.”

Joan Rivers’ death was unexpected, and learning that she didn’t have to die is perhaps the hardest part. Many people suspect that something out of the ordinary happened when Joan was put under for her procedure, especially since her doctor (Dr. Cohen) parted ways with Yorkville Endoscopy right after the incident with Rivers occurred. Sources say that Melissa Rivers wants to wait until she learns her mother’s cause of death before she takes legal action.

“It was something related to Joan’s personal ear, nose and throat doctor and it wasn’t about the unplanned biopsy she did. Melissa will await the outcome of the official medical investigation and then absolutely file the lawsuits.”

According to CNN, staffers at the clinic revealed that Dr. Cohen took a selfie with Joan Rivers while she was under anesthesia. Also, Dr. Cohen reportedly took a biopsy of something that he found during the endoscopy without Rivers’ consent. It very well may have been the biopsy that caused Rivers to stop breathing.

“Investigators believe that Rivers’ vocal chords began to swell during the allegedly unauthorized biopsy, cutting off the flow of oxygen to her lungs, which led to cardiac arrest on the morning of August 29, the source said.”

As previously reported by The Inquisitr, Joan was rushed to Mount Sinai Hospital in Manhattan after a staff member called 911. Despite resuscitation efforts, Rivers was placed on life support when she was admitted to the hospital. There had been so many rumors about Joan “getting better” and “pulling through,” but once Melissa confirmed that her mom was on life support, the public sort of figured that things weren’t improving.

Rivers passed away on Sept. 4 (exactly one week after being admitted to the hospital) after being taken off life support.

Joan Rivers’ personal doctor snapped a selfie while the comedian was under ­anesthesia and the physician was about to perform an unauthorized biopsy that led to her fatal cardiac arrest, a report said Tuesday.

The doctor took the photo in the procedure room at Manhattan’s Yorkville ­Endoscopy before performing the procedure on Rivers’ vocal cords, according to CNN.

A staffer at the clinic told investigators about the doctor’s behavior, the cable-TV network said.

Rivers was at the clinic for an endoscopy to be performed by gastroenterologist Dr. Lawrence Cohen.

Cohen and the clinic’s medical director finished their work on Rivers before her unidentified personal physician took it upon himself to perform the biopsy, CNN said.

But before performing the unauthorized procedure, the doctor allegedly pulled out his camera to snap a picture of himself with the legendary star while she was unconscious, according to the network.

It was during the biopsy that Rivers suddenly went into cardiac arrest.

Investigators believe that her vocal cords began to swell during the biopsy on Aug. 29 and the flow of oxygen to her lungs was cut off, CNN said.

She died a week later."

http://www.emergent.info/nhl-vegas	Claim: The NHL will announce an expansion to Las Vegas in 2014	false	['Las Vegas', 'NHL']	2014/08/27	emergent	['http://www.theprovince.com/sports/Tony+Gallagher+Bettman+changed+tune+expansion/10150984/story.html']	http://www.theprovince.com/sports/Tony+Gallagher+Bettman+changed+tune+expansion/10150984/story.html	http://www.theprovince.com/	"It wasn’t very long ago that NHL commissioner Gary Bettman was treating talk of expansion as though he was being asked if he’d like an epidemic of Ebola.

But recently the nature of the rhetoric has changed so much that the question is becoming not if, but when.

And then the ultimate question. Will they be able to limit the number of new teams to just two?

Sources close to the situation have indicated Las Vegas is a done deal, the only thing to be determined being which owner will be entitled to proclaim that he brought the first major league sports franchise to Sin City.

And given how dead set against a team in the gambling haven the commissioner was 10 years ago, this move into another player friendly state-tax-free zone represents a considerable about-face indeed.

But people have been betting on hockey games for years and to pretend games couldn’t be fixed just as easily anywhere as in Vegas is pretty ridiculous, so that posturing has fallen by the wayside.

A new team close to the newly renamed Arizona squad and California’s big three is all but assured, the only question being when and with which other city. Or should that be plural?

With all the activity going on in the Seattle area in the last little bit it would be quite a stretch to imagine that much time and effort being spent by so many wealthy men being frittered away for nothing.

At the moment there are no surefire plans to build a new rink, but that could change at any time with Vancouver billionaire Victor Coleman among many reportedly showing interest in putting an NHL team into the city.

And Bettman hasn’t been visiting there to see if it really does rain a lot.

It’s been 15 years since the NHL expanded — and given there are 16 teams in the east and just 14 in the west, taking in two more teams would certainly seem to make a lot of sense, the same amount of sense it made when realignment was first announced.

And expanding without the players getting their mitts on any of the money other than the increase in payrolls is surely tempting, at least to those owners who remember the hefty cheques they cashed for Columbus and Minnesota.

Whereas before the commissioner balked at expansion, this is a sample of his more recent verbal footwork:

“There’s a lot of interest. We’re hearing from multiple groups in Seattle and in Vegas and Kansas City and Quebec City,” Bettman said to the Tribune while scoping out Target field in Minny for yet another trip to the well of outdoor games.

“We have not decided to engage in a formal expansion process but we listen to expressions of interest. It’s not something we’ve seriously considered yet.”

Like hell it isn’t. They’d have to be nuts not to be thinking about it seriously.

And since then things have changed for a commissioner who hates to move teams in his league no matter how dire the circumstances might appear — one of the most likable aspects of his regime for most hockey fans. Once the league comes to your area, it is going to stay through thick, thin and the almost impossible, as seems to be the case in Phoenix.

But could that long-standing policy and loyalty change with the Florida situation? True there’s a lease until 2028, but with the Panthers bleeding money, even the city of Sunrise can’t seem to see the point of carrying on much longer, so perhaps one of these new cities could get an existing team after all.

And while Kansas City isn’t really likely to be a serious contender in this expansion soup unless they’re going to stretch it to four teams, saying no to Quebec City in favour of two more U.S. cities with no proven NHL backgrounds is almost certainly not going to happen.

Going back to Minnesota has been a success, and there’s no question there’s more money and corporate backing than ever before in Quebec. Even an expansion team there in a new arena would be virtually assured of sellouts into perpetuity.

There will be all manner of bleating about there being insufficient talent, of course, but even if it’s true, after such a long wait this trivial detail — which only troubles the fans — isn’t going to get in the way of a financial windfall like this.

And any time the league decides it could use talent, they can start doing away with most of the coaches they employ whose chief calling in life is to devise ways to stop offensive players and choke the very life out of the game that’s paying their salaries.

Expansion will be happening, and soon. The only question is how many new cities will be involved.

North Korea’s dictator already has his restaurant branch across Asia going by the name of Pyongyang. The state-backed Pyongyang restaurants are recognized for being a luxurious and lavish experience. While customers dine, they are entertained by traditional Korean music and dance.

In the 1990s, Kim Jong Un opened his first restaurant near the China border. The ruler expanded his eating and entertainment establishment in Amsterdam in 2012. However, it was closed down and reopened under the name of Haedanghwa. With Kim Jong Un establishing a restaurant in Scotland, he may be able to gain more support for North Korea.

CNBC reports Jim Hoare, a Korea expert at the School of Oriental and African Studies (SOAS) in London, visited one of the restaurants in Asia. Hoare said the core intention of Kim Jong Un’s restaurants is to raise money and up the profile of the regime abroad.

Jim Hoare is aware that Kim Jong Un has a love of Swiss cheese and whisky. However, Hoare offers his explanation as to why he is especially surprised of the dictator’s choice of Scotland for a new Pyongyang restaurant location.

“Scottish food is very conservative and the idea of them taking to Korean food…I can’t think it is the obvious place to go. This type of restaurant is not aimed at the Korean community but aimed at rich foreigners who might want to spend money, and may be more suited to London.”

The Daily Mail’s coverage of this story claims there are reports that Kim Jong Un is particularly enthusiastic on opening the restaurant in Scotland due to his love of whisky and its popularity among the communist ruling elite.

Michael Madden, an editor at North Korea Leadership Watch, said Kim Jong Un and North Korea are anxious to build diplomatic ties with European countries, especially those that have left-wing leanings.

Madden offers his explanation.

“It would not surprise me at all if they opted to open a restaurant in Scotland. The Scottish independence referendum catapulted Scotland into the North Korean’s elite’s thoughts. Despite voting no, they’d consider left-leaning Scotland to be more suitable than England, plus North Koreans love whisky. Tourists in North Korea are told to tip people in Scotch instead of the currency.”

Due to North Korea’s reputation, the country has been closed to the outside world. For example, last year, U.S. officials blamed Kim Jong Un and his regime for hacking Sony Pictures Entertainment. In addition, the United Nations accused Kim Jong Un and his administration for severe human rights abuses.

The restaurant will continue serving North Korean delicacies like pine-nut gruel and dog meat soup. Additionally, the Pyongyang restaurants are partnered with a secretive branch of the North Korean government known as Office 39. This covert division uses the restaurants to raise overseas cash, legally. However, reports are that Kim Jong Un pockets the money made by his restaurants to support his lifestyle.

Though millions of North Koreans are malnourished, Kim Jong Un imports large quantities of whiskey and Swiss cheese to satisfy his cravings. Establishing a branch of his restaurants in Scotland will make it easier for Kim Jong Un to get as much Swiss cheese and Scotch as he desires.

The waddling dictator has already opened branches of the Pyongyang restaurant in China and Holland – with some serving delicacies such as dog-meat soup and a bottled aphrodisiac allegedly made from bears.

Next to that lot, deep fried Mars bars and a national dish made from sheep’s bowels sounds positively delicious.

Kim is alleged to be eyeing up Scotland because of his love of whisky – which is so popular in his communist dictatorship it’s sometimes used instead of money.

The podgy autocrat also admires Alex Salmond’s attempt to break free of English control last year.

While that is something that Scots might be able to get on board with, it’s debatable whether they’ll share Kim’s taste in food, with Western Pyongyang outlets serving ‘delicacies’ such as pine nut gruel.

The fat dictator is eyeing up locations as he looks to expand the state-backed chain of restaurants that started springing up in China and the rest of Asia before making their way to Europe.

It is believed the 32-year-old, who celebrated his birthday last week, is considering building a joint in Scotland, fuelled by the quest for independence north of the border and the communist country’s love of whisky.

Michael Madden, editor of the North Korea Leadership Watch blog, claimed Kim is desperate to build diplomatic ties with European countries with left-wing leanings.

He said: “It would not surprise me at all if they opened a restaurant in Scotland.

“The Scottish independence referendum catapulted the country into the North Korean elite’s thoughts.

“Despite voting ‘No’ they’d consider left-leaning Scotland to be more suitable to deal with than England. Plus, North Koreans love whisky.”

It would be the second North Korean government restaurant to open in Europe after one popped up in Amsterdam in 2012.

The food outlets channel 30% of their takings back to the capital Pyongyang but critics think the cash will be trousered by Kim to fund his own lavish lifestyle.

As well as being hooked on whisky, Kim is addicted to Swiss Emmental cheese, which is partly to blame for his huge weight gain.

It is claimed he imports vast quantities of the fatty treat into North Korea at huge expense despite millions of his countrymen living in abject poverty.

Mr Madden said: “The restaurants are one of the few ways to experience North Korean culture without having to go there.

“They are done like a franchise with the state renting the brand out to other Koreans to run but they tailor the menus to suit.”

North Korea expert Jenny Town said she believed the country has “warmed” to Scotland in recent months.

She added: “North Korea is going to support any country that is struggling for independence as it continues to seek validation and recognition of its own legitimacy.”

They were shocked to find out that the women were their mothers

The men made remarks about the women before identities were revealed

The show disguised the men's mothers who walked past their sons

A new TV show in Peru has captured the moment unwitting men have been caught wolf-whistling their own mothers.

The experiment took two mothers, whose sons were identified as repeat cat-callers, and disguised them using make-up, wigs and clothes. The women then women walked past their sons to gauge their reaction.

The mother wearing a disguise of a wig and sunglasses walks past her unsuspecting son and a friend, before he makes a comment towards her

The mother then goes over to confront her child, who is still unaware the woman is actually his parent

The man acts in horror as he realises it is his own mother and she launches into a tirade, accusing him of being dirty

The mother gets so angry with her son, she then takes off her bag and proceeds to hit him with it due to this behaviour

In the first case, the mother is dressed in a short black dress and walks past her son and a friend in the street.

The son then unwittingly makes a comment at his mother saying 'tasty panties' which prompts her to go and confront him.

She then removes her sunglasses and the man then realises he has just cat-called his own mother.

The mother then launches into a tirade, accusing him of being dirty and saying she never taught him to talk to women in that manner.

Another mother, wearing a black wig walks past her son, who is standing working on the streets of Lima

After making a remark towards his mother, she then turns around and goes over to confront him

She then takes off her wig to reveal herself and then throws it on the floor in anger after being disgusted by her son's behaviour

The mother then tells her son he should be ashamed of himself for speaking to her like that, as he pleads with her to calm down

She then gets so angry with her child that she then removes her bag and hits him with it.

Meanwhile in the second case, the mother wearing a green dress, walks past her son, who calls her 'piggy'.

She then calls his name before taking off her wig and confronting her son, hitting him with her hairpiece.

The man then tries to claim he didn't make the remark but is then forced to apologise to his mother before she walks off

She too launches into a tirade telling her son to he should be ashamed of himself, while he pleads with his mother to quieten down as he is working.

He then tries to claim he didn't make the remark and it a man in a nearby car, but he eventually apologises before his mother walks off.

The video ends with a warning saying men should start respecting women before they unwittingly harass their own mothers."

A video showing sons catcalling their mothers in Peru's capital city of Lima has gone viral on the internet.

Cases of sexual harassment, eve teasing and molestation have plagued several cities across the world.

A recent video shows that not only young girls, but middle-aged woman also become the victims of such attacks.

The video stated that seven out of ten women are harassed in the streets of Lima.

A Peruvian TV show found some repeat offenders who harass women in public places in Lima. Following this, the channel asked the offenders' mothers to get a makeover and walk past their sons. However, its climax turned ugly.

In the video titled, ""Harassing Your Mother"", which is sponsored by Everlast, two moms dress up and walk in front of their own sons.

While a pervert is seen catcalling his mother by mentioning ""tasty panties"", the other stalker refers his mom as ""Hello Piggy"". Both the angry mothers yell at the sons after revealing their identity.

""What's the matter with you Renzo? What they told about you was true that you saying such dirty things to women,"" one mother asked.

When the other lady said she was under covering herself just to see if her son was really harassing women, the guy tried to tell her that it wasn't him who teased her.

The viral video ends with the message, ""If you harass women don't wait for us to get you to harass your own mother to start respecting them"".

When men shout out obscene things at women in the street, it's tempting to ask them: ""Would you talk to your mother like that?""

These video makers from Peru came up with an ingenious way to give men who persistently harass women in the street a shock - by tricking them into wolf-whistling their own mothers.

The pranksters found some repeat offenders - and somehow managed to contact their mums.

They gave the mums a makeover, dressing them up in short skirts and luxurious wigs, before sending them out on the streets to find their errant sons, while CCTV cameras watched their every move.

One man sees a woman in a tight fitting, short black dress walking past in the street and calls out ""tasty panties.""

The woman confronts him, taking off her sunglasses and the man realises, to his horror, that he's just been sexually harassing his own mother.

His furious mum lays into him, calling him dirty and giving him a painful looking handbag to the face.

The video claims 7 out of 10 women in the Peruvian city of Lima have experienced street harassment. In 2012, a YouGov survey revealed 40% of women in London had been a victim of threats, harassment or lewd language in public places.

The video was produced by sports equipment brand Everlast and ends with a request to ""share this video so this message gets to all the stalkers around you.""

It may begin to occur a lot less in Lima, Peru after an extremely creative Public Service Announcement, which was sponsored by Everlast aired. The video shows what happens when men harass an attractive woman in the street, only to soon find out that the woman is in fact their own mother in disguise. The results are nothing short of hilarious. The video is called Harassing Your Mother.

The host of the video starts out by saying:

“7 out of 10 women are sexually harassed on the streets of Lima, Peru. Men who do it think it is a minor offense. Let’s show them that they are wrong.”

They find “repeating offenders” who harass women on the streets, then proceed to get in contact with their mothers. The moms then get a makeover that makes then look fabulous and not immediately recognizable.

The first man in the video calls out to a woman that he does not know is actually his mother saying (at least according to the translation):

“Tasty panties!”

The mother then turns around and walks up to her son. The realization that he just catcalled his own mother dawns on him as he says, “Mama?”

She then wails on him. She says:

“What’s the matter with you Renzo? What they told me about you is true.”

The man then tries to desperately rationalize the awful thing he did to his mother telling her that it is, “just a game.”

They repeat the prank again one more time in the video, just to cement the idea they are trying to put out. Remember, the next woman you decide to harass on the street may turn out to be your mother, so maybe try not to do it. Okay? The video is staged but that does not take away from the message it offers.

An airline spokesman said that the plane returned to the gate and the woman received medical attention before disembarking. She refused an offer of additional medical treatment but did not return to the aeroplane.

Cabin crew killed the arachnid and checked the overhead compartments for any other creatures.

The flight took off about an hour late, at 8.40pm local time.

A reporter for the Oregonian newspaper, Tyson Alger, who was on the flight, tweeted that a man flicked the scorpion off his shoulder, after which the creature landed on the woman’s hand.

“Chivalry is dead, he added.

Of the 1,500 species of scorpion, only about 30 can inflict lethal stings. Generally, stings are painful but not deadly for healthy adults.

It is not known how the scorpion got on to the plane, but the flight originated in Los Cabos, Mexico, where scorpions are prevalent.

It is not known which species stung the woman on the Alaska Airlines flight.

This is not the first time an air passenger has been the victim of an arachnid bite. In 2012, a woman won $80,000 compensation from Delta Air Lines, after being stung by a brown recluse spider, one of the most deadly in North America, on a transatlantic flight, according to AJC.com.

In 2009, a British man was arrested after he was caught trying to smuggle 1,000 live spiders out of Brazil in his hold luggage."

A scorpion stung a woman on an Alaska Airlines flight from Los Angeles to Portland, Ore., Saturday night, according to media reports from the West Coast.

The incident happened after the plane pulled back from the gate and was taxiing out, airline officials told ESPN. The aircraft returned to the gate so the woman could be treated.

The flight also happened to be carrying the Oregon State University men's basketball team, which was on its way back to Oregon after games in Los Angeles. Wayne Tinkle, Oregon State's head coach, tells ESPN the scorpion situation occurred just two rows in front of him.

""The plane was coming from Mexico before us, and [the scorpion] was on the plane,'' Tinkle tells ESPN's Andy Katz. ""The woman was a real champ. She acted like it was a mosquito bite. They got it off her but the needle was stuck.""

Tinkle's account mirrored other eyewitness descriptions.

""No one seemed frantic at all, not even the woman who was stung,"" passenger Mike Parker, a sports announcer for Oregon State, says to CNN. ""The flight attendants did a great job, as did the captain,"" said

As for the woman, she was treated by medical personnel for a sting on the arm, Alaska Airlines spokesman said Cole Cosgrove tells CNN. The woman declined additional treatment.

The Oregonian newspaper also confirms Tinkle's account of how the scorpion made it onto the aircraft, writing: ""Passengers were told the scorpion hitched a ride in the carry-on bag of a passenger who had been to Mexico.""

The flight was delayed by about 30 minutes to respond to the sting. Alaska Airlines officials tell ESPN that an attendant killed the scorpion and that the carrier would have an exterminator ""thoroughly check the plane"" upon arriving to Portland."

Flight 567 to Portland, Ore., was taxiing to the runway for a 7:50 p.m. departure when the passenger was stung, said Cole Cosgrove, a spokesman for Alaska Airlines.

The plane returned to the gate and medics checked the woman. She declined additional medical treatment but did not stay on the flight, Cosgrove said.

The woman had brushed the scorpion off of her before stepping on it. Employees searched the plane and checked the overhead bins but did not find other scorpions, Cosgrove said.

Among the 139 passengers were players and coaches for the Oregon State University men’s basketball team, who tweeted about the scorpion. Coach Wayne Tinkle told ESPN that he sat two rows behind the passenger who was stung.

“The woman was a real champ,” Tinkle said. “She acted like it was a mosquito bite. They got it off her but the needle was stuck.

The airline doesn’t know where the scorpion came from, but Cosgrove noted that the flight originated in Los Cabos, Mexico.

After a 50-minute delay the plane took off at 8:40 p.m. and arrived in Portland without further incident, Cosgrove said.

Alaska Airlines stated that it is uncertain how the scorpion got on the plane but acknowledged that the flight originated in Los Cabos, Mexico, where the plane was on the ground for approximately one hour.

Reached by phone aboard the plane Saturday night before the team took off for Oregon, Beavers coach Wayne Tinkle told ESPN that the woman was sitting two rows in front of him.

Rapper Kanye West reprised his most infamous stunt at Sunday night’s Grammy awards, taking the stage as Beck was accepting the album of the year award. West popped up on stage and moved toward Beck as if he was about to take the trophy from him. Instead, West turned away and quickly jumped down.

Beck beat out both the night’s top winner, Sam Smith, and the category’s expected winner, Beyoncé.

The incident was a repeat of the 2009 MTV Video Music Awards, when West accosted Taylor Swift during her acceptance speech after Swift’s “You Belong With Me” beat Beyoncé’s “Single Ladies” for Female Video of the Year.

“Yo, Taylor, I’m really happy for you, I’ma let you finish,” West said after taking the microphone at Radio City Music Hall, “but Beyoncé had one of the best videos of all time! One of the best videos of all time!”

West was roundly criticized for his action and was even called a “jackass” by no less than President Obama.

After this latest incident, organizers of the major awards shows like the Grammys, MTV Video Music Awards, People’s Choice Awards and the Oscars have unanimously agreed to disinvite and bar West from their respective ceremonies. The television networks that air these awards programs also joined in the ‘West boycott.’

Given the recent turn of events, his engagement to Afton Elaine Burton, also known as “Star,” is off.

Journalist Daniel Simone spoke with the NY Post about the 27-year-old’s plan to marry one of the most infamous killers in history. Burton reportedly hadn’t planned to marry Manson for love, but for profit. She and a friend by the name of Craig Hammond wanted to rake in money by putting Manson’s corpse in a glass crypt. As Simone says, it was a “California version of Lenin’s Tomb” and “would draw huge crowds and make big money.”

The 80-year-old has no interest in having his body displayed in a glass coffin. He realized what his fiancee was up to and got out. Simone adds that Charles Manson doesn’t believe he’ll ever even face death.

“He feels he will never die. Therefore, he feels it’s a stupid idea to begin with.”

The couple’s marriage license expired on Thursday, as Inquisitr revealed. Burton and Hammond’s website claims they “plan on renewing the license, and things will move forward in the coming months.”

Simone’s writing partner for The Retrial of Charles Manson is Heidi Joran Ley. The two are looking for someone to publish their book. The authors say Star Burton and her friend allegedly came up with their plan to get Manson’s corpse about two years ago. When the pair asked Manson to sign a document that would allow them to take his body after he dies.

What Burton and Hammond may not have realized, is that Manson was playing them. Simone says Manson didn’t give them a yes or no on signing the document. Since his fiancee and Hammond would bring him “toiletries and other items,” Manson continued “stringing them along” because it “kept the goodies coming.”

Exasperated by their attempt to get Manson to sign over his dead body, a plan was devised to get Burton married to Manson since California law would grant her possession of his remains upon his death, Simone says.

The journalist surmises that Mason had no intention of marrying Star Burton.

In a separate report by Fox 2 News, Burton’s mother disputes the entire report, claiming that her daughter isn’t marrying Charles Manson to get his remains after he dies.

“She is my daughter no matter what is going on in her life. You would love her unconditionally too if she were your child.”

The 52-year old woman, whose name has not been made public, was eventually extracated from the machine and suffered only minor injuries.

On January 3, a woman in her fifties had her hair sucked up into a robot vacuum at her home in the city of Changwon, South Korea.

On the day of the accident, she turned on her robot vacuum as usual, and laid down flat on the floor to rest, leaving the robot to do its job. The robot vacuum came around her relaxing on the floor, and suddenly sucked her hair into its nozzle. The vacuum stopped running one to two minutes after the sudden hair intake.

The startled housewife called 119, Korea’s emergency telephone number. Fortunately, paramedics quickly arrived at the scene, and successfully disjoined her hair from the nozzle. The housewife suffered only minor injuries.

The problematic robot vacuum had a nozzle with a roller inside, which sweeps and vacuums floors. The Changwon Fire Service Headquarters presumed that the vacuum’s sensors identified the woman’s hair as dust.

The likelihood of this type accident occurring is undoubtedly more significant in countries with a “sitting-on-the-floor” culture. Since Koreans love to rest or relax on a toasty, cleanly swept floor, exercising caution on using a robot vacuum is probably a good idea.

When a South Korean woman invested in a robot vacuum cleaner, the idea was to leave her trustworthy gadget to do its work while she took a break from household chores.

Instead, the 52-year-old resident of Changwon city ended up being the victim of what many believe is a peek into a dystopian future in which supposedly benign robots turn against their human masters.

The woman, whose name is being withheld, was taking a nap on the floor at home when the vacuum cleaner locked on to her hair and sucked it up, apparently mistaking it for dust.

The agony of having her hair entangled in the bowels of the contraption roused the woman from her slumber.

Unable to free herself, she called the fire department with a “desperate rescue plea” and was separated from the robot’s clutches by paramedics, according to the South Korean newspaper the Kyunghyang Shinmun.

She escaped serious injury, although it is not known whether she has retained the autonomous cleaner’s services.

Robot vacuum cleaners have grown in popularity in recent years, with US firm iRobot’s circular Roomba selling well over 10 million units in the 12 years since its debut in 2002.

Panasonic recently unveiled Rulo, a triangular rival to Roomba that the Japanese firm says is more adept at sucking up dust from corners.

The wheeled gadgets are equipped with sensors that enable them to steer clear of obstacles, avoid tumbling down stairs, and detect dust and other debris on the floor. They can also be programmed to seek out a recharging dock.



Korean Biz Wire pointed out, however, that people from cultures in which it’s commonplace to sit or nap on the floor - such as Japan and South Korea – may be more vulnerable to vacuum robot rage.

The woman, a 52-year-old resident of Changwon who has not been named, was awoken by the pain and, unable to extricate herself from the robot, called the fire department for help.

She was eventually freed by paramedics, escaping serious injury but losing several strands of hair.

It required two paramedics to remove her hair from the machine's nozzle, Korea Biz Wire reported .

The incident, which took place on January 3, highlighted the potential risk of this type of accident in South Korea, where sitting and sleeping on the floor is common practice.

The vacuum only stopped running more than a minute after initially ingesting the woman's hair.

She was still unable to free herself from the vacuum and made a ""desperate rescue request"" call to 119, South Korea's emergency telephone number.

Robotic vacuum cleaners are equipped with sensors allowing them to clean surfaces by detecting dirt while avoiding obstacles such as stairs, people and cables - but not, seemingly, human hair that is still attached.

Too close to home

While a person's home is his or her castle, it can also the source of seriously painful and embarrassing accidents that require medical attention.

Doctors in Saudi Arabia got quite a shock when they x-rayed a toddler and saw that he had swallowed a metallic SpongeBob SquarePants pendant.

Doctors couldn't believe their eyes when they saw this familiar face on the x-ray

The item, seen in stunning detail in the image above, was removed from the 16-month-old baby boy's oesophagus without complications.

A closer look at the hairball doctors removed Picture: EUROPICS

A teen in Kyrgyzstan was rushed to hospital unable to eat and when doctors cut open the 18-year-old's swollen stomach they discovered this giant hairball, which had formed over many years of the girl compulsively eating her own hair and locks she picked up off the floor.

Statistically speaking, most British people are more likely to be injured at home than anywhere else.

Don't whatever you do, let the kids anywhere near a trampoline, with the device accounting for around half of all domestic sports injuries requiring hospital treatment among children. Safety experts say children jumping on one with an adult or a crowded trampoline, are the most likely to end in tears and a trip to an A&E unit.

Barbequing at home can cause unfortunate accidents, with a quarter of us admitting to cooking with one, that is operating a large open flame, while drunk. Gazebos, wooden furniture and sheds are often accidentally set alight in the warmer months, safety experts say. Tipsy grillers could explain the 2,000 individuals admitted to A&E units each year with barbeque-related injuries.

Depending on the damage, it seems some of us nurse our wounds in silence.

Around a third of UK adults will feel more than a slight ache or pain as a direct result of bedroom antics, with carpet burns, cricked necks and bruised shoulders among the nation's most common sex injuries.

Some birds want the whole package.

None more so than a particularly demanding Snowy Owl in Poland, who KILLED her new boyfriend because of his tiny penis.

The bird, nicknamed the Black Widow, left her suitor half-eaten, shocking vets at the animal shelter in Knyszynska Forest.

Park keepers had noticed the owl was unhappy and decided to pair her up with a new mate.

But just two days after arriving from Germany, they found the new owl devoured and dead.

Shelter spokesman, Robert Konowal, said: ""The first two days were fine and they seemed to get on very well.

""We were horrified when we then discovered she had killed him.

The photo has apparently gone viral in China.



Huxiu reports that the photo was shared by a micro-blog today under the heading, ""It's Hard Being a Top App Worker."" The image shows a worker siting in front of hundreds of iPhones laid out on a rack that appears to have been specially designed for this purpose.



The exposé, shown in the picture, displays a 'Top App list worker' in their work place, which features a simple shelf containing hundreds of iPhone 5Cs. In a room filled with such workstations from one side to the other, mobile phone labour takes place at an industrial level. Simply put, a worker downloads (and deletes and downloads, etc.) an app to boost its rank on the App Store, calculated by how many times the app has been downloaded. One worker can operate as up to 100 unique users.



Accompany the photo on some sites is an alleged price list for boosting your app ranking. Getting into the top 10 free apps costs RMB 70,000 (US$11,200), and keeping it there will cost you another RMB 405,000 (US$65,000) per week. The third column is said to be the monthly fee. Negotiations take place over the QQ messaging service.



While Apple has taken steps to counter the manipulation of App Store rankings, it's quite difficult to identify manual downloads as being fake.

Widower Stan Beaton cried tears of joy after telephone engineers found the voicemail recording of his late wife he thought was lost forever.

Stan, 68, of Mirfield, was left devastated in December when an upgrade of his phone line by Virgin Media wiped the precious greeting he had kept for 14 years.

The retired forklift truck driver took comfort in the voice of wife Ruby, who died of stomach cancer aged 63 in May, 2003.

Stan had been assured by the phone company that the recording would be saved after the upgrade and the firm was forced to apologise and offered to make donations to Stan’s favourite charities after the blunder.

Red-faced bosses, though, didn’t stop there and put a team of 10 engineers on the case until the recording was recovered.

Stan was overcome with emotion when he was played a recording of the voicemail and said: “I felt pure elation and just couldn’t believe it. I thought the recording was gone forever.

“I can’t thank Virgin Media enough. Putting 10 people on the job must have cost them a fortune. I am staggered by that.”

Stan, who was married to Ruby for 20 years, often used to listen to the voicemail when he was feeling down.

He had previously tried to record the message to ensure it wasn’t lost but said: “All I ended up with were blank tapes.”

A husband who thought he had lost a recording of his late wife's voice he had kept for more than 10 years has described the moment the message was recovered as ""wonderful"".

Stan Beaton, from Mirfield, had kept the voicemail since his wife Ruby's death in 2003, but technical work by Virgin Media meant it was deleted.

However, the telecoms company has now managed to recover the message.

Mr Beaton, 68, said: ""They've made this old age pensioner extremely happy.""

Listening to the message he said: ""It's just a wonderful, wonderful sound that I thought was lost forever.

""I'm staggered at the lengths they have gone to.""

Mr Beaton told BBC Radio Leeds the message he had kept since his wife's death from cancer was lost in December.

He said: ""I've always resisted changing companies because whenever I mentioned that my wife's voice was our voicemail message and would it be retained and each company said no, so that's why I never changed.

""Sadly it disappeared. I was absolutely devastated by it, but also extremely angry.

""In the early days [I listened to it] quite often. Basically it came to the point when if I felt low then I would listen to it.

""In December I learned that it had disappeared. I just could not tell people how it affected me at that time. It really did devastate me.""

Mr Beaton contacted Virgin who managed to retrieve the message which has now been permanently saved for him.

Rob Evans, executive director of engineering at Virgin Media, said finding it ""was like searching for a needle in a haystack"", however a team of 11 engineers spent three days tracking it down.

""The chances of its recovery were slim"" he said, but the missing file containing Ruby's voice was found on Friday.

""The next morning we called Stan to deliver the good news,"" he said."

Bart’s owner, Tampa Bay resident Ellis Hutson, buried Bart back on January 15th after a neighbor found him dead in the road in a pool of his own blood after being hit by a car. Five days later, however, Bart turned up at a nearby store looking for food — although it’s unclear if he just wanted some Fancy Feast or HUMAN SOULS.

Fox 13 reports:

Bart is at the Human Society of Tampa Bay right now, and rescuers told FOX 13 that he has severe trauma to the head, a broken jaw, a dead eye, and other injuries. Right now, doctors are scheduling surgery to save its life. FOX 13 visited Bart on Monday. Rescuers say they believe he may have regained consciousness, dug himself out of the ground, and hid for a few days.

I don’t know about you guys, but personally I like my Florida stories when they aren’t literally the plot of a Stephen King novel. Bart is expected to make a full recovery, but as if you needed more reason to stay away from Florida, there is now a zombie cat on the loose.

Survivor: Bart, pictured, was pronounced dead, but clawed his way out of the grave and made it to his home in Tampa, Florida

Fighter: Rescuers say Bart probably came to underground and quickly got out - then hid for days before heading home

Hutson told local news station Fox13 that Bart suffered head trauma, a broken jaw and a ruined eye - but was very much alive.

Though he still needs surgery before it can be certain he'll pull through, Bart's brush with death saw him escape a muddy grave.

It is unclear how he escaped, but Hutson is convinced that the battered feline who made his way to his neighbor's garden - then on home in the hope of a meal - is his revived pet.

Bart's eye will never work again - even if the surgery goes right - but his survival instincts are clearly on top form.

A buried cat clawed his way out of his grave after being left for dead alongside a road in Florida. The Humane Society of Tampa Bay has taken in the miracle cat and hopes to do their best to help save him.

Rescuers tell FOX 13 in Tampa Bay that the miracle kitty has severe trauma to his head, has a dead eye, a broken jaw, and other serious injuries.

Ellis Hutson is the cat’s owner and says “Bart” was hit by a vehicle and left for dead. He buried his beloved cat several days ago and is amazed Bart survived his horrendous ordeal.

Bart wound up on a neighbor’s front yard after he dug himself out of the grave. Hutson told rescuers that he was certain he was dead. He has no way of explaining how the buried cat clawed his way out of his grave. When they found the zombie cat alive, he was rushed to the veterinarian hospital.

Bart will have an operation, but will lose one eye.

“This doesn’t happen. Cats don’t just come back to life. Not five days after they’ve been put in the ground,” Hutson’s neighbor said, according to News 96.5.

Doctors at the Humane Society of Tampa Bay are scheduling surgery to save Bart’s life. There’s no guarantee he’ll make it, but his good luck after fooling everyone into thinking he was dead may be an indicator as to how well he pulls through again!

FOX 13 reports that rescuers tell them they believe Bart may have regained consciousness, dug himself out of the ground, and decided to hide out for a few days. They believe Bart will live, but will lose one of his eyes.

Bart is still in good spirits despite being hit by a car then buried alive. He purrs when he gets attention, loves being pet, and acts as though nothing happened. The black-and-white cat is very much a big mess – covered in dirt and dried up blood. When he gets all fixed up again, he should be good to go.

The Inquisitr wrote on another animal that was believed dead, but dug itself out of a grave. A hamster was buried in the ground and 24 hours later managed to crawl out.

The story about a buried cat clawing his way out of his grave is good news for his owner who hated parting with his pet. It’s yet one more story of a cat having nine lives!

 -- Looks like he used up all his nine lives!

A cat in Florida that was hit by a car and then buried is apparently back from the dead.

""I was so shocked,"" owner Ellis Hutson told ABC News. ""I didn’t know really what to do.""

And today, Bart the cat is having surgery at the Humane Society to repair his jaw and remove his eye.

""We have seen many amazing cases at our full-service veterinary clinic, but this situation may take the cake,"" the Humane Society of Tampa said on its website.

The cat's owner, Hutson, 52, said he found Bart the cat two weeks ago in the middle of the road, lifeless in a puddle of blood.

Hutson said he asked his friend to help bury the 23-month old cat, because the landscaper was so distraught after losing a companion he's had since he was a kitten.

""We were so close, I couldn’t stand to bury him,"" Hutson said. ""I put him on the shoulder of the road and went and got David. He dug a hole and covered up the cat with dirt. I witnessed him bury the cat.""

Five days later, the cat showed up in a neighbor's yard alive, but weak, dehydrated and in need of medical attention.

""I open the door and my neighbor's standing there with the cat in her hand,"" Hutson said. ""She said, 'Bart is not dead.' I said, 'That’s impossible. We buried Bart.'""

Bart has been treated for a broken jaw, open facial wounds and a ruined eye. The Humane Society veterinarians expect him to recover and be able to return home after recovering a couple days.

""This is unbelievable. I don’t have any explanation for it,"" Hutson said.

Hutson said he will pay for the surgery costs for the cat. The total cost for the care of Bart, including today’s surgery and post-operative care, will be around $2,000, the Humane Society said.

Hutson's neighbor Dusty Albritton started a GoFundMe page to raise money for the cat’s medical expenses.

“I saw him with my own eyes. I know he was dead. He was cold and stiff,” Albritton told ABC News.

Albritton’s cat died the same day with similar injuries.

“We figured he was hit by the same car,” she said.

“Now my kids believe their cat will also rise from the dead,"" she said with a chuckle. ""But I told them I don't think so.""

When she discovered the resurrected Bart, she said he acted “like he’s in no pain whatsoever.”

“The only thing I can think of is that this is God’s miracle. And I thought, why five days later? If Bart was alive before, he would have come to our homes earlier. All I can think of is that God created animal life on the fifth day.“

Bart was a kitten from Hutson's girlfriend's cat. He said this has been an emotional ordeal for him and his girlfriend, but he hasn't tried explaining the situation to his two-year old daughter.

""As a two-year old, she doesn't understand any of this either,"" he said."

The newspaper said the nun, whose age wasn't given, gave birth last Sunday and intends to keep the baby, whose sex wasn't given.

The nun had been staying at a cloistered convent in the province of Macerata since June.

The hospital hasn't confirmed the birth and the bishop of nearby town Camerino, Francesco Brugnaro, hasn't made any comment on the case. Another case of a nun giving birth took place in 2011 in Marche, when a 41-year-old Congolese nun gave birth to a baby girl in Pesaro.

In that case, the nun had been raped abroad by a foreign priest and initially gave her daughter up for adoption.

The case engendered strong protests from the adoptive family after it reached Italy's highest court of appeals in February 2014 after the nun changed her mind and was granted custody, reversing a lower court decision.

Another nun who had no idea that she was pregnant surprised her mother superior and sisters as she gave birth to a baby boy recently, according to the Daily Mail.

The South American nun belongs to an order in Macerata, in the eastern Italian region of Le Marche. She arrived there last June, and people suspect now that she was already pregnant by the time she was admitted.

She was rushed to the emergency department of 'Bartolomeo Eustachio' di San Severino Marche by her fellow sisters after she complained of a severe stomach ache, and doctors immediately deduced that the nun was about to give birth.

She soon delivered a healthy baby boy, but the child currently remains in the hospital to undergo more checks. The Macerata nuns have expressed their desire to keep the baby and raise him. For her part, the nun said she had no idea that she was pregnant prior to her hospital admission.

This is not the first time a nun has mysteriously given birth after suffering from stomach pains. The South American nun's case is very similar to what happened to a 33-year-old Salvadorean nun, also in Italy last year. She complained of unbearable stomach pain, was rushed to the hospital, and gave birth afterwards. She named her baby boy after Pope Francis.

The Salvadorean nun told her social worker that she does not feel any guilt and only expressed eagerness to raise the child. ""I am so happy. He is a gift from God. I feel more of a mother than a nun,"" she admitted, according to the Daily Mail.

Back in 2011 a Congolese nun in an Italian order also gave birth to a baby girl. However, the Congolese nun's experience was different since she was raped by a priest.

She decided to give the baby up for adoption, but after she was refused re-entrance to the convent, she changed her mind and decided to raise her daughter herself."

Pregnant Nun Gives Birth To Baby Boy In Italy

What a strange story. The unnamed South American woman, who belonged to an order of nuns in Macerata, Italy, said she wasn’t aware she was pregnant before giving birth, according to the UK’s Daily Mail.

Her fellow sisters were the ones who rushed her to the emergency department at a nearby hospital. The sister is believed to have been impregnated before she arrived at the Italian convent in June 2014.

The sisters say that they are interested in taking care of the baby if the nun does not wish to keep it, according to a report in the Italian newspaper L’Unione Sarda.

A Salvadorean Nun Gave Birth To A Baby Boy In Italy In 2014

Surprisingly, this isn’t the first time something like this has happened. In fact, in 2014, a 33-year-old Salvadorean nun living in Italy gave birth to a baby boy.

It seemed like it was meant to be though because the sister said at the time that she couldn’t be happier about her unexpected bundle of joy.

“I am so happy,” she said about the child, whom she named after Pope Francis. “He is a gift from God. I feel more of a mother than a nun.”

Sarebbe solo una storia a lieto fine, un parto come tanti, quella che arriva dalle corsie del reparto di ostetricia e ginecologia del ""Bartolomeo Eustachio"" di San Severino Marche se non fosse per il fatto che la protagonista della corsa in ospedale stavolta non è stata una puerpera qualunque bensì una religiosa che aveva giurato, anni fa, castità al Signore insieme a fedeltà eterna.

Era arrivata in ospedale, accompagnata dalle consorelle, passando dal pronto soccorso. Appunto lamentava dolori di pancia ma l’ecografia ha svelato il mistero e il medico di turno ha invitato suora e consorelle a prendere subito la strada del reparto di ostetricia non senza un attimo di imbarazzo. Sacco amniotico rotto e equipe subito in azione per far partorire la suora.

Della storia, ovviamente, si sa ben poco anche se la stessa ci ha messo un nulla a fare il giro del paese e a uscire allo scoperto non solo dall'ovattato silenzio assicurato da personale medico e infermieristico che ha assistito al lieto evento ma anche da quello, più religioso in questo caso, del convento che sembrerebbe essere addirittura un monastero di clausura della zona (a San Severino ce ne sono due, il convento di S.Caterina e quello di S.Chiara, entrambi nella zona del Catsello). Nulla trapela, ovviamente, sulla identità della religiosa, né sui tratti somatici del pargolo. Mistero sul fatto se somigli più alla mamma piuttosto che al papà.

E non chiedete se a venire al mondo sia stato un maschietto o una femminuccia visto che in corsia gli imbarazzi sono palpabili. Si sa solo che la mamma del nascituro, originaria di uno stato del sud America, sarebbe arrivata nel Maceratese da qualche tempo e avrebbe trovato alloggio, forse rifugio, in una struttura di clausura della nostra provincia.

Difficile anche poter dire se la suora abbia o meno confessato il suo peccato, non certo veniale, alla sua superiora. Si sa però che la religiosa sarebbe arrivata prima al pronto soccorso, e successivamente sarebbe stata fatta salire in reparto, accompagnata da altre consorelle che, ancor prima di gridare al miracolo, avrebbero affidato alle preghiera del Signore chi nel frattempo stava per venire alla luce.

L'ingresso all'accettazione è avvenuto domenica ed è stato, comunque, un gran giorno di festa per l'arrivo di una nuova vita. Così, nell'imbarazzo veramente generale, sono state seguite dall'equipe che ha eseguito il parto le concitate fasi che hanno accompagnato lo stesso.

Niente fiori all'ingresso della cameretta che in questi giorni ha permesso di garantire l'anonimato alla neo mamma che, comunque, sembra aver deciso di tenere il piccolo e che forse ora sarà trasferita altrove, probabilmente in una casa famiglia.

Di certo prima di domenica la suora non si sarebbe sottoposta a controlli, questo è quello che avrebbero raccontato le religiose che con lei hanno condiviso la clausura negli ultimi mesi. E di certo nella struttura che la ospitava, la suora difficilmente avrebbe potuto aver avuto contatti con il mondo esterno. Anche se le vie del Signore, si sa, sono veramente infinite.

Non stupì, mesi fa, la notizia del parto di un'altra suora, stavolta congolese. Il bimbo venuto alla luce fu dapprima affidato a una coppia di Tolentino e poi tolto ai genitori adottivi con un provvedimento inatteso e inaspettato della Suprema Corte per finire affidato a una casa d'accoglienza.

In quel caso la mamma naturale aveva abbandonato la pargoletta alla nascita. La bimba per due anni e mezzo era stata cresciuta da due nuovi genitori che se l'erano vista poi sottrarre.

It's not every night that a pizza delivery driver receives a $2,000 tip.

But that's what happened Thursday to one Ann Arbor driver who delivered a single pizza to a conference room full of more than 200 realtors from Michigan and northern Ohio on Thursday.

Pizza House delivery manager Brian LeFevre said he received a call Thursday morning from a man who said they wanted one pizza delivered to the Sheraton Hotel in Ann Arbor.

""They said they wanted it at 2:20 p.m. on the dot,"" LeFevre said. ""I gave it to our delivery driver and he went down there and took it to the front desk.""

LeFevre said his driver was escorted to a conference room where a man was up front with a microphone.

A video posted on YouTube shows the deliverer being stopped as he handed over the pizza and then presented with $2,084, letters of encouragement, a Visa gift card and lottery tickets -- all to cheers from the crowd. LeFevre said the driver, who identifies himself as Rob in the video but whose last name wasn't released, has worked at the restaurant about six years.

When he came back, LeFevre said, Rob was visibly happy.

""He was clearly pretty ecstatic about something so I asked him what's going on,"" Le said. ""He said, 'I just had a life-changing delivery.' He was kind of blown away.""

LeFevre said he's never seen a driver earn such a large tip.

""For one pizza, that's a pretty good day's work,"" he said. ""It's nice to be appreciated.""

Stacey McVey, team leader of Keller Williams Greater Cleveland West, said that at the company's annual conference, all the agents agreed to pitch in to show someone from the service industry their appreciation.

""Our company as a whole is very interested in doing things like that,"" she said. ""It's really important as businesses that we give back. We believe a group of people can come together and change a life and cause other people to think about how to change others' lives. People in the service industry, I think they're pretty under-appreciated. It's a lot of fun to do something like this.""

McVey said when the driver realized what was going on, it was a priceless moment.

""He was a little stunned,"" she said. ""Everyone was excited and you could kind of feel the energy in the room. This is the first time we've done anything over the top and this won't be the last.""

Whether it’s gluten or plastics or peanuts, it seems young and new parents have more and more social taboos to navigate.

The latest parenting taboo? Missing a birthday party — or sending an invoice to the absent child’s parents, depending on how you look at it.

A pair of British parents are still reeling from the discovery of an invoice for £15.95 (just under $29 Canadian) in their five-year-old son Alex’s backpack. Their crime? Not informing the parents of his classmate their son would not be attending a birthday party in December.

Five-year-old boy gets a bill for missing school friend’s birthday party owl.li/HxxgR http://t.co/kBcK8w7iWo—

Plymouth Herald (@PlymouthHerald) January 19, 2015

Julie Lawrence, the birthday boy’s mother, has defended the “fee” as necessary to recoup the costs associated with a no-show. She said Alex told her son he would attend the party and took that as proper confirmation. She said the cost covers one ticket to the “child’s party at the ski slope including snow tubing and tobogganing and lunch.”

Lawrence has also threatened to take the Nash family to small claims court if they don’t pay up.

Nash has said he understood the financial concerns and said it was the way Lawrence went about it that offended. They have also taken the issue up with the school, because it allowed Lawrence to place the brown envelope in Alex’s backpack, which is against school policy.

So where was Alex? Out with his grandparents, whom he chose over the party when his parents realized he was double booked for the day and it was the only chance he would have to see them before Christmas.

Alex’s mom, Tanya Nash, explained this to Lawrence in a Facebook exchange printed by the Plymouth Herald, the local paper that first broke the story. The ensuing Facebook debate between the two mothers now has parents around the world chiming in.

Plymouth Herald (@PlymouthHerald) January 19, 2015

If Lawrence’s side of the story seems reasonable — she did have to pay for Alex when he didn’t show up after all — the Facebook conversation takes quite the turn. The moms’ fight about whether or not they had each other’s number and who was ruder in how they approached the other parent.

“This is not the first time Alex has not turned up to a party that he has been invited to, either. the amicable way round this I believe would be to pay me the money and let a lesson be learnt, I hope this is agreeable,” Lawrence writes.

Nash responds that she can’t think of another party Alex missed where there was a formal invite, and the pushes back against Lawrence’s tone: “Exactly what lesson would I be learning? I am not a child, so please do not speak to me like I am one. So, to answer your question, unfortunately no. This is not agreeable.”"	Parents billed $29 for a 'no-show fee' after five-year-old son misses birthday party	2015-01-19 00:00:00	[]	['noshow', 'party', 'herald', '29', 'alex', 'missing', 'son', 'parents', 'billed', 'school', 'fee', 'misses', 'pay', 'lawrence', 'birthday', 'fiveyearold']	"Missing a birthday party — or sending an invoice to the absent child’s parents, depending on how you look at it.

Derek Nash and his partner Tanya Walsh discovered the £15.95 ""no show fee"" invoice after it was slipped into their son Alex's school bag.

Mr Nash said he originally ""thought it was a joke"", but the issue has remained unresolved with the birthday boy's mother, Julie Lawrence, threatening small claims court.

His partner confronted Ms Lawrence in a series of posts on Facebook in a bid to resolve the situation.

The family confirmed their son would be attending the party at the Ski Slope and Snowboard Centre just before the Christmas holidays.

However, Mr Nash, from Torpoint, Cornwall, realised he had already arranged for their daughter to go on a day trip with her grandparents.

He said: ""She saw me and asked if Alex was coming to the party. At this time I agreed and said that Alex was looking forward to it.

""By this time we did not have a contact number, email or an address to let [the boy's mother] know. So on the day of the party we asked Alex what he wanted to do - he chose to be with his grandparents.""

Alex returned to Torpoint Nursery and Infant School on January 6, but the family were shocked to receive the bill just over a week later.

Mr Nash added: ""My partner looked out for [the friend's mother] to apologise for Alex not showing up to the party, but didn't see her.

""But on January 15 she looked in Alex's school bag and found a brown envelope. It was an invoice for £15.95 for a child's party no show fee.

""I asked Alex's class teacher if [the child's mother] had given anything to her. She said, 'Yes, a brown envelope'.

""I then visited Alex's school head teacher, who couldn't apologise enough that one of the teachers had passed this on. She said she would remind all staff that this was a breach of protocol.

""I left the school and went to see [the birthday boy's mother] as her address was on the invoice. When she answered the door I told her I had found the invoice in my son's school bag and that I wasn't happy about it.

""I told her I would not be paying her the money. I told her she should have spoken to me first and not put the invoice in my son's school bag.



Julie Lawrence and her husband Simon

""I would have sympathised with her about the cost of Alex not showing up, but I just can't believe the way she has gone around it.""

Ms Lawrence has since threatened the family that she would take the case to a small claims court, while the birthday boy will no longer play with Alex at school.

Due to his no-show at his friend’s party, the young child was actually given an invoice and billed for his nonappearance.

According to the Plymouth Herald, Derek Nash says that his son Alex was given a “child’s party no show fee” invoice for not going to a friend’s birthday party. The bill for £15.95 (approx. $25) was in his son’s school bag last week and Nash “thought it was a joke.”

The party was scheduled for before the Christmas holidays when Alex was invited to one of his Torpoint Nursery and Infant School classmate’s birthday party. It was being held at the Ski Slope and Snowboard Centre, and the Nash family indicated that Alex would be attending the party.

“She saw me and asked if Alex was coming to the party. At this time I agreed and said that Alex was looking forward to it.”

As the Metro stated, Nash informed the classmate’s mother in person that his son would be going to the party. It was after that conversation that Nash realized the family already had a family trip planned for that day.

Upon trying to cancel Alex’s acceptance to the party, Nash found no way to contact the party-thrower.

“We did not have a contact number, email or an address to let [the boy’s mother] know. So on the day of the party we asked Alex what he wanted to do – he chose to be with his grandparents.”

It was a week later that the invoice for Alex’s no-show was received. A teacher at the Torpoint Nursery and Infant School is actually the one who put the notice in the boy’s school bag, and the school has since issued an apology for their involvement in the matter.

Alex’s teacher said that she would let all staff know that giving the boy an invoice was a “breach of protocol.”

Derek Nash said he then left the school and went to visit the birthday boy’s mother since her address was now on the invoice. He let her know that he “would not be paying her the money” and that “she should have spoken to me first.”

The birthday boy’s mother has since threatened the Nash family with legal action and could possibly take them to small claims court to get the money she is owed.

As for Alex Nash and his classmate at the Torpoint Nursery? He has told his parents that his classmate won’t play with him at school now since he was a no-show to the party and the invoice was given out.

A five-year-old was billed for failing to attend a friend's birthday party - resulting in threats of legal action.

Alex Nash, from Cornwall, was invited to the party just before Christmas.

An invoice for £15.95 was sent by his schoolfriend's mother Julie Lawrence, who said Alex's non-attendance left her out of pocket and his parents had her details to tell her he was not going.

Alex's father Derek said he had been told he would be taken to the small claims court for refusing to pay.

Alex's parents, from Torpoint, had accepted an invitation to the party at a dry ski slope in Plymouth, Devon, just before Christmas.

However, they realised their son was double-booked and due to spend time with his grandparents, which he did.

Analysis: Clive Coleman, BBC legal correspondent

It is all but impossible that Ms Lawrence will be able to recover the £15.95 party ""no show fee"".

Any claim would be on the basis that a contract had been created, which included a term that a ""no show"" fee would be charged.

However, for there to be a contract, there needs to be an intention to create legal relations. A child's party invitation would not create legal relations with either the child ""guest"" or its parents.

If it is being argued that the contract is with the child, it is inconceivable that a five-year-old would be seen by a court as capable of creating legal relations and entering into a contract with a ""no show"" charge.

It's amusing to imagine what a children's party invitation seeking to create a contract might say: ""I, the 'first party', hereinafter referred to as the 'birthday boy', cordially invite you the 'second party', hereinafter referred to as 'my best friend', to the party of 'the first party'.

His parents said they had no contact information for Ms Lawrence at that time.

They found the invoice in a brown envelope in his schoolbag last week.

Mr Nash said: ""It was a proper invoice with full official details and even her bank details on it.

""I can understand that she's upset about losing money. The money isn't the issue, it's the way she went about trying to get the money from me.

Image caption The invoice lists a ""Party No Show"" fee

""She didn't treat me like a human being, she treated me like a child and that I should do what she says.""

In a short statement, Ms Lawrence said: ""All details were on the party invite. They had every detail needed to contact me.""

Mr Nash said he had been told he was being taken to the small claims court because he was refusing to pay.

The party was held at the Plymouth Ski and Snowboard Centre.

In a statement, the centre said: ""We would like all our customers to know that this invoice has nothing to do with Plymouth Ski and Snowboard Centre.

""No invoices are ever sent out from the centre to private individuals. This is a disagreement between the two parents involved and the fact that the centre has been named on the invoice is fraudulent.

""When booking a party there is a small deposit to pay on booking, confirmation of numbers and final balance are due 48 hours before the party.

""On the extremely rare occasion that people don't attend parents are generally offered other activities in compensation.""

The unwritten rules of children's parties?

Image copyright Thinkstock

Birthday boy/girl must be given preference for starting activity. Small guests pushing past should be restrained by attending adults

Party bags or gifts for each attending child - the children will always remember ""that party"" when they didn't get one

If you don't RSVP don't think you can just turn up. And if you do, don't expect a party bag (see above)

Avoid party talk around the parents of the uninvited

Host child MUST win at least one round of pass the parcel. Sweets within each layer for everyone else

Children must be given 15 minutes at the buffet before adults are allowed to hoover up the cocktail sausages

FORT DEVENS, Massachusetts –

Infamous Boston Marathon bombing suspect Dzhokhar Tsarnaev, 22, was the victim of an “unfortunate accident” yesterday at Ft. Devens Detention Center in Massachusetts, just a few short months after his high-profile trial and sentencing, according to warden Paul Jacobson.

Corrections officers reportedly found the terror suspect face down in a pool of his own blood in his cell; a banana peel was found on the floor nearby.

“It initially appeared as though Tsarnaev slipped on a discarded banana peel and hit the floor with such force that his head bounced off the hard tile surface, probably 16 or 17 times. There was blood everywhere – all over the walls, the floor, even the toilet. The injuries have caused massive brain trauma,” said prison investigator Joe Goldsmith. “We determined though, through expert analysis, that it would be impossible for these injuries to have occurred through a fall. Our investigation has shown that that it was the Aryan Brotherhood who initiated an attack on Tsarnaev.”

“Yes, it was the brotherhood who took care of that bomber,” said Miles Smith, head of the Aryan Nation inside Devens. “The other gangs, they wanted him, too. We paid the guards the most money to have a shot. They stood aside, and let us do what we do. On the way out, they shook our hands, told us ‘Thank you.’ Well, You’re welcome. You’re welcome, Boston. You’re welcome, America!”

“Normally, an attack this violent, this cruel, on another inmate would get any offending party more time added to their sentence,” said warden Jacobson. “Because of the nature of Tsarnaev’s crimes, though, we have decided to actually reduce the sentences of the Aryan members who were involved. They have done our prison and our country a great service, and we appreciate it immensely. They are heroes in the eyes of not only this institution, but also in the eyes of the people of the Commonwealth of Massachusetts.”

Tsarnaev had pled not guilty to all thirty charges filed against him, but was found guilty on all counts in April. He was sentenced to the death penalty per the crimes committed.

The single mother who’s delivery necessitated a surgical incision in the mother’s abdomen and uterus was done to prevent any harm to the baby and mother’s health and was undergone without any complications.

The doctor who practiced the cesarean section first believed the woman to be pregnant with twins or even triplets.

“I have dealt with other women suffering from obesity before but this birth will stick with me until I die,” he told reporters with a large grin.

“I truly believed there was two or even three babies in there” he commented laughingly, “but no, it was just one big sturdy guy. He obviously has a career as a future rugby player” he added with humor.

The largest recorded baby in the world was previously thought to be a South African baby who is believed to have weighed 38 pounds (17.2 kilos) and was born in 1839.

A man who allegedly made a habit of stealing women’s underwear from washing lines has been on the receiving end of some ironic mob justice.

After Chan Chun Chee was caught red handed by the women whose underwear had gone missing, they forced him to wear one of the pilfered bras and made him walk around the block in a classic example of public shaming.

Residents of the block of flats in Singapore first became aware of the kinky thief when items of clothing being left out to dry started going missing, sometimes even from inside their apartments.

Local man Teo Goh, 56, said: ‘We realised he was targeting windows where he knew women lived and knew were open, so we decided to teach him a lesson and publicly humiliate him.’

They sprung a trap by getting one of the women in the block to leave some underwear in plain sight near an open window.

The group then waited for the thief to make his move, before pouncing on him.

After ‘frog marching’ the culprit around the block in his new outfit and forcing him to promise never to steal from them again, the vigilante group called the police to have him arrested.

A police spokesman said: ‘We don’t condone vigilante activity but in this case it seems to have turned out OK.’

Chee now faces three years jail for breaking and entry and theft (plus these embarrassing photos will probably haunt him forever).

An alleged underwear thief who supposedly targeted woman's lingerie left out to dry has been publicly shamed after being caught red-handed.

Chan Chun Chee, 32, was forced to walk around a block of flats in Singapore with bras and undies hanging from his neck after residents laid a trap following a spate of kinky thefts.

Local man Teo Goh, 56, said: ""We first became suspicious after my wife found one of her bras missing when she woke up in the morning.

""Over the next couple of weeks other residents began noticing lingerie being stolen either from courtyards or balconies and we realised there was a serial thief at work.

""We realised he was targeting windows where he knew women lived.""

Knowing that the perverted prowler would be watching, the residents arranged for a woman to leave some of her freshly-washed underwear by an open window to dry.

Goh explained: ""He came at around midnight and as soon as he was in the room we grabbed him, forced him to wear the girl’s lingeries and then frog-marched him from door to door making him confess what he had done and to promise he would never do it again.

""And then we called the police.""

A police spokesman said: ""We don't condone vigilante activity but in this case it seems to have turned out OK.""

Lung had used Feng’s cell phone to send his lover an email, according to the news outlet.

After forgetting to log out of his account, she found the messages, and stormed into the bedroom where her husband was sleeping and allegedly cut off his penis with a pair of scissors.

But the anger for her husband and the father of her five children didn’t stop there.

While he was recovering in the hospital, she allegedly snipped it off again after surgeons had reattached it.

She then threw it out the window.

Despite losing a lot of blood, Lung chased his wife outside.

“Staff rushed out to see what was happening and found the patient with blood streaming down his legs hitting the woman,” a hospital spokesperson said according to the news outlet.

Doctors and police officers failed to find his penis when they searched outside.

Feng Lung is now under arrest for grievous bodily harm, the new outlet reports.

But Fan Lung’s lover isn’t alarmed that Lung is missing his penis.

“It doesn’t matter that he’s lost his fertility, he has five children already,” she said."

In a bizarre, but true illustration of that edict, a jealous wife in China, 30-year-old Feng Lung, reported chopped her husband’s penis off with a pair of sharp scissors, not once, but twice, in order to teach him a lesson for his infidelity.

Having found out her husband was cheating on her, the woman sliced off his penis, which was reattached successfully by surgeons in Shangqiu in central China’s Henan province. When she saw her husband had sent a raunchy email to his mistress once again, she severed his member a second time.

Lung is now facing jail after being arrested for causing grievous bodily harm to her husband, 32-year-old, Fan Lung.

The Mirror reports that surgeons were able to reattach the penis, but when the jealous wife found the email on her phone, she reportedly sneaked into his hospital room and cut it off again before throwing it out of a window.

The man ran outside the hospital to confront his wife and to find his severed penis. He was seen naked and pouring with blood in the street outside the facility.

A hospital spokesman told reporters, “The first we were aware of what happened was when someone came into the reception area to say a naked man was beating up a woman outside the hospital. Staff rushed out to see what was happening and found the patient with blood streaming down his legs hitting the woman. He was stopped and the woman was taken in for treatment, and then we discovered she had chopped his penis off again.”

Despite an extensive search by police officers at the scene, the man’s penis was never located, and authorities believe it may have been eaten by a stray dog or cat.

The hospital spokesman added, ‘The man had lost a lot of blood and was taken in for emergency surgery. He is now in a stable condition but is extremely emotionally distraught.”"	Jealous Wife Who Chopped Off Husband’s Penis For Cheating On Her, Chops It Off A Second Time		['Addam Corré']	['jealous', 'woman', 'husbands', 'chopped', 'chops', 'husband', 'surgeons', 'cheating', 'hospital', 'second', 'wife', 'outside', 'taken', 'blood', 'penis', 'man']	"Having found out her husband was cheating on her, the woman sliced off his penis, which was reattached successfully by surgeons in Shangqiu in central China’s Henan province.

A woman in Henan province has been arrested for reportedly chopping off her husband’s penis after discovering that he was having an affair—then going to the hospital and cutting it off again.

The husband and father of five, 32-year-old Fan Lung, had used his wife’s phone to send a steamy email to his mistress, 21-year-old Zhang Hung, from his home in the city of Shangqiu, The Mirror reports.

Fan had forgotten to log out of his account, and when his wife Feng, 30, looked through her phone, she found the message among several others that he’d sent to to his xiao san. In a fit of rage, Feng grabbed a pair of scissors and chopped off her husband’s penis while he was sleeping in their bedroom.

Fan was taken to a hospital, where doctors were able to reattach his precious manhood. Feng, however, managed to sneak into his hospital room and cut his penis off again before tossing it out of a window, The Mirror said.

“The first [time] we were aware of what happened was when someone came into the reception area to say a naked man was beating up a woman outside the hospital,” a hospital spokesperson was quoted as saying in the report.

“Staff rushed out to see what was happening and found the patient with blood streaming down his legs hitting the woman.”

They brought the fighting couple back into the hospital and discovered that Feng had cut off her husband’s newly reattached member.

Doctors and police searched outside for the man’s severed penis, but to no avail. They believe it was carried off by a stray animal.

Fan, who’d lost a lot of blood at this point, is now in stable condition after undergoing emergency surgery but is “extremely emotionally distraught,” as one might expect.

Fan’s side-lover, however, said she still plans to marry him.

“It doesn’t matter that he’s lost his fertility, he has five children already,” she was quoted as saying.

When Feng Lung, 30, discovered her husband was having an affair she cut off his manhood with a pair of scissors, then snipped it off again after surgeons reattached it.

She is now facing jail after being arrested for causing grievous bodily harm.

Fan Lung (right) turned on his wife (left) after she cut off his penis for a second time and he was spotted naked and bloody attacking her outside the hospital

Two-timing dad-of-five Fan Lung, 32, had used his wife's mobile to send lover Zhang Hung, 21, a saucy email from his marital home in the city of Shangqiu in central China's Henan province.

But after forgetting to log out of his account, stunned wife Feng came across the message and several others, and flew into a rage.

Grabbing a pair of scissors she stormed into their bedroom where he was sleeping and cut off his penis.

Surgeons were able to reattach it, but fuming Feng sneaked into his hospital room and cut it off again before throwing it out of a window.

This prompted the cheat to turn on his wife and he was spotted naked and bloody attacking her outside the hospital.

A hospital spokesman said: 'The first we were aware of what happened was when someone came into the reception area to say a naked man was beating up a woman outside the hospital.

'Staff rushed out to see what was happening and found the patient with blood streaming down his legs hitting the woman.

'He was stopped and the woman was taken in for treatment, and then we discovered she had chopped his penis off again.'

Lover: Zhang Hung (left) visited Fan (right) in hospital and said she planned to marry him as soon as she could

Doctors and police officers combed the area outside but failed to find the man's missing member. They believe it may have been taken by a stray dog or cat.

The hospital spokesman said: 'The man had lost a lot of blood and was taken in for emergency surgery.

'He is now in a stable condition but is extremely emotionally distraught.'

A wife who cut off her cheating husband’s penis sneaked back into hospital to remove it for a second time.

She allegedly flew into a rage after discovering a flirty email exchange between husband Fan Lung and his lover Zhang Hung – on her mobile phone.

The 32-year-old’s pride and joy was snipped off with a pair of scissors as he slept at his home in Shangqiu, China’s Henan province.

He was taken to hospital where he had it sewn back on. However, his fuming spouse, 30, slipped into his treatment room and cut it off again before throwing it out of a window.

‘Someone told reception a naked man was beating up a woman outside,’ a hospital spokesman said.

‘Staff found the patient with blood streaming down his legs hitting the woman. He was stopped and his wife was taken in for treatment.

‘Then we discovered she had chopped his penis off again.’

Doctors and police officers combed the area outside but failed to find the dad-of-five’s missing member.

They believe it may have been stolen by a stray dog or cat.

‘He is now in a stable condition but emotionally distraught,’ the spokesman added.

His wife was discharged and is under arrest for grievous bodily harm.

The Los Angeles Times reports the luxury property has an asking price of $7.1 million.

The agency searching for a buyer made no secret of Woods’ motivation to sell. Sabine Rollinger, of Vladi Private Islands, said the property is of little practical use to the golf superstar.

“This island was owned by Tiger Woods but after his divorce he doesn’t need an island in Sweden any more.”

Nordegren told People in May of 2014 that she and Woods live a 25-minute drive apart in Southern Florida and share custody of their two children, daughter Sam and son Charlie. The children were, at that time, 6 and 5 respectively.

“I have moved on and I am in a good place. My relationship with Tiger is centered around our children and we are doing really good — we really are — and I am so happy that is the case. He is a great father.”

Nordegren gave the interview to People as she finally received her psychology degree after nine years of chipping away at courses. She graduated with a 3.96 GPA and gave the commencement address at her institution, Rollins College. Her speech made a silent reference to her marriage to Woods.

“Education has been the only consistent part of my life the last nine years. And it has offered me comfort. Education is one thing that no one can take away from you.”

The island is in Sweden’s Lake Mälaren and boasts a villa, hunting lodge, landing strip, stables, woods, lush parks, and tee-off area. There’s also a unique historical artifact: an 11th-century Viking stronghold. But anyone who buys the property will have to ferry in a couch, since the property is listed as unfurnished.

The Boston Herald reports that after Elin and Tiger’s divorce, they sold their home in Windermere, Florida, to another golf star, left-hander Bubba Watson. Woods’ extensive Florida compound is in Hobe Sound, Florida, and Nordegren’s Florida home is in North Palm Beach.

Last year, Tiger Woods’ career earnings surpassed the $1.3 billion mark. ESPN quotes a Golf Digest report in stating that 88 percent of those earnings were for endorsements off the green. In 2013, Woods made $12 million playing golf and $71 million in endorsements.

After revelations came to light about Woods’ infidelity, his endorsement earnings dropped to an all-time low of $62 million in 2011. He made $100 million in endorsements in each of 2008 and 2009."

Golfers, take note — Tiger Woods’ Swedish luxury island, complete with six tee-off locations, is now up for grabs.

Located in Lake Mälaren, Sweden, the island was previously home to Woods and his then-wife, Swedish native Elin Nordegren, before their marriage famously collapsed in 2010 due to Woods’ infidelity.

In addition to being a golfer’s paradise, the 62-acre haven features a villa, hunting lodge, private ferry boat, horse stables and landing strip for propeller planes.

Sabine Rollinger of Vladi Private Islands, who are listing the island, told Mercury Press Agency that the escape is “unique due to its central location, as the Swedish capital is only about an hour away by boat or car, and from there you have swift access to the Stockholm archipelago.”

The property is also home to a historic 11th-century Viking stronghold, “a dramatic landscape with approximately 30-meter-high rocks rising out of the lake.”

Lake Mälaren is an enviable swim destination, as the water temperature reaches up to 79 degrees Fahrenheit in the summer months.

Found near Stockholm, the 62-acre island was purchased by a Swedish businessman in 2006 and developed as a retreat for the golfer and his then wife, Elin Nordegren. A deal for the property was never consummated, however, and the couple divorced in 2010. The island is now on the market with an asking price of about $7.1 million.

Situated in Lake Mälaren, the private island features a villa, a hunting lodge, guest quarters, horse stables, a dock and a landing strip for propeller planes, as well as a structure of historical significance: an 11th century Viking stronghold.

The main villa, fashioned in log cabin style, spans about 2,475 square feet with a chef’s kitchen, a dining area and a living room fireplace. Adjacent from the villa is a spa and a pool built around a rock outcrop.

Elsewhere on the grounds are six golf tee boxes.

Two smaller islands and a 494-acre water area for hunting and fishing are included in the sale. What’s not included is the furniture; the property is being marketed as unfurnished, according to Vladi Private Islands, the real estate agency that holds the listing.

Woods, whose career earnings eclipsed the $1.3-billion mark last year, announced that he would take part in the Waste Management Phoenix Open starting Jan. 29, followed by Torrey Pines in La Jolla in February. He was limited to seven PGA Tour events last year due to injury.

Keen golfers can have their very own putting paradise if they snap up this luxury island previously owned by Tiger Woods.

The island in Lake Mälaren, Sweden, was one of the homes shared by the 14-time major winner and his ex-wife, Elin Nordegren, before their six-year marriage fell apart in 2010.

The 62-acre island features a secluded villa, a hunting lodge, its very own landing strip for propeller planes as well as, of course, six tee-off areas for a custom-made golf hole.

Very private: The 62-acre island previously home to Tiger Woods and his ex-wife Elin Nordegren

An animal shelter is trying to track down the owner who abandoned a young Shar Pei at a railway station in Scotland, leaving him leashed to a rail with a suitcase full of his belongings.

The Scottish Society for Prevention of Cruelty to Animals (SPCA), an animal welfare charity, said the wrinkly-faced crossbreed was discovered last Friday at Ayr railway station. His suitcase was packed with a pillow, a toy, some food and a bowl.

The dog was microchipped, so the charity was able to find the dog’s name, Kai. The group was also able to track Kai’s previous owner whom the microchip was registered to.

His previous owners said they sold him on the classified ads website, Gumtree, in 2013. The were unable to provide the charity with the address of the person who bought Kai.

If found, the owner could be charged under Scotland’s Animal Health and Welfare Act.

Scottish SPCA inspector Stewart Taylor said the case highlights the unfortunate consequences of selling an animal online.

“Regardless of the fact Kai was left with his belongings, this was still a cruel incident and we are keen to identify the person responsible,” he said “If anyone can help we would ask them to get in touch as soon as possible.”

The Scottish SPCA said Kai is a “lovely dog with a nice nature”, and estimate that he is between two to three years old. The charity said it will care for the dog until they find him a permanent home.

Ben Supple, a spokesman with the charity, told the Guardian on Tuesday afternoon that the prospect of Kai finding a loving home looks promising.

“We haven’t as yet found a home for Kai though we’ve been inundated with offers and will ensure we find him the right owner,” Supple said.

Anyone with information about Kai is urged to contact the charity’s animal helpline at 03000 999 999."

Kai’s heart-breaking story received media attention around the world after he was discovered tied to a railing outside Ayr station in Scotland.

The Scottish SPCA has received hundreds of messages online after Wimbledon champion Andy Murray and Trainspotting author Irvine Welsh tweeted about Kai.

A spokeswoman for the charity said it has received dozens of calls from members of the public offering Kai a new home.

“The phone’s been ringing off the hook all day. We’ve had over 100 offers to take him on. It’s really unusual to get that sort of interest,” the SSPCA said.

“Normally, when we get an abandonment, it’s usually a staffie and we don’t tend to get many offers to re-home them, but when it’s an unusual breed or a particularly cute one, then we get a lot of interest.

“I’m sure Kai’s story has tugged at a lot of heartstrings.”

The Scottish Society for the Prevention of Cruelty to Animals is investigating an incident of a dog abandoned at a train station along with a suitcase.

The SPCA says the dog was found Jan. 2 tied to a railing at the Ayr railway station in South Ayrshire, Scotland. The suitcase was filled with possessions, including a pillow, a toy, food bowl, and food, according to the SPCA.

Inspector Stewart Taylor said the dog's name is Kai.

Officials said the male shar-pei crossbreed, who is 2 or 3 years old, had a microchip and they were able to track down the last registered owner.

""Unfortunately they could not tell us the address of the person who bought him. This case highlights the potential consequences of selling an animal online as it often leads to the impulse buying of pets that people know very little about,"" according to the SPCA website.

The SPCA says the society will look after him until a suitable owner is found.

Kai the Shar-Pei crossbreed is now the most popular dog in the Scottish SPCA's history after he was found tied to railings outside Ayr station with a case containing a toy, bowl, food and a pillow.

Just like Paddington Bear, he was saved after a human took pity on him - and the two-year-old has since been lapping up the attention at the charity's rehoming centre in Glasgow

Staff have received more than 100 phone calls and more than 80 e-mails offering him a new home.

Enjoying the attention: Kai the Shar-Pei crossbreed at the Scottish SPCA's rehoming centre in Glasgow

Character: The charity has had more than 100 phone calls and 80 emails - but Kai (above) will stay in Scotland

Assistant manager Katrina Cavanagh said Kai's success had taken staff by surprise. 'We just can't believe how big this became,' she said. 'But then, it's not every day you get a dog abandoned with his own suitcase'

The delighted staff face days of work to whittle down the flood of applications after poignant photos of Kai went viral - but they insist the new owner will be in Scotland.

Assistant manager Katrina Cavanagh said: 'We've had offers from America, the Philippines, Canada and England and we're trying to work our way through them.

'We've had good responses in the past but this is off the scale. We've never had offers from the other side of the world before.

'What we're saying to people is fill out a questionnaire, and Anna the manager and I will have a wee look through, whittle them down and make a decision. It'll be hard but we'll get there.

'We just can't believe how big this became, but then, it's not every day you get a dog abandoned with his own suitcase.'

Kai has been compared to Paddington bear after his ordeal, which has prompted an investigation by the animal welfare charity.

Until it is complete, he will not be handed over to a new family, so it could be some time before he is adopted.

Vow: The charity will rehome Kai in the country where he was found abandoned on railings at a train station

New friends: Kai investigating the characters on a donations bucket for the animal rescue charity

Hello! Kai in his new lodgings, which he has been in and out of constantly because of all the attention

Grumpy? Kai needs surgery for entropions - inward-curling eyelids - but his fans have already raised the cash

He also needs surgery for entropions, inward-curling eyelids, which the charity will pay for.

There has been an enthusiastic response on social media, with even author Irvine Welsh tweeting: 'If I was in Ayr that boy would be coming home with Welshy. Yes he would! Yes he would!’

Seizing on the publicity, the Scottish SPCA set up a JustGiving page yesterday to raise the £1,000 needed for Kai's operation - and it has already raised almost double that.

All leftover funds will go towards other animals in the care of the charity.

Ms Cavanagh added: 'He's loved the attention. He's been in and out of his kennel so many times being filmed and having his picture taken. He's a very happy boy and he's behaved perfectly.

'We're also seeing a boost in donations. A lot of people have come here in person and mentioned him.'

Animal welfare experts warned his owners could face a lifetime ban from keeping animals after the 'cruel' incident.

Scottish SPCA inspector Stewart Taylor said: 'The dog is microchipped and we were able to find out his name is Kai.

 -- A dog was found abandoned at a Scottish train station next to a suitcase filled with its belongings and now the local animal welfare charity are looking for tips into who is the neglectful owner.

The dog, a male shar-pei named Kai, was found sitting with a leash attached to a banister at the Ayr railway station on Jan. 2, according to the Scottish Society for Prevention of Cruelty to Animals.

""Kai is around two to three years old and is a lovely dog with a nice nature,"" Scottish SPCA Inspector Stewart Taylor said in the group's release.

The group reported that the suitcase contained a dog bowl, food, a pillow and toy -- although that doesn't clear the owner from wrongdoing.

Abandoning an animal is an offense in Scotland and, if they are able to determine who left the dog in the station, that person or persons could be banned from owning animals for life.

""Regardless of the fact Kai was left with his belongings, this was still a cruel incident and we are keen to identify the person responsible,"" Taylor said.

Officials were able to determine the dog's name because the animal had been microchipped by a previous owner. When they contacted that individual, he reported that he had sold the dog in 2013 but did not have any information on the new owner.

Taylor said that the group will care for the dog until they find an owner for Kai."

A dog has been found abandoned at a railway station along with a suitcase filled with his belongings.

The Scottish SPCA is keen to trace the owner of shar pei-crossbeed Kai, who was discovered tied to a railing outside Ayr station on Friday.

He was accompanied by a case containing items including a pillow, toy, food and bowl.

The dog was sold on the Gumtree website in 2013 and the charity is appealing for information to help trace whoever bought him.

Scottish SPCA inspector Stewart Taylor said: ""The dog is microchipped and we were able to find out his name is Kai.

""We contacted the owner registered to the microchip, who stated they had sold Kai on Gumtree in 2013. Unfortunately they could not tell us the address of the person who bought him.

(Image: PA)

""This case highlights the potential consequences of selling an animal online as it often leads to the impulse buying of pets that people know very little about.

""Regardless of the fact Kai was left with his belongings, this was still a cruel incident and we are keen to identify the person responsible. If anyone can help we would ask them to get in touch as soon as possible.

""Kai is around two to three years old and is a lovely dog with a nice nature. We will look after him until we can find him a permanent and loving home.""

Station staff looked after Kai until the Scottish SPCA arrived at the scene on Friday.

He is now being cared for at the charity's centre in Glasgow.

The charity said abandoning an animal is an offence under the Animal Health and Welfare (Scotland) Act 2006 and anyone found guilty of doing so can expect to be banned from keeping animals for a fixed period or life."

Operation was carried out by a vet at a practice in North Walsham, Norfolk

Man spent £300 on operation save his goldfish after it became constipated

A devoted pet owner has spent £300 on saving the life of his goldfish after it became constipated.

The man, who has not been named, took the fish to a veterinary practice in North Walsham, Norfolk, after noticing it was struggling to eliminate waste.

He had hoped it would be a simple procedure but was told by staff at the Toll Barn Veterinary Centre that the delicate surgery required to save his pet would cost £300.

The company boss initially turned down the treatment but changed his mind 10 minutes later and went back to give the go-ahead.

The pet owner, who has not been named, took his goldfish (pictured) to Toll Barn Veterinary Centre in North Walsham, Norfolk, and paid £300 for it to have a special operation after noticing it had become constipated

Vet Faye Bethell, 29, put anaesthetising agent into the fish's water before using tiny instruments to remove two lumps from its body. The three-inch pet went on to make a full recovery after the 50-minute operation

Vet Faye Bethell, 29, was then tasked with carefully administering anaesthetic before using tiny instruments to remove a lump close to the fish's backside.

A second lump was removed from his dorsal fin before the fish was returned to water and handed back to his grateful owner.

Ms Bethell said the three-inch fish made a full recovery after the 50-minute operation and said it would have died if it was left untreated.

She said: 'I have never done a procedure like that on a goldfish, although I have done it before on more valuable fish like a carp.

Vet Faye Bethell, 29 (pictured), carried out the delicate £300 operation on the constipated goldfish

'The actual surgery is quite straightforward but administering the anaesthetic is quite complicated.

'The issue was the fish couldn't poo and it would have eventually become toxic and it would have died.

'There was nothing special about the fish. He just liked it a lot. People love their pets - but that was an expensive little goldfish.'

The delicate procedure involved introducing a carefully-measured anaesthetising agent into the fish's water.

It was then removed from its tank and placed on a waterproof drape before anaesthetic water was put into its mouth via a tube and bubbled over its gills.

Ms Bethell then used a miniature heart-rate monitor to check that the fish was properly 'under' before using a mini scalpel to remove the lumps.

She then sewed each cut with three stitches before using a special 'glue' to cover and waterproof the fish's scales before it was gradually re-awakened.

Goldfish can live up to 10 years and this ailing pet was two years and 10 months old at the time of its operation.

The Toll Barn practice opened a year ago and specialises in exotic animals as well as the more usual pets.

Ms Bethell revealed that in the past year she has carried out a string of bizarre operations including the removal of a 12g skin tumour from a two-inch long hognose snake.

She has also successfully taken out a stone from the 5mm-wide ureter of a guinea pig and last week castrated a skunk.

Earlier this year, Melbourne veterinarian Dr. Tristan Rich (pictured) - head of exotics and wildlife medicine at Lort Smith Animal Hospital - performed micro-surgery on a goldfish called George to remove a cancer tumour

The 10-year-old goldfish had a large tumour on his head, making it difficult for him to breathe and swim

During the 'fiddly' operation, the tumour - which had stretched down to the fish's skull - was cut out (pictured)

It is not the first time a goldfish has undergone a traumatic operation to save its life.

Earlier this year, Melbourne veterinarian Dr. Tristan Rich - head of exotics and wildlife medicine at Lort Smith Animal Hospital - performed micro-surgery on a goldfish called George.

The 10-year-old pet had a large tumour on his head, making it difficult for him to breathe and swim. He was also unable to eat properly, and the tumour was affecting his ability to see.

His owners had been monitoring the growth of the tumour which was sprouting from his head, and decided to opt for the surgery which cost $200 (£105)."

A goldfish lover from Norfolk paid hundreds of pounds in vets' fees when his pet became constipated.

The owner took his ailing fish to Toll Barn Veterinary Centre in North Walsham where vets told him it was constipated and an operation would cost about £300.

Vet Faye Bethell used anaesthetised water to knock out the goldfish before removing the blockages.

""At the end of the day they're all pets and everybody does have a commitment to their pet,"" Miss Bethell said.

""[The goldfish] was constipated because he had a lump blocking his bottom, rather than because of his diet or any other reason,"" she said.

The operation, which took almost an hour, was performed by Miss Bethell, assisted by two veterinary nurses.

""Obviously, we discussed all the options [with its owner] and he made the decision to go for surgery.

19-year-old Iga Jasica of Poland began making headlines recently after the rumor got out that she accidentally awoke during brain surgery to enjoy a friendly conversation with the surgical staff about cats. Though only part of the story is true, we’re sort of thrilled to be able to report that it’s the part about the mid-brain surgery conversation about cats. Iga revealed on her Facebook page Saturday that her temporary consciousness during the procedure was actually all part of the plan.

The teen told well wishers that when it came to the publications sharing her story, many “articles have a lot of mistakes.” She explains that far from being a shock to her doctors, “waking me up was deliberate – This method is called Awake Craniatomy. It was deliberate and planned.”

Jasica even provided readers with a link to the website of University Hospital Southampton where the surgery is described in detail. “An awake craniotomy is an operation performed in the same manner as a conventional craniotomy but with the patient awake during the procedure. This is a preferred technique for operations to remove lesions close to, or involving, eloquent (functionally important) regions of the brain. This allows us to test regions of the brain before they are incised or removed and allows us to test patient’s function continuously throughout the operation. The overall aim is to minimise the risks of such operations,” it says.

Despite the fact that her brain was indeed exposed during the waking parts of her surgery, neurosurgeon Dawid Larysz recently assured The Daily Mirror that Jasica would not have been able to see or hear anything. “Despite coming round, she didn’t feel anything and was never in danger,” he said.

Jasica herself later commented, “I can’t remember much, but the doctor said he talked to me about cats, which I love. I missed Christmas because of this operation, but it is the best present I could have had, as I am now feeling great.”

She stresses on her Facebook page that the “operation was successful and there was nothing damaged.” The teen says it’s important to her that people know that the “Doctors saved my life” and encourages readers to “not be influenced by stupid articles.”

Otherwise the 19-year-old seems to be progressing well in her recovery and is looking forward to healthier days. Whether or not she’s decided to seize the opportunity to regale countless future strangers with bad jokes about being the “brains of the operation” she has yet to reveal."

Iga Jasica, 19, was receiving treatment at Central Clinical Hospital, for a cancerous growth on her brain. According to the Mirror, Jasica awoke during the surgery after the anesthetic she had been administered wore off.

Jasica’s brain was exposed as she verbally communicated with the doctors, asking them how the surgery was going. Her tone was apparently casual, and she wasn’t disturbed by waking up during the procedure.

“Despite coming round she didn’t feel anything and was never in danger,” said Neurosurgeon Professor Dawid Larysz, who explained that the girl couldn’t see or feel anything during the operation.

Jasica remained optimistic about her experience in the operating room, mostly acknowledging her gratitude that the surgery was successful.

“I can’t remember much but the doctor said he talked to me about cats, which I love. I missed Christmas because of this operation but it is the best present I could have had as I am now feeling great,” Jasica said.

According to Fox News, doctors at the hospital are investigating whether or not the anesthetic was improperly administered prior to Jessica’s operation.

Surgeons don’t yet know exactly how the organ works, so it’s always a risk.

Iga Jasica, a 19-year-old Polish girl, woke up while it was happening and gave the surgeons a surprise. The reason for the surgery was to remove a tumor which had apparently been bothering her for a while. It is suspected that the surgeons may have triggered neurons which caused her to regain consciousness and the ability to hear and speak, but not the senses of sight and feeling.

It was also possible that the doctors had given her the anesthetics incorrectly. Fox News claims that investigators are looking into the reason why Jasica spent part of her brain surgery awake. The surgeons may have simply activated the right neurons despite successful administration of anesthesia.

The surprisingly premature brain surgery recovery is a rare situation, and the surgeons said the first thing she did was ask them, “How’s it going?”

Iga Jasica allegedly didn’t appear to wake up in pain, and didn’t sound panicked or frightened. Officials have stated that even though her brain was fully exposed, there was no danger, and her health was not in jeopardy.

The patient reportedly felt so comfortable that as she chatted with the surgeons, Jasica started talking about cats.

After her successful brain surgery recovery, Jasica told the Daily Mail about the experience.

“I can’t remember much but the doctor said he talked to me about cats, which I love. “I missed Christmas because of this operation but it is the best present I could have had as I am now feeling great.”

Spending part of brain surgery awake can be a scary situation, but this time everything turned out fine. It even led to an amusing tale of a 19-year-old girl who got rid of a brain tumor and loves cats.

A teenager woke up in the middle of a brain operation and asked doctors how it was going before chatting about cats.

Iga Jasica, 19, had been taken to the Central Clinical Hospital in the city of Katowice in southwest Poland for the operation to remove a cancerous growth.

But halfway through the critical surgery she woke up after the anaesthetic wore off and started talking to the surgeons about how it was going.

Doctors say her brain was exposed at the time.

Neurosurgeon Professor Dawid Larysz said: ""Despite coming round she didn’t feel anything and was never in danger.""

He said the young woman would not have been able to see or feel anything.

Experts said the operation may have triggered something that caused her to come round despite the anaesthetic, but doctors are also investigating whether the anaesthetic was properly applied.

After the operation Iga said: ""I can’t remember much but the doctor said he talked to me about cats, which I love.

Halfway through brain surgery aimed to remove a cancerous growth, a teenager allegedly woke up and asked the doctors, ‘How’s it going?’

Iga Jasica, 19, went through this serious procedure at Central Clinical Hospital in Katowice, south-west Poland.

On prematurely waking from anaesthesia, she was apparently neither panicky or in agony but rather calmly inquired after the progress of the operation.

An investigation has begun into the incident but the hospital have insisted that the patient suffered no undue pain despite regaining consciousness mid-surgery.

Miss Jasica allegedly told reporters: ‘I can’t remember much but the doctor said he talked to me about cats, which I love.

YouTuber Josh Paler Lin – better-known for his hilarious pranks – was feeling the holiday spirit and decided to give a homeless man in California $100 to see what he would do with it.

He followed the man, Thomas, with a camera to see how he spent the money. His first stop was a liquor store, but not for the reasons some might think: He bought bread and then headed over to a park, where Lin filmed him distributing the food to other homeless people.

When Lin approached him at the park, Thomas explained his story. He quit his job to take care of his sick parents, only to lose his home after his parents died within two weeks of each other. He’s been on the streets for four months.

“I feel I owe you an apology,” Lin told Thomas after hearing his story.

Thomas explained that he simply wanted to use the money to help others in his situation. Lin gave him another $100 and has even started a crowdfunding campaign to help buy Thomas clothes, food and get him on the road to a job. He’s already surpassed his $10,00 goal and raised over $60,000.

“There are things money can’t buy and I get happiness out of what I’m doing,” Thomas told Lin.

“And I honestly truly understand what he meant right after because as I’ve helped him I feel so happy,” Lin told TODAY."

A video published Monday about Thomas, a homeless man, went mega viral, wracking up nearly 2 million views in about a day (now up to over 14 million almost 28 million views).

Hours after that, via an Indiegogo crowdfunding site, the Internet had pledged to give the man more than $13,000. By December 24 the tally was over $75,000; by 26, $101,000 and as of December 30, the total was over $128,000 and still climbing, though not as fast.

Here's what happened: YouTube prankster star Josh Paler Lin wanted to find out what happens if you give a homeless guy $100. How would he spend that money? He approached Thomas, who was holding a sign on the street asking for money, and gave him $100. Thomas was near tears at the amount and tried to refuse but Lin insisted.

Lin then followed Thomas with a camera. Thomas beelined for a liquor store.

But it turns out, Thomas bought food at the store. He then walked to a nearby park and handed the food out to other homeless folks, people he didn't know.

Lin, who was hiding and filming, was floored. He came out of hiding and apologized to Thomas.

Thomas has been homeless for about four months, he told Lin when asked. He wound up on the street after both of his parents died. They had grown ill and their insurance didn't cover all of their care, so he quit his job to take care of them. After they died, their condo was sold to pay the bills and he had no place to go.

""There's a lot of people that are just victims of circumstance and they didn't go homeless because they're lazy or ... it could be a divorce, one thing leads to another and the man sells his boat, his home, everything, and all of a sudden he finds out he's got no money. There's a lot of good people that are homeless,"" he told Lin.

The man touched Lin so much, he insisted Thomas take another $100. But it touched viewers so much, they insisted that Lin set up a crowdfunding account where they could donate to help get Thomas back on his feet.

In the time it took us to write this post, the account went from $10,000 to more than $13,000. The Internet is going to be very generous on this one. We'll update this post with the final donation number when the fund raising ends."

Lin's lawyer told NBC News that the allegations are false and defamatory. He also provided this statement on behalf of Josh Lin: ""On December 20th, 2014, my videographer and I went out to film a social experiment to find out how a homeless man would spend $100. After driving around Fullerton we came upon Thomas on the side of the 91 highway around 1 o’clock. We then followed Thomas for about 10 minutes before he walked into the liquor store. And then my videographer and I proceeded to follow him for another 45 minutes where he began handing out food to the local homeless people in the park. I then revealed myself and apologized for misjudging him. Once we had finished filming, my videographer and I wanted to get to know him more and took him out to eat at the local Thai food restaurant before we dropped him back off at the homeless shelter. ""

Original story:

Let's face it: Many of us hesitate to hand money to the homeless, concerned they will spend it in ways we'd consider unwise.

But one man put that belief to the test ... and his surprising new video showing what happened after he gave a homeless man $100 has already racked up over 10 million views on YouTube.

Josh Paler Lin, whose YouTube channel has more than 711,000 subscribers and usually features pranks, thought he'd try a social experiment: Give a homeless man money, then follow him in secret to see what he'd do with it.

And sure enough, the man's first stop was at a liquor store. He emerged with a bag and took it to a nearby park. Well, what do you expect, right?

Wrong: Once at the park, the man pulled food from the bag and shared it with his fellow homeless.

""My heart was crushed,"" Lin told TODAY.

After witnessing what the homeless man, whose name is Thomas, did with the cash, Lin approached him on camera and explained that he'd been following him. He apologized and gave Thomas more money.

Thomas said that he'd quit his job to take care of his sick parents, then lost his family home after they died. He said he's been on the street for four months.



Lin decided to take action, setting up a crowdfunding page to raise money to help Thomas get off the streets. Donations thus far have topped $50,000.

""People think I changed his life,"" said Lin, who maintains the video was not staged. ""For me, it's completely the opposite. I feel that he changed my life.""

Josh Lin watched -- and filmed -- as the subject of his experiment entered a liquor store. Then he got a surprise.

The man holding up the sign asking for money from the freeway offramp in Fullerton bought food, walked to a neighborhood park and gave it to others in need.

What Lin witnessed left him stunned. The amateur filmmaker has made a name for himself on social media with pranks that capture the public’s reaction to unexpected situations. But in this case, Lin was the one caught off guard.

“I feel like I owe you an apology,” Lin confessed to the man, whom he identified only as Thomas. “I thought you were going to buy alcohol or something.”

“There’s things money can’t buy,” Thomas responded. “I get happiness out of what I’m doing.

“There’s a lot of people that are just victim of circumstance, that didn’t go homeless because they’re lazy.”

Thomas said he became homeless after his parents died within weeks of each other and the condo he shared with them was sold.

The video has been viewed more than 11.4 million times on YouTube since it was posted on Monday. On Lin’s multiple social media pages, he says he was so moved by Thomas’ generosity that he put him up in a hotel and has launched a fundraiser to get Thomas back on his feet.

The account had more than $55,000 as of Wednesday morning.

YouTube channel owner Josh Paler Lin decided to see it for himself and capture it all on camera.

Normally when you think of the homeless, you probably picture some drug or alcohol addict who is only taking money from passerby to support their next fix. Some of them even make more money than the average full-time employee working legally just because they’re good actors with bad clothes and not homeless at all.

Instead of assuming the worst, Josh put his money into finding the truth. He started the video asking the audience a question and explaining his idea.

“When you give homeless people money, do you ever wonder how they spent it? Today I’m going to give a homeless guy a hundred dollars, and I’m going to follow him and see how he spent it.”

Josh approached a homeless man at an intersection holding up one of the usual cardboard signs asking for help, and begins a conversation with the man. As Josh hands the man the hundred dollars, he tears up at the generosity, telling him plainly that nobody’s ever given him that much.

Josh then left the intersection as the camera remained trained on the man. As expected, the first place he went was a liquor store, but if you watch what happens, it’s not what you’re probably thinking. Coming out with a few things in bags, he made his way to the park and started handing food and other items to the homeless people there.

After witnessing this twice, Josh approached the homeless man and told him that what he saw really touched him. He confessed that he had the man followed to see what he would do, and had his doubts initially. The man told Josh that some of the homeless are just people who fell on hard luck, and he told him his story.

To reward the man for his generosity paid forward, Josh gave him another hundred dollars.

Does this change how you think about the homeless?

Ting Su, 29, caught bed-hopping partner Cheng, 30, romping naked in an underground carpark along with her TWIN SISTER after using a mobile phone tracker to locate their whereabouts.

And when the wailing wife confronted the treacherous twosome about their red-hot rear-seat rendezvous, the stunned pair reacted by jumping out of the vehicle.

Quick-thinking Ting seized her chance for instant karma and drove off – leaving the secret rompers bare-bummed and red-faced on the tarmac at a local shopping centre in the city of Suzhou, eastern China.

A woman who found out her boyfriend was cheating on her became an internet sensation when she scrawled abuse over his prized motor and posted photos of it online last month.

Stunned Maria Alejandra Samaniego, 25, went ballistic when she found cheating Pabil Muniz Quintanilla, 27, in bed with another woman at his home in Barranquilla, Colombia.

After storming out, she returned several hours later with a friend and convinced the security guard to let them into the garage area without letting Quintanilla know.

As pal Valeria Cazares Aranda, 28, filmed, Maria took a permanent black marker from her pocket and covered the gleaming white Mercedes with abuse, accusing him of being a ""c**p s***"", questioning the size of his manhood and being a 'junkie loser'."

As firefighters rushed extinguish the massive blaze, Chien, 22, searched for his girlfriend, also 22, who forgot that he had asked her to join him for a walk.

“I was feeling a bit surprised that she hadn’t shown up, and was completely unaware that the fireworks had set the grass on fire,” Chien said. “When I found her I said she had to come with me as there was something important I wanted to tell her and show her.”

The fiasco didn’t deter Chien, who decided to postpone the proposal.

Yen said she found out later about Chien’s plan but his botched romantic gesture may have cost him the respect of his potential in-laws.

“Of course, I love him, but my parents have told me to steer clear, saying he can’t even ask me to marry him without causing a massive hoo-ha,” she said."

This is the shocking moment a woman accused of sleeping with someone else's husband was savagely beaten in broad daylight as passers-by watched on.

It's the latest in a string of copycat attacks in China, including one a month ago when a half-naked woman was stamped on by a stiletto-wearing rival.

Locals say such scraps go ignored because there is an acceptance that love cheats are deserving of a beating having caused a man to cheat on his partner.

In this latest incident, accused Lin Yao Li, 38, was ambushed by four women as she walked home from shops in Puyang, in eastern China's Henan Province.

Punching and kicking her to the ground while she writhed in agony, her attackers then ripped her clothes off and continued the beating, pulling her hair and kicking her in the breasts and groin.

Local reports say the sickening attack was carried out by the scorned wife of the man Lin is accused of sleeping with and her three friends.

Meanwhile, as the stomach-turning drama unfolded, scores of people pass by without making an attempt to help the outnumbered and defenceless victim.

Local man Jun Feng, 30, who helped the woman after spotting her lying on the ground told local TV: ""This type of thing is becoming quite normal.

""Angry wives and girlfriends get their revenge on their cheating men by attacking the other woman.

""People don't tend to get involved because they see it as being an argument of the heart.""

The woman was later taken to hospital where she was treated for cuts, severe bruising and shock.

Last month's attack in Jinan city, in Eastern China's Shandong Province, saw three women caught on camera attacking an alleged mistress.

She was violently stripped naked and beaten senseless by a mob of women on a busy shopping street ... but the police never came.

Indeed, nobody intervened as Lin Yao Li, 38, was kicked in the groin and breasts as she writhed screaming in agony on the pavement.

The reason, onlookers said, was that it was an 'argument of the heart' - she didn't deserve help because had slept with another woman's husband.

It is only the latest in a number of similar incidents in which it seems there is placid acceptance in Chinese society of such humiliation, as long as the victim is seen as deserving in having caused a man to cheat on his partner.

Tan Shen said that she was ""walking around feeling miserable"" when she passed the KFC restaurant in the city's train station.

She told local media: ""I hadn’t planned on staying there long, I just wanted some chicken wings. But once I got in there and started eating I decided I needed time to think.

""I didn’t want to go back to my apartment because it was full of memories of him. So I stayed.""

She telephoned her employers to say that she was sick, and was unable to go to work.

And so she settled in.

After a few days employees at the chicken shop noticed that the same woman was still there.

""We work in shifts here and the restaurant is open 24 hours a day, so we get a lot of people coming through. At first no one really noticed her,"" said Jiang Li Lung, 22.

""But after a few days I began thinking she looked really familiar. Then I realised we had been serving her for the past three days and that she hadn’t actually left.

""When we asked her if she was OK, she said she was and just needed time to think. And then asked for another box of chicken wings with extra large fries.""

Miss Tan decided that it was time to leave the restaurant when, after a week, local media begun to write about her.

So she telephoned her employer, said that she had decided to leave her job, and took a train to her parents home in Quingdao city in east China’s Shandong Province.

""And I was getting sick of the taste of chicken so there was no point in staying there anymore,"" she said.

Jiang Li Lung, who worked at KFC, said the staff now miss her.

Tan Shen, 26, says she stopped at a KFC near a train station on her way home from the breakup when she decided you know what, fuck this, this feels right and good and I don't need that asshole anyway. It's all about these wings. These wings right in front of me. One week's worth of wings, let's go.

Via Yahoo News, she explains:

'I hadn't planned on staying there long, I just wanted some chicken wings. 'But once I got in there and started eating I decided I needed time to think. 'I didn't want to go back to my apartment because it was full of memories of him. So I stayed.'

The KFC, which is 24 hours, said at first they didn't really notice the poor mourning girl because of the shift changes. Tan Shen decided it was time to return to her parents' home after local media started showing up a week into her Kentucky fried experiment, adding that she was ""getting sick of the taste of chicken.""

The staff at KFC said she'd be missed, so someone out there loves you, girl.

Tan Shen, 26, accidentally on-purpose spent a full week at a 24/7 KFC in Chengdu, calling in sick to work, to mourn the loss of her relationship.

“I hadn’t planned on staying there long, I just wanted some chicken wings,” Tan told Yahoo. “But once I got in there and started eating I decided I needed time to think.”

But is KFC really where you’d want to spend your time of mourning? Are the chicken wings really that good?

After all, Tan herself admits that after a week, “I was getting sick of the taste of chicken, so there was no point in staying there anymore.” (That and local media started showing up to take photos).

Here are some places that might have been better week-long hideaways:

McDonald’s

Find a Play Place and start enjoying the little things in life again.

Walmart

If it’s good enough for a 9-month pregnant woman, as depicted in Where The Heart Is, it should be good enough for the lovesick.

Anthropologie

Just so aesthetically pleasing.

A make-your-own, pay-by-the-pound Fro-Yo shop

Because… cliches.

Maybe then Tan would have looked slightly more upbeat:

Tan Shen, 26, said that she was walking around depressed after being dropped by her lover and went into a branch of the fast food outlet in a train station in Chengdu, China.

Staff eventually realised after three days that she had not left the store and she told them that she just needed time to think while ordering another box of chicken wings and extra large fries.

After being dumped by her boyfriend, Tan Shen says she was walking the city feeling depressed when she decided to stop into a KFC outlet in a train station in Chengdu China, reports Metro UK.

After ordering some chicken wings, Shen realized going back to her apartment would be too difficult.

“I hadn’t planned on staying there long, I just wanted some chicken wings. But once I got in there and started eating I decided I needed time to think,” Shen said. “I didn’t want to go back to my apartment because it was full of memories of him. So I stayed.”

Luckily for Shen, the place where she camped out is open for 24 hours. At first, the lovesick woman went unnoticed by employees since they work in different shifts.

""At first no one really noticed her. But after a few days I began thinking she looked really familiar. Then I realized we had been serving her for the past three days and that she hadn’t actually left,” Jiang Li Lung, a KFC employee said.

Shen ordered more wings and fries and continued to stay in her booth. After a week, local media reportedly started flocking to the restaurant so Shen decided it was time to leave.

""I decided the best thing to do would be to leave the city and go back to my parents. I had already told work I was off sick, so phoned them and said I was leaving,” Shen said.

But her best line ever?

""And I was getting sick of the taste of chicken so there was no point in staying there anymore.""

A Chinese woman spent an entire week in a KFC eating fried chicken wings after being dumped by her boyfriend because she ‘needed time to think’.

Lovesick Tan Shen, 26, from Chengdu, in China’s southwest Sichuan Province, went to the fast food chain in search of some comfort food to get over the break-up.

But seven days later Tan was still ordering chicken wings with a side of extra large fries at the KFC near a train station by her home.

Lovesick Tan Shen, 26, went to the fast food chain in search of some comfort food to get over the break-up

She even phoned in sick to work to stay at the restaurant.

Tan said: ‘I was walking around feeling miserable and decided to stop off at the KFC at the train station.

'I hadn’t planned on staying there long, I just wanted some chicken wings.

'But once I got in there and started eating I decided I needed time to think.

'I didn’t want to go back to my apartment because it was full of memories of him. So I stayed.'

After a few days employees at the chicken shop began to worry about Tan.

For seven days Tan ordered chicken wings with extra large fries at the KFC near a train station by her home

Tan said she stayed at the fast food restaurant for so long because she 'needed time to think'

Worker Jiang Li Lung, 22, said: 'We work in shifts here and the restaurant is open 24 hours a day, so we get a lot of people coming through.

'At first no one really noticed her.

'But after a few days I began thinking she looked really familiar.

'Then I realised we had been serving her for the past three days and that she hadn’t actually left.

'When we asked her if she was ok, she said she was and just needed time to think.

'And then asked for another box of chicken wings with extra large fries.'

Tan even called in sick to her work so she could spent time at the KFC recovering from her break-up

He said the Tan was doing no harm eating her way through boxes of chicken so they let her stay.

He added: 'She was after all a paying customer, even if a bit of an odd one.'

Tan decided she had had enough when local media turned up after a week at the KFC. And, unsurprisingly, she was starting to get sick of the taste of chicken.

'I decided the best thing to do would be to leave the city and go back to my parents.

It was only after a week that Tan decided she was 'sick of the taste of chicken' and she went home

'I had already told work I was off sick, so phoned them and said I was leaving.

'And I was getting sick of the taste of chicken so there was no point in staying there anymore.'

She then boarded the next train to her parents' home in Quingdao city in east China’s Shandong Province and left.

Waitress Jiang Li Lung said: 'I guess we kind of miss her. It certainly made work more interesting.'

It happened in Ganganagar in the north-western state of Rajasthan, in graphic scenes captured on video.

According to local authorities, the extreme action was a response to high-profile incidences of sexual attacks in India.

World-wide condemnation greeted the gang-rape of a student on a bus two years ago, which shook the image of the country.

Alleged attacker Suresh Kumar, 40, molested a teenager in a street, but her screams for help alerted a crowd which came to her aid.

Kumar was dragged into a nearby butcher's shop and beaten heavily with sticks for nearly an hour, according to reports. Vigilantes then hacked at his genitals with a meat cleaver, before throwing them into the street.

The incident left Kumar in a critical condition.

A reported witness said the action was intended to send out a message that sexual assault was not tolerated.

Aamir Dhawan, 30, said: ""We have had a lot of intolerable offences against women in this country recently, with girls being raped, hung, and molested, and it's time it stopped.

""This sends out a very strong message to anyone like that - if you do it you will be punished.""

A police spokesman, who called on the attackers to hand themselves in, said: ""As deplorable as these crimes are, law and order has to be maintained, and not lynch justice."""

Rajasthan , Oct 14: A man learnt a lesson, the hard way. Attempting to rape a teenager in public cost him his penis. A 46-year old man, Suresh Kumar was seen pinning a teenager to the wall in Ganganagar in Rajasthan. The next moment, he saw his penis chopped off and thrown on the road. He was dragged and taken to a local butcher shop where he was beaten with sticks for more than an hour.

Thereafter, his asset was hacked with a meat cleaver and dumped in the middle of the road. According to the Daily Star, the man was abandoned bloodied and bruised, with no one helping him. One local said,""No one went to help the man because they could see his penis on the ground and knew this was punishment for a sex crime.""

Calling it a message for the people with perverted mindset, the man further added,""We have had a lot of intolerable offences against women in this country recently, with girls being raped, hanged, and molested, and it's time it stopped.""

The police, however, have condemned the attack and warned locals not to take laws in their hands. They have further asked those involved in the deed to hand themselves in. A police officer said,""As deplorable as these crimes are, law and order has to be maintained, and not lynch justice.""

Jaipur: A man who was allegedly caught red-handed trying to rape a teenage girl in Rajasthan is in a critical condition in hospital after locals chopped off his genitals with a meat cleaver.

The incident took place in Ganganagar district in Rajasthan.

Locals got alerted by the girl's screams for help and found 40-year-old Suresh Kumar pinning the girl against a wall. The mob dragged him to a nearby butchers’ shop where he was beaten up with sticks for an hour before castrating him, as reported on Friday.

The report said, the locals then dumped the severed remains in the middle of a road and left a bloodied Kumar nearby.

The Daily Mail quoted an eyewitness, Aamir Dhawan saying that no one 'went to help' Kumar because they knew he had been punished for a 'sex crime'

""We have had a lot of intolerable offences against women in this country recently, with girls being raped, hung, and molested, and it's time it stopped. This sends out a very strong message to anyone like that - if you do it you will be punished,"" Dhawan said.

Police said people can't take the law into their ""own hands"" and they are looking for the attackers.

The man reportedly attempted to have sex with the teenager in the city of Ganganagar, India, but locals found him down an alley, pinning the terrified girl to a wall.

The 40-year-old was then dragged away by the angry mob of vigilantes while they all decided what to do with him.

Unfortunately for the alleged attempted rapist, what they decided was to take him to a local butcher's shop where they apparently beat him with sticks for an hour.

They then hacked off his penis with a meat cleaver and dumped the remains in the middle of the road, leaving his beaten and bloody body nearby.

Daily Star online has seen the picture of the severed member on the road but we have censored the graphic image.

Local man Aamir Dhawan, 30, said: ""No one went to help the man because they could see his penis on the ground and knew this was punishment for a sex crime.

""We have had a lot of intolerable offences against women in this country recently, with girls being raped, hung, and molested, and it’s time it stopped.

""This sends out a very strong message to anyone like that - if you do it you will be punished.""

However, police have taken a dim view of the vigilante attack and have called on those responsible to hand themselves in.

A local police spokesman said: ""People cannot take the law into your own hands.

""As deplorable as these crimes are, law and order has to be maintained, and not lynch justice.

""We ask those men who carried out this attack to hand themselves in before we find them.""

The man was eventually taken to hospital where doctors described his condition as critical.

An alleged attempted rapist in India received a grisly punishment for his alleged attack on a young teenager – an angry mob dragged him into a butcher’s shop where his penis was severed with a meat cleaver.

Suresh Kumar, 40, was set upon when locals in the city of Ganganagar in India’s north-western Rajasthan state heard a girl’s screams.

A mob dragged Kumar away after he was found in an alley allegedly pinning his victim to a wall – and then the group held a vigilante community meeting to decide what to do with him.

He was beaten with sticks for an hour, and dragged into a local butcher’s shop where his organ was severed with a meat cleaver.

It was thrown into the street.

Kumar is still in a critical condition after the attack.

Suresh Kumar, 40, is now recovering in hospital after he was apparently dragged into a butchers shop in the city of Ganganagar, in India’s Rajasthan state.

He had allegedly been seen pinning the petrified girl to a wall, which is when he was pulled off and taken to a store to have his genitals hacked off with a meat cleaver.

The appendage was reportedly thrown into the road, with officers now hunting down the perpetrators. He is understood to be in a critical condition, while the girl was treat for shock.

Aamir Dhawan, 30, a local, said: “No one went to help the man because they could see his penis on the ground and knew this was punishment for a sex crime,” according to the Daily Mirror.

He added: “We have had a lot of intolerable offences against women in this country recently, with girls being raped, hung, and molested, and it’s time it stopped.

“This sends out a very strong message to anyone like that - if you do it you will be punished.”

The Daily Mail reports a police spokesperson as saying: “As deplorable as these crimes are, law and order has to be maintained, and not lynch justice.

“We ask those men who carried out this attack to hand themselves in before we find them.”

The Indian government has been accused of not doing enough to protect its citizens, as violent attacks against girls and women become increasingly condemned by the international community.

Meenakshi Ganguly , South Asia Director at Human Rights Watch, wrote in the Hindustan Times in August that “knee-jerk solutions like death penalty for rapists and lowering the age of a juvenile from 18 to 16 will not help end sexual violence against women.”

She added: “Instead of hasty measures, the government should make a commitment to effective law enforcement and the more difficult and lengthy steps needed to reform the criminal justice system.”

Recent incidents include a 15-year-old teenage girl who was gang-raped and murdered in India in September, and a six-year-old girl who was raped at a school in Bangalore in July."

Suresh Kumar was set upon in Ganganagar, in India's northwestern Rajasthan state, after locals heard the girl's screams for help.

After finding the 40-year-old pinning the girl against a wall, a lynch mob dragged him to a butchers shop where they beat him with sticks for an hour before castrating him.

They then dumped the severed remains in the middle of a road and lefta bloodied Kumar nearby.

Aamir Dhawan, 30, said no one 'went to help' Kumar because they knew he had been punished for a 'sex crime'.

Mr Dhawan said: 'We have had a lot of intolerable offences against women in this country recently, with girls being raped, hung, and molested, and it's time it stopped.

'This sends out a very strong message to anyone like that - if you do it you will be punished.'

But the police have called for those responsible to come forward, saying people can't take the law into their 'own hands'.

The spokesman said: 'As deplorable as these crimes are, law and order has to be maintained, and not lynch justice.

'We ask those men who carried out this attack to hand themselves in before we find them.'

Kumar was eventually taken to hospital where doctors described his condition as critical.

The girl involved was treated for shock, and given counselling.

The castration follows a string of violent sex crimes in India that have prompted vigilante justice.

In July, one man was killed and two others were badly hurt after being accused of raping and hanging a seven-year-old girl.

The girl was discovered hanging from a tree near the village of Kaliabazar, West Bengal, and angry villagers quickly rounded up a local 'Tantrik' holy man and his two friends.

An Indian man had his penis cut off with a meat cleaver by a vigilante group, after attempting to rape a teenage girl.

The 40-year-old rapist, Suresh Kumar, was beaten with sticks for about an hour before his genitals was cut off.

The incident occurred in the city of Ganganagar, where Kumar was left bleeding as his penis and testicles lay on the road next to him.

An eyewitness, Aamir Dhawan, who was at the scene, said people were reluctant to help the rapist, after seeing that his private parts had been cut off.

He said, “No one went to help the man because they could see his penis on the ground and knew this was punishment for a sex crime. We have had a lot of intolerable offences against women in this country recently, with girls being raped, hung, and molested, and it’s time it stopped. This sends out a very strong message to anyone like that – if you do it you will be punished.”

The police, has however, urged those responsible for the castration to come forward and submit themselves for prosecution.

A police spokesman said, “People cannot take the law into your own hands. As deplorable as these crimes are, law and order has to be maintained, and not lynch justice.

Xue Paan, 37, reportedly attacked her nephew, Qiang Qiang in a rage, while she babysat him as his mother, her sister, went to visit neighbors nearby.
According to reports, Paan was sitting on the toilet sending text messages to her boyfriend when the bored toddler burst into the bathroom and asked if he could play games on her smart phone.
The question from the youngster apparently sent Paan into such a rage that she went to the kitchen, grabbed a blunt knife and severed the screaming child’s penis completely.
“Unfortunately, the knife was quite blunt and the cut wasn’t clean so although we reattached the boy’s penis, it wasn’t ideal and he had to have further treatment."

She fled the house before his mother could return.

So in desperation he cut off his penis in a bid to stop himself thinking about finding love.

Realising his mistake Yang CYCLED to hospital to get treatment only to be sent home by shocked doctors who told him to retrieve his severed penis so they could attempt to reattach it.

However, when he returned he had lost too much blood and so surgeons were unable to save it.

Yang's friends said that he had been increasingly depressed about the fact that since moving to the city he could not find a girlfriend.

They said that his long hours working in a clothing factory in Jiaxing, in Zhejiang province in east China, meant he he doubted he would ever have a chance to meet a woman."

Last week, President Cristina Kirchner adopted a Jewish teenager named Yair Tawil and posted pictures of the event on her Twitter feed. Outlets around the world ran with the story, explaining the move by citing lingering local superstition about werewolves. In Western folklore, only a werewolf can create another werewolf with its bite, but in Argentina, the story's a little different: the creature is born when a couple gives birth to their seventh son in a row. According to said folklore, seventh sons turn into el lobizon on their 13th birthday if nothing is done about the hereditary curse. Thus, the need for presidential action is pretty clear.

""The notion of animal shifting came from different Native American traditions,"" Oscar Chamosa, a folklorist at the University of Georgia, told me. ""The idea of el lobison comes from uturunco—or the were-jaguar—which mixed with the European notion of the werewolf."" Chamosa says he's not sure how the idea was first associated with teenaged boys.

But even if someone who's devoted his entire life to studying Argentine folklore can't explain it, the teen werewolf thing had become pervasive by the early 20th century, and Catholics in Argentina were producing enough seventh children, that the myth became a public policy problem. After all, terrified parents were (according to legend, at least) regularly committing infanticide.

""In order to counteract the myth, Argentine presidents have traditionally godfathered any child born into the same family,"" Chamosa explains, adding that the governor of a province or mayor of a village would sometimes officiate for practical reasons. ""The rationale is that the godson of a president would be respected throughout his life despite the suspicion his seventh-male birth position would bring with it.""

This idea apparently prevented people from murdering their own babies, so it was a smart move on part of the Argentine government. But if it's surprising people believed in such a curse a century ago, it's downright bizarre that they're still entertaining the notion of it today.

As per a decree that came out in 1973, adoptees receive a gold medal and a college scholarship. And Argentina is apparently still making new rules about werewolf children, because in 1999 the adoption ceremony was extended to non-Catholics. As the Independent noted, Tawil is the first Jewish boy to receive the honor. So while a werewolf Bar Mitzvah might be a joke on 30 Rock, it's also apparently a real thing that just happened in South America.

The boy's parents first applied for the medal and scholarship in 1993, but were denied. They applied again after the rules changed to include Jews in 2009. A tweet from President Kirchner's account shows her lighting a menorah with the Tawils, quite the gesture given that the Jewish population of Argentina is less than half of one percent.

Jewishpublications are making a big deal out of the historic event, and angry commenters are freaking out about a Jew being adopted—even symbolically—by a non-Jew and the blasphemous concept of a Jewish family taking part in something involving werewolves. (In Jewish folklore, people don't turn into werewolves, and whatever they were before beasthood is never really discussed.)

But most observers have been glossing over the absolutely fucking strange juxtaposition between a groundbreaking event and an ancient superstition. Like, for instance, that's it's kind of a weird move to progressively bequeath a privilege to a religious minority while tacitly legitimizing the belief that human beings have the ability to transform into mythical creatures that feast on unbaptized babies.

Stories about the adoption would also have us believe the president of an industrialized nation believes in werewolves, which is clearly not the case. Although presidents in our own country's recent memory believed they were chosen by God, Chamosa describes Argentina's Kirchner as a nominal Catholic who's a ""progressive left-wing president—more like a Marxist and a secular person in general."" Much as our Dear Leader pardons a turkey every year, this is an Argentine ritual that's basically a national inside joke.

Chamosa says that the werewolf thing has stuck around out of quaint tradition and that the average family in the country today has only two children. For that reason, anyone who achieves an unbroken chain of seven same-sex children is rewarded with the prize.

Of course, that doesn't mean there aren't some people in Latin America who still believe in el lobizon.

""Belief in the healing powers of folk saints and withcraft are pretty much shared across the territory, especially—but not only—in rural areas,"" Chamosa says. ""I would say that only old people still believe [in el lobison]. But you really don't know.""

Argentinian President Cristina Fernandez de Kirchner adopted a young boy as her godson so he wouldn't turn into a werewolf and eat babies. Yes, really! (Kind of.)

It's actually part of a long-standing tradition stemming from Argentinian folklore that says the seventh son in families with no girls are doomed to turn into ""el lobison,"" a werewolf who feeds on unbaptized babies and whose bites could turn others into werewolves. Belief in the legend was once reportedly so widespread that families were abandoning their seventh sons, giving them up for adoption, or killing them.

A law was passed in the 1920s to counteract the effect (the law was expanded in 2009 to include girls and non-Catholic children), and now, every year, the president formally adopts a boy or girl as his or her godchild, awarding him or her a medal, ""presidential protection,"" and a scholarship to study until the godchild turns 21.

This year, Fernandez de Kirchner formally adopted Yair Tawil, a member of a Chabad-Lubavitch family, according to the Jewish Telegraphic Agency. In 1993, Yair's parents reportedly wrote to the president asking for the honor and were denied, but this year, Yair wrote to Fernandez de Kirchner himself and got his wish, making him the first Jewish boy in Argentina to be officially adopted by the president.

Fernandez de Kirchner posted a photo of herself with Yair and his family lighting Hanukkah candles together (below) with a menorah, which Fernandez de Kirchner tweeted was a gift from Yair's family.

And now we can move on to a year of weirdness in 2015.

It wasn't government intel that told Kirchner that Yair Tawil was destined to become a werewolf. It was legend. In Argentina, the seventh son of a family is said to become a werewolf after his 13th birthday, destined to hunt, kill, and possibly turn other people into werewolves every full moon. So to stop Tawil from terrorizing Argentina, Kirchner adopted him.

The centuries-old legend caused many problems for seventh sons, who were often killed out of fear that he would turn into what Argentinians refer to as el lobison. When he transformed into el lobison, he would feed on unbaptized babies, excrement, and freshly dead bodies. Not the nighttime activity you want your sons around. As a protection for the children, the president of Argentina would adopt the seventh son of a family as a godson. The tradition was started in 1907 and formalized into law in 1973. The decree has since been expanded to include girls and non-Catholics in the adoptions.

Tawil will be the first Jewish boy adopted under the law. His parents wrote a letter asking the president to adopt their son as a godson in 1993 but were denied. They wrote another letter in 2009 after the law was changed, and Kirchner accepted the proposal. There have been conflicting reports on Tawil's age, but under law he receives a medal and a scholarship until he turns 21. Pretty sweet alternative to becoming a werewolf.

The family met with Kirchner on Dec. 23 and presented her with a menorah. It is unclear who the emancipated werewolf is from the photos Kirchner tweeted.

Yeah, so that is a thing that happened. Cheers to a year of weirdness in 2015, y'all.

But that seventh son myth is not connected to the seventh son adoption tradition:

Related Content Why Is Friday the 13th Supposedly Unlucky?

That custom began in 1907, when Enrique Brost and Apolonia Holmann, Volga German emigrés from south-eastern Russia asked then-president José Figueroa Alcorta to become godfather to their seventh son, said the historian. “The couple wanted to maintain a custom from Czarist Russia, where the Tsar was said to become godfather to seventh sons, and Argentina’s president accepted.”

Christina Fernández de Kirchner, the president of Argentina, got a new addition to her family last week when she adopted a 13-year-old Jewish boy named Yair Tawil as her godson, the Independent reports. Her motivations for doing so are based on a centuries-old legend that seventh sons will transform into werewolves.

In Argentina, the werewolf is referred to as el lobison; in Paraguay it goes by the name Luison, and in Brazil it's called the Lobisomem. The Independent elaborates on the South American legend:

The werewolf-like creature shows its true nature on the first Friday after boy’s 13th birthday, the legend says, turning the boy into a demon at midnight during every full moon, doomed to hunt and kill before returning to human form. As well as feeding on excrement, unbaptized babies, and the flesh of the recently dead, the lobison was said to be unnaturally strong and able to spread its curse with a bite.

In Guaraní mythology, the lobison is the offspring of Tau, an evil spirit, and Kerana, a mortal woman. In the cultures that believe in the lobison, that creature acts as a sort of Grim Reaper, whose mere presence means that death will soon befall those it comes into contact with. As the Independent explains, by the 19th century, fear of this creature was so acute in Argentina that families sometimes murdered their seventh sons to prevent the legend from coming true. So in 1907, in an attempt to stop this practice, the Argentinean president began adopting seventh sons, which the president insisted would stop the curse. In 1973, the Independent adds, the presidential adoption tradition was also extended to seventh daughters.

In addition to being able to say he's the president's godson, Tawil will receive a gold medal and enjoy a full educational scholarship. In modern times, the curse, it seems, is more aptly described as a blessing."

Argentina’s President Christina Fernéndez de Kirchner has a pretty solid plan for keeping her country safe from werewolves: She’s going to adopt them.

There’s apparently an obscure bit of Argentinian folklore that states the seventh son born to a family will turn into the feared el lobison on the first Friday after the boy’s 13th birthday. The myth predicts the child will transform into a creature at midnight during each full moon, eternally damned to ravage the countryside before returning to human form.

Get push notifications with news, features and more.

Other fun bits of el lobison trivia, per The Independent: They feed on excrement, unbaptized babies and the flesh of the recently dead; they’re unnaturally strong; and they can spread their curse by biting.

The fear of el lobison‘s curse was so strong in Argentina that families abandoned – or in some cases murdered – their seventh son in the 19th century, which is how the tradition of the sitting president adopting one of these children came to pass in 1907. It was formally decreed in 1973 by then-president Juan Domingo Perén, and extended to baby girls at that time. Those adopted gain the sitting president as their official godparent, a gold medal and a full educational scholarship.

This year, Kirchner adopted the first Jewish seventh son, Yair Tawil. The practice had extended only to Catholic children until 2009. Kirchner met with Yair and his parents, Shlomo and Nehama, on Dec. 23. She called the family “marvelous,” described Yair as “a total sweetie,” and bestowed the presidential nickname of “Queen Esther” on Nehama. (Shlomo and Nehama had sent in their request back in 1993.)

Christina Fernandez de Kirchner met Yair Tawil and his family last week at her office to mark the 100-year-old Argentine custom.

According to legend the seventh son born to a family turns into a ferocious ""el lobison"" or werewolf – on the first Friday after his 13<sup>th birthday.

The country began to introduce adoption procedures to quell the fear of the people in the 19th century who believed their sons could turn into werewolfs (the fear was so extreme in some cases people murdered their baby boys).

It has become customary since 1907 but formally established in 1973 for the president to adopt their seventh sons and daughters who also receive a gold medal and full educational scholarship.

Tawil's parents wrote to the president in 1993 for their son to be the first Jewish boy to be adopted and they got their wish this year, according to the Jewish Telegraphic Agency.



Until 2009, the tradition only applied to Catholic children.

Last week's unusual ceremony between the president and Tawil, witnessed by his parents and three brothers, happened at the same time as Hanukkah - the eight-day Jewish festival that commemorates the rededication of the holy Temple in Jerusalem in 165 BC.

Fernandez de Kirchner tweeted: ""I didn't know it but his visit coincided with the Hanukkah celebration. The father said it wasn't a coincidence.""

She added the meeting with him and his family was a ""magical moment""."

President Christina Fernandez described in seven tweets her meeting with her new godson, Yair Tawil, a member of a Chabad-Lubavitch family.

He was adopted as a godson under a law passed in the 1920s. The law was passed in order to counteract a legend that led to the death of Argentine boys. According to the legend, the seventh son, born after six boys without any girls in-between, becomes a werewolf whose bite can turn others into a werewolf.

The belief in the legend was so widespread that families were abandoning, giving up for adoption and even killing their own sons.

The law only applied to the biological children of Catholic families until the enacting of a presidential decree in 2009, which allows children from other religions to qualify.

The boys receive presidential protection, a gold medal and a scholarship for all studies until his 21st birthday.

Shlomo and Nehama Tawil, parents of seven boys, in 1993 wrote a letter to the president asking for the honor and were denied. But this year Yair wrote a letter to the president citing the 2009 decree, and asking for the designation of godson.

Yair Tawil on Tuesday became the first Jewish godson of a president in Argentina’s history. Fernandez received the Yair, his parents and three of his brothers in her office, where they lit Hanukkah candles together on a Hanukkah menorah from Israel presented to the president by the Tawil family.

The president in her tweets and photos described to her 3.4 million Twitter followers the “magical moment” with a “marvelous family.” She described Yair as “a total sweety,” and his mother a “Queen Esther.”

She tweeted that the Tawils “are a very special family. They have a sort of peace, happiness and a lot of love that is not common.” The tweet included a link to the presidential blog, which includes more photos from the meeting.

This is actually a thing that happened.

According to The Independent, Argentina's president, President Christina Fernández de Kirchner adopted a boy named Yair Tawil as her godson so that he would not turn into a werewolf. It's actually part of a longstanding tradition in the country that dates back to a folk story in the country:

According to Argentinian folklore, the seventh son born to a family turns into the feared ""el lobison"". The werewolf-like creature shows its true nature on the first Friday after boy's 13th birthday, the legend says, turning the boy into a demon at midnight during every full moon, doomed to hunt and kill before returning to human form. As well as feeding on excrement, unbaptized babies, and the flesh of the recently dead, the lobison was said to be unnaturally strong and able to spread its curse with a bite.

Because some people actually believed this hundreds of years ago, they started killing babies. So, to stop that from happening, presidents starting adopting the seventh born boys of families. The practice was later extended to include girls, too. Now, seventh born children not only get the country's president as their new godparent, they also get a gold medal and a scholarship.

According to The Jewish Telegraphic Agency, Tawil is also the first Jewish boy to participate in the adoption tradition:

Shlomo and Nehama Tawil, parents of seven boys, in 1993 wrote a letter to the president asking for the honor and were denied. But this year, Yair wrote a letter to the president citing the 2009 decree and asking for the designation of godson. On Tuesday, he became the first Jewish godson of a president in Argentina's history. Fernandez received Yair, his parents and three of his brothers in her office, where they lit Hanukkah candles together. The president in her tweets and photos described to her 3.4 million Twitter followers a ""magical moment"" with a ""marvelous family."" She described Yair as ""a total sweety,"" and his mother a ""Queen Esther."""

The President of Argentina, Cristina Fernandez de Kirchner, has adopted a Jewish godson – to prevent him from becoming a werewolf.

Although this sounds like something straight out of a fantasy novel, the President last week met Yair Tawil and his family for the unusual ceremony, which dates back more than 100 years and is based on Argentinian folklore.

According to the legend, the seventh son of a family will transform into ‘El Lobison’, a werewolf like creature, on the first Friday after the boy’s 13th Birthday, and will continue to turn into a blood-thirsty, baby eating werewolf every full moon.

The fear of the creature was so fervent in 19th century Argentina that many families murdered or abandoned their seventh born son, forcing the Argentinian government to implement the process of Presidential adoption.

The tradition was established in 1907, and was extended to baby girls in 1973.

Although having seven children is now much rarer than 100 years ago, seventh sons or daughters can now expect to gain the President as their official godparent, as well as a gold medal and educational scholarship.

The President has said that Yair is the first Jewish boy to take part in the ceremony, as the tradition was exclusive to Catholic children until 2009."

According to Argentine historian Daniel Balmaceda, there is no link between the two traditions. ""The local myth of the lobizón is not in any way connected to the custom that began over 100 years ago by which every seventh son (or seventh daughter) born in Argentina becomes godchild to the president,"" he said.

The legend seems ridiculous, but the Independent reports that fear of the creature was so widespread in 19th century Argentina that some families even murdered their babies. Fear and panic gave rise to the unusual practice of adoption by Argentina's president in 1907, which is meant to quell the deadly stigma ad demystify the folklore that was causing the abuse of children. Now a time-honored tradition, any family with seven sons or daughters today gets the president as their official godparent, a gold medal and a full educational scholarship.

The boy's parents, Shlomo and Nehama Tawil, had written the president's office requesting the adoption in 1993, the Jewish Telegraphic Agency reported. President Kirchner reportedly described the adoption as a ""magical moment,"" calling the Tawils a ""marvelous family.""

Yair Tawil, 21, was born in the Argentine city of Rosario, the seventh son of Shlomo and Nehama Tawil.

Under Argentine legend, any seventh consecutive son will grow up to become a werewolf. Any seventh daughter will become a witch.

The belief in the myth was so strong that, centuries ago, the seventh child was often put to death.

According to some reports, Jose Figeroa Alcorta, then-president of Argentina, became the godfather of José Brost, the seventh son of a Enrique Brost and Apolonia Holmann who had emigrated from Russia, in 1907 in a bid to counter the myth.

However, Argentine historian Daniel Balmaceda told the Guardian there is no link between the two traditions. “The local myth of the lobizón [werewolf] is not in any way connected to the custom that began over 100 years ago by which every seventh son (or seventh daughter) born in Argentina becomes godchild to the president,” he said.

Regardless of its origin, the tradition of Argentine presidents adopting the seventh son born to any couple does exist, and was formalised in 1973 by President Juan Domingo Perón, and a year later the ruling was enshrined in law.

Those affected by law 20.843 – ""The Law of Presidential Godfathership"", were entitled to presidential protection, a gold medal and a scholarship for all studies until the 21st birthday.

But the ruling only applied to Catholic families, and so in 1993 Mr and Mrs Tawil wrote to the president asking for the honour to be extended to their son, Yair.

The request was denied. But in 2009 the law was changed to apply to all – regardless of their religion.

And just before Christmas, Mrs Kirchner met with Yair, who became the first Jewish godson of a president in Argentina's history.

The president in her tweets and photos described to her 3.4 million Twitter followers a ""magical moment"" with a ""marvellous family."" She described Yair as ""a total sweety,"" and his mother a ""Queen Esther.""

She tweeted that the Tawils ""are a very special family. They have a sort of peace, happiness and a lot of love that is not common.""

Mrs Kirchner adopted her first ""godson"" in 2008. In 2012 she adopted another, Natanael Eric, who was also born in Rosario, and last year three more boys – all of them born in the northern province of Santa Fe.

The Argentine president had been due to usher in the New Year with a visit to the Vatican, to see her compatriot Pope Francis.

But a fall on Boxing Day, when she slipped on a wet floor in her home, caused her to fracture her ankle.

On Monday it was announced that she had cancelled the trip and suspended official events for the beginning of next month."

President Christina Fernandez described in seven tweets her meeting with her new godson, Yair Tawil, a member of a Chabad-Lubavitch family.

He was adopted as a godson under a law passed in the 1920s. The law was passed in order to counteract a legend that led to the death of Argentine boys. According to the legend, the seventh son, born after six boys without any girls in-between, becomes a werewolf whose bite can turn others into a werewolf.

The belief in the legend was so widespread that families were abandoning, giving up for adoption and even killing their own sons.

The law only applied to the biological children of Catholic families until the enacting of a presidential decree in 2009, which allows children from other religions to qualify.

The boys receive presidential protection, a gold medal and a scholarship for all studies until his 21st birthday.

Shlomo and Nehama Tawil, parents of seven boys, in 1993 wrote a letter to the president asking for the honor and were denied. But this year Yair wrote a letter to the president citing the 2009 decree, and asking for the designation of godson.

President Christina Fernández de Kirchner met Yair Tawil and his family at her office last week to mark the unusual ceremony, which dates back more than 100 years.

According to Argentinian folklore, the seventh son born to a family turns into the feared “el lobison”.

The werewolf-like creature shows its true nature on the first Friday after boy’s 13th birthday, the legend says, turning the boy into a demon at midnight during every full moon, doomed to hunt and kill before returning to human form.

As well as feeding on excrement, unbaptized babies, and the flesh of the recently dead, the lobison was said to be unnaturally strong and able to spread its curse with a bite.

Fear of the lobison was so rife in 19th Century Argentina that some families abandoned or even murdered baby boys – an atrocity that sparked the unusual Presidential practice of adoption, aimed at stopping the deadly stigma.

Starting in 1907, the tradition was formally established by a decree in 1973 by Juan Domingo Peron, which also extended the practice to baby girls.

Seventh sons or daughters – now much rarer than 100 years ago – gain the President as their official godparent as well as a gold medal and full educational scholarship.

Even now, reports of dog-like creatures attacking livestock continue, as does the tradition.

Ms Fernandez said Yair is the first Jewish boy to be adopted, as the tradition only applied to Catholic children until 2009.

She described her meeting with him and his family on 23 December as a “magical moment”.

Calling the Tawils a “marvellous family” she described Yair as “a total sweety” and dubbed his mother “Queen Esther.”

Shlomo and Nehama Tawil, parents of seven boys, had written the President a letter in 1993 and got their wish this year, the Jewish Telegraphic Agency reported, attending the ceremony with their son and three of his brothers.

Pictures showed them lighting Hanukkah candles together on a menorah from Israel presented to the president by the Tawil family.

Update: An Argentine historian has since told the Guardian that the local lobison myth and the tradition of the seventh child becoming the President's godchild are not related. However, in Portuguese folklore the last-born of a series of seven or nine siblings is in danger of becoming a werewolf or a witch."

President Christina Fernandez described in seven tweets her meeting with her new godson, Yair Tawil, a member of a Chabad-Lubavitch family.

The adoption practice derives from an old custom by which the president adopts the seventh son born after six boys with no girls in between to prevent him from becoming a werewolf. Belief in the legend was once so widespread that families were abandoning, giving up for adoption and even killing their own sons.

The custom became a law in the 1970s and provided the boys with presidential protection, a gold medal and a scholarship for all studies until their 21st birthday. Until 2009, the law only applied to Catholic boys.

Shlomo and Nehama Tawil, parents of seven boys, in 1993 wrote a letter to the president asking for the honor and were denied. But this year, Yair wrote a letter to the president citing the 2009 decree and asking for the designation of godson.

On Tuesday, he became the first Jewish godson of a president in Argentina’s history. Fernandez received Yair, his parents and three of his brothers in her office, where they lit Hanukkah candles together.

The president in her tweets and photos described to her 3.4 million Twitter followers a “magical moment” with a “marvelous family.” She described Yair as “a total sweety,” and his mother a “Queen Esther.”

She tweeted that the Tawils “are a very special family. They have a sort of peace, happiness and a lot of love that is not common.” The tweet included a link to the presidential blog, which includes more photos from the meeting.

CORRECTION: The original brief stated incorrectly that Shlomo Tawil was the director of the Chabad House in Rosario, located in central Argentina. The sentence has been deleted. The original brief also stated incorrectly that the original law was adopted in the 1920s. It was actually adopted in the 1970s."

Strange natural occurrences are happening in the world today. But nothing more magnificent than the one you will experience on January 4, 2015.

According to British astronomer Patrick Moore, at exactly 9:47 PST AM on January 4th, Pluto will pass directly behind Jupiter, in relation to Earth. This rare alignment will mean that the combined gravitational force of the two planets would exert a stronger tidal pull, temporarily counteracting the Earth’s own gravity and making people virtually weightless. Moore calls this the Jovian-Plutonian Gravitational Effect.

Moore told scientists that they could experience the phenomenon by jumping in the air at the precise moment the alignment occurred. If they do so, he promised, they would experience a strange floating sensation.

Astronomers have long been aware that there would be an alignment of the planets on that date, when Mercury, Venus, Earth, Mars, Jupiter, Saturn, Uranus, Neptune and Pluto would be on the same side of the sun, within an arc 95° wide. But now they are guaranteeing the occurrence as the gravitational effect of the other planets on the Earth’s crust is maximum even at their closest approach.

But don’t get too excited. If you think you’ll be able to float around your house, you’re wrong. But, if you jump in the air at 9:47 AM PST, on January 4, 2015, it should take you about 3 seconds to land back on your feet instead of the usual 0.2 seconds.

So, mark this date on your calendar and share it with your friends! Zero gravity day is just around the corner!

Joe Riquelme surprised his parents for Christmas by giving them envelope with bank

There are Christmas miracles after all.

For Joe Riquelme's parents, the miracle came in the form of a plain white envelope containing a handwritten note from their son telling them he had paid off their mortgage.

Riquelme, a successful app developer from New York who goes by the YouTube user name joeytrombone, on Thursday shared a video showing his parents’ heartwarming reaction to his incredibly generous Christmas gift.

One final gift: Joe Riquelme, an app developer from New York (center) surprised his parents this Christmas by giving them a life-changing present

Priceless reaction: Riquelme's mother was shocked to find a note written by her son inside a plain envelope telling her he had paid off their mortgage

Best gift ever? Riquelme placed bank documents inside the folded envelope along with his brief note

Tears of joy: The app developer's parents burst into tears in reaction to their son's generosity

The touching video, which has been viewed nearly 130,000 times in the last 24 hours, and counting, begins with Joe Riquelme sitting on a couch with his parents and their pet dog.

Looking visibly nervous and struggling to keep his emotions in check, Riquelme tells his mom and dad that he has one more Christmas gift for them: a slightly dog-eared envelope folded in half.

Inside, there are documents from Bank of America accompanied by a handwritten note that reads: 'Your house is paid off. Merry Xmas. - Joe.'

In the corner, Riquelme drew a box with a list of three things his parents had done for their family with check marks next to each one: raising kids, college loans, mortgage.

Confronted with the note, Riguelme's mother covers her mouth in shock and bursts into tears of joy mingled with laughter as her son labors to keep his composure.

The overwhelmed woman then passes the envelope to her husband, who also begins to weep.

‘I love you. Thank you, Papi,' Riquelme's mom exclaims through sobs while showering him with hugs and kisses.

Group hug: The emotional video concludes with Riquelme's mom and dad embracing him and showering the young man with kisses

'Sometimes the best gifts come in the lamest packages. Merry Christmas everyone! — feeling happy,' Riguelme later wrote on Facebook along with this collage from the video

The emotional minute-long video concludes with a group hug.

'Sometimes the best gifts come in the lamest packages. Merry Christmas everyone! — feeling happy,' Riguelme later wrote on his Facebook page.

BILD ERFUHR: ALLE MÄDCHEN HABEN ABGETRIEBEN.

Ihre Familien würden in einer kleinen Ortschaft in der Provinz von Bosnien und Herzegowina leben, erklärt der Professor, der den Fall öffentlich machte.

Nenad Babić, Gynäkologe und nationaler Gesundheitskoordinator des Landesteils Republika Srpska (Serbische Republik), zu BILD: „Können Sie sich vorstellen, wie sich die Eltern fühlten, als sie mitbekamen, dass ihre Töchter schwanger waren? In einem kleinen Dorf ist das eine furchtbare Situation. Die Schülerinnen sind dort weiter zur Schule gegangen. Die Familien sind gebrandmarkt.“

Aus Rücksicht habe er deshalb abgewartet, bevor er die Geschichte publik machte.

Babić: „Die Schwangerschaften der Schülerinnen liegen mittlerweile anderthalb Jahre zurück. Die Abtreibungen waren nötig, um die Mädchen und ihre Gesundheit zu schützen.“

Die Identität der Schülerinnen will Babić nicht preisgeben. Er beteuert: „Die Sache ist nicht ausgedacht. Ich wusste, die Welt würde reagieren, wenn sie die Nachricht hört. Ich habe über sie berichtet, um über die mangelnde sexuelle Aufklärung von Minderjährigen aufmerksam zu machen. Diese Kinder waren einfach nicht richtig informiert. Weder von den Eltern noch von der Schule.“

Wie geht es den sieben Mädchen jetzt?

Babić: „Vom Schwangerschaftsabbruch und dem Schock haben sich alle gut erholt.“ Die Mädchen bekämen Hilfe, wieder ins normale Leben zurückzufinden.

Der Fall Die jüngste ist 13 7 Schülerinnen nach Klassenfahrt schwanger Eine Klassenfahrt in Bosnien erwies sich als fruchtbare Exkursion: Sieben Schülerinnen wurden während der Fahrt schwanger.

Mangelnde Aufklärung und die Folgen – in Bosnien und Herzegowina ist das ein wichtiges Thema.

Allein in Sarajevo, Hauptstadt von Bosnien und Herzegowina, wurden im vorigen Jahr 31 Schwangerschaften bei minderjährigen Mädchen registriert. Bei einer Einwohnerzahl von nicht einmal 300 000 Menschen.



Laut der Tageszeitung „Dnevni avaz“ ist die Zahl der sexuell aktiven minderjährigen Mädchen in den vergangenen Jahren erheblich gestiegen. Das größte Problem: 43 Prozent würden dabei nicht verhüten!

Senad Mehmedbašić, Frauenarzt aus Sarajevo: „Es ist schon besorgniserregend, dass Mädchen mit 13 Jahren Sex haben, aber das ist der Trend der heutigen Zeit. Wir dürfen aber nicht weiterhin zulassen, dass unsere Kinder über Sex auf der Straße und nicht in der Schule aufgeklärt werden.“

The schoolgirls, from the city of Banja Luka, went to the Bosnia and Herzegovina capital, Sarajevo.

Nenad Babici, the National Coordinator for Reproductive Health of the Republika, told Inserbia.info that it was discovered that the seven schoolgirls fell pregnant on the school trip.

The school in Banja Luka had taken 28 girls to the nation’s capital city for a five-day trip to visit museums and historic sights in the city, ranked among the finest in the world.

Furious parents are demanding to know why there was such a lack of teacher supervision, reported the Daily Mail.

However, Babici blamed parents for not educating their children properly.

He said that early engagement in sexual relations later lead to adverse consequences such as infertility, various diseases, miscarriages and premature births.

Senad Mehmedbasic, a Sarajevo gynaecologist, said a growing trend of underage pregnancies in Bosnia and Herzegovina is worrying.

“That is the trend of today. But we cannot continue to allow our children to be educated about sex on the street and not in school,” he told Inserbia.info.

Educational institutes and parents should, he said, play a stronger role in providing effective sex education.

“It is obvious that children do not have enough knowledge of health education so they engage in such activities, not knowing the consequences.

“We have to be more direct in the educational system, it must not be allowed that street teaches children about intimate matters, and that they are later slapped by life.”

However, the parents of seven different girls are reportedly outraged over the outcome of a recent school trip because all of their daughters came home pregnant! According to The Daily Mail, 28 girls attending a Bosnian school were taken on a five-day school trip from the town of Banja Luka to Bosnia’s capital city, Saravejo. Out of the 28 girls, seven reportedly came home pregnant.

The students were supposed to be touring museums, but apparently, much more went on. Shortly after the trip, the seven girls, who range from ages 13 to 15, all turned up pregnant at the same time and that’s when it was discovered that they all conceived on the trip.

Needless to say, the parents are outraged. As a matter of fact, many of the parents are blaming school administrators and chaperones for lack of supervision on the five-day excursion. However, a Bosnian gynecologist feels otherwise, arguing that parents and school officials are equally responsible due to the lack of sexual education children in the receive. InSerbia News heard from Nenad Babici, National Coordinator for the Reproductive Health of the Republika Srpska, on the matter.

“That is the trend of today. But we cannot continue to allow our children to be educated about sex on the street and not in school. It is obvious that children do not have enough of health education so they engage in such activities, not knowing the consequences. We have to be more direct in the educational system, it must not be allowed that street teaches children about intimate matters, and that they are later slapped by life.”

The shocking report has captured the attention of thousands around the world. The issue has also sparked controversy, as many Internet surfers have expressed different views about who should be held accountable for the girls’ actions.

The school is based in the Bosnian town of Banja Luka, and took 28 teenage girls on an educational visit to the city with intentions to visit museums and places of historical significance.

But it seems the unsupervised girls got up to a lot more than that while they were staying away from home. The case has triggered serious discussion about the state of Bosnia's sex education, with the number of 13-15-year-old girls having underage sex having seen a dramatic spike in recent times.

A Sarajevo-based gynaecologist, Senad Mehmedbasic, commented on how concerning the increase in underage pregnancies is. ""That is the trend of today,"" he said. ""But we can not continue to allow our children to be educated about sex on the street and not in school.""

And continuing his point that education is the key to reducing the number of girls having underage sex, he said:

""It is obvious that children do not have enough knowledge of health education so they engage in such activities, not knowing the consequences. We have to be more direct in the educational system, it must not be allowed that street teaches children about intimate matters, and that they are later slapped by life.""

The parents of the girls are now understandably furious that such lack of care was taken to keep an eye on their children's activities. But the National Coordinator for Reproductive Health of the Republika Srpska, Nenad Babici, believes the blame shouldn't lie with the teachers on the trip, but the ""parental neglect"" that caused the lack of reproductive understanding in the young girls.

We're sure there is some truth in what he says - that it is the duty of parents as well as schools to inform their children of the dangers of unprotected sex both at such a young age, and throughout their adult lives. But for 7 out of 28 pupils - that's a staggering 25% of girls who attended the trip - to have become pregnant is surely primarily down to the neglect of teachers, who should have made it their duty to keep an eye on the girls for the duration?"

The schoolgirls, from the city of Banja Luka, returned to Bosnia after having fallen pregnant, the Herald Sun reported. Now, furious parents are demanding to know why there was such a lack of teacher supervision on the five-day trip.

But instead of taking responsibility, the school has placed the blame on the girls' parents, claiming they are responsible for not having properly educated their children on the subject.

The school had taken 28 girls to Sarajevo on an educational outing recently to visit museums and other historical sites, ranked among the finest in the world, Nenad Babici, the National Coordinator for Reproductive Health of the Republika, told Inserbia.info.

Since sexually active girls between 13 and 15 have increased significantly in recent years, the case has sparked nationwide discussions about sex education in Bosnia.

According to the InSerba News Network, young girls in Bosnia are allegedly seeking advice from experts online. ""I would have sex with my boyfriend, even though I'm only 14... But I am afraid I'll be judged,"" one girl wrote online.

Since returning from the trip, all seven girls have reportedly dropped out of their classes, UK MailOnline reported.

The school in Banja Luka had taken 28 girls to the nation’s capital city for a five-day trip to visit museums and historic sights in the city, ranked among the finest in the world.
But we cannot continue to allow our children to be educated about sex on the street and not in school,” he told Inserbia.info."

A shocking case has been reported in the Bosnian press, claiming that seven primary school children from a small town, returned home pregnant after a five-day field trip.

The case has provoked nationwide discussions about sex education in Bosnia where the number of sexually active girls aged between 13 and 15 has increased significantly.

Senad Mehmedbasic, a gynaecologist from Sarajevo said that the growing trend for underage pregnancies is worrying.

""It is worrying that girl 13 years old to have sex, but that is the trend of today. But we can not continue to allow our children to be educated about sex on the street and not in school.""

He added that educational institutes and parents should play a stronger role in providing effective sex education

Illustration National Coordinator for Reproductive Health of the Republika Srpska Nenad Babici said that children engage in sexual relations as early as at age of 13 or 14 and added that primary school students from a small town in Bosnia and Herzegovina went to a five-day trip, and after some time it turned out that seven schoolgirls got pregnant on it. He said that the reason for this was the neglect of parents, but also educational institutions, toward the education of children.

Babic said that early engagement in sexual relations later leads to a series of consequences such as infertility, various diseases, miscarriages, and premature births. “In the Republika Srpska between 15 to 18 percent of people are struggling with infertility, we have 15 percent of miscarriages and between 5 to 10 percent premature births,” he said. Only last year, according to the Clinical Center of the University in Sarajevo, 31 minors gave birth, four of them are 15 years old, ten are 16 years old and 17 are 17 years old. The problem of the adolescent in Bosnia and Herzegovina is becoming more prominent, but information on the increasing number of sexually active girls aged between 13 and 15 years of age is also shocking. Thus, on a website where girls seek advice from experts, gynecologists, peers, one of them wrote:” I would have sex with my boyfriend, even though I’m only 14… But I am afraid I’ll be judged.”

The page also contains information according to which boys engage in sexual relations at age of 11, writes “Dnevni Avaz”. Sarajevo gynecologist Senad Mehmedbasic says that it is terrible that girls aged 13 or 16 engage in sexual relations, but adds that this is something that, unfortunately, is in the trend. He warns that in these cases both pregnancy and childbirth are highly risky. “It is obvious that children do not have enough of health education so they engage in such activities, not knowing the consequences.

UTAH COUNTY — Over the years, holiday office Christmas parties have gained a reputation for crazy antics. Often, there's a lot of heavy drinking. One overly zealous drinker in Utah County nearly killed himself a couple of weeks ago, winding up in the hospital for three days.

Even though the drinks at the party contained no alcohol, a heavy drink nearly put Ryan Roche out of commission for the holidays.

""I think it was one of those spur of the moment kind of things,"" Roche said.

As his holiday office party wound down earlier this month, Roche headed for the door with his wife and kids.

""They busted out some eggnog.""

An eggnog-chugging contest was getting started, and one of Roche's colleagues called him out to compete. Roche said he's a competitive guy and couldn't walk away.

""I've already decided, if I'm going to do it, I'm going to win,"" he said.

The record at that point was 22 seconds. There was a Ruth's Chris Steak House gift card on the line, so Roche faced off against two other co-workers.

""I just opened up my throat, didn't even swallow,"" he said. ""I pretty much poured it down.""

I was pretty much shaking uncontrollably. I was shaking so badly, I was nauseous, and my breathing became a pant. –Ryan Roche

As the video shows, he drank a quart of eggnog in just 12 seconds, without taking a breath.

""I got done, and I was gasping, I couldn't breathe.""

Roche said he was coughing a lot as he headed home, but thought he would be OK. A couple of hours later, he wasn't so sure.

""I was pretty much shaking uncontrollably,"" he said. ""I was shaking so badly, I was nauseous, and my breathing became a pant.""

He asked a friend in medical school to come over to his house and check on him. The friend took him to the hospital.

Roche had aspirated the eggnog to his lungs and was essentially ""dry drowning,"" the doctors told him.

""They pretty much had to wheelchair me in, double IV, oxygen, and hooked me up to what they call the nuclear weapon of antibiotics,"" he said.

The liquid in his lungs was starting an infection. He spent 24 hours in intensive care with a fever, sweats and chills.

""It was rough,"" he said. ""Eggnog: not ideal for the lungs.""

On day three in the hospital, doctors took him off oxygen, and he went home. After about a week, he was back at full strength.

It was a holiday mishap he'll never forget, and also probably never live down. Roche did win, but at quite a price.

""Not only do I get a Ruth's Chris gift card, but I got a three night's stay in the hospital.""

 -- A Utah man was rushed to the hospital after he chugged a quart of eggnog in 12 seconds during a contest at an office holiday party, he said.

""Everyone knows I'm pretty competitive,"" Ryan Roche of Lehi, Utah, told ABC News today, explaining how his colleagues talked him into participating just as he was leaving the party with his family earlier this month.

""I just decided I was going to win. So I pretty much just opened it up and poured it down my throat,"" he said.

Roche, 33, said he shaved 10 seconds off the previous best time of 22 seconds that day, earning him bragging rights and a $50 gift certificate to Ruth's Chris Steak House. But the glory was short-lived: Later, at home, he started to feel sick.

""Two hours later I was laying on the couch, shaking uncontrollably, nauseous, having fevers and panting,"" said Roche, who works in sales.

His friend took him to the hospital while his wife stayed home with their three children.

In Roche's case, the eggnog may have literally gone down the wrong pipe, Dr. Robert Schilz of University Hospitals in Cleveland explained. The eggnog, which was booze-free, may have crept into Roche's windpipe, triggering pneumonia.

Roche spent a full day in the ICU and two more days recovering at the hospital.

""It was not fun,"" Roche said. ""It took me a full week of recovery to be 100 percent.""

Nearly two weeks later, he says the jokes won't stop at work.

""People are emailing me pictures of eggnog ... it never gets old,"" he said. ""I'm pretty competitive but, unfortunately, in this situation it got the best of me. But it's become quite the story."""

BUTTE, Montana –

Robert O’Neill, the former United States Navy SEAL who shot and killed Osama Bin Laden, had his home mistakenly invaded by members of a street gang this morning shortly after 1AM. O’Neill was uninjured, the five intruders all suffered injuries and remain hospitalized, but are expected to make a full recovery. Their names were not released in anticipation of the oncoming media storm.

Butte Police Commissioner Bartholomew S. Harrington told members of the Associated Press in a brief press conference that the five men, part of a local street gang connected with the infamous Crips, were seeking to collect on a drug debt and invaded the wrong house, with the intended target just so happening to be the next door neighbor of O’Neill’s.

“Mr. O’Neill had just turned in for the night, but was awoken by a loud crash when his backdoor was abruptly kicked in. As the five thugs ran aimlessly through the home, Mr. O’Neill used silent hand-to-hand combat tactics to individually disarm them of their weapons. Once Mr. O’Neill had taken down the five men and secured his home, he brewed a pot of coffee and called the police station. Those boys sure did find the wrong house!” commissioner Harrington said as he chuckled.

O’Neill had little to say on the matter when Butte Daily Times journalist Kevin Williamson interviewed the celebrated war hero.

“It was nothing really. Those kids didn’t have their mission planned out properly and hit the wrong target. I hated to break their wrists and dislocate each of their knees like I did, but it was necessary in order to immobilize the invasion. I hope they get the money that is owed to them once they get out of jail and decide to live better lives. My main concern is getting my back door fixed. Those boys really did a number on the door jamb,” O’Neill stated.

The neighbor who was the intended target seems to have abandoned home and has not been found by police. According to the men in custody, the debt was over a $50 bag of marijuana.

One of Mark Oberholtzer's old work trucks appeared in a photo tweeted by a Syrian rebel group, prompting an influx of threatening phone calls to the plumber.

His truck, with its original decal for ""Mark 1 Plumbing"" and a phone number for the business, is reportedly being used by the militant group to transport an anti-aircraft gun.

The original tweet, below, was posted to an account associated with the Jabhat Ansar al-Din militant group based in Syria. Oberholtzer traded in his truck to a Texas dealership that then placed it up for auction in 2013.

Other images of the truck have also popped up on the Twitter account, including this one showing the mud-covered vehicle from October:

""We had no intentions or no idea this would even happen,"" Oberholtzer said in the video by local television station KHOU. ""Something that we would use to pull trailers and things like that, I mean, to now a truck to be used in terror, I mean that's crazy.""

In an interview with KHOU, Oberholtzer said he's had to take his phones off the hook due to angry and threatening calls from across the United States.

His phone number appears on the bottom of the truck, while the the full company logo and name remains on the side.

It is unclear how the car ended up thousands of miles away in the Aleppo province of Syria. Jabhat Ansar al-Din is an alliance of smaller militant factions established in July 2014 that functions in the hotly contested Aleppo area.

According to the Terrorism Research and Analysis Consortium, the group is made up of the Green Brigade, Jaish al-Muhajrin, Sham al-Islam and Harakat Fajr al-Sham, which includes both local and foreign fighters."

“We had no intentions or no idea that this would even happen. To think something we would use to pull trailers now is being used for terror, it’s crazy.

Never in my lifetime would I think something like that.”

While some viewers speculated the photograph had been doctored, Jeff Oberholtzer of the Mark-1 plumbing company in Texas City confirmed it was indeed his company’s truck seen in the picture:

The truck can also be found in other photos:

The export market for used U.S. vehicles reaches across the globe. The cars and trucks we think of as old and busted hold immense value in other parts of

the world, and auction transactions happen fast. The truck likely passed through numerous hands and ended up on a dealer’s lot in Syria.

The plumbing company put the truck up for auction in November 2013. It’s unclear how many people owned the truckafter it was purchased from the AutoNation Ford Dealership in Houston and who ultimately sold it to the rebel group in Syria:

Oberholtzer said that shortly after the photo went viral, he started receiving phone calls accusing his company of supporting terrorist groups. Regardless of

how this truck ended up in Syria, Oberholtzer said he has learned a valuable lesson and will be removing the company’s logo before selling any more trucks:

We have a secretary here, she’s scared to death. We all have families. We don’t want no problems. We have nothing to do with terror at all.

In December 2015, Mark Oberholtzer (Jeff Oberholtzer’s father and also part owner of the company) filed a lawsuit in Texas state court against

AutoNation Ford Gulf Freeway for $1 million for neglecting to peel off his company’s decals before selling the truck he had traded in. The lawsuit contended

that he and his employees had received continual abuse and harassment – including death threats – by phone, email, and social media since the photos of the truck first showed up on Twitter."

This week, Mark Oberholtzer is among those trying to piece together the story. An Islamic extremist group in Syria was photographed opening fire off of the back of that very same F-250 truck — the company’s name and phone number printed on the side — and that image is now circulating around the Internet.

A representative of Mr. Oberholtzer’s company, Mark-1 Plumbing Company, tells CBS News that the company lost track of the truck after selling it to an AutoNation dealership in Houston last year.

Were members of the Ansar al-Deen Front – or their reps – operating in Texas buying used trucks? Or was there a more indirect path?

Some observers have speculated that it must have taken many, many trades to get from the American South to the Middle East.

But Andrew Collins, who oversees Jalopnik.com’s “Truck Yeah!” vertical, says the path from Texas to Syria may be shorter than some may think.

“If he traded it in, he would have no idea where it’s going,” Mr. Collins says. “The highest bidder takes it, and they can do whatever they want.”

The truck could have been put on a cargo ship bound for a Middle East car dealer within days.

Car auctions, held several times each week, attract both used car dealers and exporters, he says.

Exporters comprise a small minority of auction attendees and purchase cars that, generally, are in worse condition than the ones that American used car dealers buy, Collins says, who has also written about the auto industry for The Christian Science Monitor.

Exporters then ship the cars overseas, where they are fixed up and resold.

“The next person to buy it could have been the exporter who sold it to the militants,” says Collins, who himself bid in auto auctions for a car dealership for about a year. “I don’t know if ISIS has representatives in the car buying world — I don’t know anything about them. But [exporters] could have shipped it to Syria and sold it to the people who mounted weapons on it. It still would have been a few steps removed from the original seller, but I don’t think it had to be that complex.”

An AutoNation manager would not comment on the vehicle’s sale history to CBS News.

Oberholtzer tells the Galveston County Daily News that he received a thousand calls and faxes between Monday afternoon and Tuesday evening about the photo of his pickup truck.

“A few of the people are really ugly,” he told the Galveston Daily News. “People think you are aiding and abetting terrorists. We have a secretary here, she’s scared to death. We all have families. We don’t want no problems.”

“I just want it to go away, to tell you the truth,” he said.

Oberholtzer has run the company for 32 years and said he took the truck to an AutoNation dealership three years ago. He believed that the company would remove the decal from the vehicle before sale.

“They were supposed to have done it and it looks like they didn’t do it,” Oberholtzer told the Galveston Daily News. “How it ended up in Syria, I’ll never know.”

Oberholtzer told CBS News that he had hired a lawyer to make Twitter remove the posting.

A spokesman for AutoNation told KHOU 11 News that the truck went to auction. It has probably had different owners since the auction before ending up in the hands of Islamic terrorists.

Mounted with a cannon and leaving a trail of shells in its wake, a black pickup truck in the hands of jihadists in Syria has brought woe to a family of Texas City plumbers by way of the insignia on its driver-side door: “Mark-1 Plumbing”.

On Monday a Chechen-led group linked to the extremist group Ansar al-Deen, a sometime ally of Islamic State (Isis) and al-Nusra fighters, tweeted a photo of the black Ford F-250 in action near Aleppo. Since then, Mark Olberholtzer and his family near Houston have received hundreds of phone calls with questions and threats.

Attempts to call the Olberholtzer family, who own Mark-1 Plumbing, reached only a recorded message or a disconnected line. On Tuesday Mark Olberholtzer told the Galveston Daily News he was mystified: “How it ended up in Syria, I’ll never know.” His son Jeff similarly expressed bafflement to KHOU local news: “We had no intentions or idea that this would happen.”

“To think something we would use to pull trailers, now is being used for terror – it’s crazy. Never in my life would I think something like that,” the younger Olberholtzer told KHOU.

The Olberholtzers sold the truck in October 2013 to a nearby Houston dealership run by AutoNation, confirmed Marc Cannon, senior vice-president of AutoNation’s corporate communications. Cannon told the Guardian that AutoNation sent the truck to the Adesa auction house in Houston.

The car was sold on the auction block to a local used car dealer, though Adesa has not yet responded to requests to identify the dealer. An operator at the auction house told the Guardian the company has been bombarded by calls, and that she was surprised that neither the plumbers nor the jihadis had simply removed the logo.

From the port of Houston the Olberholtzers’ old F-250 likely made it to a dealership in eastern Europe, Africa or the Middle East, and within a few months changed hands several times before it finally reached a jihadist sympathizer. The truck then likely passed through Turkey’s porous border, which lies only a few hours’ drive from Aleppo and the chaotic battles so far removed from south-eastern Texas.

About erasing the logo, the elder Olberholtzer told the Galveston Daily News that AutoNation or one of the other middlemen “were supposed to have done it and it looks like they didn’t do it”. The plumber of 32 years said his family has received death threats and that some of the callers “are really ugly”.

“We have a secretary here, she’s scared to death. We all have families,” his son told KHOU. “We have nothing to do with terror at all.”

His father had a message to the broader world: “I just want it to go away, to tell you the truth.”

A representative of Mark-1 Plumbing told CBS News that they plan to pursue legal action to force Twitter to remove the photo. The person said that sold vehicles would “most definitely” have the logo removed henceforth.

Auction houses, which make more profit the faster they turn products, usually sell used cars quickly, and exporters are often keen to pick up unwanted vehicles from lots. Those exporters then ship used cars into the sizeable market in developing nations, where a battered Ford can find a long second life, or where scavengers can resurrect a lemon or dismantle it for parts."

Mark Oberholtzer’s former Ford F-250 pick-up truck, complete with anti-aircraft gun, was used in a propaganda stunt by Supporters of the Religion Front (Jabhat Ansar al-Deen) in the Syrian civil war.

SYRIAN WAR: 10 points to help understand what’s going on

IS EXPLAINED: How it fits into Syria and Iraq

Subsequently his company Mark-1 Plumbing — the name emblazoned on the pick-up truck in Syria — has been bombarded with hate calls at the office in Texas City, Texas.

“A few of the people are really ugly,” he told Galveston Daily News.

“People think you are aiding and abetting terrorists.

“We have a secretary here, she’s scared to death. We all have families. We don’t want no problems.

“I just want it to go away, to tell you the truth,” he said.

Oberholtzer has run the company for 32 years and said he took the truck to an AutoNation dealership three years ago. He believed that the company would remove the decal off the vehicle before sale.

“They were supposed to have done it and it looks like they didn’t do it,” Oberholtzer told Galveston Daily News. “How it ended up in Syria, I’ll never know.”

Oberholtzer told CBS News that he had hired a lawyer to make Twitter remove the posting.

A spokesman for AutoNation told KHOU 11 News that the truck went to auction. It has probably had different owners since the auction before ending up in the hands of Islamic terrorists.

Jabhat Ansar al-Din wants to impose the rule of Shari’ah but has maintained it is independent of ISIS/al-Qaeda.

A photo posted to Twitter on Monday by the Ansar al-Deen Front, an Islamic extremist brigade seemingly comprised largely of Chechen fighters, shows the Ford F-250 with a militant standing in the bed firing the anti-aircraft gun.

Speaking to CBS News Tuesday morning, a representative of the plumbing company in Texas City said the vehicle was sold to the AutoNation dealership in Houston in Oct. 2013, and that's the last they knew of it.

The company has been besieged by phone calls -- including threats -- since the photo appeared online, clearly showing the company's name and phone number. CBS News is not identifying the company due to the nature of some of the attention it has received.

They have employed an attorney and intend to pursue legal action to force Twitter to remove the photo from the Internet.

Reached by CBS News Tuesday morning, a person identifying himself as a manager at AutoNation would not comment on the sale history of the vehicle in question, saying ""we can't give information like that over the phone,"" before hanging up the phone.

The representative of the plumbing company in Texas City said they would ""most definitely"" be removing their logo from all vehicles sold in the future.

Ansar al-Deen Front has been fighting in the complicated Syrian war primarily around Aleppo, Syria's largest city and formerly the economic powerhouse of the nation.

It has been the scene of some of the most vicious fighting between Syrian President Bashar Assad's forces and the myriad rebel groups trying to topple him, but is largely controlled by the Islamic State of Iraq and Syria (ISIS).

So how will McDonald’s define overweight?

Obesity rates in America have more than doubled over the last 2 decades and has become the leading public health issue in the U.S. With more than two-thirds of the adult population overweight, McDonald’s has decided to become part of the obesity rate solution – not the problem.

According to reports, beginning January 1, 2015, McDonald’s will no longer serve customers who show risks of being overweight. They will define overweight by these standards: Over 170 lbs for women and 245 lbs for men. Children’s weight restrictions will vary depending on age and height.

McDonald’s is currently running campaigns to shake its “junk food” image, insisting they sell nothing but good quality food. They are are branding themselves from “A dining experience of fast food” to “Good food served fast.” They want people to understand the risks of being overweight.

So how will they know if you are overweight ? Will they ask you what you weigh and trust your answer? NO

They are implementing scales at the from of every register just like the one in the photo below. You must stand on the scale when ordering or you will not be served. They also plan on posting signs to let customers know that they have the legal “Right to refuse service to anyone.”

For drive-thru patrons it may be a bit more difficult to enforce. However, if the person looks like they exceed the weight restrictions, they will be refused service at the drive-thru window.

“It actually started out as a joke,” Snowden said in his speech. “Someone photocopied a picture of an elf with the caption ‘I’m watching you,’ and it just kept moving from cubicle to cubicle.”

Snowden said that at some point it occurred to someone that if people as paranoid as NSA staff would play this game, what would happen with civilians?

“Now, the NSA has an agent inside practically every home with a child in it,” Snowden said.

“The elves have basic mobility, which isn’t a problem because when one shows up someplace unexpected,” Snowden added, “it’s just assumed to be part of the game.”

Through these adorable snoops, the NSA has gained access to millions of tax returns, bank statements, and 10-year old boys unwrapping and re-wrapping their presents in the days ahead of Christmas.

“We would flag those kids for later recruitment to the intelligence community,” Snowden said. “Especially for Tailored Access Operations.”

In addition, the NSA has uncovered a trove of data about the personal lives of millions of Americans, sources confirmed.

“The NSA has incorporated advanced sensors into these things that can uncover all kinds of information,” journalist Glenn Greenwald told Duffel Blog in an email. “They can tell things about people’s health — cancer, heart disease, liver disease. They know who’s being naughty, and who’s being really naughty, things that even extensive online snooping couldn’t provide. Dildos, vibrators, chains — all the things stashed in closets and under beds.”

Sources told reporters these were previously inaccessible to the government’s leading intelligence agency, if the owners paid cash at least.

“If you want to know why the ‘privacy advocates’ have settled down, and moved on? My guess is, blackmail. These elves have accumulated petabytes of evidence against pretty much everybody,” Snowden said.

“You wouldn’t believe what perverse things people will do to each other, right in front of these things,” Snowden concluded. “It’s why ‘ElfMonitor’ is such a highly sought after duty assignment.”"	Snowden: 'Elf On A Shelf' Is An NSA Project	2014-12-15 07:00:51-05:00	['Posted By']	['intelligence', 'whos', 'naughty', 'told', 'project', 'elf', 'elves', 'know', 'snowden', 'shelf', 'nsa', 'things', 'millions']	"“Now, the NSA has an agent inside practically every home with a child in it,” Snowden said.

Those estimates corroborate a previous report that also claimed the Apple Watch will deliver all-day battery life and support up to five hours of heavy usage per charge.

The report also claims that the Apple Watch will only deliver notifications while worn on the wrist. The smartwatch will not ping you for notifications without being in contact with skin so that the device is not disruptive at unnecessary times. Apple Watch will also stop delivering notifications when the battery reaches 10% or lower in an effort to conserve the remaining power.

""Here’s a tidbit you might not know — in order to receive notifications from apps, the Watch must be on your wrist and locked. They require contact with your skin. There will be no in-app dropdown notifications or constant pinging while it’s off your wrist. Push notifications also cease when the battery reaches 10 percent. Those decisions speak to the care with which Apple is handling notifications.""

Apple continues to tweak Digital Crown on the Apple Watch, giving the button a ""weightier, higher-end feel."" Pressing and holding down the Digital Crown activates Siri, which the report claims works well and can be used for labeling, directions and commands using a paired iPhone. The goal of the Apple Watch, the report describes, is to return some of your attention away from your smartphone by allowing you to communicate from your wrist on the go.

While both reports this afternoon have provided a closer look at the Apple Watch, there are still several question marks surrounding the wrist-worn device. That will change in less than three days, when Apple provides more details about the Apple Watch at its highly-anticipated ""Spring Forward"" media event in San Francisco. The keynote begins on Monday at 10 AM Pacific and MacRumors will be providing live coverage of the event."

http://www.emergent.info/Apple-Watch-email	Claim: The launch version of the Apple Watch OS does not support email replies	unverified	['9to5 Mac', 'Apple Watch', 'Apple Watch Features', 'Mark Gurman']	2015/03/06	emergent	['http://9to5mac.com/2015/03/06/sources-offer-hands-on-apple-watch-details-battery-life-unannounced-features-and-more/']	http://9to5mac.com/2015/03/06/sources-offer-hands-on-apple-watch-details-battery-life-unannounced-features-and-more/	http://9to5mac.com/	"Just ahead of the finalized Apple Watch’s presentation at Apple’s March 9th “Spring Forward” event, sources with hands-on Apple Watch experience have revealed a collection of new details about the device’s features to 9to5Mac. Our sources have offered new information on the Watch’s real-world battery life, health and fitness features, apps, and experiences using Apple’s next-generation touchscreen hardware…

Power Reserve Mode and Battery Life

The Apple Watch’s battery life has concerned many prospective customers, as Apple said only that the Watch will need to be charged nightly. Earlier this year, we reported that Apple’s development targets for Apple Watch battery life were 2.5-4 hours for heavy app usage, versus 19 hours per day of combined usage between light app access, notifications, and Glances. Sources who have handled the Apple Watch tell us that Apple has improved the device’s battery life, noting that the final Apple Watch should be able to handle 5 hours of fairly heavy application usage, and it and won’t run out of battery during a typical day of mixed active and passive use. However, the source says that the device will still need to be charged nightly, as it will definitely not last through a second full day.

As The New York Times reported, Apple will address battery life concerns with a new “Power Reserve Mode” that cuts optional services to preserve as much of the Apple Watch’s core functionality as possible. Our sources have shared several new details about the feature. First, Power Reserve Mode can be activated via a Battery Glance that’s accessible at any time, or via the Apple Watch’s Settings application. The Battery Glance will show the percentage of battery life remaining, the amount of time since the last full charge, and a large button to activate Power Reserve Mode.

Power Reserve Mode can even be accessed when the Watch has a full 100% charge, and it is not solely activated when the Watch’s battery life is low. The mode noticeably dims the display, slows down communication with the iPhone to an on-demand level, and puts the display to sleep after roughly two seconds of inactivity. One unit tested allowed access to all Apple Watch functions while in Power Reserve mode, while another unit was limited to the Clock face. We’re told that some test units took between four and five hours to charge up to 100% from 0% via the wall-attached MagSafe charger. This is a notable improvement, we’re told, from fall 2014 prototypes.

Unlike the iPhone, when battery life is low on the Apple Watch, the device does not show a modal popup window indicating the battery life percentage remaining. Instead, with 20% battery life remaining, the Battery Life glance turns an orange/amber color as a subtle alert to the user. At 10%, the glance turns from orange/amber to a red color. On the iPhone side, our sources say that they did not see any “meaningful” change to the iPhone’s battery while using the Apple Watch.

Heart Rate Glance

One notable yet-to-be-announced Apple Watch feature is the Heart Rate Glance. Thanks to the device’s heart rate monitor, the Heart Rate Glance will allow the user to see their Beats Per Minute at any time. When accessing the Glance, an outline of a heart will appear, similar to the heart in the image above. After a button is tapped to start measurement, the screen will show the constantly updating BPM reading. Our sources say that the process of reading the heart rate was almost instant and the readings were “seemingly accurate.” Previously, Apple has only stated that the Heart Rate sensor will be used to send other users their heart beat via the communication features and to measure intensity for calorie reading in the fitness app. Of course, heart rate readings could be transferred to the Health application on the accompanying iPhone.

Notification Center, Glances, and Clock Faces

Our sources indicate that the following Glances are installed on the Apple Watch by default, in addition to Heart Rate and Battery Life: Fitness Stats, Activity, Clock, Weather, Music, Quick Settings, Calendar and Maps. As discussed on one of our recent Happy Hour podcasts, sources also indicate that the Apple Watch will have a full Notification Center like the iPhone, iPad, iPod touch, and Mac. To access Notification Center, a user can swipe down from the top of the display in any screen. The list of notifications will show each app name as well as truncated descriptions of the alerts, akin to an iPhone. Developers will be able to customize which notifications can show up in Notification Center as well as the Apple Watch app icon specific to this view. As for Clock Faces a source says that “the level of detail and customization is insane.” The source also called the quality of faces “incredible,” and said “each face is like an app in itself so it’s [a little curious] is not (yet) allowing third-party faces.” The source also said that the “astronomy Watch Face is smart: in one mode you can use the crown to scroll through time and see planetary alignments for the whole solar system.”

Onboard Storage and Music

As Apple has announced, the Apple Watch will be able to store music that can be played while unlinked to an iPhone. Prototype Apple Watches within Apple are said to include 8GB of storage; it is yet to be seen whether the shipping versions will all include 8GB. As we noted yesterday, the internal units also include Lightning connectors, which won’t be on the shipping models. Users will be able to specify individual songs, albums, and playlists to be loaded to their Apple Watches via a panel in the Companion app for iPhone. Users will also be able to stream music from the Apple Watch to external speakers or headphones over Bluetooth.

iPhone Companion App

As we extensively reported earlier this year, the settings for individual Apple Watch applications will be controlled by a Companion application on the iPhone. The Companion app has a dark black user interface with a glyph of the Apple Watch as the app icon. In addition to controlling various settings and music storage, the Companion app allows users to re-arrange the icons on the Apple Watch’s Home screen. This can be done from the Watch itself as well via a long press, just like on the iPhone and iPad. When a user downloads an iPhone application from the App Store with a WatchKit component, the Watch app is automatically installed on the Watch. Users can remove the WatchKit applications through the Companion app without deleting the app from the iPhone. Interestingly, if the iPhone is not connected to the Watch, third-party application icons will remain on the device’s Home screen, and the applications will still work for a period of time with cached data.

Force Touch, Digital Crown + Voice Control

Sources have praised the Watch’s next-generation force-sensing touchscreen interface, saying that “the screen feels like a giant button than you just want to press in the manner needed for Force Touch.” A source added that the feature “feels natural” on the small screen. Also, the Digital Crown input device is required to use the Apple Watch, as the Watch differs from the sixth-generation iPod nano in lacking pinch to zoom capabilities: it registers touches and movements up, down, left, and right. There is no keyboard at all on the device; all forms of input are handled with pre-populated options and voice dictation. Speaking of dictation, the menus within the Apple Watch label all voice control features as “Voice Control,” rather than as Siri. As we reported earlier, this initial version of the Watch OS does not support replying to emails, even by voice. Users will need to access the Mail app via Handoff on their iPhone to conduct replies.

Speed, Display, and Bands

People who have used the Apple Watch say that the device feels very fast overall, which is in line with our report that the S1 chip is comparable with the current iPod touch’s A5 chip. But there are limits. One source said that an Apple Watch with over 200 WatchKit applications became noticeably sluggish on the Home screen. It is unlikely that the majority of users will ever install 200 WatchKit applications, so this should not be a typical concern. The sources say that the display will light up when the iPhone is locked for all of the phone’s notifications, but if the iPhone is unlocked, the Watch will not light up for new alerts.

A designer familiar with the quality of mobile device screens who has used the Apple Watch says that the “screen is the best [smartwatch] screen I have ever seen,” noting that “it’s like vibrant digital paper, and does not look rendered,” with especially “great” black levels. The source thinks that the smaller, 38mm version is “tiny,” but of course this will differ between users of different sizes. Apple’s Sport Band, the default on the $349 aluminum Apple Watch, is said to “take time” to get used to as it is somewhat difficult to put on at first due to the pin-based closure system. As for the stainless steel link bracelet, a source says that “Apple have seemingly got around [hair getting stuck between links] by having the case expand the links flexibility from the outer rim only.”

Powering Off, Force Quitting and Settings

Some users have wondered how the Apple Watch will be powered off without a dedicated power button. Our sources say that it’s turned off by long pressing the large “communication button” on the right side of the Watch. When this is pressed, a confirmation slider akin to the iPhone, iPad, and iPod touch is shown, letting a swipe finish the shut down. Users can also Force Quit an unstable application by accessing the shut down screen and then quickly pressing the button on the right side. The Apple Watch also includes a Settings application that includes various toggles including Bluetooth and Airplane Mode. There is not a dedicated Wi-Fi settings panel, which instead will likely be controlled by the accompanying iPhone.

Apple will officially announce Apple Watch pricing and availability on Monday, March 9, starting at 10:00AM Pacific/1:00PM Eastern Time. 9to5Mac will offer coverage of the event in the hours leading up the keynote, during the presentation, and afterwards, so please join us for more news and commentary then.

http://www.emergent.info/Apple-Watch-diagnostics-port	Claim: The Apple Watch will ship with a diagnostics port	unverified	['Apple Watch', 'Matthew Panzarino', 'TechCrunch']	2015/03/05	emergent	['http://www.macrumors.com/2015/03/05/apple-watch-diagnostic-port/']	http://www.macrumors.com/2015/03/05/apple-watch-diagnostic-port/	http://www.macrumors.com/	"Ahead of Monday's media event where Apple is expected to provide final details on the Apple Watch, a new report from TechCrunch details a hidden ""diagnostic port"" inside one of the channels on the Apple Watch where watch bands slip into place. While the port is currently used only for diagnostic purposes, the report argues it could be used in the future to interface with ""smart band"" accessories bringing additional functionality to the watch.

The port has a 6-dot brass contact array inside the groove for the ‘bottom’ strap connector slot. Several sources have confirmed its existence and placement to me. It is very similar to the connector for the Lightning connector in iPhones, as that connector currently only uses 6 of its 8 available pins. Apple recently began opening up the Lightning port for use by third parties. A source says that this port is currently for diagnostic purposes only — but that there is nothing preventing it from being a connection port for future accessories.

TechCrunch's Matthew Panzarino is careful to state that he has no knowledge of any plans by Apple to launch such smart band accessories, but the idea remains an intriguing one. Possibilities for such bands include additional sensors, external batteries integrated into a band, and more.

Apple revealed a number of high-level details about the Apple Watch at the device's unveiling last September, but even now with a launch set for next month there is still much that remains unknown, including pricing details beyond the $349 starting price. Apple will undoubtedly address many of the details at Monday's events, but some of the technical details will likely need to wait until the device launches and users and technical experts can get a closer look at the device.

Geller']	2015/03/05	emergent	['http://mashable.com/2015/03/07/apple-watch-event-rumor-roundup/?utm_campaign=Mash-Prod-RSS-Feedburner-All-Partial&utm_cid=Mash-Prod-RSS-Feedburner-All-Partial&utm_medium=feed&utm_source=rss', 'http://www.idownloadblog.com/2015/03/05/ios-8-2-could-arrive-monday-here-are-full-release-notes/']	http://mashable.com/2015/03/07/apple-watch-event-rumor-roundup/?utm_campaign=Mash-Prod-RSS-Feedburner-All-Partial&utm_cid=Mash-Prod-RSS-Feedburner-All-Partial&utm_medium=feed&utm_source=rss	http://mashable.com/	"We all know that Apple's Spring Forward event on Monday is all about the Apple Watch.

Since unveiling the Apple Watch back in September, the Cupertino giant has been focused on teasing the device to the financial, fashion and tech press alike.

And as Mashable Chief Correspondent Lance Ulanoff helpfully outlined, we have an idea as to what we can expect to see from the event.

But this is Apple. Which means there are always rumors. The Apple Watch event is no different. Along with the main event are rumors about other things Apple could show off or reveal at its big press spectacle.

Being the consummate Apple watcher (no pun intended, truly) that I am, I figured it was time to run down the list of rumors, followed by how likely we feel each item is to show up.

The gold Apple Watch Edition will cost at least $10,000

Image: Apple

Rumor: The solid gold Apple Watch Edition will cost five figures. And up.

When Apple announced the Apple Watch last fall, the only price the company shared was that it will ""start"" at $349.

Most of us have taken that to mean that the Apple Watch Sport will be the version to debut at that price point. The Apple Watch, which has stainless steel rather than aluminum, will be next, followed by the 18 carat gold Apple Watch Edition model.

Although there are guesses about what the Apple Watch will cost (we think it'll be starting at $499), the real game has been to guess just how much Apple will sell the Apple Watch Edition for.

John Gruber at Daring Fireball initially predicted Apple would sell the Apple Watch Edition for $5,000.

He has since gone on to change his prediction, assessing that the fanciest of watches will ""start around $10,000.""

In the gadget world, a $10,000 device seems insane. You could buy a car for that (or at least a tricked-out Mac Pro and 4K display). In the watch world, however, $10,000 for a gold watch actually seems reasonable.

If Apple really is going after the luxury watch market — and not just the gadget market — the pricing could make sense.

Accuracy Rating: We'll give this an 80% accuracy rating. Gold watches are expensive and if Apple is going to try to sell to the watch aficionado crowd, it should probably be pricing its goods on-par with where they are at.

We'll also guess that counterfeit gold Apple Watch Editions will be on the streets of Chinatown in New York City within days of the announcement. They won't work with your iPhone and the gold might make your wrist green, but from afar, you can look special.

iOS 8.2

Rumor: Apple will launch iOS 8.2 alongside the Apple Watch.

This rumor seems pretty solid. The Apple Watch will need a software update and iOS 8.2, which has been seeded to developers for quite some time, will fill that void.

Interestingly, Apple is also beta testing iOS 8.3, which brings in some additional features, including new diverse emoji. This leads us to think Apple might launch iOS 8.2 before the Apple Watch officially arrives and iOS 8.3 not long after it ships.

Accuracy Rating: We're 100% confident Apple will release iOS 8.2 with or right before the Apple Watch hits stores. We're 90% certain we could see the update hit phones and tablets as early as next week.

MacBook updates

Rumor: Apple will release updated Broadwell-based MacBook Air and MacBook Pro with Retina notebooks.

It's been almost a year since Apple last updated its notebook line. The MacBook Air last got a speed bump at the end of April 2014, with the 13-inch and 15-inch MacBook Pro with Retina displays last getting updated at the end of July 2014.

Part of the reason it has taken so long for Apple to refresh its notebook line comes down to Intel, whose Broadwell mobile chipset was delayed.

Alleged screenshot evidence of new, Broadwell-based MacBook Air machines in 11-inch and 13-inch varieties appeared earlier this week, which only bolsters the idea that Apple will give the Mac a brief shout-out on Monday before going full-force on the Apple Watch.

Accuracy Rating: We think it's 90% likely that Apple will update its notebook line on Monday. That said, we expect these updates to be spec bumps only — moving to Broadwell and maybe slightly improved discrete graphics options for the 15-inch MacBook Pro with Retina.

MacBook Air Redesign

Rumor: Apple will reveal a brand new, wholly redesigned 12-inch MacBook Air.

A recent Wall Street Journal report intimated that the rumored MacBook Air redesign could ship by June.

This has led some individuals to think that the new device might share stage time with the Apple Watch at Monday's event.

The new MacBook Air will reportedly be fanless, have a retina display and a single USB-C port.

Accuracy Rating: Although we think it is highly probably that Apple will release at least one update to its general MacBook Air/MacBook Pro line, we put the likelihood of a brand-new MacBook Air redesign at 30%.

We just don't see Apple taking time to move the focus off of the Apple Watch with something as important as a new MacBook Air.

It's true that Apple has used major events to show-off Mac redesigns in the past, but this just doesn't feel right. Instead, we expect the new MacBook Air (or whatever it is called) to make its debut in June at WWDC.

New Apple TV

Rumor: Apple will finally update its Apple TV.

It's been three years since the third-generation Apple TV was released by Apple. Three years.

In that time, not only has the set-top box landscape changed, with strong competition coming not just from Roku but also from Amazon and Google via its hit Chromecast.

Moreover, the Apple TV interface is starting to feel stale. Plus the hardware could use a refresh, if only to make AirPlay mirroring even better and to bring something like Continuity and Hand-off to the Apple TV world.

But beyond the set-top box world, the OTT revolution is off and running with an increasing number of television viewers turning to over-the-top streaming services for more of their content.

Could Apple finally be prepared to release a new Apple TV along with a Sling TV-like service?

Accuracy Rating: We think there is a 15% change Apple could release an update Apple TV. Without a doubt the product needs an update, we just don't see it happening now.

iPad Pro

Rumor: Apple will release the long-rumored 12-inch iPad Pro.

Personally, I have a hard time believing Apple is even planning on releasing a 12-inch iPad. Sure, it's possible that this is a device that its partner IBM might want for the enterprise, but the truth is, tablets of that size tend to become unwieldy.

Plus, it seems like Apple releasing an iPad that is trying to be a laptop would be making the same mistake Microsoft made with the Surface and Surface 2. Microsoft finally found success with the Surface Pro 3 by selling it for what it is, a laptop that, in a pinch, could be used as a touch-screen device.

Apple has been very clear that it intends to keep iOS and OS X separate.

But even if you do believe that an iPad Pro is coming, Bloomberg and the Wall Street Journal are both saying that Apple can't ship the device until fall.

Accuracy Rating: 0%. You will not see a new iPad at the Apple Watch event. Period.

Apple's tagline for the event is ""spring forward,"" a less-than-subtle reference to the Apple Watch and a reminder that holding a product event the day after Daylight Saving Time begins is cruel. Since this event is likely to be the springboard for an all-new product line, it's probably going to crowd out most other announcements, which makes this list shorter than it normally is. That said, the timing is right for a handful of other announcements—here's what we think will share the stage on Monday.

Apple Watch

This is a gimme. The Apple Watch has already been announced, so we know what it looks like and some basic things about how it works. We know it's scheduled to launch in April, and we have some basic information about what it does. We know it requires an iPhone 5 or better and that it will support Apple Pay even when tethered to older phones. We know the price starts at $349, probably for the aluminum Apple Watch Sport model with a basic band.

What we're likely to get on Monday is an actual launch date, more specific pricing information for all three versions of the product and their bands, and some kind of showcase of third-party apps. At iPhone and iPad launches, Apple usually has at least one or two devs come on stage to walk the audience through a demo that shows what the new hardware is capable of. iOS still enjoys the widest and deepest third-party support of any mobile platform, so we'd expect third-party support to be a major selling point for the Apple Watch as well.

We don’t know whether the Apple Watch will succeed or not—nobody knows, no matter how many op-eds have already called it one way or the other. In either case, its launch signifies the start of something new for Apple.

Macs

Macs aren't the targets of leaks to the extent that iDevices are, so this one is not as sure a bet as the Apple Watch. That said, most of Apple's Mac lineup hasn't been refreshed in well over a year (blame Intel). Among those products, there are three for which new Intel processors now exist: the MacBook Air (Broadwell U or perhaps Core M), the 13-inch Retina MacBook Pro (Broadwell U again), and the Mac Pro (Haswell-EP and refreshed workstation GPUs from AMD). Higher-wattage quad-core parts suitable for the 15-inch Retina MacBook Pro and most iMacs aren't due until midyear.

Of those three, the MacBook Air is the only thing we've really heard many rumors about. Earlier this week, we saw convincing screenshots that suggested the current 11- and 13-inch MacBook Airs would be refreshed with Broadwell chips, but not with new designs. Another rumor proposes something totally different—a 12-inch version of the computer that streamlines the chassis and does away with nearly all ports. One USB Type-C port would handle all wired connectivity, and using Intel's Core M rather than the more powerful Core i5 and i7 CPUs would allow it to run without a fan. It may or may not use a Retina-class display; reports are less clear on that one.

Even if the latter product exists, we're not sure where it would slot into Apple's lineup. Is it a new product line entirely? Is it intended to be the future of the MacBook Air, leaving power users with the 13-inch MacBook Pro if they want more ports and more performance? We can't say for sure, but remember that Apple didn't replace non-Retina models immediately when it introduced the Retina MacBook Pros and the Retina iMac. There may be a transitional period.

However the lineup shakes out, we think MacBook Air news is most likely, followed by everything else we just mentioned, followed by some kind of surprise like a 4K 21.5-inch iMac.

iOS

The Apple Watch requires iOS 8.2, so iOS 8.2 is likely to drop on the day of the event or just after. It's been through five developer betas and a new beta hasn't been issued in a few weeks, which is usually a sign that release is imminent. If you don't care about the Apple Watch, this update probably won't amount to much more than a handful of bug fixes, but that's fine too.

Apple is also expected to announce a public beta program for iOS at some point in March, beginning with iOS 8.3 and eventually extending to iOS 9.0 (don't expect word about the next major iOS version before WWDC this summer, though). Launching something like this really doesn't require stage time at a major product event, but we wouldn't be surprised to hear about it.

We're not expecting anything in the way of major iOS hardware announcements. Rumors about a new 12-inch ""iPad Pro"" spring eternal, but the newest item from a reputable source says not to expect it before this fall (if we ever actually see it). The current iPads and iPhones are still in the middle of their typical release cycle. Most iOS news is going to be about the way iOS interacts with the Apple Watch.

And the rest

The Apple TV was last updated in March of 2013, and there's plenty of new hardware that could speed it up. Apple doesn't seem to have the 4K fever that most other consumer electronics companies are suffering from right now, but it would be a logical next step (the current maximum resolution is 1080p).

Most of the Apple TV rumors from the last year or so have revolved around something entirely new, though—not a faster version of the little $99 black box, but some kind of collaboration with content providers that would integrate Apple TV functionality into cable boxes (or maybe the other way around).

iPods haven't been touched since 2012, either, but the iPod Touch is the only one that could use new hardware to get better at the stuff it does. Its A5 chip dates back to early 2011, after all. Don't hold your breath, but if Apple intends to drop support for Apple A5 devices in iOS 9, now is the time to start replacing them.

And that's the rundown! The Apple Watch is the only sure thing, but Apple usually uses events like these to refresh a few things at once. Whatever happens, we'll be on the ground in San Francisco to liveblog the speech, and we'll go hands-on with anything we can get our mitts on afterward.

Apple allegedly planned to launch the new service at the beginning of 2015, but the departure of key employees cause the project to be delayed.

Instead, Apple currently plans to introduce the service, at least in beta form, at its Worldwide Developers Conference (WWDC) in early June. The WWDC keynote likely takes place on Monday, June 8th, and that’s the event where the debut will occur. The new iTunes music streaming service is based on technology acquired from Beats Music, including curated playlists, cloud-based libraries, and offerings customized to the musical tastes of individual users. The service will be priced as high as $7.99 per month, which is less expensive than current $9.99 pricing for Beats Music, Spotify, and Rdio…

The service was initially planned for launch earlier in 2015, but was delayed by the departures of key employees, as well as difficulties integrating Beats human and technology resources into Apple. Some Beats executives such as Bobby Gaza, who was a Senior Vice President at Beats in charge of technology, have departed Apple in recent weeks. The new Apple-made service will also make way for Apple’s first entirely-in-house Android application, but sources say that delays to the Android app are also possible as some of Apple’s Android developers have also left the company. Apple has, not coincidentally, published job listings for Android developers in recent days.

Apple currently plans to launch the new music service as part of an iOS 8.4 upgrade for the iPhone, iPad, and iPod touch following WWDC, but a final decision has not yet been made. It’s possible that the service will be bundled into iOS 9 this fall, which is expected to have a significant focus on bug fixes and stability improvements. The service will be integrated into the standard iOS Music application and will function similarly to Beats Music for iPhone, but it will have an entirely Apple-designed aesthetic that matches the Music app and iOS. On the Mac side, the new service will be implemented with an iTunes update.

As for the Apple TV, the new service will be an app that replaces the existing Beats channel. Sources say that Apple is also finishing up work on a slimmer Apple TV set-top-box with a more capable and tactile remote control and a redesigned operating system bundled with an App Store. As of last fall, Apple had hoped to debut a new set top box as soon as this month, but with reports of the discussions between Apple and content providers being in only “early stages”, it seems that, just like last year, content roadblocks could keep the new Apple TV from debuting until another point in the future. As we learned yesterday regarding the larger iPad Pro, Apple will have another busy fall, so perhaps the new Apple TV will launch later in the year.

While the streaming service won’t debut at the March event, as some had hoped, Apple still has plenty to talk about. The Apple Watch will be the cornerstone of the event, where sources expect Apple to spend a significant amount of time introducing and demonstrating third-party WatchKit applications as selling points for the device. It is also highly likely that Apple will discuss the rest of the price points for the device and its accessories before the April ship date. Apple has a redesigned MacBook Air with Retina display in the works for this year, but it remains unclear whether Apple actually plans to debut the computer at the March event.

Since unveiling the Apple Watch back in September, the Cupertino giant has been focused on teasing the device to the financial, fashion and tech press alike.

And as Mashable Chief Correspondent Lance Ulanoff helpfully outlined, we have an idea as to what we can expect to see from the event.

But this is Apple. Which means there are always rumors. The Apple Watch event is no different. Along with the main event are rumors about other things Apple could show off or reveal at its big press spectacle.

Being the consummate Apple watcher (no pun intended, truly) that I am, I figured it was time to run down the list of rumors, followed by how likely we feel each item is to show up.

The gold Apple Watch Edition will cost at least $10,000

Image: Apple

Rumor: The solid gold Apple Watch Edition will cost five figures. And up.

When Apple announced the Apple Watch last fall, the only price the company shared was that it will ""start"" at $349.

Most of us have taken that to mean that the Apple Watch Sport will be the version to debut at that price point. The Apple Watch, which has stainless steel rather than aluminum, will be next, followed by the 18 carat gold Apple Watch Edition model.

Although there are guesses about what the Apple Watch will cost (we think it'll be starting at $499), the real game has been to guess just how much Apple will sell the Apple Watch Edition for.

John Gruber at Daring Fireball initially predicted Apple would sell the Apple Watch Edition for $5,000.

He has since gone on to change his prediction, assessing that the fanciest of watches will ""start around $10,000.""

In the gadget world, a $10,000 device seems insane. You could buy a car for that (or at least a tricked-out Mac Pro and 4K display). In the watch world, however, $10,000 for a gold watch actually seems reasonable.

If Apple really is going after the luxury watch market — and not just the gadget market — the pricing could make sense.

Accuracy Rating: We'll give this an 80% accuracy rating. Gold watches are expensive and if Apple is going to try to sell to the watch aficionado crowd, it should probably be pricing its goods on-par with where they are at.

We'll also guess that counterfeit gold Apple Watch Editions will be on the streets of Chinatown in New York City within days of the announcement. They won't work with your iPhone and the gold might make your wrist green, but from afar, you can look special.

iOS 8.2

Rumor: Apple will launch iOS 8.2 alongside the Apple Watch.

This rumor seems pretty solid. The Apple Watch will need a software update and iOS 8.2, which has been seeded to developers for quite some time, will fill that void.

Interestingly, Apple is also beta testing iOS 8.3, which brings in some additional features, including new diverse emoji. This leads us to think Apple might launch iOS 8.2 before the Apple Watch officially arrives and iOS 8.3 not long after it ships.

Accuracy Rating: We're 100% confident Apple will release iOS 8.2 with or right before the Apple Watch hits stores. We're 90% certain we could see the update hit phones and tablets as early as next week.

MacBook updates

Rumor: Apple will release updated Broadwell-based MacBook Air and MacBook Pro with Retina notebooks.

It's been almost a year since Apple last updated its notebook line. The MacBook Air last got a speed bump at the end of April 2014, with the 13-inch and 15-inch MacBook Pro with Retina displays last getting updated at the end of July 2014.

Part of the reason it has taken so long for Apple to refresh its notebook line comes down to Intel, whose Broadwell mobile chipset was delayed.

Alleged screenshot evidence of new, Broadwell-based MacBook Air machines in 11-inch and 13-inch varieties appeared earlier this week, which only bolsters the idea that Apple will give the Mac a brief shout-out on Monday before going full-force on the Apple Watch.

Accuracy Rating: We think it's 90% likely that Apple will update its notebook line on Monday. That said, we expect these updates to be spec bumps only — moving to Broadwell and maybe slightly improved discrete graphics options for the 15-inch MacBook Pro with Retina.

MacBook Air Redesign

Rumor: Apple will reveal a brand new, wholly redesigned 12-inch MacBook Air.

A recent Wall Street Journal report intimated that the rumored MacBook Air redesign could ship by June.

This has led some individuals to think that the new device might share stage time with the Apple Watch at Monday's event.

The new MacBook Air will reportedly be fanless, have a retina display and a single USB-C port.

Accuracy Rating: Although we think it is highly probably that Apple will release at least one update to its general MacBook Air/MacBook Pro line, we put the likelihood of a brand-new MacBook Air redesign at 30%.

We just don't see Apple taking time to move the focus off of the Apple Watch with something as important as a new MacBook Air.

It's true that Apple has used major events to show-off Mac redesigns in the past, but this just doesn't feel right. Instead, we expect the new MacBook Air (or whatever it is called) to make its debut in June at WWDC.

New Apple TV

Rumor: Apple will finally update its Apple TV.

It's been three years since the third-generation Apple TV was released by Apple. Three years.

In that time, not only has the set-top box landscape changed, with strong competition coming not just from Roku but also from Amazon and Google via its hit Chromecast.

Moreover, the Apple TV interface is starting to feel stale. Plus the hardware could use a refresh, if only to make AirPlay mirroring even better and to bring something like Continuity and Hand-off to the Apple TV world.

But beyond the set-top box world, the OTT revolution is off and running with an increasing number of television viewers turning to over-the-top streaming services for more of their content.

Could Apple finally be prepared to release a new Apple TV along with a Sling TV-like service?

Accuracy Rating: We think there is a 15% change Apple could release an update Apple TV. Without a doubt the product needs an update, we just don't see it happening now.

iPad Pro

Rumor: Apple will release the long-rumored 12-inch iPad Pro.

Personally, I have a hard time believing Apple is even planning on releasing a 12-inch iPad. Sure, it's possible that this is a device that its partner IBM might want for the enterprise, but the truth is, tablets of that size tend to become unwieldy.

Plus, it seems like Apple releasing an iPad that is trying to be a laptop would be making the same mistake Microsoft made with the Surface and Surface 2. Microsoft finally found success with the Surface Pro 3 by selling it for what it is, a laptop that, in a pinch, could be used as a touch-screen device.

Apple has been very clear that it intends to keep iOS and OS X separate.

But even if you do believe that an iPad Pro is coming, Bloomberg and the Wall Street Journal are both saying that Apple can't ship the device until fall.

Accuracy Rating: 0%. You will not see a new iPad at the Apple Watch event. Period.

Apple's tagline for the event is ""spring forward,"" a less-than-subtle reference to the Apple Watch and a reminder that holding a product event the day after Daylight Saving Time begins is cruel. Since this event is likely to be the springboard for an all-new product line, it's probably going to crowd out most other announcements, which makes this list shorter than it normally is. That said, the timing is right for a handful of other announcements—here's what we think will share the stage on Monday.

Apple Watch

This is a gimme. The Apple Watch has already been announced, so we know what it looks like and some basic things about how it works. We know it's scheduled to launch in April, and we have some basic information about what it does. We know it requires an iPhone 5 or better and that it will support Apple Pay even when tethered to older phones. We know the price starts at $349, probably for the aluminum Apple Watch Sport model with a basic band.

What we're likely to get on Monday is an actual launch date, more specific pricing information for all three versions of the product and their bands, and some kind of showcase of third-party apps. At iPhone and iPad launches, Apple usually has at least one or two devs come on stage to walk the audience through a demo that shows what the new hardware is capable of. iOS still enjoys the widest and deepest third-party support of any mobile platform, so we'd expect third-party support to be a major selling point for the Apple Watch as well.

We don’t know whether the Apple Watch will succeed or not—nobody knows, no matter how many op-eds have already called it one way or the other. In either case, its launch signifies the start of something new for Apple.

Macs

Macs aren't the targets of leaks to the extent that iDevices are, so this one is not as sure a bet as the Apple Watch. That said, most of Apple's Mac lineup hasn't been refreshed in well over a year (blame Intel). Among those products, there are three for which new Intel processors now exist: the MacBook Air (Broadwell U or perhaps Core M), the 13-inch Retina MacBook Pro (Broadwell U again), and the Mac Pro (Haswell-EP and refreshed workstation GPUs from AMD). Higher-wattage quad-core parts suitable for the 15-inch Retina MacBook Pro and most iMacs aren't due until midyear.

Of those three, the MacBook Air is the only thing we've really heard many rumors about. Earlier this week, we saw convincing screenshots that suggested the current 11- and 13-inch MacBook Airs would be refreshed with Broadwell chips, but not with new designs. Another rumor proposes something totally different—a 12-inch version of the computer that streamlines the chassis and does away with nearly all ports. One USB Type-C port would handle all wired connectivity, and using Intel's Core M rather than the more powerful Core i5 and i7 CPUs would allow it to run without a fan. It may or may not use a Retina-class display; reports are less clear on that one.

Even if the latter product exists, we're not sure where it would slot into Apple's lineup. Is it a new product line entirely? Is it intended to be the future of the MacBook Air, leaving power users with the 13-inch MacBook Pro if they want more ports and more performance? We can't say for sure, but remember that Apple didn't replace non-Retina models immediately when it introduced the Retina MacBook Pros and the Retina iMac. There may be a transitional period.

However the lineup shakes out, we think MacBook Air news is most likely, followed by everything else we just mentioned, followed by some kind of surprise like a 4K 21.5-inch iMac.

iOS

The Apple Watch requires iOS 8.2, so iOS 8.2 is likely to drop on the day of the event or just after. It's been through five developer betas and a new beta hasn't been issued in a few weeks, which is usually a sign that release is imminent. If you don't care about the Apple Watch, this update probably won't amount to much more than a handful of bug fixes, but that's fine too.

And the rest

The Apple TV was last updated in March of 2013, and there's plenty of new hardware that could speed it up. Apple doesn't seem to have the 4K fever that most other consumer electronics companies are suffering from right now, but it would be a logical next step (the current maximum resolution is 1080p).

http://www.emergent.info/Apple-Watch-Edition-5000	Claim: The Apple Watch Edition will cost $5,000	false	['Apple Watch', 'Apple Watch Edition', 'Apple Watch Price', 'Marco Arment']	2015/03/04	emergent	['http://www.marco.org/2015/03/04/boring-apple-watch-edition-pricing']	http://www.marco.org/2015/03/04/boring-apple-watch-edition-pricing	http://www.marco.org/	"I’ve never seen a smartwatch that I’d wear except the Apple Watch. It’s not that I think the rest are all ugly — most are, some are less so. But they’ve all looked like too strong a combination of cheap,1 absurdly geeky,2 and chunky for my taste, even though I wear $40 jeans and a $10 black T-shirt every day. My outfit feels reasonably acceptable, but an exceptionally geeky watch doesn’t.

I cannot look past my fashion preferences for a smartwatch’s functionality benefits. Looking good to me and making me feel good about wearing it is a fundamental requirement. Watches are a combination of functionality and jewelry for most wearers, often with the jewelry side as a higher priority.

The biggest challenge Apple faced with the design of the Apple Watch has nothing to do with battery life or screen technology: How do you make a smartwatch that most people will want to wear?

Everyone draws that line differently. A lot of tech people will see the Pebble Time or Time Steel as within those lines, but I don’t think it stands a chance in the mass market, especially the upscale market. To me, it still looks like a relatively crude geekwatch, and to everyone else, it’s going to look like a bad Apple Watch knockoff.

Apple couldn’t release a product that didn’t appeal to the mass and upscale markets — they’re too high-profile. It would be seen as a colossal failure. People would call for Tim Cook to be fired and everyone would declare Apple’s impending death spiral, even more than usual.

Lots of writers and podcasters have speculated that Apple now fancies itself a high-fashion company and wants the insane profit margins that could result from that, with the solid-gold Apple Watch Edition as the leading example. Most credible guesses, considering the price of gold itself and the prices of other high-end gold watches, predict the Edition having about $1500 worth of gold and a retail price between $10,000–20,000.

What if Apple’s primary reason for offering the gold Apple Watch Edition isn’t absurd profit? Profit helps, of course. But I bet the primary reason is to get people using an Apple Watch who would only wear a gold watch.

The Sport, assuming it’s the cheapest at $350, looks about as nice as the Pebble Time Steel in photos. It’ll easily succeed, but I don’t think it’s for me — wearing a watch with a plastic band just won’t make me feel good, and I’m not crazy about the aluminum’s appearance in Apple’s photos.

I’ll probably get a stainless model with a leather or metal band. But they couldn’t just release the stainless one, because many people would consider it too expensive, heavy, or delicate for their use. They’d rather have a cheaper, lighter model that can take a beating without looking too bad.

Just as they probably need both the Sport and the stainless line, there’s a high end of the market — much of which is ignored by and unknown to the young white American men who dominate tech and tech media — who won’t want to wear a moderately priced stainless model. They want the gold one, and many of them will buy it.

But Apple can’t sell it to them at a truly ridiculous price without alienating their base. A $10,000–20,000 starting price would make the Edition relatively affordable compared to many gold watches but ludicrously out of reach for most iPhone owners, possibily alienating millions of Apple customers and tarnishing their image with all of the snobbery and exclusion that comes with the world of five-figure watches. At the same time, Apple needs to be careful not to fall on the wrong side of the Veblen effect by making the Edition too affordable, but I bet they’re looking to keep Veblen under control at a healthy level, not maximize its short-term profitability.

Apple’s letting the $10,000–20,000 guesses simmer in the press to set price expectations high, just as they stayed quiet when everyone thought the first iPad would cost $1000. Maybe it’s for the same reason: maybe the Edition won’t be completely unreasonably priced for a piece of electronic jewelry that will probably be completely obsolete in five years but happens to be encased in a thousand bucks worth of solid gold. Letting people believe it’ll cost so much will make the real price seem like a great deal when it’s announced.

I’m guessing the Edition is closer to $5,000: expensive and very profitable, but boringly reasonable for a solid-gold electronic gadget.

(This may all be proven comically wrong at next week’s event, like most of my predictions — seriously, my track record is terrible.)"

http://www.emergent.info/apple-macbook-air-12	Claim: Apple will announce a 12-inch MacBook Air Retina at the March 9th Spring Forward Event	true	['Apple', 'MacBook Air', 'The Michael Report']	2015/03/04	emergent	['http://themichaelreport.com/2015/03/04/exclusive-retina-macbook-air-spring-forward/']	http://themichaelreport.com/2015/03/04/exclusive-retina-macbook-air-spring-forward/	http://themichaelreport.com/	"Last week, Apple sent out the invites for its “Spring Forward” event, slated to be held at the Yerba Buena Center for the Arts in San Francisco on March 9th.

Many are expecting Apple talk more about the Apple Watch. However, sources familiar with the matter within Apple have exclusively told The Michael Report that Apple plans to unveil the long-awaited Retina MacBook Air at the same event. The Michael Report has independently verified this information to be highly credible.

We should note that this information falls in line with what Apple analysts such as KGI Securities’ Ming-Chi Kuo and Oppenheimer’s Andrew Uerkwitz have been predicting for months. Supply chain sources who spoke to the press have also said that Apple ramped up their production in late 2014 and entered the mass production stage in December, with the goal of producing enough units for an early-2015 debut.

Apple’s MacBook Air line, which got upgraded in April last year (the only real upgrade being a small speed bump), still features a non-Retina screen with the same screen resolution that hasn’t been updated since late 2010. This is a stark contrast from the rest of the Apple computer lineup, which have been steadily upgraded to a Retina (or at least, a version of it is offered) screen since the first Retina MacBook Pro was unveiled in 2012.

The upcoming Retina MacBook Air, if earlier reports are to be believed, will come in an ultra slim design that combines the productivity of the current larger-screened 13-inch MacBook Air with the portability of the 11-inch MacBook Air.

Internally, the new Retina MacBook Air is said to feature Intel’s next-generation Broadwell Core M low-power processors, which would allow Apple to strip the computer of its fan assembly to create an even thinner profile. Other compromises Apple reportedly made in exchange for a thinner and lighter body includes the full-sized USB ports, MagSafe connectors and SD card slots.

The Retina MacBook Air, currently codenamed “MacBook Stealth” internally, will also come with a modest price decrease according to previous reports."

The report says that HBO is targeting a launch for Now in early April, ahead of the start date for Game of Thrones. While Game of Thrones would be a great way for HBO to drive subscriptions to the new service, it'll have to be careful if it plans to do that: last year, HBO's online streaming option for cable subscribers, HBO Go, wouldn't work for many who were trying to watch during the premiere. That would be a very bad look for a new service, and the Times says that HBO doesn't plan on launching until it's satisfied that it can do so without issue.

$15/month would make HBO's service nearly twice the cost of Netflix

Apple is reportedly one of the partners that HBO could launch its new service with. According to the Times, Apple has been aggressive in its attempts to secure a place as one of HBO's launch partners. If a deal is made, Apple TV users would be able to access and stream HBO Now, potentially through a standalone app. Apple has been adding more and more channels to the Apple TV over the last couple years, and the addition of HBO's subscription streaming service would make its device all the more appealing. The Times notes that HBO's parent company wants to see this service be accessible on platforms like the Roku, Xbox, and PlayStation as well, but it's not clear if discussions are ongoing. Nonetheless, it seems likely that HBO would want to work with multiple major partners to get this service out there.

It's still not known what HBO's subscription streaming service will actually offer. Though many will hope for the same access that HBO Go receives — that is, all of HBO's original content and the movies it's currently playing — it's possible that won't be the case. HBO may want to position this service as something distinctly different from its cable service as a way to prevent subscribers from moving online. On the other hand, the $15 per month fee may mean that HBO is earning about as much regardless of how you subscribe. That price would make it tougher to compete with Netflix, but HBO hasn't exactly had trouble finding people willing to pay subscription fees that high in the past. With the even wider audience that this service will open it up to, HBO may not be that worried."

The news comes as HBO puts the finishing touches on its impending HBO Now standalone streaming service, built and designed by Major League Baseball Advanced Media, which is scheduled to debut by April 12.

Currently HBO subscribers typically pay for the channel's programming and service through a cable, telecomm or satellite provider, paying either a set standalone monthly fee or as part of a content bundle package.

With HBO Now, however, consumers will be able to subscribe directly from HBO for a $15 monthly fee. Reports say Time Warner, which owns HBO, is aiming to build a network of distributors to push the HBO Now service to the 10 million broadband households that are not subscribed to a cable TV bundle service, and the 70 million cable TV subscribers who aren't HBO subscribers.

Pulling Apple TV on as a partner would be a huge win-win given Apple's computing ecosystem and the access to Apple smartphone consumers.

For Apple, landing HBO Now for its fledgling Apple TV would be a major coup and compliment HBO Go, a mobile streaming service, already available via Apple TV since 2013.

HBO's subscriber price for HBO Now, however, may prove a sticky point as entrenched competitor Netflix has kept its prices at nearly half that cost. There's also the potential of exhausting consumers with fees given they're already laying out money for the Web TV boxes and sticks. While these costs are typically much less than a cable subscription the increasing number of standalone services could prove to be confusing and ultimately more expensive at some point.

It's clear, however, that HBO believes the HBO Now cost is appropriate and isn't about the change the reported pricing of $15 a month.

""It's a premium product, and it will be priced accordingly,"" HBO CEO Richard Plepler said during an earnings call last month.

Obviously some Time Warner shareholders like the idea of HBO and Apple partnering as shares rallied end of day Wednesday on the reports though ultimately ended flat.

At this point HBO is not providing details regarding the Apple partnership report, and Apple has declined to comment.

""We know there's great anticipation around our standalone streaming service,"" an HBO spokesman said in a statement. ""And when we have details to share, we will do so.""

Another compelling aspect for Apple striving to be the sole HBO Now partner is the fact that HBO produces ""Games of Thrones,"" one of the most popular streaming content programs to date. The arrival of HBO Now is expected to debut with the fifth season's premiere.

Yet streaming content competitors' programs have been pulling in strong viewer support as well. Netflix's ""House of Cards"" series is extremely popular and Amazon's original content program, ""Transparent,"" has won an Emmy award.

The service will launch in April at $14.99 per month. The first month is free for early-bird subscribers.

Original story: A source speaking to the International Business Times said that HBO will launch its standalone streaming service, called HBO Now, for $15 per month this spring with the premier of Game of Thrones. The company is also working with Apple to make Apple TV one of the launch partners for the service, the sources said.

HBO’s standalone streaming service has been greatly anticipated. For a monthly fee, viewers will be able to get HBO content without having to pay for an entire cable package. HBO’s long-standing relationship with pay-TV packages has prevented it from capturing key audiences, including younger people who may have never paid for TV service before and watch most of their entertainment online. HBO currently has a streaming service called HBO Go, but a bundled TV package is required for access.

HBO will serve up its content with the help of Major League Baseball’s Advanced Media platform, a decision that was made after the network decided to throw out its homemade streaming platform in late December. HBO's Chief Technology Officer Otto Berkes also resigned at that time.

At $15 per month, the service will be priced similarly to what consumers pay to add HBO onto their cable packages. The International Business Times estimates that an online streaming version of HBO could capture up to 70 million customers who currently don’t subscribe to a pay-TV service.

The service will likely be available on other platforms as well, but “Apple has been most aggressive in courting HBO in a bid to add the service to Apple TV,” the International Business Times' sources said.

Ars contacted an HBO spokesperson who stated, “We know there’s great anticipation around our standalone streaming service. And when we have details to share, we will do so.”

Dish Network is trying to launch a similar standalone streaming service called Sling TV to cater to ""cord cutters"" and ""cord nevers,"" people who may not ever have paid for bundled TV service.

CNBC has also confirmed that Apple and HBO are in talks in the video tweet posted below.

BREAKING: Sources tell @JBoorstin that Apple & HBO are in talks for Apple TV to be a launch partner for 'HBO Now'. https://t.co/hQd9AzA3Xr — CNBC Now (@CNBCnow) March 4, 2015

Apple could potentially be one of HBO's launch partners for its web-only service, which may be called ""HBO Now."" News of HBO's web-based subscription service first surfaced in October of 2014, after HBO CEO Richard Plepler shared the company's plans at an investor presentation.

The service, aimed at cable cutters, will allow users to access HBO content without a cable subscription for a set monthly fee. With the launch of a cable-free subscription service, HBO will become the first major premium content provider to cease limiting its television and movie offerings to cable subscribers.

According to Learmonth, HBO's web-only subscription will launch in April alongside the premiere of the fifth season of Game of Thrones, which takes place on April 12. The service is said to cost $15 per month, which is roughly how much it costs to subscribe to HBO through a cable company. A partnership with Apple would allow the service to be watched on the Apple TV, much like the existing version of HBO's service, HBO Go. HBO Go is available to all existing HBO subscribers on a variety of devices like the iPad and Apple TV, but it requires an HBO subscription through a cable or satellite provider.



Cable companies like Time Warner and Comcast have long been reluctant to offer piecemeal pricing and companies like HBO have previously avoided moving away from traditional cable models in order to preserve the status quo and avoid upsetting existing revenue streams.

The introduction of HBO's service will be a major victory for cord cutters, and it could encourage other content providers to introduce similar offerings. Content providers' reluctance to shift away from traditional cable pricing models has been one of the major factors that's prevented Apple from establishing deals for its own service in the past."

When it launches, consumers will be able to subscribe to HBO Now directly from HBO for the first time, rather than through a cable, satellite or telco TV distributor such as Comcast or Verizon. The retail price is expected to be $15 a month when purchased directly from HBO, or about what consumers pay when they order HBO through their cable, satellite or telco provider.

HBO’s corporate parent, Time Warner Inc., will rely on a whole new line of distributors (e.g., Apple TV, Roku, Xbox, PlayStation, Amazon, etc.) to help market HBO Now to an estimated 10 million U.S. broadband subscribers who do not pay for a cable TV bundle. CEO Jeff Bewkes has said the offering could also help reach some of the 70 million cable TV subscribers who do not subscribe to HBO but might if given the opportunity to subscribe online.

HBO’s over-the-top service has been cast as the biggest challenge yet to the so-called cable bundle, in which consumers are required to buy packages of channels, some of which they may never watch. One study claimed the service would lead to a 7 percent drop in pay TV subscriptions, as users opt out of cable and opt in to HBO Now.

Some cable providers, however, such as Cablevision and Cox Communications, have expressed interest in bundling HBO Now with broadband for their own subscribers who don’t get cable TV.

Apple has been most aggressive in courting HBO in a bid to add the service to Apple TV, sources say. Apple TV already carries HBO Go for current HBO subscribers, but it may add a second app for HBO Now. Apple has spent the past several years negotiating for the rights to offer its own linear TV package; in the meantime, HBO Now is seen as an added service to drive adoption of Apple TV.

While HBO has not confirmed a launch date for HBO Now, internally the target is an April launch, in time for the April 12 debut of “Game of Thrones.” That’s an aggressive time frame for Major League Baseball Advanced Media, which is building the back end along with a new front end separate from HBO Go. HBO is taking care not to launch HBO Now before it can guarantee that the service will work without some of the technical glitches that plagued HBO Go during last year's debut of cult-fave ""Game of Thrones.""

The launch of HBO Now will be a milestone for Time Warner’s premium TV channel, which has for most of its 42-year history been distributed as an add-on to a package of cable channels. The Web service will allow HBO to sign on a new group of distribution partners, which it sees as no different than when it added satellite TV and, later, telcos such as Verizon and AT&T.

Each of those distributors pays a wholesale price for HBO and then resells it to consumers for anywhere from $13 to $18 a month. Most see HBO as a retention device; those who subscribe are less likely to drop service or switch providers. HBO and Time Warner declined to comment.

At $15 a month, HBO Now will be significantly more expensive than Netflix, which ranges from $8 to $12 a month for various levels of service, but cheaper than some were predicting. HBO makes the case that it has more original programming than Netflix and a better, more current film library. “It’s a premium product, and it will be priced accordingly,” HBO CEO Richard Plepler said during a Time Warner earnings call in February.

HBO’s push to launch HBO Now comes after years of talking about launching an over-the-top service that bypasses traditional cable TV. Understandably, it has been met with some resistance from current distributors, including Time Warner Cable and Comcast, two companies in the midst of a $46 billion merger, according to sources.

HBO, of course, heard the same misgivings from cable companies when it first added satellite TV providers and then telcos as distributors. HBO’s strategy is to give early partners a pricing advantage over newer ones; it’s unclear how this will go over with Apple, which has a track record of squeezing advantageous deals out of media, including the 99-cent single more than a decade ago.

Bewkes said in December that he saw “cord-cutting” accelerate as pay TV providers dropped subscribers. U.S. pay TV providers lost 125,000 subscribers in 2014, according to Leichtman Research Group. At the same time, HBO and Cinemax reported their highest number of new subscribers (2.8 million) in 30 years.

Among the challenges HBO faces to get HBO Now launched is how to avoid confusion with HBO Go, the service that allows HBO’s cable TV subscribers to access it on the Web, smartphones and tablets. The two services will have separate log-in pages and separate apps, but some cable execs are concerned about customer confusion. The explanation might challenge even the best call center employee: HBO Go is for TV subscribers to watch their content on devices; HBO Now for those who don’t subscribe via TV."

Since unveiling the Apple Watch back in September, the Cupertino giant has been focused on teasing the device to the financial, fashion and tech press alike.

And as Mashable Chief Correspondent Lance Ulanoff helpfully outlined, we have an idea as to what we can expect to see from the event.

But this is Apple. Which means there are always rumors. The Apple Watch event is no different. Along with the main event are rumors about other things Apple could show off or reveal at its big press spectacle.

Being the consummate Apple watcher (no pun intended, truly) that I am, I figured it was time to run down the list of rumors, followed by how likely we feel each item is to show up.

The gold Apple Watch Edition will cost at least $10,000

Image: Apple

Rumor: The solid gold Apple Watch Edition will cost five figures. And up.

When Apple announced the Apple Watch last fall, the only price the company shared was that it will ""start"" at $349.

Most of us have taken that to mean that the Apple Watch Sport will be the version to debut at that price point. The Apple Watch, which has stainless steel rather than aluminum, will be next, followed by the 18 carat gold Apple Watch Edition model.

Although there are guesses about what the Apple Watch will cost (we think it'll be starting at $499), the real game has been to guess just how much Apple will sell the Apple Watch Edition for.

John Gruber at Daring Fireball initially predicted Apple would sell the Apple Watch Edition for $5,000.

He has since gone on to change his prediction, assessing that the fanciest of watches will ""start around $10,000.""

In the gadget world, a $10,000 device seems insane. You could buy a car for that (or at least a tricked-out Mac Pro and 4K display). In the watch world, however, $10,000 for a gold watch actually seems reasonable.

If Apple really is going after the luxury watch market — and not just the gadget market — the pricing could make sense.

Accuracy Rating: We'll give this an 80% accuracy rating. Gold watches are expensive and if Apple is going to try to sell to the watch aficionado crowd, it should probably be pricing its goods on-par with where they are at.

We'll also guess that counterfeit gold Apple Watch Editions will be on the streets of Chinatown in New York City within days of the announcement. They won't work with your iPhone and the gold might make your wrist green, but from afar, you can look special.

iOS 8.2

Rumor: Apple will launch iOS 8.2 alongside the Apple Watch.

This rumor seems pretty solid. The Apple Watch will need a software update and iOS 8.2, which has been seeded to developers for quite some time, will fill that void.

Interestingly, Apple is also beta testing iOS 8.3, which brings in some additional features, including new diverse emoji. This leads us to think Apple might launch iOS 8.2 before the Apple Watch officially arrives and iOS 8.3 not long after it ships.

Accuracy Rating: We're 100% confident Apple will release iOS 8.2 with or right before the Apple Watch hits stores. We're 90% certain we could see the update hit phones and tablets as early as next week.

MacBook updates

Rumor: Apple will release updated Broadwell-based MacBook Air and MacBook Pro with Retina notebooks.

It's been almost a year since Apple last updated its notebook line. The MacBook Air last got a speed bump at the end of April 2014, with the 13-inch and 15-inch MacBook Pro with Retina displays last getting updated at the end of July 2014.

Part of the reason it has taken so long for Apple to refresh its notebook line comes down to Intel, whose Broadwell mobile chipset was delayed.

Alleged screenshot evidence of new, Broadwell-based MacBook Air machines in 11-inch and 13-inch varieties appeared earlier this week, which only bolsters the idea that Apple will give the Mac a brief shout-out on Monday before going full-force on the Apple Watch.

Accuracy Rating: We think it's 90% likely that Apple will update its notebook line on Monday. That said, we expect these updates to be spec bumps only — moving to Broadwell and maybe slightly improved discrete graphics options for the 15-inch MacBook Pro with Retina.

MacBook Air Redesign

Rumor: Apple will reveal a brand new, wholly redesigned 12-inch MacBook Air.

A recent Wall Street Journal report intimated that the rumored MacBook Air redesign could ship by June.

This has led some individuals to think that the new device might share stage time with the Apple Watch at Monday's event.

The new MacBook Air will reportedly be fanless, have a retina display and a single USB-C port.

Accuracy Rating: Although we think it is highly probably that Apple will release at least one update to its general MacBook Air/MacBook Pro line, we put the likelihood of a brand-new MacBook Air redesign at 30%.

We just don't see Apple taking time to move the focus off of the Apple Watch with something as important as a new MacBook Air.

It's true that Apple has used major events to show-off Mac redesigns in the past, but this just doesn't feel right. Instead, we expect the new MacBook Air (or whatever it is called) to make its debut in June at WWDC.

New Apple TV

Rumor: Apple will finally update its Apple TV.

It's been three years since the third-generation Apple TV was released by Apple. Three years.

In that time, not only has the set-top box landscape changed, with strong competition coming not just from Roku but also from Amazon and Google via its hit Chromecast.

Moreover, the Apple TV interface is starting to feel stale. Plus the hardware could use a refresh, if only to make AirPlay mirroring even better and to bring something like Continuity and Hand-off to the Apple TV world.

But beyond the set-top box world, the OTT revolution is off and running with an increasing number of television viewers turning to over-the-top streaming services for more of their content.

Could Apple finally be prepared to release a new Apple TV along with a Sling TV-like service?

Accuracy Rating: We think there is a 15% change Apple could release an update Apple TV. Without a doubt the product needs an update, we just don't see it happening now.

iPad Pro

Rumor: Apple will release the long-rumored 12-inch iPad Pro.

Personally, I have a hard time believing Apple is even planning on releasing a 12-inch iPad. Sure, it's possible that this is a device that its partner IBM might want for the enterprise, but the truth is, tablets of that size tend to become unwieldy.

Plus, it seems like Apple releasing an iPad that is trying to be a laptop would be making the same mistake Microsoft made with the Surface and Surface 2. Microsoft finally found success with the Surface Pro 3 by selling it for what it is, a laptop that, in a pinch, could be used as a touch-screen device.

Apple has been very clear that it intends to keep iOS and OS X separate.

But even if you do believe that an iPad Pro is coming, Bloomberg and the Wall Street Journal are both saying that Apple can't ship the device until fall.

Accuracy Rating: 0%. You will not see a new iPad at the Apple Watch event. Period.

A new report from Bloomberg claims that Apple has pushed back production on the long-rumored iPad Pro due to supply issues involving the device’s display.

Don’t Miss: Apple might finally unveil a Retina MacBook Air next week

Production of the 12.9-inch-screen iPad is now scheduled to start around September because of delays involving the supply of display panels, said one of the people, who asked not to be identified because the details aren’t public. Apple had initially planned to begin making the larger version this quarter, people familiar those plans had said.

Though iPad sales are still quite healthy relative to the rest of the industry, there’s no denying that the number of tablets Apple sells each quarter has been trending downwards for some time now. To that end, many analysts viewed the rumored 12.9-inch iPad Pro as an important measure designed to inject a bit of life into stagnant iPad sales. Now, it looks like the release of such a device has been pushed back until late 2015 at the very earliest.

Though Apple can clearly whether the storm without breaking a sweat — the Apple Watch launch is coming up, after all — it’s worth noting that the iPad Pro has reportedly been subject to numerous delays over the past few months. If you recall, some reports claimed that Apple was initially hoping to release a larger screened iPad sometime in early 2015.

With an Apple special event planned for next week, it looks we’ll have to make do with the Apple Watch and a Retina MacBook Air.

This isn't the first time that rumors have hinted at delays for the iPad Pro.

Back in October, The Wall Street Journal said that Apple had opted to delay mass production on the iPad in order to focus on iPhone 6 Plus production, and in November, KGI Securities analyst Ming-Chi Kuo said production could be delayed until Q2 2015 because of difficulties related to the production of display components. With production delayed until September, the tablet could see a release in late 2015.

Apple is planning to use the ""iPad Pro,"" as the media calls it, to boost its flagging iPad sales. The tablet is expected to measure in somewhere between 12.2 and 12.9 inches, dwarfing both the 9.7-inch iPad Air 2 and the 7.9-inch iPad mini 3.

It may be targeted at the enterprise market, and rumors have suggested it could sport an ""ultra"" high-resolution display and stereo speakers at the top and bottom edges of the device for an improved audio experience.

Cook had already confirmed an April launch in the United States during a recent earnings call, so this might mean the watch will launch globally all at once, or that the United States will get it first, followed by Germany later in the month.

Apple has been getting faster about rolling out products, and credited the “fastest rollout ever” of the iPhone 6 and 6 Plus as part of its record-breaking success in Q1 2015. 9to5Mac points out that Apple is already promoting the Apple Watch in China, so we wouldn’t be surprised if the watch launches there in April too.

Cook also boasted to employees that “a whole ton of announcements are coming shortly about all of the apps,” according to 9to5Mac’s report. Starwood Hotels was specifically highlighted at the watch’s unveiling last September, and Cook also mentioned Panera Bread (an Apple Pay partner) and Salesforce.

Don’t Miss: Apple’s secret plan to maximize Apple Watch battery life

The news is sourced directly from Apple CEO Tim Cook himself who spoke to Apple store employees while on a recent visit to Apple’s flagship store in Berlin, Germany.

Speaking at the Berlin flagship Apple Store last week, Apple CEO Tim Cook told employees that the Apple Watch will not be exclusive to the United States in April, according to employees in attendance. Specifically, Cook said that the Apple Watch will launch in Germany during the month of April.

If previous iPhone and iPad launches abroad are any indication, it certainly stands to reason that the Apple Watch will be available in a number of European countries come April. Additionally, it’s worth pointing out that Apple is reportedly planning to sell select models of the Apple Watch in high-end department stores and watch boutiques in Paris.

Over the past few weeks, with the Apple Watch launch drawing closer, Apple has noticeably stepped up its advertising efforts. The company’s U.S. based advertising campaign kicked off about a week ago with model Candice Swanepoel donning the device on the March cover of SELF Magazine.

With many questions and key details about the Apple Watch remaining, all eyes will be on Apple come March 9 when the company plans to hold a special media event to discuss all things Apple Watch and, perhaps, even new products.

Specifically, Cook said that the Apple Watch will launch in Germany during the month of April. It’s possible that the Apple Watch will launch first in the United States in early April, with Germany and other countries following later in the month, but it definitely appears that the Watch’s rollout will be more aggressive than the first iPhone and iPad launches…

The iPhone was notably exclusive to the United States and AT&T for the first several months of the product’s life, while the iPad launched exclusively in the U.S. in April 2010 and was followed by launches in Europe and Australia over a month later, in mid-May of that year. Besides Germany, sources indicate that an April launch in Australia is also likely as Apple has already been training select Apple Retail employees on Apple Watch sales procedures by way of secret briefings in Sydney. The United Kingdom and France have both seen Apple Watch marketing pushes, so those countries are likely also in the April mix.

The usual first wave countries for major Apple product launches also includes Canada, where Apple is soon planning to launch the Watch-compatible Apple Pay system, but we haven’t yet confirmed if those countries will be home to the new product in April. Apple has been heavily promoting the Apple Watch in China, so perhaps the wearable will launch to the Chinese market in or around April as well. However, launches in China could be delayed due to government regulatory factors. During his trip to Germany, Cook also stopped by Chancellor Angela Merkel’s office to discuss consumer privacy and the offices of BILD to discuss Apple rumors, Steve Jobs, and the NSA.

Asked if employees will get free Apple Watches (like when full time employees got original iPhones from Steve Jobs in 2007), Cook reportedly said “you’ve given me something to think about, I agree with your point, I think it’s great, and I think everyone should use our products. It’s a good point for me to think about, I’ve got some more plane rides to think about it on.” Cook also discussed the expansion of Apple Pay into Europe, reportedly saying:

Apple Pay will be global, it’s not a U.S. program. We want it everywhere. We are working to bring it out of the US. It is going to take a little bit of time to do so. We want to be in Germany. We want to be in Europe generally this year. I don’t know if we will make it, I think we will. It’s our intention to get here as fast as we can.

We previously reported that Apple Pay will arrive in Canada as soon as March.

The reports say that the size of the display is close to the length of a few small balconies and that Apple Retail Senior Vice President Angela Ahrendts has been directing the construction of the booth at retailer Galeries Lafayette on Champs Elysees. While these claims for France are still unconfirmed, sources have told us that Apple is considering constructing dedicated Apple Watch retail stores in the future if demand deems such outlets necessary…

These dedicated stores could be stores within larger high-end retailers, similar to how Macs are sold at Best Buy, or smaller-scale Apple Stores that sit on their own to sell Apple Watches. It is unclear when these dedicated stores will debut, if ever, but Apple has already begun work on transforming its existing stores to sell the Apple Watch. Sources say that Apple is currently installing dedicated safes inside of its stores to house the pricier Apple Watch Edition models prior to sale in addition to special weight scales to determine the amount of gold in individual Apple Watch units. Stores have also begun stocking up on special cleaning wipes to clean Apple Watch store models in between hands-on demonstrations for customers.

Apple CEO Tim Cook has said that the Apple Watch will begin shipping by April.

Update: Apple is reportedly opening up another pop up shop in London Selfridges pictured below in their famous “Wonder Room” with hires being transferred from local Apple Stores to the central London location.

A section of Selfridges located near the Wonder Room was boarded up earlier this month to allow for construction of the expected Apple Watch pop-up shop, sources say.

The pop-up shop is expected to be readied in time for the Apple Watch launch in April and will likely join Galeries Lafayette as one of multiple standalone Apple Watch stores that Apple plans to open throughout Europe.

Selfridges has the second-largest retail space in the United Kingdom behind competing high-end department store Harrods.

Our sources have offered new information on the Watch’s real-world battery life, health and fitness features, apps, and experiences using Apple’s next-generation touchscreen hardware…

Power Reserve Mode and Battery Life

The Apple Watch’s battery life has concerned many prospective customers, as Apple said only that the Watch will need to be charged nightly. Earlier this year, we reported that Apple’s development targets for Apple Watch battery life were 2.5-4 hours for heavy app usage, versus 19 hours per day of combined usage between light app access, notifications, and Glances. Sources who have handled the Apple Watch tell us that Apple has improved the device’s battery life, noting that the final Apple Watch should be able to handle 5 hours of fairly heavy application usage, and it and won’t run out of battery during a typical day of mixed active and passive use. However, the source says that the device will still need to be charged nightly, as it will definitely not last through a second full day.

As The New York Times reported, Apple will address battery life concerns with a new “Power Reserve Mode” that cuts optional services to preserve as much of the Apple Watch’s core functionality as possible. Our sources have shared several new details about the feature. First, Power Reserve Mode can be activated via a Battery Glance that’s accessible at any time, or via the Apple Watch’s Settings application. The Battery Glance will show the percentage of battery life remaining, the amount of time since the last full charge, and a large button to activate Power Reserve Mode.

Power Reserve Mode can even be accessed when the Watch has a full 100% charge, and it is not solely activated when the Watch’s battery life is low. The mode noticeably dims the display, slows down communication with the iPhone to an on-demand level, and puts the display to sleep after roughly two seconds of inactivity. One unit tested allowed access to all Apple Watch functions while in Power Reserve mode, while another unit was limited to the Clock face. We’re told that some test units took between four and five hours to charge up to 100% from 0% via the wall-attached MagSafe charger. This is a notable improvement, we’re told, from fall 2014 prototypes.

Unlike the iPhone, when battery life is low on the Apple Watch, the device does not show a modal popup window indicating the battery life percentage remaining. Instead, with 20% battery life remaining, the Battery Life glance turns an orange/amber color as a subtle alert to the user. At 10%, the glance turns from orange/amber to a red color. On the iPhone side, our sources say that they did not see any “meaningful” change to the iPhone’s battery while using the Apple Watch.

Heart Rate Glance

One notable yet-to-be-announced Apple Watch feature is the Heart Rate Glance. Thanks to the device’s heart rate monitor, the Heart Rate Glance will allow the user to see their Beats Per Minute at any time. When accessing the Glance, an outline of a heart will appear, similar to the heart in the image above. After a button is tapped to start measurement, the screen will show the constantly updating BPM reading. Our sources say that the process of reading the heart rate was almost instant and the readings were “seemingly accurate.” Previously, Apple has only stated that the Heart Rate sensor will be used to send other users their heart beat via the communication features and to measure intensity for calorie reading in the fitness app. Of course, heart rate readings could be transferred to the Health application on the accompanying iPhone.

Notification Center, Glances, and Clock Faces

Our sources indicate that the following Glances are installed on the Apple Watch by default, in addition to Heart Rate and Battery Life: Fitness Stats, Activity, Clock, Weather, Music, Quick Settings, Calendar and Maps. As discussed on one of our recent Happy Hour podcasts, sources also indicate that the Apple Watch will have a full Notification Center like the iPhone, iPad, iPod touch, and Mac. To access Notification Center, a user can swipe down from the top of the display in any screen. The list of notifications will show each app name as well as truncated descriptions of the alerts, akin to an iPhone. Developers will be able to customize which notifications can show up in Notification Center as well as the Apple Watch app icon specific to this view. As for Clock Faces a source says that “the level of detail and customization is insane.” The source also called the quality of faces “incredible,” and said “each face is like an app in itself so it’s [a little curious] is not (yet) allowing third-party faces.” The source also said that the “astronomy Watch Face is smart: in one mode you can use the crown to scroll through time and see planetary alignments for the whole solar system.”

Onboard Storage and Music

As Apple has announced, the Apple Watch will be able to store music that can be played while unlinked to an iPhone. Prototype Apple Watches within Apple are said to include 8GB of storage; it is yet to be seen whether the shipping versions will all include 8GB. As we noted yesterday, the internal units also include Lightning connectors, which won’t be on the shipping models. Users will be able to specify individual songs, albums, and playlists to be loaded to their Apple Watches via a panel in the Companion app for iPhone. Users will also be able to stream music from the Apple Watch to external speakers or headphones over Bluetooth.

iPhone Companion App

As we extensively reported earlier this year, the settings for individual Apple Watch applications will be controlled by a Companion application on the iPhone. The Companion app has a dark black user interface with a glyph of the Apple Watch as the app icon. In addition to controlling various settings and music storage, the Companion app allows users to re-arrange the icons on the Apple Watch’s Home screen. This can be done from the Watch itself as well via a long press, just like on the iPhone and iPad. When a user downloads an iPhone application from the App Store with a WatchKit component, the Watch app is automatically installed on the Watch. Users can remove the WatchKit applications through the Companion app without deleting the app from the iPhone. Interestingly, if the iPhone is not connected to the Watch, third-party application icons will remain on the device’s Home screen, and the applications will still work for a period of time with cached data.

Force Touch, Digital Crown + Voice Control

Sources have praised the Watch’s next-generation force-sensing touchscreen interface, saying that “the screen feels like a giant button than you just want to press in the manner needed for Force Touch.” A source added that the feature “feels natural” on the small screen. Also, the Digital Crown input device is required to use the Apple Watch, as the Watch differs from the sixth-generation iPod nano in lacking pinch to zoom capabilities: it registers touches and movements up, down, left, and right. There is no keyboard at all on the device; all forms of input are handled with pre-populated options and voice dictation. Speaking of dictation, the menus within the Apple Watch label all voice control features as “Voice Control,” rather than as Siri. As we reported earlier, this initial version of the Watch OS does not support replying to emails, even by voice. Users will need to access the Mail app via Handoff on their iPhone to conduct replies.

Speed, Display, and Bands

People who have used the Apple Watch say that the device feels very fast overall, which is in line with our report that the S1 chip is comparable with the current iPod touch’s A5 chip. But there are limits. One source said that an Apple Watch with over 200 WatchKit applications became noticeably sluggish on the Home screen. It is unlikely that the majority of users will ever install 200 WatchKit applications, so this should not be a typical concern. The sources say that the display will light up when the iPhone is locked for all of the phone’s notifications, but if the iPhone is unlocked, the Watch will not light up for new alerts.

A designer familiar with the quality of mobile device screens who has used the Apple Watch says that the “screen is the best [smartwatch] screen I have ever seen,” noting that “it’s like vibrant digital paper, and does not look rendered,” with especially “great” black levels. The source thinks that the smaller, 38mm version is “tiny,” but of course this will differ between users of different sizes. Apple’s Sport Band, the default on the $349 aluminum Apple Watch, is said to “take time” to get used to as it is somewhat difficult to put on at first due to the pin-based closure system. As for the stainless steel link bracelet, a source says that “Apple have seemingly got around [hair getting stuck between links] by having the case expand the links flexibility from the outer rim only.”

Powering Off, Force Quitting and Settings

Some users have wondered how the Apple Watch will be powered off without a dedicated power button. Our sources say that it’s turned off by long pressing the large “communication button” on the right side of the Watch. When this is pressed, a confirmation slider akin to the iPhone, iPad, and iPod touch is shown, letting a swipe finish the shut down. Users can also Force Quit an unstable application by accessing the shut down screen and then quickly pressing the button on the right side. The Apple Watch also includes a Settings application that includes various toggles including Bluetooth and Airplane Mode. There is not a dedicated Wi-Fi settings panel, which instead will likely be controlled by the accompanying iPhone.

Apple will officially announce Apple Watch pricing and availability on Monday, March 9, starting at 10:00AM Pacific/1:00PM Eastern Time. 9to5Mac will offer coverage of the event in the hours leading up the keynote, during the presentation, and afterwards, so please join us for more news and commentary then.

It was long-awaited, and at first glance, well-received. So what is it that we've exactly been waiting for all this time? Is this the one smartwatch to rule them all or just another in a long line of ""meh?""

Apple's been able to spin gold from perceived failure before, even the iPad had its doubters, and they're back this time too. And maybe for good reason. We've learned a lot more about Apple's first wearables since its announcement months ago. This is what we know about what we'll be getting.

The Apple Watch will try to replace your credit cards.

Of course, Apple Watch will come NFC-equipped to support the new e-payments system, Apple Pay. But it will work a little bit differently here than on your iPhone 6/6 Plus. Essentially, you'll use a passcode to authorize Apple Pay and then you'll stay logged in as long as the watch remains in contact with your skin.

Also, the Apple Watch will allow Apple 5, 5C, and 5S users to finally get on the Apple Pay wagon, which is great for them and for Apple.

The Apple Watch's will track health and fitness about as well as anything else.

When it came to health and fitness, the Apple Watch wanted to be so much more, according to The Wall Street Journal. It was supposed to be a state-of-the-art tracker, one with a built-in EKG and other sensors that would measure stress (much like the new Jawbone Up3). But all those sensors kind of suck and didn't really span well across different types of wrists.

So instead, the Apple Watch is stuck with the classics—an accelerometer, gyroscope, and HR monitor (which have also been dinged for inaccuracy in general). The Apple Watch's Activity and Workout apps will track you throughout your typical calorie-counting, step-making, workout-doing day, you know, like every other fitness watch out there. If you want more specifics on what the watch will track, the Apple Watch companion app leak posted by 9to5Mac is a good place to start:

Some of the more interesting applications in health and fitness will most likely come from third-party developers like DexCom, who are developing an embeddable chip that will pump out glucose readings for diabetics. But in this scenario, the Apple Watch is merely a display for the information, and other smartwatches, most notably the Pebble Watch, can already do this kind of thing.

The Apple Watch might replace your car keys.

Speaking with The Telegraph, Cook said that he also wanted the Apple Watch to unlock your car and replace those annoyingly big key fobs. Of course, there's a huge gulf between ""want"" and ""will"" but the idea is kind of cool. Only one major problem—dat battery. I hope you don't mind getting stranded when your watch runs out of juice. And if you need to have a backup key in your pocket, what's the point?

The Apple Watch might replace your (Apple TV) remote.

In another pimping session with Bloomberg Businessweek, Apple CEO Too Many Cook(s) ever-so-off-handedly mentioned that he loved controlling his Apple TV with the Apple Watch.

The Apple Watch can join you in the shower.

Cook also says he wears his Apple Watch in the shower. This doesn't match up with what Yahoo's David Pogue said way back in September after the big announcement. So still a bit of a question mark, but you'd think Cook would know.

The Apple Watch will not solve the smartwatch battery problem.

You could say Apple's philosophy is ""better right than first"" and perhaps the biggest smartwatch failing that needs to be righted is battery life. A lot of smartwatches—specifically Android Wear—can't boast more than a day and a half of life, or two at best. The disappointment began with the Moto 360 and pretty much continued from there. Charging every night is almost inevitable.

Advertisement

The Apple Watch, it seems, won't be much better. In late January, 9to5Mac reported some dismally bad battery results for the Apple Watch: 2.5 hours of ""heavy use,"" 3.5 hours of standard app use, and a goal of 19 hours of mixed use (and even that might be a stretch for the first generation). That is definitely not solving the battery problem. Not to mention Tim Cook himself said he needs to charge it every night.

Apple seems to recognize the issue and is preparing a lot of workarounds. The Apple Watch will use a MagSafe wireless charger, so you don't have to mess around with a cradle or hunt for a lightning port. Apple is also developing a ""Power Reserve"" mode—basically ""just a watch"" mode—so you can get the most juice out of your watch. This will be the first power-saving feature on any iDevice.

The Apple Watch will probably have a shit ton of apps.

A rumor was circulating last month that the Apple Watch would launch with 100,000 apps. That seems....ludicrously hopeful. Cult of Mac points out that it took iOS near 16 months to reach 100,000 apps. So we'll see if something relatively iffy and new like a watch can manage to launch with a cool 100k. But even if that number is a few thousand (or tens of thousands) shy of the truth, the Apple Watch won't feel empty at launch by any means.

At a company briefing in Germany, Cook Master Flex said ""tons"" of apps will soon be announced for the Apple Watch, alongside previously announced partners like Panera, Tesla, and Todoist and many others. In fact, apps will very likely be the center of discussion during Apple's upcoming ""Spring Forward"" event a week from now.

The Apple Watch will be about as powerful as an iPod Touch.

It's not a huge deal for a watch but let's just touch on specs briefly. The Apple Watch will have an S1 processor, which as Mark Gurman of 9to5Mac notes, offers essentially the same performance as an iPod Touch. But because it's a custom chip made just for the Apple Watch, it's possible the watch will perform a little bit better than most Android Wear watches that generally use off-the-shelf Snapdragon 400s. But not exactly an iPhone on your wrist by any means.

Advertisement

The Apple Watch will come in all kinds of styles, with all kinds of prices.

Right now, the price for Apple's first foray into wearables is $350 for the base model, the Sport. The stainless steel Apple Watch will be around $500 and then there's that 18k gold one that will be lots of $$$. The original figure was $4000, but that's jumped up to $8,000, so probably somewhere in there. Not like you really need to know.

The Apple Watch is also rumored to also be available in international markets at launch. After all, Apple ordered 3-5 million watches for the first batch.

The Apple Watch is the most buzzed about wearable to hit the market in a long time, and not all of the buzz is good. We’ve shared some of th earlier rumblings about the Apple Watch’s short battery life. Now we are hearing news of a new feature called Power Reserve, which could be a battery-saving mode that lets the Apple Watch run on low energy while only displaying the time.

The Apple Watch’s battery life is expected to only last a day. This puts it at the bottom of the pack for iOS smartwatches. Even with a Power Reserve function, the battery is significantly lagging behind the Pebble Time‘s seven day battery life. Even before wearables came on the scene, not everyone is diligent about plugging in their smartphones overnight. One of the most frustrating things in the world is a dead battery when you need to check your email, text, or actually make a call.

If the expected battery life is only one day, then we must consider what happens with higher than average usage. Imagine if dynamic and draining apps are engaged, then the battery has the possibility of lasting only until midday. This means that the user will have to take his watch off to charge it.The allure of a wearable is its instant notifications while your phone is tucked away in your pocket. If the Apple Watch isn’t on your wrist, will you be drawn to look at the notifications?

Can the new consumers get used to plugging in every night? The Power Reserve feature sounds like it may revert the smartwatch back to an ordinary time piece to save battery life. It’s still better than a running out of juice. Without a charge, a dead Apple Watch isn’t even a watch. It’s just an expensive bracelet. Perhaps the short battery life will be overshadowed by the army of apps and developers Apple has at its disposal. We’ll let you know all the emerging details leading up to Apple’s big event on March 9th, 2015.

Among the interesting details is the existence of an unannounced ""Power Reserve"" mode for the watch that will display only the time and cut off all other functions as the battery begins to run critically low, preserving the most basic functionality of the watch. The report also notes that while the Apple Watch has been widely tested by Apple employees, the company did work to conceal many of those prototypes by disguising them to resemble Samsung smartwatches.

Sources have also provided more context to a Wall Street Journal article from last month that discussed how many of the originally planned health features for Apple Watch were dropped due to consistency issues. According to The New York Times' sources, the decision to drop many of those features came more than 18 months ago, refuting off-target reports in recent weeks claiming the cuts have come at the last minute.

Nearly two years ago, the company experimented with advanced health monitoring sensors that tracked blood pressure and stress, among other variables. Many of those experiments were abandoned more than 18 months ago after the sensors proved unreliable and cumbersome, these people said. Apple long ago decided that for the first version of the product, it would include a heart rate sensor and a sensor for tracking movement, to market the device as a fitness-tracking companion to the iPhone.

Previous reports have indicated Apple is still working on those technologies, and they could appear in future versions of the Apple Watch.

Today's report reveals some additional insight into the development process, noting that the Apple Watch is coming a bit later than originally hoped due to technical challenges that were likely exacerbated by the loss of several engineers working on the project. Google's Nest Labs, headed by iPod pioneer Tony Fadell, was responsible for poaching several of the key Apple Watch employees.

Apple's media event will take place at 10:00 AM Pacific Time on Monday, March 9 at the Yerba Buena Center for the Arts in San Francisco.

Apple critics have always roasted the company for selling products that are more expensive than they should be, and they frequently use this as a wedge topic to criticize buyers. But the “18-karat gold” Apple Watch Edition will set a whole new bar with a sales price of $10,000. The funny thing in this case is that Apple is perfectly right to be charging that much!

Do you disagree? Check out my counterpoint, “The Case Against the $10,000 Gold Apple Watch Edition“

Gold is Expensive

Let’s start with a little backgrounder in gold. Everyone has a vague sense that gold is expensive. Even rabid Internet trolls have seen the banner ads and heard about that in the news. But most people don’t understand just how expensive even a little bit of gold is. So this is a good place to begin the discussion.

Update: My calculations were wrong! Also, this was a bit “back of the envelope.” Now that it has some readership I realize I should go back and fix the calculations in the article to be more realistic…

Here are the basic facts:

Gold currently sells for between $1,200 and $1,300 per troy ounce and has been over $1,000 per troy ounce for the last five years. 18-karat gold contains 75% pure gold, and that term is regulated by law. One ounce of 18k gold occupies about 1.8 cubic centimeters of volume since a typical 18-karat gold alloy weighs about 16.5 grams per cc. 18-karat gold currently sells for $29.11 per gram, $905 per troy ounce, or $480 per cc.

.25 cc of 18k gold is about enough to construct a watch buckle and .75 cc gets you a deployant clasp. It takes a few more to build a watch case, anywhere from 1.5 to 8 cc depending on the size and thickness of the case. So the buckle is worth $120-$360 and the watch case $720 to $3800 just as raw gold. This is why gold watches generally sell for a lot more than $6,000!

Gold Watches are Expensive

Let’s apply this to a watch case. Imagine you wanted to create a rectangular case 42 mm high by 36 mm wide by 10 mm deep. If it was solid, this would equal 15.12 cc of volume. But it’s a watch case, so you have to leave room for the movement, dial, case back, etc. So let’s just leave 5 mm of thickness all around, making a hollow rectangle. This equals 6.8 cc (42 x 36 x 10 – 32 x 26 x 10). Therefore, the raw gold to make just the case of this hypothetical watch would cost $3,200 as of this writing.

Now let’s consider the same shape but just 2 mm thick. That’s 2.9 cc of gold, worth $1,400. Pick your thickness and you’re still looking at thousands of dollars worth of gold.

How does this translate in the real world? Let’s look at the retail price of some watches that are available in both stainless steel and 18-karat gold.

The Cartier Tank MC measures 44 mm by 34 mm by 9.5 mm thick: $15,000 extra (list) for 18k gold Cartier Tank MC in stainless steel: $7,000 list, $5,800 street Cartier Tank MC in 18k pink gold: $22,000 list, $18,200 street The Jaeger-LeCoultre Reverso Squadra Hometime measures 50.5 mm by 34.9 mm by 14 mm thick: $14,750 extra (list) for 18k gold Jaeger-LeCoultre Reverso Squadra Hometime in stainless steel: $8,550 list, $6,800 street Jaeger-LeCoultre Reverso Squadra Hometime in 18k pink gold: $23,300 list, $18,400 street

This list could go on and on, but the gist is simple: 18-karat gold cases cost a lot more than stainless steel. In fact, it’s pretty much impossible to find a gold watch for under $10,000 in any size and from any manufacturer. Even tiny quartz ladies watches like the tiny Chopard Happy Sport Mini sells for $11,000! Most of the bargains commenters have pointed to are either 14-karat or less, very slim and small, or long out of production and with outdated pricing.

Then there’s the bracelet. Swap a gold bracelet for a leather strap and you are looking at an extra $20,000. Adding a gold bracelet to that Jaeger-LeCoultre bumps the price to $42,900!

Certainly there is quite a bit of profit in luxury watches, but one simply cannot deny the raw material value in a gold watch case. And the gold market is liquid like stocks and other commodities: There are plenty of buyers and sellers of gold, and plenty of reserves, so no company, no matter how strong, can expect favorable pricing from their suppliers.

Another reason companies charge so much for gold watches and jewelry is as a hedge against volatility. They can’t price near the commodity price because they have to set a price and stick to it all year long. So they generally price somewhat higher than they would, even taking into consideration all the rest of the materials, labor, distribution, and profit in a watch.

The Apple Watch Edition Will Cost $10,000

There’s a reason I picked those two watches for my comparisons: Both are similar in size and shape to the 42 mm Apple Watch. The Cartier is a little smaller and the Jaeger-LeCoultre is a little larger, but both represent a traditional watchmaker’s gold-cased square-ish offering in the space. And both cost more than $20,000, with much of that price going to the gold case and matching buckle. And Jony Ive recently said that the historic Cartier Tank was one of his inspirations for the Apple Watch design!

Apple would be crazy to sell the Apple Watch Edition for $20,000, though. That’s not going to happen. So they’re likely to find ways to reduce the cost dramatically.

First, as we can see, the Apple Watch case is highly rounded in all three dimensions. Although questionable from an esthetic standpoint, this reduces the amount of material required by quite a lot. Second, Apple Watch has a large sapphire crystal front and back with the display, sensors, and such. Third, the interior frame is likely made of steel or aluminum, not gold, to reduce cost and increase commonality with the aluminum and steel versions.

Could it be gold plated? No. Numerous reports state that it is a solid gold case. Although Apple has not apparently used the word, “solid” in their press releases, they do claim it is “crafted from 18-karat gold” and nowhere does it say it is plated or “gold filled” (the industry term). There are laws covering descriptions of metal content for jewelry and Apple cannot break these any more than Tiffany could.

Apple says that the Apple Watch will start at $349 for that aluminum Sport model, and many bloggers have reported the price for the steel Apple Watch to be roughly $1,000. It is reasonable to assume that the gold Edition model will sell for substantially more than this, with many suggesting $4,000 or $5,000. But remember that this price would only cover 4 or 5 ounces of gold! Even with thin walls and a steel frame, it’s hard to see how Apple could make a solid 18-karat gold case and buckle for a 42 mm watch with just 3 ounces of gold.

Gold is soft, but Apple claims that their special gold is twice as hard as “standard gold”. Taking that at face value, perhaps they reduced the thickness of the case commensurately, cutting the amount of gold in half versus a standard rectangular watch. This still leaves a few thousand dollars of material value in the case. The Apple Watch Edition will come in 38 mm and 42 mm sizes, a difference of about 20% in terms of case volume. So the smaller model could sell for 20% less still.

My prediction is that the 42 mm Apple Watch Edition will retail for $9,999 with the 38 mm Apple Watch Edition retailing for $7,999. This covers the cost of the gold case, the internals, manufacturing, sales, and profit, and yet does not leave Apple subsidizing the world gold market by selling at a discount or cheating with a too-thin or plated case. I will be shocked if the price is $4,999, but I suppose it’s possible with some finagling and if that’s the smaller model. And it will not be any less than that.

Bonus prediction: Given the very high price of the Apple Watch Edition, I predict that availability will be quite limited. Apple will likely create special store-within-a-store spaces in certain Apple Store locations for the Edition. I further expect them to open special standalone Apple Edition Boutiques to sell the Watch Edition, accessories, and perhaps other future high-end products.

Update!

Needless to say, many people disagree with me. And now that @Gruber Fireballed this post, I imagine I’ll hear from lots of them real soon!

The gist of the disagreement lies in the amount of gold needed for the watch case. I assumed it would be quite thick (read sturdy) and would contain upwards of 130 grams of 18k gold. Then there’s the strap lugs and buckle which would likely contain another few dozen grams. But @GAK_PDX (and others, though he was most visually eloquent) suspects it contains much less gold.

For fun, I took my Apple Watch models and used SW and some basic assumptions to figure the gold content. 29.16g: pic.twitter.com/WGEnjtj1Yh — Greg Koenig (@gak_pdx) February 19, 2015

I think this number is way too low, but it’s a good lower bound if the case was very thin and completely hollow. And it puts the raw gold at about $849 at $29.11 per gram of 18k gold. Although this is admittedly much, much lower than my estimate, it still illustrates my point that the Apple Watch Edition is not going to be cheap. And I think he’s way off but time will tell who is right and who is wrong.

Another argument is based on this 2006 analysis of a gold Rolex watch. Right off the bat one should point out that gold cost $400/oz when it was written and that watch includes a gold bracelet as well, something Apple is apparently not going to do with the Edition. That Rolex case contained 18.5 grams of gold alloy, but it’s much, much smaller than the Apple watch and it’s circular to boot! A 34mm circle is 107mm in circumference, while the 42mm Apple Watch is 156mm in circumference. Use the magic of math to scale the Rolex up into a 42mm rectangle and we’re at 27.75 grams. But that case is also much thinner since we excluded the bezel, and the Apple Watch is pretty slab-sided. So we can probably double this safely and come out with $1,615 of gold in my mangled square Rolex case.

So there are lower estimates than mine for the amount and value of the gold. I can accept that. But let’s take a step back and think about the final price. Even if it contained less than $1,500 of gold, how much would it sell for? Certainly not $2,000 or $3,000. You still have to account for the cost of everything else, plus the intangibles of manufacturing and distribution. And profit for Apple (and a hedge against the volatility of the price of gold). So we’re back at the $4,000-$5,000 estimate others have made. As Greg Koenig tweeted, and Forbes reported, “If anyone thinks Apple is charging less than $5k for the Edition, they are smoking crack.”

Regardless of the total, it’s important to realize that the price of gold is in the driver’s seat when it comes to pricing the Apple Watch Edition.

I’d love to be wrong, and I look forward to updating this piece. Thanks for reading!

It’s entirely possible for them to put together a gold-cased Apple Watch for a much-lower price point, but I’m much more interested in the reasons why: Apple’s manufacturing and retail empire would be seriously disrupted by a $10,000 lump of gold!

How To Make A Gold Watch For Under $10,000

In my last post, I pointed out (hyperbolically) that there are no gold watches available for less than $10,000. This isn’t really true – there are a few small gold-cased watches available below that mark. But comparing these to an Apple watch is (if you pardon the pun), a case of “apples and oranges”: They’re much smaller; they’re round; and they’re not Apple Watches!

This last point is critical: We have no idea how the case of an Apple Watch is constructed. And, more importantly, the components, manufacturing, and sales process is entirely different from a Swiss mechanical wristwatch. My point was simply that Apple’s Watch Edition case looks like a big chunk of gold and that’s an expensive thing, likely pushing the total cost all the way to $10,000 if my assumptions are correct.

But let’s say Apple didn’t want to build, stock, and sell a $10,000 watch but still wanted it to be “crafted from 18-karat gold.” How would they do it?

Our first argument against the $10k solid gold watch is commonality of design and certification. Apple has never (to my knowledge) delivered a device with different models constructed of different materials. Electronics aren’t like watches. They are mass-produced and must be certified for electromagnetic (“RF”) interference. Apple says they’ll deliver Watches in aluminum, steel, and gold, but it would be much easier of all three had an identical internal design and only varied when it comes to the outer skin. (Counterpoint: Commonality inside doesn’t necessarily mean cheap outside.)

This would also make the final product much cheaper, since the “gold case” could be extremely thin and not structural. Note that nowhere does Apple use the term, “solid gold case”, to describe the Watch Edition. I’m no lawyer, but their “crafted from 18-karat gold” boast could be weasel words to describe a conventional Watch wrapped in a thin gold skin.

The lugs and bars (that’s the watch insider term for “the things that the strap attaches to”) as well as the strap buckle could simply be gold plated or even gold colored. This is important because even these seemingly-small pieces would cost hundreds of dollars if they are solid 18-karat gold. That’s how expensive gold is.

One big clue could be the missing gold bracelet. It’s pretty glaring that the steel Apple Watch has two metal bracelets while the gold one only has leather and rubber. A gold watch bracelet has much more gold in it than the watch case itself, so the missing bracelet could be a clue that Apple is trying to keep the price in check. And the mere availability of the rubber strap which, as John Gruber notes, is the same as on the cheapest cheapie in the whole lineup could be another tell. Rubber bracelets are sometimes found on expensive dive watches, but this is no X Fathoms… (Counterpoint: They could add the gold bracelet later as an accessory.)

Combine these clues and we could be looking at a much cheaper watch. It’s still inconceivable to imagine prices less than $1,000, but Apple could definitely finagle a $2,000 Apple Watch Edition. It’s more likely that the Edition would retail over $4,000, but this is a far cry from my earlier assertion that it would cost $10,000!

Why Apple Wouldn’t Want A $10,000 Watch

It’s entirely possible for the “gold” Apple Watch Edition to be way under $10,000, but a more important question is why would Apple do this. After all, those making the decisions are very familiar with the luxury watch market and the incredible prices that gold watches command at retail. Why wouldn’t they want to “pull a Vertu” and cash in if customers are willing to buy?

Let’s return to the cost of gold. Although Apple has produced $10,000 products in the past and currently stocks some pretty expensive devices in the stores, a gold watch is an entirely different animal. Gold is much more fungible than anything else Apple sells, so security is a much more critical issue. Remember the smash-and-grab iPhone heists? How about that pallet of stolen iPhones? Now imagine if those thieves could melt the case down and have an untraceable $4,000 lump of gold instead of some hot electronics.

The high price of gold affects every aspect of my purported solid gold Apple Watch. Where would Apple manufacture a $10,000 watch? Even that little buckle would be worth more than a month’s pay for a Foxconn assembly line worker. And the level of finish required to compete with Swiss watches is not yet possible at scale in China. (Counterpoint: Apple could build the solid gold Watch Edition in Texas alongside the Mac Pro.)

Then there’s shipment and warehousing. Although it is extremely unlikely that Apple would manufacture and ship the millions of gold Watches some analysts suggest, even more modest shipments would be immensely valuable. Securing these shipments from factory to warehouse to freight to warehouse to store will be a real challenge. Apple currently packs as many as 1.5 million iPhones into a single 747, but they couldn’t ship $15 billion worth of Watch Editions this way! Every point of collection and shipping would instantly be a ripe target for criminals. (Counterpoint: Apple already deals with armored cars, security systems, and locked vaults.)

Even the stores themselves would need to be reconfigured. Is Apple ready to add armed guards, armored display cases, and time-lock vaults to their stores? Certainly the smaller stores don’t have space for a private room or boutique for Watch Edition buyers. (Counterpoint: We know they are working on a major redesign of the retail stores already.)

And what about payment? Luxury watch buyers typically pay using wire transfers, not credit cards. Apple must prepare to process five-figure credit card transactions and accept wires. Are they ready to accept the hassle of validating buyers and payments of this size?

Apple also has to worry about what a “1%” product like a $10,000 Apple Watch Edition would say about the company and its buyers. As Adam Fields notes on Medium, Apple will have to abandon their historic focus on “accessible luxury” and fully embrace their new role as a vendor of conspicuous luxury. Already frequently criticized as a maker of status symbols, this would be a lightning rod for Apple: If the gold Watch Edition sells for $10,000, it could spike Apple’s broader reputation and turn away customers rather than attract them.

It seems smart for Apple to skimp on the gold and bring the cost of the Apple Watch Edition to under $4,000. They would still have issues with production, shipping, and security but these would be reduced since they would no longer be dealing with four-figure lumps of fungible bullion.

Yet even at that price the stores will need reconfiguration and the pundits will hurl jokes about the rich. If the company is going to suffer to bring out a gold Apple Watch Edition anyway, why not embrace the change and go solid gold?

That’s why I’m sticking to my original predictions:

The starting prices will be $7,999 and $9,999

The Apple Watch Edition will have a solid gold case weighing more than 5 ounces

If sales go well, Apple will later offer a gold Edition bracelet at $9,999 as an accessory

The Apple Watch Edition will be offered through certain high-end third-party fashion boutiques and retailers

Some larger Apple Stores will add a private “Edition Boutique” (but not all)

A whole line of expensive and exclusive Edition products will appear

The Edition line will not be available from the online store or by mail

Among those things that Apple failed to mention was whether or not Cupertino’s new smartwatch will be able to withstand liquids — making it suitable for, say, swimming or washing the dishes.

While we still don’t have a final, definitive answer on what is and is not advisable with the Apple Watch, Tim Cook shed a bit of light on the mystery during a Q&A session with staff at the Kurfürstendamm Apple Store in Berlin, Germany, where he is currently visiting. Cook said that that he wears his Apple Watch “even in the shower.”

This is in contrast with what we had previously heard, courtesy of tech journalist David Pogue, who after a private briefing with Apple advised readers that, “Sweating [while wearing the Apple Watch], wearing it in the rain, washing your hands, or cooking with it is fine. Take it off before the swim or get in the shower, though.”

As much as we respect Pogue, you’d have to say that — when it comes to Apple advice — Cook trumps Pogue!

The Apple CEO also answered a few other questions in what sounds like an interesting session. Among them was a bit more clarification on the Apple Watch’s battery life, with Cook saying he removes the device to recharge overnight — something we’ve suspected based on previous reports.

Cook talked about some of the possible applications of the Apple Watch, including monitoring auctions on eBay — or else accessing hotel rooms in a way similar to existing apps for the iPhone.

Answering a question from a visually impaired employee, he said that the Apple Watch will have more accessibility features added over time, although it sounds like these features will be limited at first.

No price tariff was given for the device, but Cook confirmed that Apple will begin marketing the device in April. In what sounds like an amusing moment, Cook sidestepped the question of whether retail staff could have all have an Apple Watch to more easily show customers, by saying that it is a “good idea” and that he would “consider it.”

Cook also spoke about his efforts to improve working conditions in China, and lamented the fact that the media often choose to paint Apple in a bad light in this regard. Cook said that Apple is trying to ensure that there is no abuse of employees on the supply chain, and that they work fairer numbers of hours.

Finally, he addressed the reports that Apple Pay could be available in Europe soon by saying that Apple aimed for this to be the case “before the end of the year.”

And it's been a big hit. The Apple Watch Series 2 has shifted in numbers since its launch in 2016, and leads the field as one of the best smartwatches money can buy.

With the Series 2, Apple shifted focus to fitness, by adding GPS to track runs and cycling session sans iPhone. It's fully waterproof and offers swim tracking in the pool and in open water. Apple even introduced the Breathe app to help you relax. The intentions are clear: Apple is making a big play for sports watch owners.

Wareable verdict: Apple Watch Series 3 review



But it's not ignoring those who'd prefer to steer clear of a gym. With watchOS 3, Apple is looking to right the software wrongs of its predecessor, improving the way you interact with the Series 2 on a daily basis, offering better third-party app support and more. But there's more to come with watchOS 4, and you can read below about how that will change the Series 2 experience.

Here's our full verdict of the Apple Watch series 2, which has been updated since our initial test with some long-term thoughts.

Apple Watch Series 2: Design

So what's changed with the Apple Watch? Well, visually, nothing. The Apple Watch continues to be the most divisive smartwatch around. For many it's an abhorrent square wrist-computer, devoid of any style. To others it's sleek, opulent and classy. For our money, it's a great-looking device and feels as premium as it costs– especially in stainless steel paired with a leather or metal strap. In short, it's now a sports watch that doesn't look like a sports watch.



For many, the primary purpose of a watch is to make a statement. The Apple Watch is one of the few smartwatches that's capable of doing that.

Jog on: The best Apple Watch running apps



While there are some nuanced differences, you'd pretty much have to put the Apple Watch Series 1 and 2 side-by-side to notice the difference. It's very slightly thicker than the original, which is just about noticeable on the 42mm version, less so on the 38mm. (If we're being truly picky, we'd like to see it back to the original slim profile on v3.)

Everything else is business as usual. It's seriously light and comfortable - no mean feat - so you won't get arm ache as you might with a bulkier rival. In fact, it's one of the only real options for women who don't want an oversized watch on their wrist.

The crown and button still reside in the same place (although the role of the button has changed for the better in watchOS3) and the fitting for Apple Watch straps hasn't changed, which will be music to the ears of those who forked out for third-party bands and like how fast it is to swap them in and out.

It's still available in aluminium or stainless steel editions, plus of course the new ceramic version. There are new strap choices as well, including the woven nylon – in short, there's even more choice but it's the same, essential, iconic look.

Of course, the big change is waterproofing. Apple has steeled the Watch Series 2 against 5ATM of water pressure, which works out to about 50 metres. The most impressive thing is achieving that without changing the design, and that's no mean feat. Remember how Jawbone totally screwed up the UP3 because it couldn't waterproof it?

The screen has also changed, and is now twice as bright as the Series 1 at 1,000 nits. The difference is certainly apparent here though many will miss the change, given that the Watch defaults to 66% brightness, presumably for battery longevity reasons. Ramp it up and it's pretty dazzling – and still the best display of any smartwatch on the market.

Apple Watch Series 2: Features

At the heart of Series 2 are the very same features that we've become accustomed to with the first Watch. You can still use this as a watch first and foremost, changing watch faces (including new Activity-focused faces) from the Watch itself or in the companion iPhone app. You can customise with Complications (small widgets) making it easier to get to your favourite apps from the main watch screen. From that perspective, it's a fine watch replacement. It's not an always-on display, but a quick raise of the arm will show you everything you need in a flash.



Essential reading: Best Apple Watch apps

That app bubble home screen remains, unlocked by a press on the digital crown, that still feels a little fiddly to select and launch apps compared to the improvements elsewhere. Notifications are still very much part of proceedings as well, flashing up native and third-party apps (Facebook, Twitter, WhatsApp etc) on the watch so you don't have to dip into your pocket to retrieve your phone.

As a core smartwatch feature, it didn't work fantastically on the original but it's so much better on Series 2. Notifications appear with no issues letting you read, dismiss or deal with them as you see fit. It still struggles slightly when it has to deal with multiple notifications from the same app in a short space of time, but on the whole Apple has handled this side of things a whole lot better.



Speaking of notifications takes us nicely into communicating - that is, how you can respond to contacts, other Apple Watch/Series 2 owners or social media updates without getting out your phone. You can still make calls and use Siri, but we've found that Apple has addressed the issue for those who don't want to speak into their watch to respond to people. The way you find out those notifications are coming through are usually from a pretty audible ping or a gentle buzz from Apple's taptic engine. It's impossible to miss when someone is getting in touch, and if you value needing to know that information as soon as it comes through, the Series 2 delivers.



In the native Apple Messages app, you can still use voice to dictate responses and pick from a preloaded responses (Thanks, call you back, etc). You can easily throw emojis into the conversation and now you can also use a new Scribble feature. This lets you draw out letters individually with your fingers to type out messages. The accuracy is surprisingly good as well. Sometimes you need to draw quickly for it to register, but it's a great addition, and you can also use it within Google Hangout conversations. And of course we shouldn't forget about Digital Touch. You can still send drawings, but it's no longer done from the Friends section (more on that shortly).

Apple Watch Series 2: WatchOS 3 and 4

Away from the added fitness-centric features, a lot of what is good about Series 2 is down to the introduction of watchOS 3. Apple has kept its promise to make continual and regular improvements through its watchOS updates and has done so since the first Apple Watch launched.

In its latest iteration, a whole host of new features and improvements have been made. Some of these aim to change the way users will interact with Series 2, and others like the new Breathe feature try to extend the appeal of the Apple smartwatch.

It's worth noting that you can also still add music to your Apple Watch - say for a run using the GPS - via the Music app. There's about 2GB available for it, but you need to create a playlist in iTunes on your phone first.



Thanks to the internal processor upgrade, performance speed on the Series 2 has been given a bump. But it's the new ways of navigating the watch which are most welcome. The dock of recently used apps - activated by pressing the button under the crown - is a much needed addition, if you have found watchOS confusing in the past, as are the more customisable watch faces.

Apple's also since added Theater mode, which keeps the display asleep when you don't want it lighting up (but the haptic feedback will still alert you to notifications) and SiriKit, which will let developers build Siri into their Watch apps.

It's a better experience overall and we now get along with our Apple Watch like we never have before, but it's getting even better in watchOS 4.

watchOS 4

Apple announced watchOS 4 at WWDC, and it will be rolling out this September alongside the Apple Watch Series 3. It's not a massive change, but the experience is more refined, while updates to the fitness features will make a lot of people happy.

First of all, there are some changes to navigation, including a new scrollable dock that makes more sense with the crown, while you can also do the same for the honeycomb grid of apps. A press of force touch and you can change that to a scrollable list, too.

Hands on: watchOS 4 review



With the new software, Apple is bringing in some new watch faces, the best of which is undoubtedly the Siri face. This serves up information about your day - upcoming calendar events, weather updates, traffic alerts - along with some other information it thinks you'll like, such as news stories. It's meant to be contextual, offering at-a-glance updates that you would normally get from the iPhone's widget panel, and in our time spent running the watchOS 4 beta it's one of our favorite new features.

But for the fitness fans, there's something for you too. Apple is bringing in GymKit, which will let you sync data from some cardio gym equipment to the Watch. Cybex, Star Trac, StairMaster and TechnoGym are some of the announced names so far who will be compatible. Apple's also added HIIT workouts, and promises improved algorithms for better heart rate accuracy.

Apple Watch Series 2: Apps and performance

The Apple Watch works in much the same way as the original, in that there's a host of pre-installed apps. Then of course there's the App Store, accessed through the Apple Watch companion app.



The stock apps are still much the same: Workout, Activity, Mail, Messages, Stopwatch, Photos, Weather, Music, Stocks, Clock, Remote (for controlling iTunes), Maps and Calendar are all included.



It's a pretty complete set, but your screen will be a lot busier when you load it for the first time. Many of your existing iPhone apps have Apple Watch versions, and the setup process will identify and add those to your smartwatch.

The Apple Watch has the most varied and vast collection of apps of any ecosystem, but it's still been tough going for Apple. What's more, performance issues meant that some of the apps were just unusably slow. Well, performance has noticeably improved thanks to the beefier dual-core processor under the hood. A new app takes around two seconds to fire up from cold, where before that could run to over five seconds – and then there was no guarantee it wouldn't hang or crash.

The increased usability is even more pronounced when you use the dock in watchOS 3. This keeps your six most commonly used apps pre-loaded, which means they're instantly usable when you push the button to access them.

In terms of the quality and selection of Apple Watch apps, things are still a little bit questionable. There certainly isn't a killer app on the App Store, it's more a combination of nifty, little one-function downloads which some people will love, some will find useless and the usual big smartphone app names.

Some third-party fitness apps haven't been updated to support the Apple Watch Series 2's GPS sensor. Strava says its app update is coming in ""early 2017"" to address this, for instance, though the likes of Runkeeper have already made the leap. Best to check if you're locked in to one app/community.

Apple Watch Series 2: Fitness, sports and heart rate

Activity tracking

The Activity app is mostly unchanged this time around, with the three, beginner-friendly rings for Move (steps), Exercise (active minutes) and Stand (amount of hours in the day where you got up and moved) all tracked.



We've always been fans of the three metrics and they still offer a decent way to ensure you're leading a healthier lifestyle. What's more, the rings offer a more visual way of accessing your goals, without getting bogged down in numbers. The Move goal is also variable, you can increase or decrease manually each week, and the Apple Watch will tailor it if you're repeatedly smashing or failing your daily target. Apple now makes it easier to share your activity with other Watch owners, which means you can keep a close eye on how you're faring against friends for that extra motivational push.

But what about accuracy? Well, we put the Apple Watch up against the Fitbit Charge 2 and found them to be comfortably close in their estimations of steps and distance. That's reassuring for prospective owners of both Apple and Fitbit devices.

There's still no sleep tracking built in, usually a go-to for trackers and smartwatches, and there hasn't been much talk of this for future watchOS updates. Perhaps this is because Watch owners know you need to charge it overnight, you can't be wearing it 24/7. The wonders of the App Store means that there are third-party apps available that will do the job if you're happy with more frequent charging.



Running

It's fair to say that we didn't have the greatest experience running with the first Apple Watch. It was basic, didn't play nice with third-party fitness apps and we were expecting so much more when Apple said it was making a big push on fitness and sport with its smartwatch.



Read this: Best GPS watches for cycling ranked and rated

Now Apple has added in GPS so you can leave the iPhone behind whether you're running, cycling or just going out for a walk – and still track activity. Pack some iTunes/Apple Music tracks onto your Series 2, grab a pair of wireless headphones and you're good to go. That's bearing in mind the aforementioned split in third party fitness app support for GPS, of course.

Tracking is still done via the Workout app and if you throw a Workout complication onto your watch face, it makes it even quicker to launch a run. Apple promised GPS lock-on to be within seconds and we were sceptical, but it did not lie. You'll get all of the data you'd expect to glance at mid run including distance, time, heart rate and average pace. As far as accuracy is concerned, we put it up against the TomTom Spark 3, a running watch we've just handed a 9 out of 10 score and it matched up on GPS tracking.

Apple Watch Series 2 (left and centre) and TomTom Spark 3 (right)

On the few runs we took it out on, there was an average difference of 0.30km for distance recorded. Average pace was usually a 9-10 second difference, while average heart rate readings were within 3-4 bpm of each other. You can now view your route and breakdown of average pace per mile/km but you're unable to dig deeper into heart rate information.

On the treadmill, it's hit and miss again. This time you're relying on the accelerometer to track running motion. Up against the Spark 3, distance tracking was usually 300-400m off and average pace was significantly off, although average bpm heart rate readings were generally accurate. The Spark 3 is by no means perfect for indoor run tracking, so we are a little more forgiving about the Series 2's performance.

As a running watch experience, you shouldn't expect anything out of the ordinary here and we're not sure Garmin, Polar etc will be quaking in their boots. For one thing, the Watch doesn't currently track elevation, a cause for concern from some runners on the web. But it's proved a pretty reliable running watch and very much an improvement on the first Apple Watch.

Heart rate performance

Apple Watch Series 1 hardly received plaudits for its heart rate accuracy, even though it's far from the worst optical device out there. Since our initial review we've been out to test the Series 2 all over again, and have to say it's performed admirably well.

The sensor takes a while to lock on initially, kicking in about a minute after the run starts. During steady runs the Series 2 stayed fairly close to a chest strap, always within 5bpm and as the run progressed, even closer. It's one of the better performances we've seen, not quite as strong as the TomTom Spark but certainly as reliable as Garmin's optical heart rate tech and stronger than the Fitbit Charge 2.

What's more, the interval performance didn't totally suck – which is always a surprise. We tracked five hill sprints against a chest strap, and while the Series 2 was certainly far slower in reporting heart rate than the chest strap, it pretty much nailed HR peaks perhaps 10 seconds after the end of the interval. It's not a perfect performance, but if you do hit the gym for HIIT classes, we'd hazard to say that the data would be useful when you return.

Where the Series 2 falls down is when you're trying to hit a target HR during very short intervals. If your bursts are less than a minute you've no chance, but longer sessions should be okay.

Swimming

We wanted a waterproof Apple Watch and that's what we got. The Series 2 is waterproof up to 50 metres depth, which is the same as the Fitbit Flex 2. That means you can safely take it in the shower or bath (we've done both) and it'll survive another day.



Apple has taken things further by throwing pool and open water swim tracking into the mix, which means you'll get served up with a host of metrics including distance covered, lengths, average pace and can distinguish stroke style. It's more than we were expecting and what's even better news is that it works really well.



Apple Watch Series 2 (left and centre) and TomTom Spark 3 (right)

In terms of how it performs in the pool, getting it up and running is very easy. Select the indoor pool sports tracking in the Workout app and then you'll need to select pool length. The Watch will to tell you that it's going to lock the screen.

You can still raise your wrist to view performance in real time, but anything else is off limits. When you're done swimming, twisting the digital crown initiates a process where water is cleaned out from the Watch speaker and you can start using it as normal once again. You'll be able to see a tidy summary of your workout, which is shared into the Activity iPhone app.

As far as data accuracy is concerned, the Series 2 is on the money. We put it up against the TomTom Spark 3, which essentially uses the swim tracking tech featured in the original Spark, and it scored highly, delivering the same distance, lengths and average pace metrics. All of that data lives inside the Activity app and contributes to filling up those activity rings. Sadly, it doesn't appear that data can be integrated into third-party fitness apps, which is a shame. Overall, we loved swimming with the Series 2, we just wish it could be more flexible with where the data lives.

Apple Watch Series 2: Battery life

Battery life on the original Apple Watch wasn't great. It would get you a day and that was your lot. But the Series 2 is better... marginally. Now you'll get around two days. That's what we found using the smaller 38mm model. The 42mm Series 2 has a bigger battery but a couple of days max is still not really enough battery life in our book.

We appreciate that it's going in the right direction but we also did look down on our commute home from work one day to a blank screen. Not a good look.

If you're planning to track a run or swim and use apps and notifications regularly, then you'll find yourself tapping into Apple's power reserve mode by the end of the second day. That restricts core features giving you a more standard watch experience. It still uses the same charger as the first Watch and it's pretty zippy at getting back to full charge when it does die on you. Just be careful how you place the Watch as it can end up being nudged off the charger quite easily.

Apple Watch Series 2 By Apple Is the Apple Watch Series 2 the perfect smartwatch? No. But it makes a much more compelling argument than the original that you should own one. We’re not just talking about the addition of GPS and the waterproofing here either.

http://www.emergent.info/Gruber-Apple-Watch-Edition-10k	Claim: The gold Apple Watch Edition will cost $9,999 USD	true	['Apple Watch', 'Apple Watch Edition', 'Apple Watch Price', 'Daring Fireball', 'Jon Gruber']	2015/02/20	emergent	['http://daringfireball.net/2015/02/apple_watch_pricing']	http://daringfireball.net/2015/02/apple_watch_pricing	http://daringfireball.net/	"On the Pricing of Apple Watch

After the gala announcement event in September at which Apple introduced Apple Watch and whatever last year’s iPhone was, I ran into SlashGear editor-in-chief Vincent Nguyen in the private hands-on area Apple had set up for select members of the media. I’ve known Vincent for years from various Apple events, and I always enjoy his perspective. I was actually looking around for him this time, though, because I really wanted to hear his take on Apple Watch. Vincent is a watch guy — he knows the watch industry, and his taste is excellent.

We greeted each other, walked in, and started staring, close-up, at the lineup. When we got to the Edition models, Vincent said, with some excitement, “This is going to cost $20,000.”

I’d already started thinking that the Edition models would cost thousands, plural, but $20,000 struck me as a price from Bananas Town. Vincent’s reply was something to the effect of, “Try to find a good 18-karat gold watch for less than $20,000. You won’t.”

Here’s what I wrote back in September, in my initial thoughts regarding Apple Watch:

In short: hundreds for Sport, a thousand for stainless steel, thousands for gold. Most people think I’m joking when I say the gold ones are going to start at $5,000. I couldn’t be more serious. I made a friendly bet last week with a few friends on the starting price for the Edition models, and I bet on $9,999.

The more I think about it, and the more I learn about the watch industry, the world of luxury goods, and the booming upper class of China, the better I feel about that bet. I don’t think I was wrong to place a friendly late night bar bet on a $9,999 starting price. I think I was wrong to guess just $4,999 in my ostensibly sober published analysis.

I can see which way the wind is blowing. For months I’ve been asking friends who might know — or know someone else who might know, or even know someone who knows someone who might know — whether my guess of $5,000 is too high for the Edition starting price. The answer has always been “No”. But the way I’ve been told “No” has given me the uneasy feeling that I’ve been asking the wrong question. I should have been asking if $5,000 is too low.

I now think Edition models will start around $10,000 — and, if my hunch is right about bands and bracelets, the upper range could go to $20,000. I was off by a factor of two, and my friend Vincent, I think, nailed it back on the day Apple Watch was introduced.

It’s All About the Bands

Louie Mantia helped clarify my thinking on this by publishing this seemingly sparsely populated table of Apple Watch collection/band combinations. Study that for a few minutes, and you should come to a few surprising — to me at least — conclusions.

One of the selling points Apple emphasized in September is that bands are easily interchanged on Apple Watch. You just press a button underneath and it’s released; slide a new one in and it securely clicks into place. And they showed a wide variety of bands: Sport, Classic Buckle, Leather Loop, Modern Buckle, Milanese Loop, and Link Bracelet. Six different styles, all of them — other than the Milanese Loop — in multiple colors.

I walked out of the event under the assumption that all of these bands would be available to purchase as accessories, like iPhone cases. So that one could, say, buy an Apple Watch Sport with a white sport band, and buy a Milanese Loop or one of the leather bands to make it dressier.

I am no longer certain that’s going to be the case. And if it is the case, the non-Sport bands are going to be expensive — in most cases, even more expensive than the Apple Watch Sport itself.

What seems clear to me now is that the various bands signify tiers within the three collections — particularly for the stainless steel Apple Watch models. Take a look at Apple’s page for the steel Watch collection, and scroll down to the bottom, where they present a scrolling carousel of “all 18 models in the collection”. From left to right:

Things to note:

The “Modern Buckle” is only available for 38mm models. The Leather Loop is only available for 42mm models. The Space Black watch is only available with a single band option: the Link Bracelet.

Sport Bands are surely the least expensive. Link Bracelets, I’m almost as sure, are the most expensive. I think Apple placed these models in order from least to most expensive, going from left to right. (Including the fact that 38mm models will cost slightly less than their 42mm siblings.)

Why are there both Classic Buckles and Modern Buckles? From their descriptions, it sounds like the Modern Buckle uses a better leather, and without question it has a more advanced clasp mechanism. I conclude: Modern is more expensive. They both exist because they’ll sit at different price points.

Note too, that on the regular Apple Watch collection page, the Classic Buckle description states, regarding color options: “Available in black.” This, despite the same band being offered in Midnight Blue for the Edition collection.

So I’m thinking the regular Apple Watch will come in at least five pricing tiers:

Entry: Sport Band, black or white. Regular leather: Classic Buckle, you’ll get it in black and you’ll like it. Milanese Loop. Deluxe leather: Modern Buckle for 38mm models, Leather Loop for 42mm models. Each with a choice of three colors. Link Bracelet.

You’ll pay a premium for color straps and advanced clasp mechanisms, and you’ll pay even more for the Link Bracelet.

I think the spread between these tiers could be significant, ranging from, say, $700 for the entry model with the Sport Band to well over $1,000 for the Link Bracelet. I still think the average for the steel Apple Watch will be around $1,000, but depending on your strap choice, you’ll pay several hundred less or more.

But wait. I would not bet against Apple bringing back the black tax. Remember the plastic MacBooks from 2006? Apple charged $150 more for the black one than the white one, even though they had nearly identical specs.

Note that the silver Apple Watch Sport only has four band color choices: white, blue, green, and pink. The space gray Sport edition has only one band: black. I think Apple might charge more for both the space gray Sport model and the space black stainless steel model.

Further, I don’t think any of the stainless steel bands will be available for retail purchase. They’ll sell sport bands, which you’ll be able to use on any Apple Watch, but I don’t think any of the nicer bands will be available for retail purchase. Don’t hold your breath for a space black Link Bracelet to put on your $349 Sport model. The nicer bands aren’t accessories that Apple hopes you’ll tack onto your purchase; they’re signifiers of how much you paid for your stainless steel or gold Apple Watch.

Limited Edition

Which brings me to the Edition collection’s curiously thin lineup of strap choices. There are only three for each watch size, and Apple doesn’t present them side-by-side in a carousel like they do with the stainless steel models:

38mm Yellow Gold with Bright Red Modern Buckle

38mm Rose Gold with White Sport Band

42mm Rose Gold with White Sport Band

38mm Rose Gold with Rose Gray Modern Buckle

42mm Yellow Gold with Black Sport Band

42mm Yellow Gold with Midnight Blue Classic Buckle

That’s the order in which the six models appear on Apple’s page. It almost certainly does not correspond to price.

Things to note: None of these leather colors are available in the standard Apple Watch lineup. These are not regular Sport Bands — they have gold clasps. None of them have metal bands.

These are (I think) $10,000+ watches, but half of them come with rubber sport bands that are nearly indistinguishable from the bands on the $349 Sport collection.

Glaringly omitted is a gold Link Bracelet. I’d place a side bet Apple withheld it in September, and will unveil it as a surprise option at the event they’ll hold before releasing the watches. If you’re going to go gold, go gold. Some people buy a gold watch simply because they like it. Others buy a gold watch because they want everyone to know they wear a gold watch. The latter group will gladly pay $20,000 for a watch with gold band.

Perhaps I’m biased by my personal taste in watch bands, but at the hands-on event in September, the Link Bracelet was my favorite by far, followed by the Milanese Loop. It seems downright ludicrous to me to charge significantly more for the Edition models and not offer the best of the bands. Note too that among the Edition combinations Apple currently lists, there is but a single 42mm model with something other than a rubber Sport Band — the Midnight Blue Classic Buckle. Further, as stated above, I think the Classic Buckle is the low-end leather strap. I’m guessing Apple will offer Edition models with gold Link Bracelets for $20,000, and perhaps Milanese Loops for $15,000 and a Leather Loop for around $12,500.

Look at the Watch Industry

Don’t try to guess the price of the Edition models based on the amount of gold they contain. I did it this week, but it’s the wrong way to look at this. It doesn’t matter if the gold in an Apple Watch Edition model is “only” worth $1,000 or $1,500 or whatever. The gold in a Rolex is only worth that, too — and their gold watches sell for $20,000 and more, for the exact same movements in their $6,000 stainless steel models. The value of a gold watch is only tangentially related to the number of ounces of gold it contains. And Edition isn’t just made of 18-karat gold — it’s made of the best 18-karat gold in the world. (I don’t know that for a fact — I don’t know anything about gold — I’m just saying what Apple is saying.)

Apple Watch Edition is not a tech product, so don’t try to price it like one.

Apple Watch Edition is a luxury wrist watch. Apple’s ambitions in this arena, I am convinced, are almost boundless. They’re not entering the market against Rolex, Omega, and the rest of the Swiss luxury watch establishment with disruptive prices. They’re entering the market against those companies going head-to-head on pricing, with disruptive (they think) features.

Again I point you to someone from the watch world, Grail Watch’s Stephen Foskett, who points out that gold watches typically cost $10-15,000 more than the same watch in stainless steel — and tens of thousands more if they come with a gold bracelet. Even if I’m wrong about Apple having gold Link Bracelets lying in wait as an April surprise, I don’t think a $10,000 starting price for Apple Watch Edition is even a step out of line for the watch industry.1

Will it work? Will people actually buy these? I have no idea. But I think Apple thinks it’s going to work."

Apple's been able to spin gold from perceived failure before, even the iPad had its doubters, and they're back this time too. And maybe for good reason. We've learned a lot more about Apple's first wearables since its announcement months ago. This is what we know about what we'll be getting.

The Apple Watch will try to replace your credit cards.

Of course, Apple Watch will come NFC-equipped to support the new e-payments system, Apple Pay. But it will work a little bit differently here than on your iPhone 6/6 Plus. Essentially, you'll use a passcode to authorize Apple Pay and then you'll stay logged in as long as the watch remains in contact with your skin.

Also, the Apple Watch will allow Apple 5, 5C, and 5S users to finally get on the Apple Pay wagon, which is great for them and for Apple.

The Apple Watch's will track health and fitness about as well as anything else.

When it came to health and fitness, the Apple Watch wanted to be so much more, according to The Wall Street Journal. It was supposed to be a state-of-the-art tracker, one with a built-in EKG and other sensors that would measure stress (much like the new Jawbone Up3). But all those sensors kind of suck and didn't really span well across different types of wrists.

So instead, the Apple Watch is stuck with the classics—an accelerometer, gyroscope, and HR monitor (which have also been dinged for inaccuracy in general). The Apple Watch's Activity and Workout apps will track you throughout your typical calorie-counting, step-making, workout-doing day, you know, like every other fitness watch out there. If you want more specifics on what the watch will track, the Apple Watch companion app leak posted by 9to5Mac is a good place to start:

Some of the more interesting applications in health and fitness will most likely come from third-party developers like DexCom, who are developing an embeddable chip that will pump out glucose readings for diabetics. But in this scenario, the Apple Watch is merely a display for the information, and other smartwatches, most notably the Pebble Watch, can already do this kind of thing.

The Apple Watch will not solve the smartwatch battery problem.

You could say Apple's philosophy is ""better right than first"" and perhaps the biggest smartwatch failing that needs to be righted is battery life. A lot of smartwatches—specifically Android Wear—can't boast more than a day and a half of life, or two at best. The disappointment began with the Moto 360 and pretty much continued from there. Charging every night is almost inevitable.

The Apple Watch, it seems, won't be much better. In late January, 9to5Mac reported some dismally bad battery results for the Apple Watch: 2.5 hours of ""heavy use,"" 3.5 hours of standard app use, and a goal of 19 hours of mixed use (and even that might be a stretch for the first generation). That is definitely not solving the battery problem. Not to mention Tim Cook himself said he needs to charge it every night.

Apple seems to recognize the issue and is preparing a lot of workarounds. The Apple Watch will use a MagSafe wireless charger, so you don't have to mess around with a cradle or hunt for a lightning port. Apple is also developing a ""Power Reserve"" mode—basically ""just a watch"" mode—so you can get the most juice out of your watch. This will be the first power-saving feature on any iDevice.

The Apple Watch will probably have a shit ton of apps.

A rumor was circulating last month that the Apple Watch would launch with 100,000 apps. That seems....ludicrously hopeful. Cult of Mac points out that it took iOS near 16 months to reach 100,000 apps. So we'll see if something relatively iffy and new like a watch can manage to launch with a cool 100k. But even if that number is a few thousand (or tens of thousands) shy of the truth, the Apple Watch won't feel empty at launch by any means.

At a company briefing in Germany, Cook Master Flex said ""tons"" of apps will soon be announced for the Apple Watch, alongside previously announced partners like Panera, Tesla, and Todoist and many others.

Wearables Shipments to Jump to 75 Million in 2015, Up 158% on 2014

Apple Watch to account for over a quarter of wearables shipments in 2015

By 2018 almost 350 million wearable devices will be in use worldwide

17 February 2015: Sales of wearables will grow from 29 million in 2014 to 172 million in 2018, with a spike in 2015. The most popular devices will be smartwatches and fitness trackers. This is according to CCS Insight’s latest global wearables forecast.

The next 12 months will be a transformative year for the wearables market thanks to the arrival of the Apple Watch. This highly anticipated smartwatch will create a frenzy of demand, catapulting it almost instantaneously to be the most successful smartwatch ever. CCS Insight expects Apple to employ its full marketing arsenal and the power of its brand to create another must-have status symbol.

CCS Insight projects Apple will account for a quarter of the wearables market in 2015, selling around 20 million Apple Watches by the end of the year. This is equivalent to about 7% of those who own a compatible iPhone at the time of the product’s launch. The current love affair affluent US consumers have with the iPhone guarantees a strong start for the Apple Watch in its home market. However, if sales of the Apple Watch fail to meet expectations it could hurt the whole smartwatch market.

Last year confirmed that North America will remain the biggest market for wearables in the near term. This region accounted for more than half of global sales in 2014 and that momentum continues in 2015.

Commenting, Ben Wood, CCS Insight’s Chief of Research, stated “The Apple Watch will be instrumental in taking the wearables market to the next level of growth. If successful, it’ll create a rising tide that will lift the whole market.”

CCS Insight’s consumer surveys indicate extremely high levels of awareness of wearable devices, but the challenge is translating this into sales. Wood continues, “People without an iPhone will still have a huge choice of alternative wearables. If the Apple Watch performs as well as expected, its halo effect will result in a sales bonanza in the second half of 2015, with record-breaking shipments in the important fourth quarter.”

While the Apple Watch will be in the spotlight this year, fitness bands from companies such as Fitbit and Jawbone will continue to dominate the wearables market, building on their explosive growth in 2014. CCS Insight analyst George Jijiashvili observes, “We expect sales of fitness and activity devices to double in 2015 to 40 million units. In contrast to many other commentators, we don’t believe smartwatches will dent sales of fitness products in the short term. Smart fitness devices do one thing and do it well: they measure activity with the goal of improving owners’ well-being. This, combined with lower retail prices, longer battery life and a strong head start in terms of adoption, suggests that these devices will outperform smartwatches for several years to come.”

Action cameras are a much-forgotten part of the wearables market. They were a central product in the market’s early stages and remained the second-biggest category in 2014. Almost 6 million units were sold worldwide in 2014, buoyed by the success of market leader GoPro. Although CCS Insight predicts continued growth in the wearable camera segment boosted by more-affordable and capable products, the near-universal access to cameras on smartphones will limit total sales.

Beyond the well-known brands and types of wearable device, CCS Insight has observed a steady flow of weird and wonderful new products that it defines as the “long tail” of wearables. This category includes smart clothing, intelligent shoes and insoles, jewellery, adhesive sensors and patches, and even sex toys. Many of these devices are developed as crowd-funded projects and few will succeed. They underline the fact that the wearables market is still in its early stages and despite the explosive growth it will be dwarfed by the 1.5 billion smartphone shipments that CCS Insight forecasts in 2015.

The data above is taken from Market Forecast: Wearables Worldwide, 2014-2018, which is published as part of CCS Insight’s extensive wearables research service.

Apple critics have always roasted the company for selling products that are more expensive than they should be, and they frequently use this as a wedge topic to criticize buyers. But the “18-karat gold” Apple Watch Edition will set a whole new bar with a sales price of $10,000. The funny thing in this case is that Apple is perfectly right to be charging that much!

Do you disagree? Check out my counterpoint, “The Case Against the $10,000 Gold Apple Watch Edition“

Gold is Expensive

Let’s start with a little backgrounder in gold. Everyone has a vague sense that gold is expensive. Even rabid Internet trolls have seen the banner ads and heard about that in the news. But most people don’t understand just how expensive even a little bit of gold is. So this is a good place to begin the discussion.

Update: My calculations were wrong! Also, this was a bit “back of the envelope.” Now that it has some readership I realize I should go back and fix the calculations in the article to be more realistic…

Here are the basic facts:

Gold currently sells for between $1,200 and $1,300 per troy ounce and has been over $1,000 per troy ounce for the last five years. 18-karat gold contains 75% pure gold, and that term is regulated by law. One ounce of 18k gold occupies about 1.8 cubic centimeters of volume since a typical 18-karat gold alloy weighs about 16.5 grams per cc. 18-karat gold currently sells for $29.11 per gram, $905 per troy ounce, or $480 per cc.

.25 cc of 18k gold is about enough to construct a watch buckle and .75 cc gets you a deployant clasp. It takes a few more to build a watch case, anywhere from 1.5 to 8 cc depending on the size and thickness of the case. So the buckle is worth $120-$360 and the watch case $720 to $3800 just as raw gold. This is why gold watches generally sell for a lot more than $6,000!

Gold Watches are Expensive

Let’s apply this to a watch case. Imagine you wanted to create a rectangular case 42 mm high by 36 mm wide by 10 mm deep. If it was solid, this would equal 15.12 cc of volume. But it’s a watch case, so you have to leave room for the movement, dial, case back, etc. So let’s just leave 5 mm of thickness all around, making a hollow rectangle. This equals 6.8 cc (42 x 36 x 10 – 32 x 26 x 10). Therefore, the raw gold to make just the case of this hypothetical watch would cost $3,200 as of this writing.

Now let’s consider the same shape but just 2 mm thick. That’s 2.9 cc of gold, worth $1,400. Pick your thickness and you’re still looking at thousands of dollars worth of gold.

How does this translate in the real world? Let’s look at the retail price of some watches that are available in both stainless steel and 18-karat gold.

The Cartier Tank MC measures 44 mm by 34 mm by 9.5 mm thick: $15,000 extra (list) for 18k gold Cartier Tank MC in stainless steel: $7,000 list, $5,800 street Cartier Tank MC in 18k pink gold: $22,000 list, $18,200 street The Jaeger-LeCoultre Reverso Squadra Hometime measures 50.5 mm by 34.9 mm by 14 mm thick: $14,750 extra (list) for 18k gold Jaeger-LeCoultre Reverso Squadra Hometime in stainless steel: $8,550 list, $6,800 street Jaeger-LeCoultre Reverso Squadra Hometime in 18k pink gold: $23,300 list, $18,400 street

This list could go on and on, but the gist is simple: 18-karat gold cases cost a lot more than stainless steel. In fact, it’s pretty much impossible to find a gold watch for under $10,000 in any size and from any manufacturer. Even tiny quartz ladies watches like the tiny Chopard Happy Sport Mini sells for $11,000! Most of the bargains commenters have pointed to are either 14-karat or less, very slim and small, or long out of production and with outdated pricing.

Then there’s the bracelet. Swap a gold bracelet for a leather strap and you are looking at an extra $20,000. Adding a gold bracelet to that Jaeger-LeCoultre bumps the price to $42,900!

Certainly there is quite a bit of profit in luxury watches, but one simply cannot deny the raw material value in a gold watch case. And the gold market is liquid like stocks and other commodities: There are plenty of buyers and sellers of gold, and plenty of reserves, so no company, no matter how strong, can expect favorable pricing from their suppliers.

Another reason companies charge so much for gold watches and jewelry is as a hedge against volatility. They can’t price near the commodity price because they have to set a price and stick to it all year long. So they generally price somewhat higher than they would, even taking into consideration all the rest of the materials, labor, distribution, and profit in a watch.

The Apple Watch Edition Will Cost $10,000

There’s a reason I picked those two watches for my comparisons: Both are similar in size and shape to the 42 mm Apple Watch. The Cartier is a little smaller and the Jaeger-LeCoultre is a little larger, but both represent a traditional watchmaker’s gold-cased square-ish offering in the space. And both cost more than $20,000, with much of that price going to the gold case and matching buckle. And Jony Ive recently said that the historic Cartier Tank was one of his inspirations for the Apple Watch design!

Apple would be crazy to sell the Apple Watch Edition for $20,000, though. That’s not going to happen. So they’re likely to find ways to reduce the cost dramatically.

First, as we can see, the Apple Watch case is highly rounded in all three dimensions. Although questionable from an esthetic standpoint, this reduces the amount of material required by quite a lot. Second, Apple Watch has a large sapphire crystal front and back with the display, sensors, and such. Third, the interior frame is likely made of steel or aluminum, not gold, to reduce cost and increase commonality with the aluminum and steel versions.

Could it be gold plated? No. Numerous reports state that it is a solid gold case. Although Apple has not apparently used the word, “solid” in their press releases, they do claim it is “crafted from 18-karat gold” and nowhere does it say it is plated or “gold filled” (the industry term). There are laws covering descriptions of metal content for jewelry and Apple cannot break these any more than Tiffany could.

Apple says that the Apple Watch will start at $349 for that aluminum Sport model, and many bloggers have reported the price for the steel Apple Watch to be roughly $1,000. It is reasonable to assume that the gold Edition model will sell for substantially more than this, with many suggesting $4,000 or $5,000. But remember that this price would only cover 4 or 5 ounces of gold! Even with thin walls and a steel frame, it’s hard to see how Apple could make a solid 18-karat gold case and buckle for a 42 mm watch with just 3 ounces of gold.

Gold is soft, but Apple claims that their special gold is twice as hard as “standard gold”. Taking that at face value, perhaps they reduced the thickness of the case commensurately, cutting the amount of gold in half versus a standard rectangular watch. This still leaves a few thousand dollars of material value in the case. The Apple Watch Edition will come in 38 mm and 42 mm sizes, a difference of about 20% in terms of case volume. So the smaller model could sell for 20% less still.

My prediction is that the 42 mm Apple Watch Edition will retail for $9,999 with the 38 mm Apple Watch Edition retailing for $7,999. This covers the cost of the gold case, the internals, manufacturing, sales, and profit, and yet does not leave Apple subsidizing the world gold market by selling at a discount or cheating with a too-thin or plated case. I will be shocked if the price is $4,999, but I suppose it’s possible with some finagling and if that’s the smaller model. And it will not be any less than that.

Bonus prediction: Given the very high price of the Apple Watch Edition, I predict that availability will be quite limited. Apple will likely create special store-within-a-store spaces in certain Apple Store locations for the Edition. I further expect them to open special standalone Apple Edition Boutiques to sell the Watch Edition, accessories, and perhaps other future high-end products.

Update!

Needless to say, many people disagree with me. And now that @Gruber Fireballed this post, I imagine I’ll hear from lots of them real soon!

The gist of the disagreement lies in the amount of gold needed for the watch case. I assumed it would be quite thick (read sturdy) and would contain upwards of 130 grams of 18k gold. Then there’s the strap lugs and buckle which would likely contain another few dozen grams. But @GAK_PDX (and others, though he was most visually eloquent) suspects it contains much less gold.

For fun, I took my Apple Watch models and used SW and some basic assumptions to figure the gold content. 29.16g: pic.twitter.com/WGEnjtj1Yh — Greg Koenig (@gak_pdx) February 19, 2015

I think this number is way too low, but it’s a good lower bound if the case was very thin and completely hollow. And it puts the raw gold at about $849 at $29.11 per gram of 18k gold. Although this is admittedly much, much lower than my estimate, it still illustrates my point that the Apple Watch Edition is not going to be cheap. And I think he’s way off but time will tell who is right and who is wrong.

Another argument is based on this 2006 analysis of a gold Rolex watch. Right off the bat one should point out that gold cost $400/oz when it was written and that watch includes a gold bracelet as well, something Apple is apparently not going to do with the Edition. That Rolex case contained 18.5 grams of gold alloy, but it’s much, much smaller than the Apple watch and it’s circular to boot! A 34mm circle is 107mm in circumference, while the 42mm Apple Watch is 156mm in circumference. Use the magic of math to scale the Rolex up into a 42mm rectangle and we’re at 27.75 grams. But that case is also much thinner since we excluded the bezel, and the Apple Watch is pretty slab-sided. So we can probably double this safely and come out with $1,615 of gold in my mangled square Rolex case.

So there are lower estimates than mine for the amount and value of the gold. I can accept that. But let’s take a step back and think about the final price. Even if it contained less than $1,500 of gold, how much would it sell for? Certainly not $2,000 or $3,000. You still have to account for the cost of everything else, plus the intangibles of manufacturing and distribution. And profit for Apple (and a hedge against the volatility of the price of gold). So we’re back at the $4,000-$5,000 estimate others have made. As Greg Koenig tweeted, and Forbes reported, “If anyone thinks Apple is charging less than $5k for the Edition, they are smoking crack.”

Regardless of the total, it’s important to realize that the price of gold is in the driver’s seat when it comes to pricing the Apple Watch Edition.

I’d love to be wrong, and I look forward to updating this piece. Thanks for reading!

Dry skin, hairy arms, and the tightness of the watch on the wrist all affected the accuracy of the sensor. A more conventional heart rate sensor was used instead.

Other sensors could have measured blood pressure and the amount of oxygen in the blood, but consistency was again an issue.

The Wall Street Journal reports that Apple will make five to six million units for the first quarter, with half of those units being the entry Apple Watch Sport and one-third being the mid-tier stainless-steel Apple Watch."

According to a new report from The Wall Street Journal, Apple originally wanted its smartwatch to focus far more prominently on health-related innovations, only to be forced to go in another direction midway through the project.

If Apple had had its way, the Apple Watch would have boasted smart sensors capable of tracking blood pressure, heart rate and even stress levels — but despite hiring top people from the biosensor industry, the technology didn’t work quite as well as had been hoped.

Problems were apparently posed by Apple Watch wearers with hairy arms and dry skin, with sensor results also varying depending on how loosely or tightly the watch is worn. Despite a heavy drain on Apple resources, engineers were unable to create a suitable solution in time for the company to reveal the device.

As a result, the Apple Watch shipping in April will be far more of an iPhone accessory/companion than had originally been planned, which is no doubt useful for growing Apple’s interlocking ecosystem but is less good in other ways. Although Apple has the luxury of taking its time with products, yesterday’s New Yorker story reveals how much pressure there was to announce a new category of device post-Steve Jobs.

While there’s still a lot to be excited for, the health-tracking applications of the Apple Watch were ones that people are very excited about. Apple has already had success introducing HealthKit into top hospitals, and a medically approved wearable could potentially help grow relations between Apple and the healthcare industry.

In a recent interview, Steve Wozniak discussed health-tracking as one of the most potentially exciting features of the Apple Watch. Cult of Mac has also written about the potential of the Apple Watch becoming your “digital doctor.”

So far Apple has only shown the Watch in pre-assembled collections, which reduces their potential for customization, but our sources say that Apple’s retail outlets will be stocked on day one with individual straps so customers can easily mix and match the looks of their Watches.

While Apple has hinted at millions of combinations of Apple Watch when considering the various watch faces and interchangeable strap combos, up until now we’ve not had confirmation that straps would be available to purchase separately alongside the Apple Watch at launch.

What we know about the Apple Watch lineup so far from Apple is that it will come in three models— Apple Watch, Sport, and Edition— with each of those models offering a selection of the total 6 straps Apple has shown so far on the 38mm size, 42mm size, or both. Some of the straps Apple shows on its website, such as the Modern Buckle and Leather Loop— will be limited to either the 38mm or 42mm models in select colors for the Apple Watch and gold Apple Watch Edition. It’s unclear Apple’s exact motivation in limiting certain watch straps to either the 38mm and 42mm options in the Apple Watch and Apple Watch Edition lineups. The Apple Watch Sport line offers all strap options and colors for both sizes, according to Apple’s site. However, it’s possible that some of the straps Apple shows as limited to either the 38mm or 42mm sizes will become available to purchase for the other size separately.

Some straps and bracelets might make more sense to offer as standalone accessories. Not offering straps for the 18-karat gold Apple Watch Edition could be something Apple does strategically to increase the exclusivity of those models that many expect to sell as high-end fashion items with matching price tags.

There’s no confirmation on what straps Apple will make available to purchase separately at launch or if the options will reflect all variations of the device currently shown on Apple’s website. It’s of course also possible, and quite likely, that Apple will offer straps beyond the designs it’s outed so far.

It’s entirely possible for them to put together a gold-cased Apple Watch for a much-lower price point, but I’m much more interested in the reasons why: Apple’s manufacturing and retail empire would be seriously disrupted by a $10,000 lump of gold!

How To Make A Gold Watch For Under $10,000

In my last post, I pointed out (hyperbolically) that there are no gold watches available for less than $10,000. This isn’t really true – there are a few small gold-cased watches available below that mark. But comparing these to an Apple watch is (if you pardon the pun), a case of “apples and oranges”: They’re much smaller; they’re round; and they’re not Apple Watches!

This last point is critical: We have no idea how the case of an Apple Watch is constructed. And, more importantly, the components, manufacturing, and sales process is entirely different from a Swiss mechanical wristwatch. My point was simply that Apple’s Watch Edition case looks like a big chunk of gold and that’s an expensive thing, likely pushing the total cost all the way to $10,000 if my assumptions are correct.

But let’s say Apple didn’t want to build, stock, and sell a $10,000 watch but still wanted it to be “crafted from 18-karat gold.” How would they do it?

Our first argument against the $10k solid gold watch is commonality of design and certification. Apple has never (to my knowledge) delivered a device with different models constructed of different materials. Electronics aren’t like watches. They are mass-produced and must be certified for electromagnetic (“RF”) interference. Apple says they’ll deliver Watches in aluminum, steel, and gold, but it would be much easier of all three had an identical internal design and only varied when it comes to the outer skin. (Counterpoint: Commonality inside doesn’t necessarily mean cheap outside.)

This would also make the final product much cheaper, since the “gold case” could be extremely thin and not structural. Note that nowhere does Apple use the term, “solid gold case”, to describe the Watch Edition. I’m no lawyer, but their “crafted from 18-karat gold” boast could be weasel words to describe a conventional Watch wrapped in a thin gold skin.

The lugs and bars (that’s the watch insider term for “the things that the strap attaches to”) as well as the strap buckle could simply be gold plated or even gold colored. This is important because even these seemingly-small pieces would cost hundreds of dollars if they are solid 18-karat gold. That’s how expensive gold is.

One big clue could be the missing gold bracelet. It’s pretty glaring that the steel Apple Watch has two metal bracelets while the gold one only has leather and rubber. A gold watch bracelet has much more gold in it than the watch case itself, so the missing bracelet could be a clue that Apple is trying to keep the price in check. And the mere availability of the rubber strap which, as John Gruber notes, is the same as on the cheapest cheapie in the whole lineup could be another tell. Rubber bracelets are sometimes found on expensive dive watches, but this is no X Fathoms… (Counterpoint: They could add the gold bracelet later as an accessory.)

Combine these clues and we could be looking at a much cheaper watch. It’s still inconceivable to imagine prices less than $1,000, but Apple could definitely finagle a $2,000 Apple Watch Edition. It’s more likely that the Edition would retail over $4,000, but this is a far cry from my earlier assertion that it would cost $10,000!

Why Apple Wouldn’t Want A $10,000 Watch

It’s entirely possible for the “gold” Apple Watch Edition to be way under $10,000, but a more important question is why would Apple do this. After all, those making the decisions are very familiar with the luxury watch market and the incredible prices that gold watches command at retail. Why wouldn’t they want to “pull a Vertu” and cash in if customers are willing to buy?

Let’s return to the cost of gold. Although Apple has produced $10,000 products in the past and currently stocks some pretty expensive devices in the stores, a gold watch is an entirely different animal. Gold is much more fungible than anything else Apple sells, so security is a much more critical issue. Remember the smash-and-grab iPhone heists? How about that pallet of stolen iPhones? Now imagine if those thieves could melt the case down and have an untraceable $4,000 lump of gold instead of some hot electronics.

The high price of gold affects every aspect of my purported solid gold Apple Watch. Where would Apple manufacture a $10,000 watch? Even that little buckle would be worth more than a month’s pay for a Foxconn assembly line worker. And the level of finish required to compete with Swiss watches is not yet possible at scale in China. (Counterpoint: Apple could build the solid gold Watch Edition in Texas alongside the Mac Pro.)

Then there’s shipment and warehousing. Although it is extremely unlikely that Apple would manufacture and ship the millions of gold Watches some analysts suggest, even more modest shipments would be immensely valuable. Securing these shipments from factory to warehouse to freight to warehouse to store will be a real challenge. Apple currently packs as many as 1.5 million iPhones into a single 747, but they couldn’t ship $15 billion worth of Watch Editions this way! Every point of collection and shipping would instantly be a ripe target for criminals. (Counterpoint: Apple already deals with armored cars, security systems, and locked vaults.)

Even the stores themselves would need to be reconfigured. Is Apple ready to add armed guards, armored display cases, and time-lock vaults to their stores? Certainly the smaller stores don’t have space for a private room or boutique for Watch Edition buyers. (Counterpoint: We know they are working on a major redesign of the retail stores already.)

And what about payment? Luxury watch buyers typically pay using wire transfers, not credit cards. Apple must prepare to process five-figure credit card transactions and accept wires. Are they ready to accept the hassle of validating buyers and payments of this size?

Apple also has to worry about what a “1%” product like a $10,000 Apple Watch Edition would say about the company and its buyers. As Adam Fields notes on Medium, Apple will have to abandon their historic focus on “accessible luxury” and fully embrace their new role as a vendor of conspicuous luxury. Already frequently criticized as a maker of status symbols, this would be a lightning rod for Apple: If the gold Watch Edition sells for $10,000, it could spike Apple’s broader reputation and turn away customers rather than attract them.

It seems smart for Apple to skimp on the gold and bring the cost of the Apple Watch Edition to under $4,000. They would still have issues with production, shipping, and security but these would be reduced since they would no longer be dealing with four-figure lumps of fungible bullion.

Yet even at that price the stores will need reconfiguration and the pundits will hurl jokes about the rich. If the company is going to suffer to bring out a gold Apple Watch Edition anyway, why not embrace the change and go solid gold?

That’s why I’m sticking to my original predictions:

The starting prices will be $7,999 and $9,999

The Apple Watch Edition will have a solid gold case weighing more than 5 ounces

If sales go well, Apple will later offer a gold Edition bracelet at $9,999 as an accessory

The Apple Watch Edition will be offered through certain high-end third-party fashion boutiques and retailers

Some larger Apple Stores will add a private “Edition Boutique” (but not all)

A whole line of expensive and exclusive Edition products will appear

The Edition line will not be available from the online store or by mail

But the “18-karat gold” Apple Watch Edition will set a whole new bar with a sales price of $10,000. The funny thing in this case is that Apple is perfectly right to be charging that much!

Do you disagree? Check out my counterpoint, “The Case Against the $10,000 Gold Apple Watch Edition“

Gold is Expensive

Let’s start with a little backgrounder in gold. Everyone has a vague sense that gold is expensive. Even rabid Internet trolls have seen the banner ads and heard about that in the news. But most people don’t understand just how expensive even a little bit of gold is. So this is a good place to begin the discussion.

Update: My calculations were wrong! Also, this was a bit “back of the envelope.” Now that it has some readership I realize I should go back and fix the calculations in the article to be more realistic…

Here are the basic facts:

Gold currently sells for between $1,200 and $1,300 per troy ounce and has been over $1,000 per troy ounce for the last five years. 18-karat gold contains 75% pure gold, and that term is regulated by law. One ounce of 18k gold occupies about 1.8 cubic centimeters of volume since a typical 18-karat gold alloy weighs about 16.5 grams per cc. 18-karat gold currently sells for $29.11 per gram, $905 per troy ounce, or $480 per cc.

.25 cc of 18k gold is about enough to construct a watch buckle and .75 cc gets you a deployant clasp. It takes a few more to build a watch case, anywhere from 1.5 to 8 cc depending on the size and thickness of the case. So the buckle is worth $120-$360 and the watch case $720 to $3800 just as raw gold. This is why gold watches generally sell for a lot more than $6,000!

Gold Watches are Expensive

Let’s apply this to a watch case. Imagine you wanted to create a rectangular case 42 mm high by 36 mm wide by 10 mm deep. If it was solid, this would equal 15.12 cc of volume. But it’s a watch case, so you have to leave room for the movement, dial, case back, etc. So let’s just leave 5 mm of thickness all around, making a hollow rectangle. This equals 6.8 cc (42 x 36 x 10 – 32 x 26 x 10). Therefore, the raw gold to make just the case of this hypothetical watch would cost $3,200 as of this writing.

Now let’s consider the same shape but just 2 mm thick. That’s 2.9 cc of gold, worth $1,400. Pick your thickness and you’re still looking at thousands of dollars worth of gold.

How does this translate in the real world? Let’s look at the retail price of some watches that are available in both stainless steel and 18-karat gold.

The Cartier Tank MC measures 44 mm by 34 mm by 9.5 mm thick: $15,000 extra (list) for 18k gold Cartier Tank MC in stainless steel: $7,000 list, $5,800 street Cartier Tank MC in 18k pink gold: $22,000 list, $18,200 street The Jaeger-LeCoultre Reverso Squadra Hometime measures 50.5 mm by 34.9 mm by 14 mm thick: $14,750 extra (list) for 18k gold Jaeger-LeCoultre Reverso Squadra Hometime in stainless steel: $8,550 list, $6,800 street Jaeger-LeCoultre Reverso Squadra Hometime in 18k pink gold: $23,300 list, $18,400 street

This list could go on and on, but the gist is simple: 18-karat gold cases cost a lot more than stainless steel. In fact, it’s pretty much impossible to find a gold watch for under $10,000 in any size and from any manufacturer. Even tiny quartz ladies watches like the tiny Chopard Happy Sport Mini sells for $11,000! Most of the bargains commenters have pointed to are either 14-karat or less, very slim and small, or long out of production and with outdated pricing.

Then there’s the bracelet. Swap a gold bracelet for a leather strap and you are looking at an extra $20,000. Adding a gold bracelet to that Jaeger-LeCoultre bumps the price to $42,900!

Certainly there is quite a bit of profit in luxury watches, but one simply cannot deny the raw material value in a gold watch case. And the gold market is liquid like stocks and other commodities: There are plenty of buyers and sellers of gold, and plenty of reserves, so no company, no matter how strong, can expect favorable pricing from their suppliers.

Another reason companies charge so much for gold watches and jewelry is as a hedge against volatility. They can’t price near the commodity price because they have to set a price and stick to it all year long. So they generally price somewhat higher than they would, even taking into consideration all the rest of the materials, labor, distribution, and profit in a watch.

The Apple Watch Edition Will Cost $10,000

There’s a reason I picked those two watches for my comparisons: Both are similar in size and shape to the 42 mm Apple Watch. The Cartier is a little smaller and the Jaeger-LeCoultre is a little larger, but both represent a traditional watchmaker’s gold-cased square-ish offering in the space. And both cost more than $20,000, with much of that price going to the gold case and matching buckle. And Jony Ive recently said that the historic Cartier Tank was one of his inspirations for the Apple Watch design!

Apple would be crazy to sell the Apple Watch Edition for $20,000, though. That’s not going to happen. So they’re likely to find ways to reduce the cost dramatically.

First, as we can see, the Apple Watch case is highly rounded in all three dimensions. Although questionable from an esthetic standpoint, this reduces the amount of material required by quite a lot. Second, Apple Watch has a large sapphire crystal front and back with the display, sensors, and such. Third, the interior frame is likely made of steel or aluminum, not gold, to reduce cost and increase commonality with the aluminum and steel versions.

Could it be gold plated? No. Numerous reports state that it is a solid gold case. Although Apple has not apparently used the word, “solid” in their press releases, they do claim it is “crafted from 18-karat gold” and nowhere does it say it is plated or “gold filled” (the industry term). There are laws covering descriptions of metal content for jewelry and Apple cannot break these any more than Tiffany could.

Apple says that the Apple Watch will start at $349 for that aluminum Sport model, and many bloggers have reported the price for the steel Apple Watch to be roughly $1,000. It is reasonable to assume that the gold Edition model will sell for substantially more than this, with many suggesting $4,000 or $5,000. But remember that this price would only cover 4 or 5 ounces of gold! Even with thin walls and a steel frame, it’s hard to see how Apple could make a solid 18-karat gold case and buckle for a 42 mm watch with just 3 ounces of gold.

Gold is soft, but Apple claims that their special gold is twice as hard as “standard gold”. Taking that at face value, perhaps they reduced the thickness of the case commensurately, cutting the amount of gold in half versus a standard rectangular watch. This still leaves a few thousand dollars of material value in the case. The Apple Watch Edition will come in 38 mm and 42 mm sizes, a difference of about 20% in terms of case volume. So the smaller model could sell for 20% less still.

My prediction is that the 42 mm Apple Watch Edition will retail for $9,999 with the 38 mm Apple Watch Edition retailing for $7,999. This covers the cost of the gold case, the internals, manufacturing, sales, and profit, and yet does not leave Apple subsidizing the world gold market by selling at a discount or cheating with a too-thin or plated case. I will be shocked if the price is $4,999, but I suppose it’s possible with some finagling and if that’s the smaller model. And it will not be any less than that.

Bonus prediction: Given the very high price of the Apple Watch Edition, I predict that availability will be quite limited. Apple will likely create special store-within-a-store spaces in certain Apple Store locations for the Edition. I further expect them to open special standalone Apple Edition Boutiques to sell the Watch Edition, accessories, and perhaps other future high-end products.

Update!

Needless to say, many people disagree with me. And now that @Gruber Fireballed this post, I imagine I’ll hear from lots of them real soon!

The gist of the disagreement lies in the amount of gold needed for the watch case. I assumed it would be quite thick (read sturdy) and would contain upwards of 130 grams of 18k gold. Then there’s the strap lugs and buckle which would likely contain another few dozen grams. But @GAK_PDX (and others, though he was most visually eloquent) suspects it contains much less gold.

For fun, I took my Apple Watch models and used SW and some basic assumptions to figure the gold content. 29.16g: pic.twitter.com/WGEnjtj1Yh — Greg Koenig (@gak_pdx) February 19, 2015

I think this number is way too low, but it’s a good lower bound if the case was very thin and completely hollow. And it puts the raw gold at about $849 at $29.11 per gram of 18k gold. Although this is admittedly much, much lower than my estimate, it still illustrates my point that the Apple Watch Edition is not going to be cheap. And I think he’s way off but time will tell who is right and who is wrong.

Another argument is based on this 2006 analysis of a gold Rolex watch. Right off the bat one should point out that gold cost $400/oz when it was written and that watch includes a gold bracelet as well, something Apple is apparently not going to do with the Edition. That Rolex case contained 18.5 grams of gold alloy, but it’s much, much smaller than the Apple watch and it’s circular to boot! A 34mm circle is 107mm in circumference, while the 42mm Apple Watch is 156mm in circumference. Use the magic of math to scale the Rolex up into a 42mm rectangle and we’re at 27.75 grams. But that case is also much thinner since we excluded the bezel, and the Apple Watch is pretty slab-sided. So we can probably double this safely and come out with $1,615 of gold in my mangled square Rolex case.

So there are lower estimates than mine for the amount and value of the gold. I can accept that. But let’s take a step back and think about the final price. Even if it contained less than $1,500 of gold, how much would it sell for? Certainly not $2,000 or $3,000. You still have to account for the cost of everything else, plus the intangibles of manufacturing and distribution. And profit for Apple (and a hedge against the volatility of the price of gold). So we’re back at the $4,000-$5,000 estimate others have made. As Greg Koenig tweeted, and Forbes reported, “If anyone thinks Apple is charging less than $5k for the Edition, they are smoking crack.”

Regardless of the total, it’s important to realize that the price of gold is in the driver’s seat when it comes to pricing the Apple Watch Edition.

I’d love to be wrong, and I look forward to updating this piece. Thanks for reading!

In pictures for the Apple Watch Edition, the 18-karat solid gold version of Cupertino’s upcoming wearable, the Digital Crown has a small dot at the end that matches the color of the watch strap. But here’s a question for you: Is Apple going to allow users to customize the Digital Crown as easily as they can swap out Apple Watch wristbands?

Over at the Six Colors blog, ex-Macworld editor Dan Moren posts some interesting thoughts about how Apple might go about allowing users to customize the color tipping the Digital Crown. One of his best theories, although it’s definitely a little crazy, is that the tip of the crown is actually a miniature LCD screen on the Apple Watch Edition, which changes its color when you swap in new bands!

That’s an awesome idea, but it seems a little out there, even for Apple. But if that’s not it, what is it? Moren ultimately says the simplest solution is probably the best one.

Let’s go with the simplest solution: you’ll probably pick the accent color when you buy it, and then basically be stuck with it, no matter which band you choose. The thinking perhaps being that most people will stick with a single watchband, viewing the whole watch-plus-band as a single unit (like most fancy watches). Cool as swappable crowns would be, I’m hard pressed to imagine that the crowd Apple wants this model to appeal to — the fashion-conscious market — is going to be keeping track of or swapping out replacement dots/crowns.

I think that’s probably right. For one thing, replacing a small dot on the end of a Digital Crown is a lot more fiddly than the kind of solution Apple usually favors. For another, I doubt that most people will really care that the small dot at the tip of the crown doesn’t match the band.

But here’s a thought. The Digital Crown is probably the part of the Apple Watch that will wear out the quickest, since you’ll be constantly twisting and turning it to interact with your device. For the expensive Apple Watch Edition devices, which could cost thousands of dollars, is it really so crazy to think that Apple might not make it easy to swap out the Digital Crown in case it gets worn out? And if it does, selling a replacement Digital Crown along with every Apple Watch band would be a fairly trivial thing to do.

What do you think? How will Apple handle this?

Pictures of the blast at a small domestic pipeline near Riyadh were posted on Twitter, sending prices of North Sea crude up almost $2 within minutes, before the benchmark fell back to its previous trading range. Brent had been trading down around 0.5pc at just over $82 per barrel before the blast.

Saudi Arabia is the world's largest exporter of crude and has the capacity to pump up to 12.5m barrels per day (bpd) of oil. The kingdom is the most influential member of the Organisation of Petroleum Exporting Countries (Opec) as it accounts for about a third of the group's supplies.

The unconfirmed pipeline blast follows a period of violence in Saudi Arabia's volotile Eastern Province, where much of its oil is produced. Masked men are understood to have killed at least five people earlier this week in a Shiite village near the town of Qatif, which is a predominantly Shia area of the Sunni-Muslim controlled kingdom.

ARABIAN SECURITY SOURCE SAYS FIRE OCCURRED IN AN OIL PIPELINE, NOT TERRORIST ATTACK.

FIRE BROKE OUT DURING REPAIERS, NOW UNDER CONTROL

* * *

It appears Saudi markets are back in play. As Bloomberg's Richard Breslow noted this morning, Riyal forwards have jerked notably higher (implying weakness expected) and the Tadawul All Share Index has dropped 7% in the last 2 days after the killing of Shi'ites by unknown parties and now news that a pipeline has exploded. As Breslow warns, ""if that indeed signifies the spread of Islamic State into Saudi Arabia, it would be the first time they crossed Saudi borders. That would be a big deal and a major escalation of problems over in that part of the world, far beyond what it would do to capital markets.""

Yesterday there were attacks on Shi'ites (as Reuters reported)

Saudi security forces on Tuesday shot dead a member of an armed group that killed five people in an overnight attack on Shi'ite Muslims marking an important religious anniversary, al-Arabiya television reported. The late Monday assault on a Shi'ite gathering in al-Ahsa district is likely to test already strained relations between Sunnis and Shi'ites across the Middle East because it coincided with the annual Ashoura commemoration of Shi'ite Islam. The Dubai-based al-Arabiya said security forces who had been hunting suspects in the al-Ahsa attack clashed with and killed ""a wanted man"" at a rest area in the al-Qassim province, north-west of the capital Riyadh.

... and today, what is allegedly an Aramco pipeline, just exploded near the town of Sudair, south of Riyadh.

The Region:

Has sent stocks and the currency reeling.

In a way, the store will reportedly be just an extension of what Amazon already does in its physical spaces. Amazon will accept returns at the location, and will use it as a mini-warehouse particularly tuned for same-day delivery of products in New York. You'll also be able to pick up online orders at the store, meaning you'll be able to buy online and get items even faster. Amazon may also use the store to show off its Kindle and Fire products, which seems like a spectacularly obvious thing to do but is evidently still only being considered.

Amazon's been thinking about physical stores for years

Of course, there's potential to do much more. Amazon's been building to this: the company launched a tool for identifying products, a card-reader for buying them, and much more that suggests it could quickly build a full-fledged physical retail space. It's been rumored for years that Amazon would do this, and even now Amazon tells the Journal that this is just an experiment.

The new brick-and-mortar shop is actually across the street from the Empire State Building, so it's clearly primo real estate. That's surely why analysts think that Amazon is opening the space as a marketing effort. It doesn't hurt that the company will be able to show off its (now sizable) lineup of products, including Kindles of all kinds and the new Fire phone. The store will also handle pick-ups and returns.

But are we giving the company credit where credit is due?

Let’s face it, after a harrowing 18-minute customer service call went viral in July, it looked like Comcast had nothing more to strive for — it had reached peak horrible. Yet, if reports this week are accurate, Comcast has continued to shine as an innovator in the competitive field of corporate terribleness: It got a customer’s employer to fire him for complaining about shoddy customer service.

The full story in all its sadistic glory is at Consumerist, but here’s the SparkNotes version. A customer named “Conal” started subscribing to Comcast service in early 2013. There were issues: erroneous charges, bills that never arrived, discounts that weren’t applied. Conal considered cancelling his service, but decided to stick with it after a Comcast rep promised that the issues would be resolved and threw in some free perks. As another friendly gesture, the company also allegedly sent and billed Conal for $1,820 of equipment he’d never ordered.

This is where it gets crazy. Conal, understandably frustrated, decided to bypass the customer service department and take his complaints straight to the Comcast controller. During the call, he claims, he suggested that a private-sector oversight group look into Comcast’s billing and accounting issues. Shortly after that call, Comcast contacted Conal’s employer — a large accounting firm that Consumerist reports happened to do business with Comcast. The rep claimed that Conal had name-dropped his employer as leverage during the call; according to the story, the firm opened an investigation against Conal and then fired him from his job.

It’s hard to know who’s telling the truth here. Conal tells Consumerist that he never mentioned his employer and that someone at Comcast must have looked him up to figure out where he worked. Comcast, for its part, has allegedly refused to release any tapes of the phone calls it made on the matter. That’s a little strange: If Conal did invoke his company’s name in a threatening way, Comcast could easily prove as much by excerpting the relevant portion of his call. So much for monitoring “for quality assurance purposes.” If you want it done right, record the call yourself.

Phone calls lead to recorded run-arounds that resolve nothing while wasting the customer’s time. If a live customer service representative is actually reached, they may cheerily declare a customer’s problem solved, only for said customer to later find out that their problem is still alive and well. And sometimes companies have insulated themselves so well against customer complaints that the customer is simply left to pound sand.

But a company that will get you fired from your job for complaining to them? Ladies and Gentlemen, please welcome, Comcast!

While definitely not Comcast’s first trip to the bad customer service rodeo, this latest case may trump all others, with Comcast getting a guy named Conal fired from his company following ongoing problems he was having with Comcast, reports the Consumerist.

Conal, an employee with a prominent accounting firm, received wrong products, extra products he didn’t request or need, wrong bills, and unwarranted bills – in other words a virtual blizzard of frustrating gaffes by Comcast that he could not get resolved through Comcast customer service. So, he went above their heads to the Comcast powers that be, including their controller.

An unforeseen conflict that Conal didn’t recognize, however, is that his company did business with Comcast. One of the higher ups at Comcast did see this though, and headed back over to Conal’s employer apparently intent on turning Conal’s complaints to Comcast against him.

This obviously influential Comcast executive had discussions about Conal with one of the partners in Conal’s company, and Conal got the boot shortly thereafter.

Conal says he’d only ever received positive reviews for his work, but the company claims he tried to use their name to get leverage in his dispute with Comcast. Conal maintains he did no such thing and can only surmise that someone from Comcast did some online sleuthing and figured out the connection with where he worked. This seemingly allowed Comcast to do some leveraging of their own to get Conal fired for daring to complain about their services.

In the end, Conal’s employer says they fired him based on an email from Comcast that gave an overview of Conal’s alleged wrongdoings via his interactions with Comcast employees.

Conal, meanwhile, says he’s never been allowed to see that email to check its veracity, and Comcast won’t release any documentation they have regarding his situation, either.

So, now stuck in a literal corporate nightmare, beneath both his own disloyal, former company and Comcast, Conal is left with little recourse, though he has retained a lawyer that has reportedly been in touch with Comcast.

The old adage about the customer always being right certainly doesn’t seem to hold any water in Conal’s dealings with Comcast.

But Business Insider reports that, as also mentioned above, Conal isn’t the first victim of Comcast’s alleged less-than-stellar customer service.

Below, please enjoy some of Comcast’s more well-known, documented, customer service fails.

In addition to the controversy over the phone’s reported tendency to bend, and the debacle over iOS 8, Apple is now being targeting for the iPhone 6’s supposed random habit of pulling out users hair, both from the head and the beard. Apple has always claimed the device is a smartphone, but one has to question the need for the ability to pull-off such a feat.

The problem seems to occur due to what users believe is a small seam between the iPhone 6’s metal casing and the glass screen. Although the situation has not turned into an epidemic, and has not stopped people lining up to buy the device, it does seem to be creating a large amount of conversation on Social Media sites such as Facebook and Twitter.

Hairgate has its own Facebook page on which users are commenting on, and sharing images of hairs caught in Apple’s trap; a device which measures a petite 138.1 x 67 x 6.9 mm. Twitter has also joined the party with dozens of users regularly tweeting comments about personal experiences and links to internet articles. Twitter user Muttly_is tweeted, “No longer the hairy dog I once was thanks to the plucking iPhone 6 relieving me of my ear fur. Ouch! Owooo!”, and mooretobyneeded tweeted, “Had a nice shave with my iPhone 6 this morning…” So far there doesn’t appear to be an official response from Apple about the Hairgate scandal, and a quick search of their website found no matching results.

However it is not all bad news, as the team from GottaBeMobile said in their article discussing iPhone 6 users’ claims that Hairgate has added to Apple’s problems. “Frankly, it hasn’t happened to any of us…” they wrote. Other sites are also supporting the “no-pull” side of the debate by trying to dispel myth with fact. A recent article on Forbes said “…it’s nonsense.” According to Forbes contributor Gordon Kelly, the gap between the front glass and the aluminum casing does not exist. “There is a bevel, but the glass front panel is actually fused to the aluminium and the tiny gap you do see is significantly narrower than a human hair,” Kelly wrote. Kelly goes on to discuss the Samsung Galaxy Note 4, which was branded with the label “Gapgate” due to an actual gap in the tablet’s seam, yet survived without “widespread reports of hair trauma.”

Many people cannot resist the opportunity to make a joke of an issue that sounds too ludicrous to be taken seriously, and the internet is a perfect audience. However most internet users have the ability to be wary and decide for themselves if a photo or video is genuine, or simply created to demonstrate an idea. iPhone 6 and Twitter user JustAlly tweeted, “I have big curly hair that gets caught in EVERYTHING, and it has never been caught in my iPhone 6. I say hairgate was started by Samsung.” When read together with other comments suggesting it is a covert DNA sourcing operation, it is hard to believe either suggestion.

Numerous news articles and Social Media comments about users’ problems with Apple’s iPhone 6 have surfaced since its release last month, and Hairgate has been successfully added. That does not necessarily mean the end of iPhone’s popularity on the market. Mashable also disputes the complaints with a video showing people rubbing the iPhone 6 on their hair and beards. “We’ve gone with beards and curly hair and long hair, short hair, your hair, my hair,” reporter Christina Warren said in the video. “Hairgate is not a thing,” Warren said. Perhaps Hairgate is simply a clever rumour created by Apple to encourage people to buy it and try it, after all, the saying goes that “any publicity is good publicity.”

REDWOOD CITY (CBS SF) — Google is playing the real estate market like a game of monopoly out of what could be a massive hiring spree.

The Mercury News is reporting that based on Google’s hiring patterns, it could add as many as 20,000 workers across Silicon Valley over the next couple of years.

Most of Google’s big-time spending is outside of its Mountain View home base. It already bought six buildings in the Pacific Shores office complex on the Redwood City waterfront, and leased an entire campus under construction in Sunnyvale.

“It’s going to make the rents go up,” Perazzo said. “But it’s also going to help businesses around here.”

Rick Perazzo says Redwood City was just a tiny town 40 years ago. Once Google moves in, it’ll be a certified tech town.

“I think Google made a great choice in choose Redwood City,” Pedro said. “It’s midpoint between San Jose and San Francisco, close to the ferry terminal which is going to be a major factor for regional transportation going forward.”

Robert Pedro runs Signature Realty based in Redwood City. He says the downtown area is getting ready for a flood of tech workers. Apartment rents here have already shot up 30 percent in a year.

“Right now we have experiences tremendous upward pressure on rental prices,” Pedro says.

Over the next two years, the city has plans to add ten new apartment buildings.

Redwood City resident Kat Petrick said it’s likely to worsen traffic. “We are pretty congested especially at lunch hour,” she said. “A lot of the local people, it’s hard to find parking.”

The two latest real estate projects in Redwood City and the other in Sunnyvale are not yet ready. Insiders say Google intends to hire about 5,000 workers every year, over the next five years.

Google reportedly bought the properties at the waterfront Pacific Shores Center office park from Starwood Capital Group and Blackstone Group, according to Bloomberg News. Redwood City is approximately 11 miles northwest of Google's Mountain View campus.

The new office buildings are likely so the tech company can expand hiring and acquisitions. Bloomberg News cites $1 billion in office-lease agreements made this month according to an SEC filing. “We expect to continue to hire aggressively for the remainder of 2014,” Google said in the document. “Acquisitions will also remain an important component of our strategy.”

Employees are up about 19 percent from last year. The company has 55,030 employees as of Sept. 30.

Neither Google nor the investment firms wanted to comment on the story.

The new properties make up about 934,200 square feet of Class A office space, including a 38,000-square-foot fitness center, and consist of six buildings addressed from 1200 to 1900 Seaport Boulevard. The office space is next to part of the San Francisco Bay Wildlife Refuge.

NEW YORK (AP) — Hewlett-Packard is splitting itself into two companies, one focused on its personal computer and printing business and another on technology services, such as data storage, servers and software, as it aims to drive profits higher.

Hewlett-Packard, like other PC makers, has been facing changing consumer tastes — moving away from desktops and laptops and toward smartphones and tablets. It has also faced revenue declines 11 of the past 12 quarters. The company laid off tens of thousands of people in recent years as sales crumbled.

The planned breakup follows other big companies that have spun off business units in order to drive growth. EBay Inc. this month said it would spin off its fastest growing segment, payment service PayPal, into a separate and publicly traded company.

(AP Photo/Paul Sakuma, File)

The shared hope is that the two units will be worth more separately and be able to grow more quickly apart than they can together.

HP said Monday that the PC and printer business will use the name HP Inc. The services business will be called Hewlett-Packard Enterprise. HP CEO Meg Whitman will lead the Enterprise business. HP PC and printer chief Dion Weisler will be CEO of HP Inc.

""The decision to separate into two market-leading companies underscores our commitment to the turnaround plan,"" Whitman said. ""It will provide each new company with the independence, focus, financial resources, and flexibility they need to adapt quickly to market and customer dynamics.""

Cantor Fitzgerald's Brian White said that there are numerous reasons why HP would want to split the businesses, including the slowdown of the PC market since the iPad debuted in April 2010. While the PC market has shown some improving trends this year, White said in a client note that separating into two companies gives HP the option to sell off one or both businesses if an attractive offer is made.

The split, if approved by the company board, is expected to close by the end of fiscal 2015. Once complete, HP stockholders will own shares of both companies.

During its most recent quarter HP reported revenue of $27.6 billion, a 1 percent annual gain. It marked HP's first year-over-year increase in quarterly revenue since late 2011. Printers and computers contributed 51 percent of the company's quarterly revenue, with the rest coming from technology services like consulting, software and financial programs.

HP is expected to complete the latest round of layoffs, between 11,000 to 16,000 people, this month. That is on top of the 34,000 people it had already jettisoned from its payroll.

Jim Suva of Citi Investment Research said that HP's announcement may be coming now partly because the stock market has been supportive of spinoffs of late. The analyst also believes the company's stronger balance sheet, stable PC margins, improving services margins, better financials and completion of the more difficult parts of its restructuring efforts played a role in its decision to act now.

HP maintained its guidance for fiscal 2014 adjusted earnings between $3.70 and $3.74 per share. Analysts polled by FactSet predict earnings of $3.73 per share.

For fiscal 2015, the company anticipates adjusted earnings in a range of $3.83 to $4.03 per share. Wall Street is looking for $3.96 per share."

By Supantha Mukherjee and Edwin Chan

Oct 6 (Reuters) - Hewlett-Packard Co said it would split into two listed companies, separating its computer and printer businesses from its faster-growing corporate hardware and services operations, and eliminate another 5,000 jobs as part of its turnaround plan.

HP said its shareholders would own a stake in both businesses through a tax-free transaction next year. Each business contributes about half of HP's revenue and profit.

Shares of the 75-year-old company, which has struggled to adapt to the new era of mobile and online computing, were up 4.4 percent at $36.78 in late morning trading on Monday.

Chief Executive Meg Whitman told Reuters the newly created HP Inc would mostly stick to its knitting - PCs and printers - for now, while exploring related markets such as 3D printing.

The company has no plans to venture into the hotly contested consumer mobile devices market, where it stumbled years ago.

""There's still lots of opportunities in other adjacencies, where we don't chase the market leaders,"" said Whitman, who will be CEO of HP Enterprise, the business that will sell computer servers and networking gear and data storage to businesses.

Whitman said HP's balance sheet had improved markedly over the past few years, allowing the company to come to the decision to split up from a position of strength.

""This would not have been possible three years ago,"" she said, referring to a proposal to spin off PCs in 2011.

Some analysts expressed skepticism about the latest move.

Barclays analysts noted that the sudden announcement in 2011 was disruptive to HP's sales, its sales force and demand.

""If the (latest) decision by HP isn't well communicated or is not well executed, the negative share shifts could be material,"" they said in a note.

Analysts at Bernstein Research also warned of ""material negative synergies"" and one-time costs associated with the spinoff, largely in purchasing but also in distribution. The separation, they said, was fueled by weakness, not strength.

A spinoff of the PC business was last proposed in 2011 by then-Chief Executive Leo Apotheker. HP later ditched the plan - and Apotheker, replacing him with Whitman.

HP said it planned to cut 5,000 more jobs as part of its multi-year restructuring, raising the total under Whitman to 55,000. The company currently has more than 300,000 employees.

The separation will result in a fundamental reshaping of one of technology's most important pioneers, which is on track to generate $112 billion in revenue in the fiscal year this month.

While there were skeptics, many investors and analysts had called for a break-up of HP or a sale of the PC business so that HP could focus on the more profitable side of its operations.

""Shareholders will now be able to invest in the respective asset groups without the fear of cross-subsidies and inefficiencies that invariably plague large business conglomerates,"" Ralph Whitworth, former HP chairman and founder of Relational Investors LLC, said in a statement.

Relational owns a 1.49 percent stake in HP.

HP is the latest in a line of companies to spin off operations in an attempt to become more agile and capitalize on faster-growing businesses.

Online auction company eBay Inc, which was formerly run by Whitman, said last week it would spin off electronic payment service PayPal.

""We like the spin and believe it could create additional value over time,"" UBS analyst Steven Milunovich, wrote. ""In our view, focus is more important than synergies, and it is hard to be good at both consumer and enterprise computing.""

HP's printing and PC business will be led by Dion Weisler, currently an executive in that division. Whitman will be chairman of HP Inc."

Following rumors over the weekend, HP is announcing today that it will separate its PC and printer division from its enterprise and services business. The split means current CEO Meg Whitman will become the chairman of the PC and printer operation, and continue as CEO of the split-off enterprise business. Dion Weisler, an executive at HP’s PC business, will take over as CEO of the company’s PC and printer operation.

HP Enterprise is the newly split-off part of the original company, and HP Inc will continue to focus on PCs and printers. ""The decision to separate into two market-leading companies underscores our commitment to the turnaround plan,"" says HP CEO Meg Whitman. ""It will provide each new company with the independence, focus, financial resources, and flexibility they need to adapt quickly to market and customer dynamics, while generating long-term value for shareholders."" HP is planning to complete the split by the end of fiscal 2015, and the structure will mean the company's total planned layoffs will rise to 55,000 from an earlier estimate of 45,000 to 50,000 cuts.

A change in direction for a struggling PC maker

Today’s split is a significant change for the company, following rumors from 2011 that HP was considering a similar split at the time. Those reports surfaced shortly before HP appointed Meg Witman as CEO, just 11 months after former CEO Leo Apotheker took over from Mark Hurd after he was forced to resign amidst charges of inappropriate business conduct. Apotheker spearheaded a disastrous acquisition of Autonomy, and failed to capitalize on the company’s purchase of webOS.

Whitman’s era at HP has seen the company struggle to cement a solid position in the industry, leaving Lenovo to dominate PC sales worldwide. Whitman’s initial assessment of the company after around six months left her feeling it was ""too complex and too slow,"" noting it had underinvested in its PC division. Instead of significant investment, Whitman claimed in 2012 that the company had to offer a smartphone, before failing to announce one in 2013. Board members reportedly mulled spinning off the company’s consumer PC business in 2013, but it never happened. HP has recently focused on Android tablets, and even an Android laptop, after describing Microsoft as an ""outright competitor.""

HP and Microsoft appear to be forming a closer relationship with the launch of new low-cost Stream PCs. Although Lenovo continues to push Windows-based PCs, Microsoft still needs close PC allies as it demonstrated with a $2 billion loan to help Dell go private last year. That particular deal may have angered HP, but the renewed partnership will see Microsoft and HP take on Chromebooks this holiday season. HP is also planning to sell a smartwatch this fall.

A new HP says it will focus on ""new computing experiences"" and technologies like 3D printing. ""As the market leader in printing and personal systems, an independent HP Inc. will be extremely well positioned to deliver that innovation across our traditional markets as well as extend our leadership into new markets like 3-D printing and new computing experiences -- inventing technology that empowers people to create, interact and inspire like never before,"" says Dion Weisler, head of HP's Printing and Personal Systems business."

The [company]Hewlett-Packard[/company] enterprise unit, comprising servers, storage, networking, converged systems, services and software and the OpenStack Helion cloud, will be led by Meg Whitman as president and CEO. Pat Russo will be chairman of that board.

The PC and printer entity, to be known as HP Inc., will be led by Dion Weisler as president and CEO, with Whitman as chairman. The Wall Street Journal (registration required) was first to report this news Sunday afternoon.

Here’s a glimpse at how the two companies will look:

“Our work during the past three years has significantly strengthened our core businesses to the point where we can more aggressively go after the opportunities created by a rapidly changing market,” Whitman said in a statement. “The decision to separate into two market-leading companies underscores our commitment to the turnaround plan. It will provide each new company with the independence, focus, financial resources, and flexibility they need to adapt quickly to market and customer dynamics, while generating long-term value for shareholders.”

HP, truly an iconic IT company, has been slammed in the past decade by the shift to mobile devices and cloud and a series of management fiascos including the short-lived tenure of former CEO Leo Apotheker. Under his watch, the company considered selling off its still huge PC business, a plan that was scotched by Whitman when she took the reins in 2011. The rationale behind holding onto the PC business was that it gave HP huge volume buying power advantages in procuring chips and other components for its server business as well.

Toni Sacconaghi, senior analyst with Bernstein Research, wrote in a note that while a split up of HP is hardly a new topic, his take is that the spin off seems to be “fueled by weakness at HP rather than strength.” He also noted that HP in the past few months “came close” to buying Rackspace for nearly $6 billion; nearly bought EMC and “apparently has shopped various parts of its portfolio PCs, its Unix business, IT Services.”

In another research report released before the news was official, Wells Fargo analyst Maynard Um wrote:

We believe a separation may suggest HP could become more active in both divestitures and acquisitions, which we believed would be increasingly necessary in FY2015. While this is somewhat of an about face from its prior stance that it was “better together”, we believe this, if true, is likely to be driven by competitive market dynamics as well as a stabilization in its PC business.

The separation, which HP said will be tax-free to shareholders in terms of federal income taxes, is slated to be done by the end of HP’s 2015 fiscal year, ending October 31, 2015.

Technology giant Hewlett-Packard, known as HP, is to split itself into two separate companies.

The US firm will separate its better-performing computer and printer business from its corporate hardware and services operations.

Shareholders will be given a stake in both businesses.

The split is part of a radical restructuring plan, which has already resulted in tens of thousands of job cuts in recent years.

Investors cheered the news, sending HP's shares up nearly 5% in early trading on Wall Street.

Rapid change

The firm is now in the fourth year of its five-year turnaround plan, aimed at helping the firm adapt to the new era of mobile and online computing.

Current chief executive Meg Whitman, who has the job of reviving the fortunes of the 75-year-old firm, will head the new spin-off, Hewlett Packard Enterprise.

This will house the corporate hardware and services operations.

She will also be chairman of HP's printing and PC business, HP Inc, which last quarter accounted for about half its revenue and profit.

Ms Whitman said the split would give both firms the ""flexibility they need to adapt quickly to market and customer dynamics"".

""We can [now] more aggressively go after the opportunities created by a rapidly changing market,"" she added.

HP said it expected the division to be complete by the end of the 2015 financial year.

Split opinion

Analysts said it was still unclear how the split would help HP to compete against its rivals, and whether the two divisions would ultimately end up competing with one another.

""Both operations have seen declining revenue, and many are likely to question whether independence can change their fortunes,"" said Arnaud Gagneux at analyst firm CCS Insight.

""The cost of the separate marketing, finance and purchasing departments for the two entities will increase HP's spending, and the loss of some economies of scale may affect HP when purchasing components.""

However, Cantor Fitzgerald analyst Brian White said that separating into two companies would give HP the option to sell off one or even both businesses if an attractive offer was made.

Business pressures

The division of HP's businesses comes at a time when other large tech firms are being urged to break up.

Last week, online auction site eBay announced it was splitting off its payments system PayPal into a separate company.

HP has been under pressure from newer rivals such as Chinese firm Lenovo, which overtook HP as the world's largest PC maker in 2012. Third-ranked US rival Dell was taken private last year.

Founded by Bill Hewlett and Dave Packard in 1939, HP helped usher in the PC revolution and now has more than 300,000 employees globally."

WASHINGTON (AP) — Hewlett-Packard Co., the iconic maker of personal computers and printers, reportedly plans to split itself into two separate companies by spinning off its technology services business.

The Wall Street Journal reported the pending split Sunday citing people familiar with the matter, who said an official announcement could come as soon as Monday. A spokeswoman for HP declined to comment on the report.

The breakup would create one company that sells HP's computers and printers and a second that focuses on technology services, including data storage, servers and software.

The Palo Alto, California-based company has laid off tens of thousands of employees in recent years due to flagging sales as consumers turn to mobile devices to perform basic computing chores. The shift has curbed demand for HP's desktop and laptop computers, as well as its printers.

In its most recent quarter, HP posted revenue of $27.6 billion, up 1 percent at the same time last year. Although only a slight uptick, it marked HP's first year-over-year gain in quarterly revenue since its fiscal third quarter in 2011.

Printers and computers contributed 51 percent of the company's quarterly revenue, with the rest coming from four businesses that offer various technology services, including consulting, software and financial programs.

HP previously announced plans to wrap up between 11,000 to 16,000 layoffs by October, expanding upon the 34,000 employees that it had already jettisoned from its payroll.

The Wall Street Journal claims that the tech giant is about to split into two companies, one focused on PCs and the other dedicated solely to corporate hardware and services. If the report is accurate, the separation could be announced as early as Monday. The exact reasoning behind the move hasn't been mentioned, but the PC-centric group would be headed by one of its existing executives, Dion Weisler; current CEO Meg Whitman would run the business group and keep an eye on the other company by serving as its chairman of the board. However true the rumor may be, such a move wouldn't be all that surprising -- much of the computing industry has been restructuring and rescaling to cope with a world where the PC's role is rapidly evolving.

Update: Recode also says it's aware of the split, and has an explanation for it. Supposedly, HP had no luck in early talks to sell its PC division to Dell or Lenovo. It had similar problems offloading server and services groups, and a merger with the data storage gurus at EMC also wasn't meant to be. The breakup would effectively revive plans shelved when CEO Leo Apotheker got the boot in 2011; getting rid of less successful products (in this case, PCs) would improve the chances of an EMC merger or similar deals.

Update 2: HP has now confirmed the news. In a filing with the SEC, the company states that it plans to split into two publicly traded companies. Its consumer-focused PC, tablet, and printing efforts will continue on under the HP banner, while a new company named Hewlett-Packard Enterprise will focus on ""enterprise technology infrastructure"" and ""software and services businesses."" Meg Whitman, the current CEO of HP, will take the reins at Hewlett-Packard Enterprise, while Dion Weisler, the company's EVP for Printing and Personal Systems, will lead the new HP.

The company also announced an increase in the number of layoffs for this financial year. It had previously estimated 45,000-50,000 employees would be leaving the company, but that figure has now risen to 55,000."

HP is splitting its personal-computer and printer segments from its corporate hardware and services business. The PC/printer company will be called HP. The remaining units will be called Hewlett-Packard Enterprise. Both will be public companies. The stock split is intended to be a tax-free transaction for existing shareholders. The Wall Street Journal first reported the story.



The company reorganized itself in 2012 under CEO Meg Whitman. That move combined its computer and printer businesses.

The PC and computer segment is massive for HP. It accounts for half of the company's revenue. For the first six months this year, it reported $27.8 billion in revenue. That's about three times the size of HP's next biggest unit, the Enterprise Group, which makes servers, storage, and network hardware.

Under the new split, Whitman is chairman of the computer and printer business, and she remains CEO of the separate HP Enterprise company. Patricia Russo, who sits on HP's board, is chairman of the enterprise company. Dion Weisler, who currently leads the printer and PC operation, is being named CEO of the new printer/PC company.



Whitman has said since 2012 that fixing the supply chain is one of HP's biggest priorities to get the company back on track in terms of revenues and profits. HP reported a beat on revenue for its third quarter, and its profits were right in line.

This isn't the first time HP has been toying with the idea of strategic moves. For almost a year it has contemplated merging with EMC to create what would be one of the biggest enterprise companies in the world. But talks apparently fell through, The Journal reported.

And HP isn't the only company that sees benefit in splitting itself to create a more-focused company. eBay announced last week that it was spinning off PayPal into a separate business starting next year.

Here is the press release HP issued Monday morning:

HP to Separate Into Two New Industry-Leading Public Companies

Hewlett-Packard Enterprise Will Define the Next Generation of Technology Infrastructure, Software and Services for the New Style of IT

HP Inc. Will Be the Leading Personal Systems and Printing Company Delivering Innovations That Will Empower People to Create, Interact and Inspire Like Never Before

Strategic Step Provides Each New Company With the Focus, Financial Resources and Flexibility to Adapt Quickly to Market and Customer Dynamics While Generating Long-Term Value for Shareholders

PALO ALTO, CA--(Marketwired - Oct 6, 2014) - HP (NYSE: HPQ)

Highlights:

Hewlett-Packard Enterprise will build upon HP's leading position in servers, storage, networking, converged systems, services and software as well as its OpenStack Helion cloud platform

Meg Whitman to be President and Chief Executive Officer of Hewlett-Packard Enterprise; Pat Russo to be Chairman of Hewlett-Packard Enterprise Board

HP Inc. will be the leading personal systems and printing company with a strong roadmap into the most exciting new technologies like 3D printing and new computing experiences

Dion Weisler to be President and Chief Executive Officer of HP Inc.; Meg Whitman to be Chairman of the HP Inc. Board

Company reiterates fiscal 2014 non-GAAP diluted net earnings per share (EPS) outlook of $3.70 to $3.74 and updates GAAP diluted net EPS outlook to $2.60 to $2.64

Company issues fiscal 2015 non-GAAP diluted net EPS outlook of $3.83 to $4.03 and GAAP diluted net EPS outlook of $3.23 to $3.43

HP (NYSE: HPQ) today announced plans to separate into two new publicly traded Fortune 50 companies: one comprising HP's market-leading enterprise technology infrastructure, software and services businesses, which will do business as Hewlett-Packard Enterprise, and one that will comprise HP's market-leading personal systems and printing businesses, which will do business as HP Inc. and retain the current logo. Immediately following the transaction, which is expected to be completed by the end of fiscal 2015, HP shareholders will own shares of both Hewlett-Packard Enterprise and HP Inc. The transaction is intended to be tax-free to HP's shareholders for federal income tax purposes.

Today's announcement comes as HP approaches the fourth year of its five-year turnaround plan. Over this time, the company has executed successfully against its turnaround objectives, keeping customers and partners at the forefront. HP has reignited its innovation pipeline, strengthened its go-to-market capabilities, rebuilt its balance sheet, and inspired its workforce and management teams. The company is now positioned to accelerate performance, drive sustained growth and demonstrate clear industry leadership in key areas.

""Our work during the past three years has significantly strengthened our core businesses to the point where we can more aggressively go after the opportunities created by a rapidly changing market,"" said Meg Whitman, Chairman, President and Chief Executive Officer of HP. ""The decision to separate into two market-leading companies underscores our commitment to the turnaround plan. It will provide each new company with the independence, focus, financial resources, and flexibility they need to adapt quickly to market and customer dynamics, while generating long-term value for shareholders. In short, by transitioning now from one HP to two new companies, created out of our successful turnaround efforts, we will be in an even better position to compete in the market, support our customers and partners, and deliver maximum value to our shareholders.""

Both companies will be well capitalized and expect to have investment grade credit ratings and capital structures optimized to reflect their distinct growth opportunities and cash flow profiles. The separation into independent publicly traded companies will provide each company with its own, more focused equity currency, and investors with the opportunity to invest in two companies with compelling and unique financial profiles well suited to their respective businesses.

Management Structure

Meg Whitman, President and Chief Executive Officer of HP, and Cathie Lesjak, Chief Financial Officer of HP, will hold these positions with Hewlett-Packard Enterprise. When the separation is complete, Whitman will also serve on the Board of Directors of Hewlett-Packard Enterprise, and Pat Russo will move from Lead Independent Director of HP to Chairman of Hewlett-Packard Enterprise.

Dion Weisler, Executive Vice President of HP's Printing and Personal Systems business, will lead HP Inc. as President and Chief Executive Officer. Whitman will serve as non-executive Chairman of HP Inc.'s Board of Directors.

Hewlett-Packard Enterprise

Hewlett-Packard Enterprise will have a unique portfolio and strong multi-year innovation roadmap across technology infrastructure, software and services to allow customers to take full advantage of the opportunities presented by cloud, big data, security and mobility in the New Style of IT. By leveraging its HP Financial Services capability, the company will be well positioned to create unique technology deployment models for customers and partners based on their specific business needs. Additionally, the company intends for HP Financial Services to continue to provide financing and business model innovation for customers and partners of HP Inc.

Customers will have the same unmatched choice of how to deploy and consume technology, and with a simpler, more nimble partner. The separation will provide additional resources, and a reduction of debt at the operating company level, to support investments across key areas of the portfolio. The separation will also allow for greater flexibility in completing the turnaround of Enterprise Services and strengthening the company's go-to-market capabilities.

""Over the past three years, we have reignited our innovation engine with breakthrough offerings for the enterprise like Apollo, Gen 9 and Moonshot servers, our 3PAR storage platform, our HP OneView management platform, our HP Helion Cloud and a host of software and services offerings in security, analytics and application transformation,"" continued Whitman. ""Hewlett-Packard Enterprise will accelerate innovation across key next-generation areas of the portfolio.""

HP Inc.

HP Inc. will be a proven leader in the personal systems and printing markets with exciting new technologies on the horizon. The new company's strong profitability and free cash flow will enable investments in growth markets such as 3-D printing and new computing experiences. At the same time, HP Inc. will continue to execute against a well-defined and established strategic plan, ensuring continuity for customers and consistent value to shareholders.

""Since assuming responsibility for the Printing and Personal Systems Group, Dion and his leadership team have done an excellent job of building our relationships with customers and channel partners, segmenting the market and driving product innovation,"" added Whitman. ""The creation of HP Inc. will only accelerate the progress the team has made.""

""This is a defining moment in our industry as customers are looking for innovation to enable workforces that are more mobile, connected and productive while at the same time allowing a seamless experience across work and play,"" said Weisler. ""As the market leader in printing and personal systems, an independent HP Inc. will be extremely well positioned to deliver that innovation across our traditional markets as well as extend our leadership into new markets like 3-D printing and new computing experiences -- inventing technology that empowers people to create, interact and inspire like never before.""

Use of non-GAAP financial information

To supplement HP's historical and forecasted financial results presented on a GAAP basis, HP provides non-GAAP diluted net earnings per share. Non-GAAP diluted net earnings per share is defined to exclude the effects of any restructuring charges, charges relating to the amortization of intangible assets and certain other acquisition-related charges recorded or expected to be recorded during the relevant period. In addition, non-GAAP diluted net earnings per share are adjusted by the amount of additional taxes or tax benefit associated with each non-GAAP item. Fiscal 2014 non-GAAP diluted net EPS estimates exclude after-tax costs of approximately $1.10 per share, related primarily to restructuring charges and amortization of intangible assets. Fiscal 2015 non-GAAP diluted net EPS estimates exclude after-tax costs of approximately $0.60 per share, related primarily to amortization of intangible assets and restructuring charges.

HP's management uses non-GAAP financial measures, including HP's non-GAAP diluted net earnings per share, to evaluate and forecast HP's performance before gains, losses or other charges that are considered by HP's management to be outside of HP's core business segment operating results. These non-GAAP financial measures may have limitations as analytical tools, and these measures should not be considered in isolation or as a substitute for analysis of HP's results as reported under GAAP. For example, items such as the amortization of intangible assets, though not directly affecting HP's cash position, represent the loss in value of intangible assets over time. The expense associated with this loss in value is not included in HP's non-GAAP diluted net earnings per share and therefore does not reflect the full economic effect of the loss in value of those intangible assets. In addition, items such as restructuring charges that are excluded from HP's non-GAAP diluted net earnings per share can have a material impact on HP's GAAP diluted net earnings per share. Other companies may calculate non-GAAP diluted net earnings per share differently than HP does, which limits the usefulness of that measure for comparative purposes."

Hewlett-Packard may be ready for a breakup.

HP, the world's second-largest PC vendor behind Lenovo, plans to separate its PC and printer businesses from its corporate hardware and services operations, The Wall Street Journal reported Sunday, citing ""people familiar with the matter."" The company could announce the move as early as Monday, according to the Journal's sources.

HP declined to comment. (Editors' note, Oct. 6 at 4:33 a.m. PT: On Monday, HP officially announced its plans to break into two companies.)

The split is apparently one HP and its investors have been contemplating for a long time, said the Journal. HP's printing and personal systems group, which includes PCs, tablets, printers and other accessories, pulled in revenue of $55.9 billion during the company's 2013 fiscal year, almost half of its total revenue.

If true, the split could in part be an attempt to help HP move quickly to regain its position atop the global PC market -- it fell to the No. 2 spot behind Chinese computer maker Lenovo last year -- as the decline in that market shows signs of slowing.

""We're gradually shaping HP into a more nimble, lower-cost, more customer- and partner-centric company that can successfully compete across a rapidly changing IT landscape,"" CEO Meg Whitman said after the company's second-quarter earnings were released in May. Whitman had previously said the company is seeing renewed interest in traditional PCs over tablets in business.

Even so, HP as currently constituted doesn't have ""enough focus on any one area to really dominate,"" wrote Larry Dignan at CNET sister site ZDNet, in a look at why a breakup of HP would be a good move. Meanwhile, he continued, the ""printer and PC division [are] fighting for innovation spending with the enterprise side of the house. That's a lot of hands in an R&D pie that equates to about 3 percent of revenue.""

Whitman will be chairman of the new PC and printer business and chief executive of the separate ""enterprise company,"" one source told the Journal, while board member Patricia Russo will be chairman of the enterprise company. Don Weisler, the current executive vice president of HP's printing and personal systems group, will step in as CEO of the PC and printer business, according to the Journal.

This isn't the first time HP has attempted to jettison its PC business. In 2011, former Chief Executive Leo Apotheker tried to spin off the company's PC-making division. Investors rejected the move, and Apotheker was forced out. Whitman reversed the decision when she took over as CEO and began a ""multiyear journey"" to revive HP.

Hendrik Hansen / Flickr, CC There may be yet another bug in iOS 8, Apple's latest version of its mobile operating system for iPhone and iPad. This time, some users are reporting that anybody trying to reset the settings on their iPhone could accidentally delete all of their documents saved in iCloud, Apple's online backup service.

MacRumors reports that multiple users of its forums have reported an issue when attempting to reset all settings on their iPhone. Apple informs you as you reset your phone settings that ""no data or media will be deleted,"" but people are claiming that the reset wipes all of their iCloud Drive documents.

The existence of the bug is not yet confirmed. We asked Apple for comment but have not yet heard back.

iCloud Drive is Apple's online file storage solution for documents. According to the official Apple site, iCloud Drive can be used to ""safely store all your presentations, spreadsheets, PDFs, images and any other kind of document in iCloud."" It competes with DropBox and other cloud storage apps.

Forum posts claim that after they complained that a settings reset deleted their files as well, Apple told them the company is waiting on engineers to fix the issue. Another reported that his account was placed in troubleshooting mode as Apple investigated.

One poster on the MacRumors forums has this to say about the problem:

Because iOS 8 was so sluggish on my iPad 3 I reset all settings (No data or media will be deleted) and sped it up BUT deleted my iWork data! Then promptly synced and deleted it in iCloud. I have public beta of Yosemite so can't roll back via time machine. I have no pre iOS 8 backups in iTunes or iCloud to revert to (well iCloud device backups don't contain cloud documents and I should have iOS 7 backups in iTunes but can't find any. iCloud has no trash like dropbox. They seem gone forever.

Last week, security research Stefan Esser noted that QuickType was offering up his unique passwords as autocorrect suggestions, and now MacRumors forum users are reporting that the ‘Reset All Settings’ feature on iOS 8 is deleting iWork documents from the newly-implemented iCloud Drive service.

iOS 8 FAR FROM FLAWLESS: Massive iOS 8 flaw suggests parts of your password in autocomplete

One third-generation iPad user was less than satisfied with the performance of their tablet after updating to iOS 8. In order to fix the problem, they decided to reset all the settings on their iPad, which, according to the text box, should restore the default settings but leave data and media intact. Instead, all of the iWork data disappeared on both the tablet and within iCloud Drive.

MacRumors attempted to recreate the scenario and recorded the same results: files from Apple’s iWork apps, such as Numbers, Page and Keynote, vanished shortly after the settings had been reset. Other files, such as Preview and TextEdit documents, were still accessible.

If you were considering activating iCloud Drive, it might be worth waiting until Apple has time to address this issue. Although it only seems to be affecting iWork apps, users have only just begun to explore the less-than-functional elements of the new software. iOS 8.0.3 might be needed sooner than Apple had planned.

It could delete files stored in the cloud.



The bug was discovered by MacRumors, who found that selecting the “Reset All Settings” option from Settings in iOS 8 will erase iWork-related files in iCloud Drive.

This is not the way it’s supposed to work. When you reset an iPhone or iPad’s settings, iOS will even tell you that no data or media will be deleted. But in iOS 8, this isn’t working as intended.

The good news is if you don’t use iWork, you don’t have anything to fear: The deleted files bug seems to be specific to iWork documents. But you should still probably stay clear of the “Reset All Settings” option until Apple gets this sorted out. Better safe than sorry.

The bug was discovered by MacRumors, who found that selecting the “Reset All Settings” option from Settings in iOS 8 will erase iWork-related files in iCloud Drive.
When you reset an iPhone or iPad’s settings, iOS will even tell you that no data or media will be deleted.
The good news is if you don’t use iWork, you don’t have anything to fear: The deleted files bug seems to be specific to iWork documents.
But you should still probably stay clear of the “Reset All Settings” option until Apple gets this sorted out."

Unfortunately for Apple, things aren't looking much better this week, as MacRumors reports on a particularly nasty iOS 8 bug, which could potentially erase the iWork documents stored in your iCloud drive.

According to the report, the option to ""Reset All Settings,"" found under Settings — General — Reset in iOS 8, also deletes documents from the iCloud Drive — permanently.

The option, which normally resets settings to factory defaults, clearly states that ""no data or media will be deleted."" However, after some users on MacRumors' forum complained about the bug, MacRumors tested the option out, and indeed, all the iWork documents stored in iCloud Drive both on the iPhone and on iCloud.com were gone.

Even worse, after iCloud synced with a Mac running OS X Yosemite, the documents were deleted from the Mac as well. Some of the documents — including Preview and TextEdit files — were untouched, but all iWork files seem to be affected.

In some scenarios it's possible to retrieve these files from a backup folder, or via Time Machine, but nothing is certain at this point, and Apple still hasn't publicly acknowledged the bug. For now, iOS 8 users who have iCloud Drive enabled should probably avoid using the ""Reset All Settings"" option."

An alleged bug in iOS 8 appears to be deleting documents stored in iCloud Drive without the user's permission.

Discovered by MacRumors after complaints surfaced from users of the blog site's forums, the bug is triggered by the option to Reset All Settings.

Found in the Reset screen under the General category in Settings for iOS 8, the Reset All Settings option is supposed to simply reset your iOS settings but leave your data and media untouched. Yet several forum users say that's not the case as certain iCloud documents also vanished after they reset all settings.

Based on user comments, the bug seems to be specific to documents from iWork apps, such as Pages, Keynote, and Numbers, MacRumors said. One user reported that his iWork documents were deleted after resetting all settings, but other data files remained in iCloud.

""HELP,"" one user wrote. ""Because iOS 8 was so sluggish on my iPad 3 I reset all settings (No data or media will be deleted) and sped it up BUT deleted my iWork data! Then promptly synced and deleted it in iCloud.""

""I just had this happen to me,"" another forum user wrote. ""I had a bit of weird behaviour on my iPad, so I figured it wouldn't hurt to just reset all settings. For the hell of it, I did it on my iPhone as well. ALL DOCUMENTS LOST! How on earth does resetting settings (with a clear notice that data will not be lost) wipe out iCloud drive? It's embarassing.""

Apple's Time Machine feature is supposed to automatically back up your files so you can restore any that are lost. A couple of users said they checked Time Machine but were unable to retrieve the lost iCloud Drive files. However, a third person reported success with Time Machine, at least running the beta of OS X Yosemite. Several of the affected users say they've contacted Apple support personnel, who are investigating the issue.

MacRumors ran its own test on the bug and reported the following:

In our own testing, using ""Reset All Settings"" deleted all iWork documents stored in iCloud Drive on the iPhone and on iCloud.com. After allowing time for syncing to a Mac running OS X Yosemite, all of the documents disappeared from that machine as well. Preview and TextEdit documents, which cannot be accessed on the iPhone, remained untouched on the Mac.

iCloud Drive is Apple's answer to Google Drive, Microsoft's OneDrive, and other cloud-based storage services. Beyond just syncing your files between your iOS devices and iCloud, you can directly store and retrieve documents and other files on iCloud Drive just as you can store and retrieve them locally.

According to multiple posters on the MacRumors forums, using the ""Reset All Settings"" option under General --> Reset has caused documents to be permanently deleted from iCloud Drive.

Because iOS 8 was so sluggish on my iPad 3 I reset all settings (No data or media will be deleted) and sped it up BUT deleted my iWork data! Then promptly synced and deleted it in iCloud.I have public beta of Yosemite so can't roll back via time machine. I have no pre iOS 8 backups in iTunes or iCloud to revert to (well iCloud device backups don't contain cloud documents and I should have iOS 7 backups in iTunes but can't find any. iCloud has no trash like dropbox. They seem gone forever.

The ""Reset All Settings"" option explicitly says that ""No data or media will be deleted,"" and it is meant to reset all user preferences to the default out-of-the-box settings. That the option is deleting iCloud Drive documents appears to be a serious bug, though it may be limited to Apple's own iWork apps like Pages, Keynote, and Numbers. One user had all of his iWork documents wiped by using ""Reset All Settings,"" while other app information remained in iCloud.

In our own testing, using ""Reset All Settings"" deleted all iWork documents stored in iCloud Drive on the iPhone and on iCloud.com. After allowing time for syncing to a Mac running OS X Yosemite, all of the documents disappeared from that machine as well. Preview and TextEdit documents, which cannot be accessed on the iPhone, remained untouched on the Mac.

There appears to be no simple way to recover iCloud Drive documents that have been erased by ""Reset All Settings"" in Yosemite, and several people who have been affected by the bug are now in contact with Apple support in an effort to retrieve their documents. A Mavericks user was, however, able to recover his files from a backup folder, and OS X Yosemite users may also have luck with recovering files via Time Machine.

One user said that Apple was waiting on engineers to investigate the issue, while another said his account had been placed in troubleshooting mode to attempt to recover the data.

Introduced with iOS 8 and OS X Yosemite, iCloud Drive is Apple's answer to cloud-based storage services like Dropbox. iCloud Drive allows users to store a variety of documents like spreadsheets, PDFs, images, and more, accessing them on any device. Currently OS X Mavericks users can access iCloud Drive documents via iCloud.com, but iCloud Drive will be fully functional in October, after OS X Yosemite is released.

Users who have iCloud Drive enabled may want to refrain from using the ""Reset All Settings"" option on their devices for the time being, in order to avoid accidentally erasing important documents stored in iCloud Drive."

The rumor of the Beats Music shut down comes mere months after Apple’s plans to buy Beats were first revealed. Here’s what you need to know.

1. Multiple Sources Confirm the End of Beats, but Apple Says It’s Not True

TechCrunch reports that multiple sources have confirmed Apple’s plans to shut down Beats Music, including “several prominent employees at Apple and Beats.” As many as five people close to the deal have confirmed the rumor about the end of Beats Music. However, Apple told Re/code that this rumor wasn’t true, though they didn’t rule out the possibility of a Beats Music rebrand at some point in the future.

2. Beats Music Might End, But Beats Headphones Will Continue

Apple Insider writes “The rumor [about Beats Music shutting down] would suggest that Apple’s $3 billion buyout of Beats was really about the headphones side of the business, as well as the talent and credibility brought on by the ‘acqui-hires’ of Beats’s Jimmy Iovine and Dr. Dre.”

Entrepreneur magazine notes that Apple paid $3.2 billion to acquire Beats earlier this year. The same article notes that Beats has had a rapid rise to the top: In 2012, just four years after Beats began selling headphones, the company had 40 percent market share. The headphone part of the Beats brand is still very much alive and kicking.

3. Beats Music May Get Rolled Into iTunes

Business Insider predicts that the Beats Music streaming service will be absorbed into the larger iTunes ecosystem:

“It’s more likely that Apple will take the Beats Music technology and incorporate it into iTunes and/or iTunes Radio. Apple CEO Tim Cook recently told Charlie Rose that he was so impressed with Beats Music that he “couldn’t sleep” after listening to it for the first time. That doesn’t sound like a product Cook would want to completely kill off. Beats Music also has a neat feature that Apple might want to incorporate into future products. “The sentence” gives users the opportunity to select music based on their activity or location (think “I’m on a boat” or “I’m on a rooftop and feel like going back in time”).”

4. Apple Is Planning A Mysterious New Music Project

The Verge notes that there are rumors that Apple is planning a “significant music announcement” for next year. The shutdown of Beats Music may be the first step towards making that big announcement, whatever it may be.

Apple’s other big announcement in the first half of 2015 will be the official release date of the Apple Watch. Perhaps the Apple Watch will be involved in Apple’s next music project in some way, though it is too early to say so with any degree of certainty.

5. The Beats Music App Was Only Added to Apple TV a Few Days Ago

Apple Insider notes that a Beats Music app was just added to the Apple TV interface on September 17, making the plans for a Beats Music shutdown seem even more surprising. It does seem odd that Apple would add Beats to the Apple TV one week, and then start shutting down the service a week later. It’s fair to assume that if the rumors are true, and Apple is killing Beats Music, it won’t shut down the service overnight.

Some users of the anonymous web browser Tor have reported that Comcast has threatened to cut off their internet service unless they stop using the legal software.

Comcast completely denies their claims. In a blog post, the company said ""We have no policy against Tor, or any other browser or software. Customers are free to use their Xfinity Internet service to visit any website, use any app, and so forth.""

According to a report on Deepdotweb, Comcast customer representatives have branded Tor ""illegal"" and told customers that using it is against the company's policies.

Tor is a type of web browser that, in theory, makes all your internet activity private. The software routes traffic through a series of other connected internet users, making it difficult for governments and private companies to monitor your internet usage. Up to 1.2 million people use the browser, which became especially popular after Edward Snowden leaked information showing that the NSA was eavesdropping on ordinary citizens. Prior to that, Tor had been popular among people transacting business on Silk Road, the online market for drugs and hitmen.

The problem is that downloading or using Tor itself isn't illegal. Plenty of people might have legitimate reasons to want to surf the web in private, without letting others know what they were looking at. But Tor has been pretty popular with criminals.

Some Comcast reps allegedly begun telling users that it is an ""illegal service."" One Comcast representative, identified only as Kelly, warned a customer over his use of Tor software, DeepDotWeb reports:

Users who try to use anonymity, or cover themselves up on the internet, are usually doing things that aren’t so-to-speak legal. We have the right to terminate, fine, or suspend your account at anytime due to you violating the rules. Do you have any other questions? Thank you for contacting Comcast, have a great day.

Comcast customers, speaking to Deepdotweb, claimed that Comcast repeatedly asked them which sites they were accessing using Tor.

In a statement to Business Insider, Comcast refuted the claims made in Deepdotweb, stating that they had launched an internal review into the discussions reported above:

Customers are free to use their Xfinity Internet service to visit any website or use it however they wish otherwise. Like virtually all ISPs, Comcast has an acceptable use policy or AUP that outlines appropriate and inappropriate uses of the service. Comcast doesn’t monitor users’ browser software or web surfing and has no program addressing the Tor browser. he anecdotal chat room evidence provided is not consistent with our agents’ messages and is not accurate. Per our own internal review, we have found no evidence that these conversations took place, nor do we employ a Security Assurance team member named Kelly. Tor’s own FAQs clearly state: 'File sharing (peer-to-peer/P2P) is widely unwanted on Tor' and 'BitTorrent is NOT anonymous' on Tor.

Tesla Motors, the electric carmaker, is planning to build its giant battery factory in Nevada after a five-state competition, according to a source who asked not to be identified because the announcement has not been made.

Nevada Gov. Brian Sandoval has called a news conference for 7 p.m. ET Thursday in Carson City where the deal is expected to be announced.

Tesla had no official comment Wednesday on the pending announcement. Spokesman Simon Sproule said, ""We continue to work with the state of Nevada.""

Tesla CEO Elon Musk has said previously that the winning state would be expected to provide a tax incentives worth about $400 million, a level that would require legislative action in Nevada. Sandoval has ""conferred with legislative leaders"" to call a special session early next week to consider a package for Tesla, reported the Reno Gazette-Journal, citing a source close to legislative leaders. The special session will likely last one or two days.

The so-called ""Gigafactory"" will make advanced batteries expected to power Tesla's next generation of electric cars, as well as have capacity to supply batteries for other carmakers and other battery users, such as utilities.Tesla and partner Panasonic have said they plan to spend $4 billion to $5 billion on the project and employ up to 6,500 at full production.

The plant has been one of the nation's most highly sought projects among state economic development officials.

Tesla recently confirmed that it has been excavating at an industrial park near Reno, but stopped short of saying that it had made it the final choice for plant.

In choosing Nevada, Tesla has picked a location just a few hundred miles from its main assembly plant in Fremont, Calif., and its nearby corporate headquarters in Palo Alto.

CALIFORNIA MISS

The announcement comes after a weekend in which California's legislature adjourned without acting on a bill that could have delivered economic incentives to try to lure Tesla into building the battery plant in the Golden State.

The other states named as contenders for the project were Texas, New Mexico and Arizona.

California state Sen. Ted Gaines, R-Roseville, who led the legislative charge to lure Tesla, said on Tuesday that the company was clearly trying to play the five states off each other to get the best deal. He questioned whether Tesla ever intended to strike a deal with California.

""They were sending a variety of different messages,"" he said. ""Depending on what day you listened to what Tesla was saying, they were saying they'd like to get a deal done as soon as possible, or in six months, or by year's end.""

TEXAS PLAY

Texas and its Gov. Rick Perry made a particularly strong effort to lure Tesla — and the company has indicated it may build a second battery factory.

Musk has said that the plant will enable the company to dramatically lower the cost of automotive-grade lithium-ion batteries, the biggest single cost fact in making an electric car.

Tesla has indicated it was on a tight schedule to get the plant up and running in time for start of production of its third model, the Model III, which is to be a lower-price vehicle aimed at mass-market buyers.

At present, Tesla's only product is the Model S luxury sedan with starting prices from about $75,000 to about $95,000 before government incentives. It's about to start production of an electric crossover, the Model X, but it too will be a high-end luxury vehicle.

California officials, including Gov. Jerry Brown, had aggressively sought the factory, and the decision is a blow to the state’s efforts to attract and retain high-paying manufacturing jobs.

“Tesla looks forward to joining the governor and legislative leaders tomorrow in Carson City,” Tesla spokeswoman Liz Jarvis-Shean said Wednesday in an interview with this newspaper.

Tesla evaluated scores of potential sites in California, Arizona, New Mexico, Nevada and Texas throughout the spring and summer for its battery factory, which CEO Elon Musk has said will eventually produce more lithium-ion batteries than the rest of the world manufactured last year. The fiercely competitive, five-way contest among the states for the proposed factory and its promise of 6,500 manufacturing jobs turned into one of the most high-profile economic development stories in years, with Musk personally engaging in robust discussions with governors, economic development officials and even members of Congress.

The decision is a huge coup for Nevada, which is eager to diversify its tourism-dependent economy and has one of the highest unemployment rates in the country.

Tesla has already excavated on the presumed site at the Tahoe Reno Industrial Center, roughly a four-hour drive from Tesla’s Fremont factory. Casinos — which need a lot of electricity — could be prime customers of Tesla’s energy storage systems. Tesla needs a 500- to 1,000-acre site to accommodate up to 10 million square feet of construction.

“The project is the holy grail sought by the Nevada foot soldiers of economic development,” said John Boyd of The Boyd Co., a New Jersey-based site-selection firm. “It will have a huge economic impact on the housing, hotels, gaming, and construction industries in the Reno area.”

California officials expressed disappointment Wednesday.

“No other state has added more jobs than California since the recovery began and we’ll continue to work closely with businesses, including California-based Tesla, that want to grow here,” Brook Taylor, a spokesman for the Governor’s Office of Business and Economic Development, said in an email Wednesday.

“This can serve as a good learning opportunity for California,” said Jim Wunderman, CEO of the Bay Area Council. “We should look very closely at what factors ultimately led to Tesla choosing Reno, and we should determine what we can do better going forward to attract and retain middle-class jobs in California.”

State Sens. Ted Gaines, R-Roseville, and Darrell Steinberg, D-Sacramento, co-authored a proposed Tesla incentive bill, but it did not advance before the legislative session ended. Tesla had said it expected states to pay about 10 percent, or $500 million, of the gigafactory’s $5 billion cost.

“I offered to drive the legislation if a good deal for California could be reached. Tesla’s demand for taxpayer-dollars upfront, without substantiated guarantees in return, was a bridge too far,” Steinberg said in a statement Wednesday. “California continues to lead the national economic recovery, with many other opportunities ahead.”

A source close to the discussions noted that the only operating lithium company in the country is Rockwood Lithium, which operates in Silver Peak, Nevada, and could easily provide materials needed for Tesla’s lithium-ion batteries.

Nevada Sen. Harry Reid is a vocal advocate of clean energy and is in the midst of hosting his annual National Clean Energy Summit in Las Vegas; Musk spoke at the summit in 2012.

Nevada Gov. Brian Sandoval, a Republican, will convene a special session of the state’s legislature to finalize the details of Nevada’s incentive package, according to a source close to the negotiations; the session could convene as early as Tuesday.

Tesla expects to sell 35,000 all-electric Model S sedans in 2014 and is gearing up production of its Model X SUV, which will hit the market next year. By 2017, it plans to begin delivery of its more affordable “Gen 3” sedan, which it hopes to sell for about $35,000, or roughly half the cost of the cheapest Model S. Driving down the cost of battery packs is key to making electric cars more affordable.

Each Model S sedan is powered by more than 7,000 lithium-ion battery cells, which Tesla gets from Panasonic. While the battery cells are similar to those used in laptops and game consoles, Tesla’s were jointly developed by Tesla and Panasonic specifically for electric vehicles.

Tesla and Panasonic have signed an agreement to collaborate on the gigafactory.

But the gigafactory is not just for car batteries. Tesla is increasingly exploring stationary energy storage for homes, businesses and utilities.

“The gigafactory represents a fundamental change in the way large-scale battery production can be realized,” Tesla Chief Technical Officer JB Straubel said in a statement earlier this summer. “Not only does the gigafactory enable capacity needed for the Model 3 but it sets the path for a dramatic reduction in the cost of energy storage across a broad range of applications.”

Apple is preparing a radical redesign of its MacBook Air than includes just one port to allow Apple to make it even smaller.

The new design was mocked up by 9to5mac after what it claims are leaks of them machine's specs.

It is rumoured to include a single USB type C port - a new design that allows both power and other addons to work through the same connector.

The new design has a slightly narrower keyboard, and four speakers above the keyboard

One port to rule them all: The new design (left) has a single USB 3.0 port and a headphone socket, compared to the power, headphone and USB port on the current model (right)

'The 12-inch MacBook Air will be considerably smaller than the current 13-inch version, yet also slightly narrower than the 11-inch model,' says 9to5Mac's Mark Gurman.

'Sources within Apple, who have used internal prototype versions of the upcoming computer, have provided in-depth details about the machine, and our exclusive artist renditions of the revamped MacBook Air provide the first close look at Apple's first major step in mobile Mac computing since the Retina MacBook Pro launch in 2012.'

Crucially, the machine is also expected to include a Retina screen - something the current model does not.

The upcoming laptop is so thin that Apple employees are said to refer to the device as the 'MacBook Stealth' internally.

Apple's current MacBook range: The new version has a radically different design

Crucially, the machine is also expected to include a Retina screen - something the current model does not.

Late last year Apple's Phil Schiller revealed a new iMac with a high resolution retina display the firm says is the world's highest resolution.

Called the retina 5K display, it boasts 14.7 million pixels, seven times more than a HD TV.

It has 67% more pixels than 4K.

The edge of the machine measures just 5mm.

THE USB TYPE C PLUG The USB Type-C connector is a completely new design. It has been created for use with thinner, sleeker devices, such as tablets and ultrabooks. It claims to be robust enough for laptops and slim enough for smartphones. It is being built on existing USB 3.1 and USB 2.0 technologies. The plug is smaller than current laptop connectors, and more closely resembles the size of the current 2.0 Micro USB. Crucially, it will be reversible, meaning it will work whichever way it is plugged in.

The new 27‑inch iMac with Retina 5K display has four times as many pixels as the standard 27‑inch iMac display.

The upcoming MacBook Air is expected to be about a quarter-of-an-inch narrower than the 11-inch version, while also sporting a quarter-of-an-inch taller body in order to incorporate the slightly larger display, 9to5Mac reported, citing “sources within Apple” with access to “internal prototype versions” of the device. The bezels on the display could also be narrowed out on all sides to get a larger display fitted into the footprint, which is about the same size as the current 11-inch version's.

In addition to the 12-inch screen, the new MacBook Air could also feature an edge-to-edge keyboard with a redesigned key set, allowing each key to sit closer together, the report said, adding that the move is said to be aimed at making the computer as compact as possible.

The new model could also feature a revamped trackpad with the same width as that found on the 11-inch version, but with a taller frame almost touching the bottom of the keyboard, 9to5Mac reported, adding that the new trackpad may come without the clicking effect found on existing MacBook models.

Just above the keyboard of the next-generation MacBook Air, there could be four new speaker grilles that are expected to also function as ventilation ports, as the device lacks traditional computer fans.

In a bid to achieve a significantly thinner form factor, the 12-inch MacBook Air could do away with standard USB ports, the SD Card slot, and Thunderbolt and MagSafe charging standards in favor of a single USB Type-C port, which is reportedly smaller, faster and better than the existing USB 2.0 and 3.0 ports. In addition, the USB Type-C port is reversible, similar to that of the Lightning connector on the latest iOS devices. While the new USB Type-C port will sit on the left side of the device, the right side will accommodate the headphone jack, along with input and noise-canceling microphones, according to the report.

The details of the 12-inch MacBook Air closely follow recent rumors that the device could enter mass production in the first quarter of 2015. According to a report from Taiwan’s DigiTimes in December, Apple’s suppliers were stocking up inventory of related components for the new MacBook Air, in anticipation of the device entering production."

This year, Apple is set to launch a 12-inch MacBook Air, which could just be Apple's biggest product in 2015.

After being rumored for quite some time, the new laptop from Apple has just been confirmed by the latest report from Mark Gurman of 9to5Mac. Apple has made a number of changes in the MacBook Air, removing and redesigning what users know and love about the machine.

""Apple is preparing an all-new MacBook Air for 2015 with a radically new design that jettisons standards such as full-sized USB ports, MagSafe connectors, and SD card slots,"" said Gurman.

The new 12-inch MacBook Air is said to be smaller than its 13-inch sibling and a bit thinner than the 11-inch version. It is also a quarter-of-an-inch taller than the latter, which allows it to keep a slightly bigger display. The bezels around the display have also been reduced, giving the front part of the machine a brand new look.

Much of the larger proportion of the machine's usable area will be occupied by the display panel and the keyboard. Apple has noticeably deviated from the standard keyboard of the MacBook Air by cramming the keys in order to decrease the spaces in between.

Other key changes include the transferring of the power button from the upper left-hand corner to the left side of the escape key and the removal of the travel on the track pad as a way to keep the laptop's slim build.

The new MacBook Air is also a minimalist when it comes to ports as it will only be sporting two, namely the headphone jack and a USB Type-C port. This means that fans of the machine will have to do away with the Thunderbolt connection and the MagSafe charger.

However, the specs of the new USB indicate that the Type-C can support driving displays and device charging.

""The new USB Type-C connector is smaller, faster, and more capable than the standard USB 2.0 and 3.0 ports on existing computers,"" added Gurman.

Apple is yet to make an official announcement on the new MacBook Air. The laptop is speculated to ship in mid-2015 and is expected to use one of the new dual-core Broadwell chips from Intel.

RELATED: New rumor says the MacBook Air of your dreams will enter production soon

According to Gurman, the 2015 MacBook Air will have a 12-inch display and will eliminate a lot of the design features we’ve grown used to seeing from MacBooks in the past. In particular, Gurman writes that the new MacBook “jettisons standards such as full-sized USB ports, MagSafe connectors, and SD card slots in favor of a markedly thinner and lighter body with a higher-resolution display.”

So how light and thin are we talking about? Gurman’s source say the 12-inch laptop will be “approximately a quarter-of-an-inch narrower than the 11-inch version, yet it is also a quarter-of-an-inch taller in order to accommodate the slightly larger display.”

Even better, Gurman’s sources have provided such detailed descriptions of the new MacBook Air that artists were able to create beautiful renders of the devices, one of which we’ve posted below.

As you can see in the render above, Apple has eliminated a lot of extra space on the side of the device, as its keyboard nearly extends to the edge of the computer’s aluminum frame.

To get more details on the 2015 MacBook Air and to see more high-quality renders, we highly recommend checking out Gurman’s full post, available at the source link below.

Sources within Apple, who have used internal prototype versions of the upcoming computer, have provided in-depth details about the machine, and our exclusive artist renditions of the revamped MacBook Air provide the first close look at Apple’s first major step in mobile Mac computing since the Retina MacBook Pro launch in 2012.

The 12-inch MacBook Air will be considerably smaller than the current 13-inch version, yet also slightly narrower than the 11-inch model. The new 12-inch version is approximately a quarter-of-an-inch narrower than the 11-inch version, yet it is also a quarter-of-an-inch taller in order to accommodate the slightly larger display. In order to fit the larger screen into a footprint about the size of the current 11-inch model, the bezels on the display have been reduced on all sides.

Besides a new look for the front of the computer, the entire unibody has been revamped from the keyboard to the trackpad to the speakers. Taking cues from the 12-inch PowerBook introduced by Steve Jobs over a decade ago, the new keyboard sits edge-to-edge across the width of the laptop. In addition to going edge-to-edge, the entire key set has been subtly redesigned so that each key sits noticeably closer together. Apple has squeezed the keys closer in order for the computer to be as narrow as possible, which can be seen in the rendition below:

Apple has also relocated some of the function keys across the top and simplified the arrow key array in order to keep the keyboard as narrow as possible without taking away from overall usability. In addition to the keyboard, the trackpad has been changed. The trackpad is approximately the same width as that on the 11-inch MacBook Air (if not ever-so-slightly wider), but it is apparently slightly taller, nearly touching the bottoms of the keyboard and the frame. In line with earlier rumors, it also appears that the new trackpad does not have the same clicking effect as found on current and earlier MacBook models.

The elimination of physical feedback in the click is part of Apple’s plan to reduce the thickness of the MacBook to a bare minimum. As can be seen in 9to5Mac artist Michael Steeber‘s rendition above, the new 12-inch Air (on the left) is far thinner than the current 11-inch model (on the right). Taking cues from the current Air, the future model has a teardrop-like, tapered design that gets thinner from top to bottom. Above the keyboard are four redesigned speaker grills that actually double as ventilation holes for the fan-less device to keep cool.

The upcoming laptop is so thin that Apple employees are said to refer to the device as the “MacBook Stealth” internally. In order to reach that new level of portability, Apple not only slimmed down the trackpad and tweaked the speakers but the ports as well:

The upcoming 12-inch Air has the fewest amount of ports ever on an Apple computer, as can be seen in the rendition above. On the right side is a standard headphone jack and dual-microphones for input and noise-canceling. On the left side is solely the new USB Type-C port. Yes, Apple is currently planning to ditch standard USB ports, the SD Card slot, and even its Thunderbolt and MagSafe charging standards on this new notebook. We must note that Apple tests several designs of upcoming products, so Apple may choose to ultimately release a new Air that does include the legacy components, though there is very little space on the edges for them.

As we’ve reported on multiple occasions, the new USB Type-C connector is smaller, faster, and more capable than the standard USB 2.0 and 3.0 ports on existing computers. The connector is able to replace the Thunderbolt Display port on the current Apple laptops as USB Type-C actually has the technology to drive displays. Additionally, the latest specifications from the USB foundation indicate that USB Type-C can actually be used to power computers, which makes the standard MagSafe plugs unnecessary on this new device. The connector is also reversible like Lightning on iPads and iPhones, which should make the overall experience a bit more intuitive.

As the new MacBook may only have a single port, it would make sense for Apple to create a hub of some sort for users to be able to plug in multiple devices into the new laptop. Apple already ships all sorts of adapters for its Macs and iOS Devices, so adding yet another attachment to the accessory portfolio would not be unprecedented. With Apple moving to a new “Space Gray” color on its iOS devices and on some Macs (such as with the 2013 Mac Pro), it seems possible that this new MacBook may come in a new gray color, as shown off in some of our renditions.

The latest rumors indicate that the new MacBook Air will ship in mid-2015 (perhaps around WWDC), while other reports have claimed that the new Air is already nearing production. With Intel revealing the latest news on the Broadwell chipset family at CES this week, the ball is likely now in Apple’s court for pushing the future of mobile computing into the world.

Newfoundland police said over Twitter Monday afternoon that Rodney Constantine had “kept his word” and turned himself over to authorities after saying he would so in a Facebook comment -- to police.

On Saturday, the Royal Newfoundland Constabulary used their Facebook and Twitter accounts to appeal to the public in helping finding Constantine, who was wanted on four warrants, including failing to attend court and breaching court orders.

Not shy -- nor apparently trying to elude authorities -- Constantine responded using his own Facebook account. He wrote on the post: “See you Monday morn !!!!!”

The unusual example of the power of social media in policing took another bizarre twist in the comment’s section, where Constantine and police began a correspondence of sorts.

After noting that everyone is innocent until proven guilty, police wrote: “We commend Mr. Constantine for acknowledging these charges and hopefully he will contact us to have the matter dealt with properly in court.”

Constantine took to Facebook again, just to make it clear he was serious about his imminent surrender: “Look just letting everyone know this ain’t a joke or intended !!!! I was just been honest about turning in Monday morn that’s all !!!”

The unusual back-and-forth sparked a slew of comments from Facebook users, including one person who said police should offer free pick-up and drop-off service for wanted persons.

The police also took the opportunity to chastise people making rude remarks.

“We also would ask that people commenting on posts consider a more tactful and less offensive tone as many of your comments are being ‘hidden’ for simply being outright offensive toward other users or the accused.”

The “wanted” post seeking the accused has since been deleted from the RNC’s Facebook page, but police did post news of Constantine’s arrest, saying he will be seen by a provincial court judge Tuesday morning."

Kei Nishikori tops annual list of highest-paid tennis players

In 2017 it looked like the tennis player’s spectacular career was winding down. Suddenly, he was back on top. People With Money reports on Friday (April 17) that Nishikori is the highest-paid tennis player in the world, pulling in an astonishing $46 million between March 2019 and March 2020, a nearly $20 million lead over his closest competition.

People With Money’s factors

In compiling this yearly list, the magazine considers factors such as upfront pay, profit participation, residuals, endorsements and advertising work.

The Japanese tennis player has an estimated net worth of $145 million. He owes his fortune to smart stock investments, substantial property holdings, lucrative endorsement deals with CoverGirl cosmetics. He also owns several restaurants (the “Fat Nishikori Burger” chain) in Tokyo, a Football Team (the “Matsue Angels”), has launched his own brand of Vodka (Pure Wondernishikori - Japan), and is tackling the juniors market with a top-selling perfume (With Love from Kei) and a fashion line called “Kei Nishikori Seduction”.

The ranking is significant for many Kei fans, who have been waiting for his triumphant return to the glory days for what seems like a lifetime.

BREAKING: INFORMANT? Paris Terror Suspect on US Watch List Met With French President Sarkozy in 2009

21st Century Wire says…

As the dust settles from this week’s terror extravaganza in France, more loose ends are turning up (or being tied up), with this latest bizarre bombshell which is already fueling speculation as to the covert nature of the Charlie Hebdo false flag affair.

A police commissioner from Limoges, France, Helric Fredou, aged 45 (photo, below), turned up dead from a gun shot to the head on Thursday amid the Charlie Hebdo affair. A high-ranking official within the French law enforcement command-and-control structure, Fredou was also a former deputy director of the regional police service.



According France 3, his body was “found by a colleague” at approximately 1am Thursday – only hours after the initial Paris attack.

At the time of his death, police claim to have not known the reason for his alleged suicide. This was reflected in their official statements to the media: “It is unknown at this time the reasons for his actions”. However, a back story appears to have been inserted simultaneously, most likely from the very same police media liaisons, who then told the press that Fredou was ‘depressed and overworked’. For any law enforcement officer in France, it would seem rather odd that anyone would want to miss the biggest single terror event in the century, or history in the making, as it were.

Here is a link to the original report in the French media, which confirms that Commissioner Fredou was indeed working on the Charlie Hebdo case:

“The Fredou Commissioner, like all agents SRPJ, worked yesterday on the case of the massacre at the headquarters of Charlie Hebdo. In particular, he was investigating the family of one of the victims. He killed himself before completing its report. A psychological ‘cell’ was set up in the police station.”



EDITOR’S NOTE: It is not yet known to 21WIRE exactly how the fatal gun shot occurred, but if any other past political and high-profile ‘suicided’ cases are anything to go by, authorities will claim that this victim either shot himself in the back of the head, with his non-shooting hand. In addition, if that were the case, there would also be a lack of gun powder burns on the hands according to the autopsy.

UK-based investigative reporter Morris108, interviews ‘Phil in France’ regarding this new development:

Sputnik News:

Police commissioner, who had been investigating the attack on the Charlie Hebdo magazine committed suicide with his service gun on Thursday night.

Police commissioner Helric Fredou, who had been investigating the attack on the French weekly satirical magazine Charlie Hebdo, committed suicide in his office. The incident occurred in Limoges, the administrative capital of the Limousin region in west-central France, on Thursday night, local media France 3 reports.

Helric Fredou, 45, suffered from ‘depression’ and experienced ‘burn out’ [according to the official statement]. Shortly before committing suicide, he met with the family of a victim of the Charlie Hebdo attack and killed himself preparing the report.

Fredou began his career in 1997 as a police officer at the regional office of the judicial police of Versailles. Later he returned to Limoges, his hometown. Since 2012 he had been the deputy director of the regional police service.

“We are all shocked. Nobody was ready for such developments”, a representative of the local police union told reporters.

On January 7, 2015, two gunmen burst into the editorial office of Charlie Hebdo magazine, known for issuing cartoons, ridiculing Islam. The [suspected] attackers, later identified as brothers Said and Cherif Kouachi, killed 12 people and injured 11, and escaped from the scene. Following two days of nationwide manhunt, the suspects were killed on Friday by French police some 20 miles northeast of Paris.

An Indian public official has been sacked for taking leave 24 years ago and never returning to his desk in the country’s notoriously work-shy bureaucracy, the urban development ministry said.



Assistant executive engineer A.K Verma went on leave in 1990 after joining India’s central public works department (CPWD) a decade earlier.

Verma defied bosses’ orders to return to work after his requests for additional leave were denied.

“He went on seeking extension of leave, which was not sanctioned, and defied directions to report to work,” the government said in a statement on Thursday.

Even after an inquiry found him guilty of “wilful absence from duty” in 1992, it took another 22 years and the intervention of a cabinet minister to remove him, the government said.

Urban Development Minister M. Venkaiah Naidu ordered his dismissal in order to “streamline the functioning of CPWD and to ensure accountability,” it said.



India’s civil servants have long been notorious for arriving late, taking long lunches or spending parts of their day on the golf course.

A 2012 survey by the Hong Kong-based Political and Economic Risk consultancy rated India’s bureaucracy as the worst among major Asian countries.

Prime Minister Narendra Modi has said he was shocked by what he saw in the corridors of power after moving to New Delhi following his landslide election victory in May last year.

During his first few months in office, Modi developed a reputation for paying unannounced visits to government offices.

Fear of being caught playing truant triggered a rise in attendance levels among civil servants and Delhi’s main golf course has reportedly been largely deserted on week days."

The Indian government has sacked a civil servant who went on leave in 1990 and never came back to work.

Urban development minister M Venkaiah Naidu said a case of ""wilful absence"" had been proved against electrical engineer AK Verma.

Mr Verma had been under investigation since 1992, but had refused to co-operate, the minister said.

Correspondents say absenteeism is a pervasive problem in government-run offices in India.

Mr Naidu said in a statement that Mr Verma joined the Central Public Works Department in 1980.

He had risen to the rank of executive engineer by 1990, when he went on leave.

An inquiry was set up in 1992, but formal proceedings to dismiss him were not begun until 2007.

It took a further seven years for the department to reach a decision and dismiss him.

It is not clear whether he was paid during his time off.

Falling absenteeism

India's bureaucracy has become notorious for high levels of absenteeism.

A report in 2012 labelled India's government machinery the worst in Asia.

Schools have also faced problems, with teachers failing to turn up for work in huge numbers.

Last August, a state school in Madhya Pradesh sacked a teacher who had been absent for 23 years of her 24-year career.

Prime Minister Narendra Modi promised to curb slack working practices when he took office last year.

The AFP news agency reports that he makes unannounced visits to government offices, and absenteeism has since plummeted."

REUTERS/Andrew Kelly India is going through some serious public sector reforms under Prime Minister Narendra Modi. So not turning up for work for a quarter of a century is now not OK, as one civil servant found out recently.

India's Central Public Works Department (CPWD), in a press release dated Jan. 8, 2015, announced the dismissal of a senior electrical engineer employed by the department for 35 years. He only worked the first 10.

It sounds like the CPWD could use a bit of reorganisation. The employee stopped turning up for work in 1990, and an inquiry was launched in 1992. The department then seems to have forgotten about it for 13 years:

Shri A.K.Verma, who joined CPWD as an Assistant Executive Engineer in 1980 went on Earned Leave in December, 1990 and did not report to work thereafter. He went on seeking extension of leave which was not sanctioned and defied directions to report to work. An Inquiry was instituted against him in September, 1992 for major penalty for willful absence from duty. Due to non-cooperation of Shri Verma with the Inquiry and for other reasons, it got delayed and a fresh charge sheet was issued in 2005. The Inquiry Report, establishing the charges was submitted in July, 2007 and the same was accepted by the then Minister of Urban Development in August, 2007. But no further action was taken in the matter.

Charges were clearly established six years ago, but Verma apparently remained in employment for another eight years until he was sacked today. It's not clear from the press release whether he was paid over the whole period. In 2014, a German civil servant admitted he hadn't done any work in the last 14 years, but Verma beats him by a decade."

As disciplinary authority, Urban Development Minister Venkaiah Naidu directed dismissal from service of Executive Engineer (Electrical), A K Verma, after the charge of wilful absence from duty against him was proven in an inquiry set up to probe the matter.

A senior ministry official said that Verma, who had joined CPWD as an Assistant Executive Engineer in 1980, went on Earned Leave in December, 1990 and did not report to work thereafter.

Verma went on seeking extension of leave which was not sanctioned and defied directions to report to work. An inquiry was instituted against him in September, 1992 for major penalty for wilful absence from duty.

Due to non-cooperation of Verma with the inquiry and for other reasons, it got delayed and a fresh charge sheet was issued in 2005.

The inquiry report, establishing the charges was submitted in July, 2007 and the same was accepted by the then Minister of Urban Development in August, 2007. But no further action was taken in the matter.

Seeking to streamline the functioning of CPWD and to ensure accountability, Naidu, soon after assuming office directed review of pending vigilance and disciplinary cases for expeditious action against the accused.

Verma’s case surfaced in due course and Naidu directed his dismissal from service.

The Minister has taken serious view of in-action since 2007 and directed the concerned to fix responsibility for delay in the matter

Meng Xiangyan, 29, said that with certain death awaiting their daughter unless she receives medical treatment, she and her husband were prepared to sell their daughter's twin brother to a good home so that both would have a chance of life.

Pictures show her standing on Weihai Road in Qingdao, in China's eastern Shandong province, with a placard offering to sell him to the highest bidder.

The 29-year-old claims she and her husband love both their children, but they are willing to sell their son (pictured together) to a good home in order to try and save the life of his twin sister

The boy's twin sister (pictured with Xiangyan) is suffering from leukemia and requires life-saving treatment

In the pictures, he can be seen eating what appears to be candied fruit and standing alongside his mother as she appeals for someone to come forward and buy him.

She said: 'Up until a year ago we had a wonderful family and we thought we had everything we could need with a wonderful little boy and a wonderful little girl who are twins.

'But all that changed when my daughter was diagnosed as suffering from leukemia in August of last year and we spent all of our savings and borrowed everything we could from friends and relatives.

'It still wasn't enough, and now we are hoping to raise cash from the sale of our son.'

Medical staff say the child is suffering from acute lymphoblastic leukemia and needs urgent medical treatment that includes chemotherapy every 10 days at the Rizhao Municipal Hospital.

The family have sold their apartment and everything in it and are now living in a tiny 10sqm flat close to where the chemotherapy is being carried out.

Their attempt to sell their son follows a similar situation last month in which a woman was spotted trying to sell her baby daughter on the streets of China in order to pay her husband's £10,000 medical bill.

The lethal animals are being launched at Iraqi residents by the jihadist fighters.

IS, which has taken control over large areas of Iraq and Syria, are using the bombs to target civilians in the north of the country.

Hamish de Bretton-Gordon, ex-head of chemical and biological weapons for the Army and Nato, told the Mirror: ""They promote the fact that they are doing it and it creates panic.

""Scorpions are robust – even if they are launched a couple of miles, when the canister breaks thousands are flung out and start crawling all around.

""Some scorpions are very poisonous but the main thing is creating fear.""

The news comes as an IS fighter took to Twitter to laugh at the victims of the deadly Sydney siege.

Former Sydney resident Mohamed Elomar, who was pictured holding up the severed heads of two dead soldiers earlier this year, posted two sick tweets following the attack.

After referencing the 2011 Mumbai terror attacks he then posted: ""I think we got ourselves a real life hostage situation in Sydney lolololololololo.""

Another Islamist posted on Twitter: ""The world must stand for the news of 13 Australians but it would sleep for the news of over 130,000 Muslims killed in Syria.

Canisters packed with poisonous varieties of scorpion are being blasted into towns and villages - scattering the creatures and inciting panic

Militants fighting for the Islamic State in Iraq have unveiled their latest terror tactic - bombs containing hundreds of live scorpions designed to spread fear among their enemies.

Canisters packed with poisonous varieties of scorpion are being blasted into towns and villages, which explode on impact - scattering the scorpions and causing panic among the innocent local population.

Although scorpion bombs sound like something out of a modern horror movie, the tactic is actually thousands of years old and was first used by Iraqis fighting against the Roman Empire.

Hamish de Bretton-Gordon, ex-head of chemical and biological weapons for the Army and Nato, told The Mirror that ISIS had improvised devices to launch the poisonous creatures in 2ft bombs.

He said: 'Scorpions are robust – even if they are launched a couple of miles, when the canister breaks thousands are flung out and start crawling all around.

'Some scorpions are very poisonous but the main thing is creating fear.'

Mr de Bretton-Gordon, who returned from Baghdad last week where he was advising security forces, said that the bombs are not causing casualties but had a profound 'psychological impact'.

The bizarre biological weapon was used as far back as 198 AD, when Iraqis stuffed live scorpions into ceramic pots and hurled them at Roman armies marching on the fortress city of Hatra.

The Parthian city was held under siege for 20 days by Emperor Septimius Severus before the Roman military were driven out by the 'live grenades'.

Militants fighting for the Islamic State in Iraq have unveiled their latest terror tactic - bombs containing hundreds of live scorpions designed to spread fear among their enemies

Adrienne Mayor, a historian of ancient science and classical folklorist, researched the weapon in detail for her 2004 book Greek Fire, Poison Arrows & Scorpion Bombs: Biological and Chemical Warfare in the Ancient World.

SCORPION BOMBS - 'THE WORLD'S OLDEST BIOLOGICAL WEAPON' The live grenades were first used by Iraqis in the besieged city of Hatra in 198-199AD. Soldiers would pack ceramic pots full of live scorpions which they would then hurl at the Romans led by Emperor Septimius Severus. It is thought that they would first spit on the scorpions to slow them down so they could be handled - although it was still an incredibly risking tactic. The biological weapon has been credited with ending the 20 day siege on the desert city.

She describes how soldiers would spit on the end of the scorpion to calm the creatures before they were packed into pots, which were flung at the besieging Romans.

'It was the brute effectiveness of Hatra's defensive biological and chemical weapons that overcame Roman morale, manpower and siege machines,' she writes. 'The terror effect would be quite impressive.'

Last week, the U.S. confirmed it had launched a further 20 airstrikes against ISIS targets, including raids near Sinjar, Qaim, Ramadi, Mosul and Samarra, as well as inside Kobane.

ISIS militants have been attacking the Iraqi town of Kobane since mid-September, when the terror group assaulted its southern suburbs in an attempt to seize control of the strategic border city.

The terror group quickly encircled the city, raping and murdering its inhabitants, but Kurdish YPG fighters supported by U.S. airstrikes have since pushed ISIS back out of central Kobane."

Islamic State militants are launching bombs containing live scorpions as the latest terror weapon in Iraq.

Canisters of the creatures are being blasted into towns and villages, according to a British military expert who has just returned from the country.

He said the 2ft bombs were not causing mass casualties but had a massive “psychological impact”.

Mr de Bretton-Gordon – of Avon Protection Systems – returned from Baghdad last week, where he was advising security forces.

Senior Iraqi officials reported the beasts were being used to target civilian areas in the north of the country.

The weapon harks back to the scorpions stuffed into pots and launched by Iraqis thousands of years ago – in 198 AD.

A species of magic mushroom has been found growing in the grounds of BUCKINGHAM PALACE.

TV gardener Alan Titchmarsh was astounded when he came across the funny fungi while filming a Christmas special at the Queen's London home - saying: ""I won't be eating any of that.""

The Amanita muscaria mushroom, commonly known as fly agaric or fly mushroom, is a white and red toadstool, with hallucinogenic properties.

The species contains poison which, in rare cases, can cause death if consumed.

Presenter Alan told The Sun he was surprised to happen upon the plants while working on The Queen's Garden, which will be screened on Christmas Day.

""That was a surprise but it shows just how varied the species are,"" he said.

Fly agaric are common and are understood to have grown naturally in the palace grounds rather than having been planted there.

The hallucinogenic properties of the mushroom have been well-known for centuries and have a long history of use in religious and shamanistic rituals, according to the Kew Gardens website.

The fungi is also important to the growth and development of many types of tree, and provides food for flies, and a breeding site for beetles.

A Buckingham Palace spokesperson said: ""There are several hundred fungi species in the palace garden, including a small number of naturally occurring fly agaric mushrooms.

""As the programme explains, they are beneficial to trees, increasing their ability to take in nutrients.""

Royal officials also made clear for the record that fungi from the garden are not used in the palace kitchens."

The presenter found the red and white spotted toadstool called Amanita muscaria while filming an ITV gardening show called The Queen's Garden and said: 'I won't be eating any of that.'

He was touring the private 40-acre site with ecology expert Professor Mick Crawley and asked him whether the fungus is edible.

Professor Crawley replied saying: 'That depends what you mean. It's eaten in some cultures for its hallucinogenic effects. But it also makes people who eat it very sick.

The red and white spotted toadstool called Amanita muscaria can cause vivid hallucinations and is known for the unpredictability of its effects

'The old-fashioned thing to do was to feed it to the village idiot, then drink his urine because you get all of the high without any of the sickness.'

Titchmarsh jokingly replied: 'I think I'll forgo that and stick to normal mushrooms.'

The fungus, also known as fly agaric, contains the psychoactive chemicals ibotenic acid and muscimol and they can be found throughout the UK.

Last night a Palace spokesman was keen to point out the fungus is not served to Royals.

He said: 'There are several hundred fungi species in the palace garden, including a small number of naturally occurring fly agaric mushrooms.

'As the programme explains, they are beneficial to trees, increasing their ability to take in nutrients.'

He told the Sun: 'For the avoidance of doubt, fungi from the garden are not used in the Palace kitchens.'

This type of fungus can often be found growing under birch or pine trees, especially Monterey and Bishop pine which are common in the garden at Buckingham Palace.

With permission from Her Majesty The Queen, Alan Titchmarsh spent a whole year exploring the Buckingham Palace Garden, which has a five-century history.

On the new TV show, Titchmarsh explains that gardeners actively encourage mushrooms and toadstools.

He said: 'Every time they chop something down, they leave out the wood to rot.'

During her reign, Her Majesty has made the garden a place where nature thrives. It now plays host to 350 species of wildflower, 83 species of bird and two and a half thousand British species of insect, including butterflies.

It's been the garden of Queen Elizabeth II for longer than any other monarch. A rare film from 1937 shows the Queen as an 11-year-old princess with her younger sister princess Margaret, having just moved into the palace.

Mr Titchmarsh heard tales about the Queen's childhood from royal historian Dr Lucy Worsley, who explains that the young princesses held a wistful fascination with what was beyond the garden walls.

The red and white spotted Amanita muscaria species - also known as fly agaric - has been discovered by Alan Titchmarsh while on tour of the grounds with ecology expert Professor Mick Crawley.

The discovery of the mushroom - which is likely to have grown on the 40-acre land without being specifically cultivated - was recorded during a 12-month study for ITV show The Queen's Garden, which is to be aired on Christmas Day.

Mr Titchmarsh asks Professor Crawley if the fungi is edible, to which he replies: “That depends what you mean. It’s eaten in some cultures for its hallucinogenic effects. But it also makes people who eat it very sick.

“The old-fashioned thing to do was feed it to the village idiot, then drink his urine because you get all the high without any of the sickness.”

Mr Titchmarsh, known for presenting BBC gardening programme Ground Force and the annual RHS Chelsea Flower Show, then says: “I think I’ll forgo that and stick to some normal mushrooms”.

“Not something to try at home,” he added.

Chemicals muscimol and ibotenic acid found in the fungi cause psychoactive effects such as drowsiness, hallucinations, mood changes, euphoria and disassociation.

The plant has a long history of religious and shamanic use dating back around 10,000 years.

However, unlike psilocybin mushrooms - which were reclassified to Class A in 2006 and have been more popular for recreational use - the legal status of selling fly agaric in the UK remains complicated. Possession is not illegal.

The physical effects are described as ""undesirable"" and the chemicals can carry risks of poisoning and death, according to drug advice charity Talk to Frank.

The mushrooms are culturally depicted in Lewis Carroll's Alice in Wonderland, Nintendo's Super Mario Brothers video games and in Disney's musical production Fantasia."

The television presenter unearthed the fungi at Buckingham Palace for an ITV gardening show called The Queen’s Garden, and said: “I won’t be eating any of that.”

Titchmarsh came across the red and white spotted toadstool — called Amanita muscaria, or fly agaric — on a tour of the private 40-acre plot with ecology expert Professor Mick Crawley.

Titchmarsh, 65, asks in an ITV show to be screened on Christmas Day: “Is it edible?”

Professor Crawley replies: “That depends what you mean. It’s eaten in some cultures for its hallucinogenic affects. But it also makes people who eat it very sick.

“The old-fashioned thing to do was to feed it to the village idiot, then drink his urine because you get all of the high without any of the sickness.”

Titchmarsh jokingly replies: “I think I’ll forgo that and stick to normal mushrooms.”

Then he adds: “Not something to try at home.”

Later he told The Sun newspaper: “That was a surprise but it shows just how varied the species are. I won’t be eating any of that, though, no. My idea of hard drugs is Nurofen.”

On the new TV show, Titchmarsh explains that gardeners actively encourage mushrooms and toadstools.

He says: “Every time they chop something down, they leave out the wood to rot.”

Magic mushroom is a slang term for any hallucinogenic fungus.

The most common, illegal form contains drug psilocybin, but there is no suggestion this grows in the Palace garden.

Last night a Palace spokesman told the Sun: “For the avoidance of doubt, fungi from the garden are not used in the Palace kitchens.”

The new programme will show viewers an entire year in the life of the Buckingham Palace garden, from the summer garden parties to the nocturnal wanderings of wildlife in the heart of London.

It will demonstrate how gardeners work tirelessly to maintain the Queen’s flowers, while bearing in mind her wish to see animals and insects made welcome in the gardens, swapping pesticides for homemade garlic treatments.

Titchmarsh will explore how bee hives, homes for insects and deposits from the Royal mews each help cultivate the gardens of Buckingham Palace, with top tips from gardeners giving insight into the Queen’s own tastes.

The programme, to be broadcast by ITV on Christmas Day, will also show how the garden has been used by the royal family for generations, from the king who planted mulberry trees to rival the French to the young Princesses Elizabeth and Margaret climbing to peer over the high garden walls.

A sandpit used by the royal children will be filmed, along with oak trees planted decades ago by the young Prince of Wales and Princess Royal, grown from acorns sown on the event of their birth.

Titchmarsh, who spent 12 months exploring how the Palace garden changed with the seasons, will be seen finishing the calendar year with a Christmas tree mounted in the Marble Hall, decorated with holly and mistletoe from the royal garden and festooned with festive golden crowns."

The discovery was made while a television crew was touring the gardens in preparation for an ITV television show called The Queen’s Garden, which will air on Christmas day. While taping the show gardening expert Alan Titchmarsh and ecology expert Professor Mick Crawley noticed some red and white spotted fungi. Titchmarsh asked, “Is it edible?” and, according to The Telegraph, Professor Crawley replied, “That depends what you mean.”

The fungus found in the Queen’s garden was a naturally occurring Amanita muscaria (no one suspects Queen Elizabeth II of cultivating the magic mushroom) that according to Prof. Crawley is “eaten in some cultures for its hallucinogenic affects. But it also makes people who eat it very sick.” The fungus, commonly known as fly agaric or fly mushroom, does have hallucinogenic properties, but it is not the same as the illicit psychoactive mushroom that contains the illegal drug psilocybin. Still, Titchmarsch wisely replied, “I won’t be eating any of that.” Titchmarsh told The Sun that he was surprised to happen upon the red and white-headed toadstool, “That was a surprise, but it shows just how varied the species are.”

Palace officials said Friday there are several hundred species of mushrooms growing in the palace gardens, including a number of the Amanita muscaria. It is understood that the mushrooms grew naturally in the palace grounds rather than having been planted there. Palace officials made it clear to the AP that mushrooms from the garden are not used in the palace kitchens.

Instead he said, ""Holy Scripture teaches us that the fulfillment of this wonderful design also affects everything around us,” which an Italian newspaper interpreted to mean animals could go to heaven. Another quote attributed to Francis was actually made by Pope Paul VI while comforting a distraught boy whose dog had died.



Pope Francis had an early Christmas president for dogs, and animal lovers everywhere: A chance at heaven for pooches and another creatures.

During a recent public appearance, while trying to console a boy whose dog had died, Francis said, according to Italian news sources, “One day, we will see our animals again in the eternity of Christ. Paradise is open to all of God’s creatures.”

His comments were greeted with enthusiasm by animal welfare groups.

“It confirms what many of us have believed and hoped to be true for a long time,” said Christine Gutleban, director of the faith outreach program for The Humane Society of the United States. “I think it’s hard for many of us to imagine heaven without God’s creatures.”

Some religious observers have noted that the pope made the comment casually and so it was unclear what implications it would have.

Gutleban said her organization was waiting confirmation from the Vatican, but thought the comment was very much in line with Christian teachings about compassion toward animals.

The pope's predecessors have offered varying views. Though traditional Catholic teaching held that animals did not have souls, Pope John Paul II implied that they did. Pope Benedict spoke out against factory farming.

The president of the Catholic League, Bill Donohue, said as an animal lover, he welcomed the comment. In the absence of a catechism teaching on subject, popes are free to their own ideas, he said. Whether animals can get to heaven is a matter of conjecture, he said.

""But it’s Christmastime so let’s be cheery and assume that’s the case,"" he said.

That said, he planned to enjoy a prime rib at the Catholic League's Christmas party.

The American Kennel Club applauded Pope Francis for reminding the world that dogs deserved love, care and respect.

“Few things in life are more powerful than the human-canine bond, and we firmly believe that all dogs are worthy of an eternity of affection and happiness,” it said in a statement.

Other groups used the opportunity to draw attention to American farming methods.

“If indeed (Benedict) said this, that animals have a place in heaven, then I think it’s a clear that animals mean a great deal to God,"" Gutleban said. ""And we really need to be serious about how we treat them, certainly in industrial systems like factory farming, for example.""

People for the Ethical Treatment or PETA said in a statement that it hoped Christians would remember that animals raised and killed for food endure hell on earth. The most loving thing people could do toward God’s creatures was not to eat them, said the group, which has a new website directed at Christians, Jesus People for Animals.

Sarah Withrow King, the director of PETA’s Christian outreach and engagement, said that the group was contacted almost immediately by supporters who were thrilled by the pope’s statement.

She said she hoped it would change people’s treatment of animals.

“I say that a world on earth as it is in heaven is a vegan world,” she said."

Charles Camosy, an author and professor of Christian ethics at Fordham University, told the New York Times it was difficult to know precisely what Francis meant, since he spoke ""in pastoral language that is not really meant to be dissected by academics."" But asked if the remarks had caused a new debate on whether animals have souls, suffer and go to heaven, Camosy said, ""In a word: Absolutely.""

Pope Pius IX, the longest-serving pontiff whose term spanned from 1846 to 1878, believed that dogs and other animals had no consciousness.

But now Pope Francis may have given pet owners some hope. Apparently trying to comfort a young boy whose dog had recently died, he declared that “paradise is open to all God’s creatures”.

Pope Francis’s speech, delivered late last month during a public appearance on St Peter’s Square in Rome has reportedly reverberated through the church and Christian organisations that deal with animals. The New York Times said organisations such as the Humane Society, the largest animal protection group in the US, had been busy discussing his comments.

Pope Francis, whose term succeeding Benedict XVI began in March 2013, has on several instances sparked controversy within the Catholic faith with comments that have upset conservatives. He has spoken out for leniency towards gays and unmarried couples.

The newspaper said that Pope Francis had cited a number of biblical passages that assert that animals not only go to heaven, but get along with one another when they get there. The Italian media reported him as saying: “One day, we will see our animals again in the eternity of Christ. Paradise is open to all of God’s creatures.”

Chris Fegan, General Secretary of the British charity Catholic Concern for Animals, said he believed Christians with pets would be delighted by the pope’s comments. He said previous popes had hinted at such but that none had been so explicit.

“Lots of Catholics whose lose an animal would hope to see their friend again,” he said. “When you lose a loved one, whether it’s a person or an animal friend, you grieve.”"	Pope Francis suggests that pets can go to heaven	2014-12-12 13:48:42+00:00	['Andrew Buncombe']	['heaven', 'term', 'pope', 'open', 'sparked', 'animals', 'francis', 'animal', 'organisations', 'pets', 'suggests', 'paradise', 'popes']	"Pope Pius IX, the longest-serving pontiff whose term spanned from 1846 to 1878, believed that dogs and other animals had no consciousness.

Despite the ambiguousness of the statement, many animal lovers and rights groups have interpreted it as a repudiation of Catholic theology stating animals don't have souls.

Well now, the Pope is certainly endearing himself to a widening number of groups. Early in his tenure he has given hope to gays, unmarried couples, and advocates of evolution and the Big Bang theory.

And now, as reported in the New York Times, he's endearing himself to dog lovers, animal-rights activists, and vegans:

""My inbox got flooded,"" said Christine Gutleben, senior director of faith outreach at the Humane Society, the largest animal protection group in the United States. ""Almost immediately, everybody was talking about it."" Charles Camosy, an author and professor of Christian ethics at Fordham University, said it was difficult to know precisely what Francis meant, since he spoke ""in pastoral language that is not really meant to be dissected by academics."" But asked if the remarks had caused a new debate on whether animals have souls, suffer and go to heaven, Mr. Camosy said, ""In a word: Absolutely."" [...] Citing biblical passages that assert that animals not only go to heaven, but get along with one another when they get there, Francis was quoted by the Italian news media as saying: ""One day, we will see our animals again in the eternity of Christ. Paradise is open to all of God's creatures."" Theologians cautioned that Francis had spoken casually, not made a doctrinal statement.

Indeed, the Catholic Church has been inconsistent in this regard. Pope Pius IX said dogs and other animals have no consciousness, while John Paul II said animals have souls and are ""as near to God as men are."" More recently, Benedict contradicted JPII by saying an animal's death ""just means the end of existence on earth.""

Pope Francis's comments aside, the Vatican has yet to make a definitive statement on this question. But don't hold your breath; a declaration that animals have souls would imply that killing animals is a sin. The Catholic Church likely won't go there.

In fact, it's a decades-old quote from Pope Paul VI. You can read the updated story here: Pope Francis did not tell boy heaven has room for pets, contrary to report

Pope Francis suggested recently that even animals have a place in heaven, while trying to soothe a young boy during a public appearance at the Vatican's St. Peter's Square.

""Paradise is open to all of God’s creatures,"" he told the boy whose dog died recently.

He made the comment during the weekly general audience at the Vatican, in St. Peter's Square

“One day, we will see our animals again in the eternity of Christ,” said the leader of the Catholic Church, according to Italian news sources.

This is a significant pivot from the position held by Francis's predecessor, Pope Benedict XVI. In 2008, he said that when an animal dies, it “just means the end of existence on Earth.”

Francis has consistently made headlines with sometimes controversial remarks since assuming the papacy in 2013.

Vatican observers have called him a ""radical"" because of his open-mindedness and desire to reach out to ""the grassroots of Catholic life.""

The 77-year-old leader of the world's one billion Roman Catholics has adopted more liberal positions than his predecessor, stirring up tensions with conservative Catholics on issues such as homosexuality and single motherhood.

In one such instance in July 2013, Francis struck a compassionate tone when speaking about homosexuality.

""If a person is gay and seeks God and has good will, who am I to judge?"" he said to reporters on a flight returning to the Vatican from Brazil.

The leader of the Catholic Church has assured pet lovers across the world that dogs do go to heaven.

Speaking at his weekly address in the Vatican's St. Peter's Square, Pope Francis confirmed that there is a place in heaven for our furry friends, along with 'all of God's creatures.'

The head of the Catholic Church had been attempting to console a distraught young boy who was mourning the death of his dog, according to Time magazine.

Pope Francis confirmed that there is a place in heaven for dogs and 'all of God's creatures' during his weekly address in the Vatican's St. Peter's Square

The statement is at odds with conservative Roman Catholic theology which states that animals cannot go to heaven because they have no souls.

Francis was quoted by Italian news media as saying: 'One day, we will see our animals again in the eternity of Christ. Paradise is open to all of God's creatures.'

The remarks have been warmly welcomed by animal rights groups such as PETA and the Humane Society.

The issue of whether animals have the chance of an afterlife has been debated for centuries.

Pet owners will welcome the Pope's remarks that their beloved dogs, cats, horses and other furry friends have a place in heaven

POPE FRANCIS DECLINED A MEETING WITH THE DALAI LAMA Pope Francis has refused to meet the Dalai Lama over fears it could impact on the Catholic Church's relationship with China. The exiled Tibetan leader requested the meeting during a visit to Rome but it was declined 'for obvious reasons concerning the delicate situation' with China. The Catholic Church in China is divided in two; the official Church overseen by the Chinese Communist Party, and an underground community that swears allegiance to the Pope. But the main bone of contention is over which side should have the final say in the appointment of bishops. A Vatican official said the Pope's decision was 'not taken out of fear but to avoid any suffering by those who have already suffered'.

The longest serving Pope - Pius IX - who was the leader of the church from 1846 to 1878 believed animals had no consciousness and therefore could not have an afterlife.

Pope Francis's predecessor, Pope Benedict XVI, had also denied the idea of pets entering heaven and said their death simply meant the end of their existence on Earth

But it is perhaps unsurprising that Pope Francis, aged 77, supports the idea of pets and animals having a place in paradise as he took his papal name from St. Francis of Assisi, the patron saint of animals.

Several sources for the Islamic State told BuzzFeed News that middlemen have been trying to strike a sale, with the asking price for Foley’s remains at $1 million.

Foley, a U.S. journalist and long-time hostage, was the first of a series of public and videotaped Islamic State beheadings of Western citizens. He was killed in August.

Islamic State terrorists say they’ll transport his body to Turkey — and that they’ll even give a DNA sample to prove the remains belong to Foley, BuzzFeed News reported.

Islamic State terrorists reportedly held 23 hostages from the West earlier this year. Fifteen Europeans were freed after the group received millions of dollars in ransom payments. American and Britain hostages, however, were not among the ransomed.

BuzzFeed News said three sources with contact with Islamic State members confirmed that Foley’s body was being put up for sale. One is a former Syrian rebel fighter with ties to Islamic State leaders, BuzzFeed News said.

“They ask for $1 million and they will send DNA to Turkey, but they want the money first,” he said, BuzzFeed News reported. “They will not give the DNA without the money.”

Another source, also granted anonymity, said similarly and added, “This is business.”

Middlemen with alleged ties to the terror group have revealed that extremists are trying to raise war funds by selling the mutilated bodies of its dead captives, including American freelance journalist James Foley. The 40-year-old was brutally murdered by a militant dubbed 'Jihadi John' on August 19, in the first high-profile execution of a Western hostage by the group.

It will be like a shame for the US government. People will ask why you brought the body but you didn’t bring him when he was alive FSA anonymous source

In the months since his death, IS have continued to release footage of more beheadings including US journalist Steven Sotloff and British humanitarian aid workers David Haines and Alan Henning. Sources close to the radical Sunni Islamist terror group told Buzzfeed that IS want $1 million (£636,000) for Mr Foley’s body, which it has promised to deliver across the border to Turkey. IS negotiators said the group would be willing to provide a DNA sample in order to prove identification of the body. A former Syrian rebel fighter, speaking anonymously, has admitted he was approached by IS leaders to sell the US citizen's mutilated remains to his country's government or family. He said: ""They ask for $1 million, and they will send DNA to Turkey, but they want the money first. They will not give the DNA without the money."" The anonymous fighter claimed his motivation for getting involved with the exchange was justified – because he only wanted to help Mr Foley's grieving family find closure. He called his work ""a humanity case.""

The source said that all final negotiations around the sale of the beheaded journalist would be conducted through a senior official in the Free Syrian Army (FSA). The US-backed rebel coalition has previously been involved in talks over the release of US and European hostages. It is understood that the US government is seeking to put a stop to the sale. Having allowed hostages to die in IS custody, the FSA official reasoned, it would look bad if such a deal succeeded. In the past, James Foley’s parents revealed that the US government had threatened them with prosecution if they tried to pay a ransom for their son’s release. The FSA source added: ""It will be like a shame for the US government. People will ask why you brought the body but you didn’t bring him when he was alive."""

The group are said to be coming up with new ways to raise money following a series of failed hostage negotiations and are now hoping to sell the murdered journalist's body back to his family.

The group are willing to provide a DNA test to prove the body is Foley's before taking it across the border into Turkey once the ransom is paid, reported Buzzfeed News.

Foley was the first US citizen to be beheaded by IS on video, a move which was widely condemned as a ""shocking and depraved"" act. The 40-year-old journalist was taken hostage while reporting in Syria in November 2012.

Three middlemen with ties to IS – a former Syrian rebel fighter, a businessman, and an official for the Free Syrian Army (FSA) – said the group believe the act of handing over the body is a ""humanity case"" to help give the family closure.

The former rebel said: ""They ask for $1m, and they will send DNA to Turkey, but they want the money first. They will not give the DNA without the money.""

The other two sources are said to have backed up the $1m figure.

It was previously reported that IS demanded a $132m ransom for Foley while he was still alive, which the US government refused to pay as they were not willing to negotiate with the terrorist group.

The FSA official notes the issues raised if the US now purchase Foley's body after allegedly threatening his parents with prosecution if they paid the ransom themselves.

""It will be like a shame for the US government,"" the official said. ""People will ask why you brought the body but you didn't bring him when he was alive.""

Foley's family have not commented on the claims and the US State Department said they are ""seeking more information"".

According to the New York Times report by Rukmini Callimachi, hostage negotiations and ransom payments has earned al-Qaida and its affiliates more than $125m over a five-year period.

""Although every country in the world says they don't pay, the reality is that, in fact, it's really only the British government, the US government, the Canadians, and a few small European governments that don't pay,"" wrote Callimachi."

A source who is a middleman contacted by ISIS to broker the deal told BuzzFeed that the terror group is trying to present it as an act of mercy for the family and a “humanity case,” the website said.

The Islamic fundamentalist group, which has overrun large sections of Iraq and Syria, killing thousands of people in the process, had been financing its military by selling oil produced by the wells in the areas it has captured and by collecting ransom from the governments of its non-American hostages.

But with the price of crude oil now plummeting and the United States and Britain standing firmly by their policy to not pay ransoms, ISIS — also known as the Islamic State — devised the plan to sell the corpse.

ISIS beheaded Foley on video last August.

It is offering his family a DNA sample to prove that the body it is holding really is his.

“They ask for $1 million, and they will send DNA to Turkey, but they want the money first,” the source told Buzzfeed. “They will not give the DNA without the money.”

The source told the website that he is concerned the United States will stop the deal even if the family wants it, because the government nixed a ransom demand before Foley’s death."

With the group having failed to strike deals to ransom the U.S. hostages in its custody — instead beheading three of them since July — its intermediaries are now trying to negotiate the sale of the body of at least one of the men it killed.

Three sources in contact with ISIS or its associates told BuzzFeed News that it wants to sell the remains of James Foley, the U.S. journalist whose August death was the first in a series of high-profile executions of Western hostages by ISIS hands.

They said ISIS wants $1 million for Foley's body, which it would deliver across the border to Turkey, and that the group was willing to provide a DNA sample to facilitate a deal.

If true, the attempted sale would highlight the ruthlessness behind the hostage-taking enterprise that has provided ISIS with deep reservoirs of funds and publicity — as well as the group's cold calculation as it works to raise more cash.

At one point early this year, ISIS held 23 Western hostages in Syria. Fifteen Europeans were freed as governments reportedly paid millions of dollars in ransoms, but the British and American hostages remained. Both governments refuse to negotiate for hostages or to allow families to pay ransoms. In the months since Foley's death, ISIS has released videotaped executions of the U.S. journalist Steven Sotloff, the British aid worker Alan Henning, and the U.S. aid worker Peter Kassig. British journalist John Cantlie and a U.S. woman, a 26-year-old aid worker, remain in ISIS hands.

All three of the sources seeking to act as middlemen in a deal with the secretive extremists have been granted anonymity to protect their safety.

One, a former Syrian rebel fighter, has ties to ISIS commanders dating to the early stages of Syria's civil war. He said he has served as an intermediary in hostage negotiations with Jabhat al-Nusra, the Syrian branch of al-Qaeda, and with ISIS. One day this fall, to prove his bona fides in the murky trade, he opened his iPhone to display unpublished videos of Western hostages in Nusra's custody.

This former rebel said he was approached by an ISIS leader who asked him to find a channel to either the U.S. government or Foley's family. Like the other sources, he noted a price of $1 million and the promise of DNA. ""They ask for $1 million, and they will send DNA to Turkey, but they want the money first,"" he said. ""They will not give the DNA without the money.""

He claimed his motivation was to help the grieving family find closure, calling his work ""a humanity case.""

Another intermediary, a businessman who has sought to use his own ISIS connections to facilitate hostage deals in the past, was candid about his goals: ""This is business.""

The trade in Western hostages has created a shadowy marketplace in which middlemen like these seek to negotiate deals in order to receive commission. They might inflate their connections on one side of proposed negotiations in order to draw interest from the other, so they can make a case for being included in the transaction. The idea of selling Foley's body has drawn attention among some of these middlemen of late, according to a Syrian who was involved with previous negotiations with ISIS over U.S. hostages.

Both the former rebel fighter and the businessman said that one point person for the negotiations would be a senior official in the Free Syrian Army (FSA), the U.S.-backed rebel coalition, who was involved in previous ISIS talks over U.S. hostages as well as deals to free European ones. In an interview in Antakya, this FSA official expressed dismay that word of the attempted sale of Foley's remains had leaked. He urged this reporter not to publish an article on the subject, fearing that the attention could sabotage any potential deal.

Of particular concern, he said, was that the U.S. government might seek to put a stop to it. Having allowed the U.S. hostages to die in ISIS custody, he reasoned, it would look bad if such a deal succeeded now. Foley's parents have said that the U.S. government threatened them with prosecution if they paid a ransom for their son's release. ""It will be like a shame for the U.S. government,"" the FSA official said. ""People will ask why you brought the body but you didn't bring him when he was alive.""

The FSA official described himself as the ""manager"" of the proposed negotiations. He was in touch with a middleman representing ISIS, he said, and if a deal progressed would seek to arrange it with someone representing the Foley family.

As before, ISIS seemed intent on making money from its hostage enterprise by any means. ""They were trying to negotiate (a ransom deal) for his freedom before they beheaded him, and after beheading him, they are trying to sell his body,"" the FSA official said.

The Foley family had no comment for this article.

An official with the U.S. State Department said ""we are seeking more information"" on whether ISIS is trying to sell the remains of U.S. hostages. A senior U.S. diplomat called the idea ""disgusting.""

A secret government document has been leaked revealing the ""administrative order"", telling authorities to ensure no one else is named ""Kim Jong-un"".

And if people don't agree, then to ""train them"" to change it.

It is believed anyone with the same name would be forced to have official documents, identity cards and even school certificates altered.

And officials have been told to reject any birth certificates for the name.

The internal policy was obtained by South Korean news station KBS TV and highlights some of the leader's craziest rules.

His name game was said to have been set up by a directive shortly after cheese-loving Kim was made Supreme Leader.

The document reads: ""All party organs and public security authorities should make a list of residents named Kim Jong-Un... and train them to voluntarily change their names.

“Authorities should make sure that there is no one making unnecessary complaints or spreading gossip … regarding this project.""

It is unsure whether the directive is authentic but officials have said that the names of each North Korean leader in the past - Kim Il-sung and Kim Jong-il - have been banned.

Yet North Korean defector Park Jin-hee, who obtained the document, said she was sure the 2011 directive was real.

“There is no one in the North named Kim Il-sung and Kim Jong-il, and there is no doubt the same rule applies for Jong-un.""

The news comes after accusations emerged that North Korean officials hacked Sony Pictures and leaked a number of future productions.

The North Korean have refused to comment on the cyber attack."	Killing in the name of!

There have been conflicting reports about the identity of the woman, with an Iraqi official denying on Wednesday she was al-Baghdadi's ex wife.

But a Lebanese interior minister confirmed today that the woman and child who were detained about 10 days ago in northern Lebanon travelling with a fake ID are in fact the ex wife and daughter of the terrorist leader.

Islamic State (IS) group leader Abu Bakr al-Baghdadi addresses worshippers at a mosque in Mosul, after he established a self-declared caliphate across Iraq and Syria on July 5, 2014

The woman, who has been named as Saja al-Dulaimi, was travelling with two sons and a daughter, Interior Minister Nouhad Mashnuq told the Lebanese MTV channel late Wednesday.

He said DNA tests showed that the girl was Baghdadi's child.

'Dulaimi is not Abu Bakr al-Baghdadi's wife currently. She has been married three times: first to a man from the former Iraqi regime, with whom she had two sons,' he said.

'Six years ago she married Abu Bakr al-Baghdadi for three months, and she had a daughter with him. Now, she is married to a Palestinian and she is pregnant with his child,' Mashnuq added.

'We conducted DNA tests on her and the daughter, which showed she was the mother of the girl, and that the girl is his (Baghdadi's) daughter, based on DNA from Baghdadi from Iraq,' the minister said.

The woman, who has been named as Saja al-Dulaimi (pictured), was travelling with two sons and a daughter, Interior Minister Nouhad Mashnuq told the Lebanese MTV channel late Wednesday

He gave no details on Dulaimi's nationality, but a security source said she was believed to be Iraqi.

Mashnuq offered no further information about her current husband, although he said investigations showed the woman had ties to extremists in Lebanon.

Dulaimi's children were at a children's care centre while she was being interrogated, he said.

Mashnuq also confirmed the arrest of the wife of Anas Sharkas, a leader in Al-Qaeda's Syrian affiliate Al-Nusra Front.

Dulaimi was among a group of female prisoners released from Syrian jails in March, in exchange for 13 nuns from the ancient town of Maalula held by Al-Qaeda's Syrian affiliate Al-Nusra Front.

The Islamic State (IS) group has yet to comment publicly on Dulaimi's detention, but Al-Nusra, despite a feud with Baghdadi's group, issued a statement of condemnation.

It described her as 'sister Saja al-Dulaimi' and said the arrest of women and children was evidence of the 'weakness' of the Lebanese state.

Sources said the detention of Dulaimi and Sharkas's wife could help the Lebanese as they struggle to negotiate the release of 27 members of the security forces held by jihadists from IS and Al-Nusra.

The soldiers and police were abducted when militants from the two groups briefly overran the Lebanese border town of Arsal in August."

On Tuesday, news spread about the arrest and interrogation of family members of Islamic State chief Abu Bakr al-Baghdadi in Lebanon. On Wednesday, Lebanon's interior minister confirmed the detention of a woman he said had been married to the ISIS leader for three months six years ago.

Details about the development are still coming into focus. The AP and others first reported that Lebanese officials had detained Baghdadi's wife and son, but the child was later confirmed to be the ISIS leader's daughter and the woman his former wife. The Lebanese newspaper As-Safir noted that the operation was conducted with the involvement of “foreign intelligence.” As Reuters reported, Baghdadi is believed to have three wives currently, ""two Iraqis and one Syrian.""

According to a security source quoted in AFP, the woman and child were ""taken to the defense ministry headquarters in Yarze, just outside the capital Beirut, 'where investigations were continuing.'"" The source added that the arrests had been kept under wraps so that security arrangements could be made.

It's unclear how useful these arrests will ultimately be, but they come as Lebanese authorities attempt to secure the release of 20 soldiers who are currently being held captive by Islamist groups. By some accounts, the capture of Baghdadi's family members provides the Lebanese government with a valuable bargaining chip."

Since her release she is believed to have moved around the border area between Lebanon and Syria, sticking mostly to the mountainous territory held by the Nusra Front, said Mario Abou Zeid, a research analyst with the Carnegie Middle East Centre in Beirut.



""She was infiltrating the Lebanese borders, moving inside and outside Lebanon with fake IDs … in the area controlled by Nusra Front,"" Mr Abou Zeid said. ""She maintained a very low profile, protecting herself and her son.""



He warned that Dulaimi's capture, while an important step, may be of limited value to intelligence services given the Islamic State was renowned for ensuring operational matters were never discussed outside a very tight inner circle.



""The main pillar of their success is to minimise the amount of information anyone can have access to.



""Some may think she has all the secrets of Baghdadi, even though she was captured in the Syrian regime and since her release she has been almost completely cut off from Baghdadi, on the run along the Lebanese-Syrian border.""



It is possible Dulaimi had been away from Baghdadi for so long that her information may be of little worth and her decision to relocate to Lebanon ""could have been a defection from Baghdadi, she could have been fleeing"", Mr Abou Zeid told Fairfax Media.



She is being questioned by investigators at the headquarters of the Lebanese defence ministry in the Yarze district, north of Beirut, the unnamed official said.



There is no doubt the counter-terrorism operation, which involved both Lebanese, US and European intelligence agencies, will prove useful, said retired Lebanese general and security analyst, Elias Farhat.



""She is one of the wives of the so-called caliph of the Islamic State … she will be useful in the negotiations between the Lebanese authorities as IS and Jabhat al-Nusra in relation to the kidnapped soldiers,"" General Farhat said.



""Her capture is one of the successful outcomes of cooperation between Lebanese and Western intelligence agencies.""



But even as news of Dulaimi's capture broke over Lebanon, local media reported late on Tuesday that militants had attacked a Lebanese army patrol in Ras Baalbek, with a four-man unit feared harmed or kidnapped.



It is believed Baghdadi became head of the Islamic State of Iraq, a predecessor to IS, in 2010. It then expanded into Syria in 2013 and in June Islamic State militants took control of Iraq's second city of Mosul before moving south towards the capital.



There were reports last month that he had been killed in US-led airstrikes in Iraq, although soon after the Islamic State released a recording on November 13 – purportedly by Baghdadi – in which he called for ""volcanos of jihad"" to be unleashed over the world.



The US Government has offered a $US10 million ($11.84 million) reward for his capture."

An Iraqi women, identified by local security sources as Saja Hamid al-Dulaimi was detained ten days ago at a checkpoint, along with Baghdadi’s son, north of the Lebanese town of Tripoli, a senior security confirmed to the Telegraph.

“She had crossed into Lebanon from Syria. She and her son were travelling on fake passports,” the source said.

The boy is said to be no older than 11 years of age.

Citing security officials, the Lebanese As-Safir newspaper said the child’s DNA had been tested and showed the leader of the Islamic State of Iraq and the Levant jihadist group is his father.

Baghdadi’s DNA is likely to have been taken by US officials in the American run Camp Bucca prison in Iraq, where he was detained in 2004.

The newspaper said the arrests had been made after a tip off from a “foreign” intelligence agency, that is believed to belong to a Western government.

The wife and child are said to be currently being held in the Ministry of National Defence headquarters in Yarze, just outside Beirut.

Mrs Dulaimi was one of 138 women released from a Syrian government jail in March as part of a prisoner swap that led to the release of 13 Syrian nuns being held by Jabhat al-Nusra, al-Qaeda’s branch in Syria.

Though Iraqi, Mrs Dulaimi had reportedly detained along with three of her children during a military operation near the Syria capital Damascus.

Earlier this year a photograph was circulated online purporting to be of Mrs Dulaimi. It showed a young woman with a pale face, clearly defined cheek bones and large eyes. Her hair is covered in a black hijab.

The release of Mrs Dulaimi was repeatedly demanded by the al-Qaeda kidnappers of the nuns, who were captured from a convent in the Syrian Christian town of Maaloula.

One source close to the negotiations told the Telegraph that they had “insisted” that without her release negotiations “would not continue”.

Mrs Dulaimi’s second detention is likely to be a significant personal blow to Baghdadi and could be used as a bargaining chip against his group, which has captured many foreign, Iraqi and Syrian prisoners and declared a caliphate in territory it has seized in Syria and Iraq.

Baghdadi has three wives, two Iraqis and one Syrian, according to tribal sources in Iraq.

Earlier this year the Telegraph visited the ramshackle neighbourhood of Tobchi in Baghdad, where Baghdadi, whose real name is Ibrahim Awad Ibrahim al-Badri, spent his early years.

A resident who had played football alongside Baghdadi, when they were both part of a team formed by the local mosque, said he had married shortly after completing his doctorate at the Islamic University in Baghdad at the start of the millennium.

The resident, who asked not to be named recalled that his wife had given birth to a son within less than a year of the marriage ceremony. His son is now approximately 11 years old, matching the age of the boy reportedly captured in Lebanon.

There were some contradicting and unconfirmed reports that the child captured may have been a girl.

Syria's civil war has killed more than 200,000 people in less than four years, the Syrian Observatory for Human Rights monitoring group said on Thursday."

The Lebanese army says it has detained the second wife of the Islamic State (Isis) leader, Abu Bakr al-Baghdadi, and their eight-year-old son near the Syrian border.

The arrest reportedly took place in the past week and followed information provided by western intelligence agencies in the past fortnight.

Lebanese security officials described the woman as a “high-value catch” and said the identity of the boy was confirmed through DNA testing. If so, the revelation would support the claim of international involvement. The US and other states have samples of Baghdadi’s DNA from the nine months he spent in US custody in Iraq in 2004.

The British Foreign Office said it had nothing to add to the reports.

Analysts in Iraq said that, if true, the arrest would not necessarily yield useful intelligence. The self-styled leader of the new Islamic caliphate, which covers part of eastern Syria and Iraq, operates in an exclusively male world where women are rarely empowered. Baghdadi is believed to have three wives, two of them Iraqi and one Syrian.

“It is close to impossible that she would have operational details,” said an Iraqi intelligence officer. “But she could still be useful on things like locations.”

Baghdadi is known to move frequently across Iraq’s north-west, where he has been the target of an intensive technical effort to track him by the US National Security Agency and Britain’s GCHQ. He uses trusted couriers to pass vital information, often in written letters, or repeated orally. The FBI has put a $10m (£6.4m) bounty on Baghdadi’s head.

Al-Safir, the Lebanese news magazine, which first reported the arrest, said the woman and her son were arrested near the restive border town of Arsal and were being detained at Lebanon’s military headquarters in the hills overlooking Beirut.

The woman was identified as Saja al-Dulaimi, an Iraqi, by a Lebanese security official and a senior political source. Dulaimi was one of 150 women released from a Syrian government jail in March as part of a prisoner swap that led to the release of 13 nuns taken captive by al-Qaida-linked militants in Syria, according to media reports at the time.

The arrest could be used as a bargaining chip against Isis, which has captured many foreign, Iraqi and Syrian prisoners. There was no immediate reaction on Isis websites, but in a possible Isis reprisal at least six Lebanese soldiers were killed on Tuesday by gunmen from Syria who attacked an army patrol near the border.

Isis continues to pose a mortal threat to Iraq’s central government and to the opposition and regime in Syria where a devastating civil war is nearing its fourth year. The Iraqi and Syrian militaries have tried to mount counteroffensives against the group in past weeks, with mixed success. However, neither they nor US-led air strikes have wound back the spectacular gains the group enjoyed from June to August when it rampaged through northern Iraq as the Iraqi army withdrew.

Meanwhile, Isis supporters released a video claiming responsibility for a shooting that wounded a Danish citizen in the Saudi capital of Riyadh last month.

The video posted online by the Al-Battar Media Foundation shows a gunman pulling up beside a vehicle and firing five times at the man in the car, identified as Thomas Hoepner. The video’s authenticity could not be confirmed but it was posted on a website commonly used by militants.

Saudi security officials say a Danish man was shot while driving November 22, and that he was treated for shoulder wounds. They did not release his name.

If confirmed, the shooting would be the first attack on foreigners in the kingdom carried out by IS supporters. About a decade ago, al-Qaida militants seeking to topple the Western-allied monarchy launched a wave of attacks that killed scores of security forces and Westerners in Saudi Arabia.

The video also includes audio clips of IS group leaders calling on supporters to launch attacks inside the kingdom.

In Brussels, Danish Foreign Minister Martin Lidegaard told reporters on Tuesday that “the Dane is doing better.”

Denmark and Saudi Arabia are part of the US-led coalition conducting airstrikes against IS militants in Iraq and Syria."

She added that the combats zone was strewn with Taliban bodies when the fighting was over.

A spokesman for the Afghanistan's Ministry of Interior told the agency it was a symbol of a public uprising.

The Taliban is yet to comment about the incident.

Alongside other insurgent groups, the Taliban have escalated attacks across the country since the withdrawal of most of the US led forces from the country last month.

Targeting, government, security and foreign installations, especially in the country's capital Kabul, members of the public have also been caught in the crossfire.

At least 50 people were injured earlier this week, when a suicide bomber detonated his explosive vest in a crowd watching a volleyball tournament at an inter-district competition in Yahyakahil, Paktika province.

The attacks have prompted Afghanistan's president Ashraf Ghani to order a comprehensive review of the country's defense forces.

He is also rethinking Afghan policy towards controversial night raids, banned by his predecessor Hamid Karzai.

Afghan President Ashraf Ghani has ordered a top-to-bottom inspection of his country's military forces after a rise in Taliban attacks

Ghani is considering whether night raids, barred by his predecessor Hamid Karzai, should be reintroduced

The latest attacks come as it was revealed US President Barack Obama signed a 'secret' order allowing the Pentagon to continue to target Taliban fighters even after the military withdrawal.

The president's decision, made during a White House meeting with national security advisers, also gives the military the green light to conduct air support for Afghan operations when needed.

Obama issued the guidelines in recent weeks, as the American combat mission in Afghanistan draws to a close, thousands of troops return home, and the military prepares for narrower counter terrorism and training mission for the next two years.

Afghan lawmakers have also approved agreements with the US and NATO allowing Western soldiers to remain in the country."

Gul said that the battlefield was covered in Talib fighters after the deadly exchange ended.

While the Taliban have not publicly commented on the incident, the Afghan government labeled it a symbol of a public uprising against the Taliban.

Taliban and other groups have regained large swathes of the country as U.S. and NATO forces slowly pull out troops after 14 years of war. The Taliban have targeted government and foreign infrastructure as the group attempts to claw back power it lost in 2001.

While the Taliban have made key gains in rural regions, members continue to employ suicide bomber tactics in well protected towns and cities. Earlier this week, 50 people were killed after a suicide bomber detonated a vest during a volleyball competition in Yahyakahil, Paktika province.

That particular attack prompted President Ashraf Ghani to order a complete overview of the country’s defense forces and to rethink the ban on nighttime raids, which were outlawed by his predecessor, Hamid Karzai."

Earlier he was missing altogether from the scene and his puzzling absence created a lot of curiosity. Kim Jong-Un has made his first public appearance for more than a month, with state media today reporting a visit to a new housing complex in Pyongyang. It marked the first time Kim has been seen since September 3 – an extended absence that fueled intense speculation, including rumours of a serious illness or even a coup.

The North’s official KCNA news agency said Kim made a “field guidance” tour of the new residential complex specially built for scientists working on North Korea’s satellite programme. “Looking over the exterior of the apartment houses and public buildings, decorated with diverse colored tiles, (Kim) expressed great satisfaction, saying they looked very beautiful,” the agency said."

North Korean despot Kim Jong-un has been guzzling pint after pint of ‘snake wine’, with the body of a dead cobra in the bottle – in a vain attempt to restore life to genitals he may not have seen for years due to his vast bulk.

Locals believe that the meaty brew increases the size of a man’s manhood – and improves chances of pregnancy.

Kim has piled on enormous amounts of weight after bingeing on Emmenthal cheese and Johnnie Walker whisky, and the 31-year-old is struggling to father a child with his lucky young wife, Ri Joi-Su, 22.

Kim believes that glugging litres of wine, mixed with rotting flesh and venom could be just the ticket to restore his virility and father a sibling for daughter Ju-ae, two.

One South Korean ex-pat said, ‘The elite in the country joke that he is too big to please his wife and that’s why they do not have any other children.’

‘One senior official said that Kim was drinking many bottles of snake wine to help him in the bedroom department.’

Jong-un was first exposed to Emmenthal while studying in Switzerland as a young man, and his fondness for the cheese is said to have rapidly escalated into dependence.

His ballooning weight is thought to be a result of daily binges on the cheese, which is used in fondues, gratins, raclettes and sandwiches.

The slippery despot has bought up cases of the pricey plonk – with the body of a deadly cobra inside the bottle – delivered to his palace in North Korea.

Locals believe snake wine helps men get their partners pregnant and improves the size of your manhood.

Kim, 31, and his wife Ri Jol-su, 22, are said to be having problems adding to their family because of his weight.

He recently stepped out in public eye for the first time in several weeks and insiders said it was due to health problems from his size.

The ruler’s waistline has expanded because of his love of imported French cheese and Johnnie Walker whisky.

One North Korea expert living in Seoul, South Korea, revealed: ”The elite in the country joke that he is now too big to please his wife and that’s why they do not have any other children.

“One senior official said that Kim was drinking many bottles of snake wine to help him in the bedroom department but nothing seemed to be working.”

Kim, who has a two-year-old girl called Ju-ae, is a fan of the bizarre brew which is made by placing the reptile in a jar of distilled alcohol and aging it.

Locals says that the more deadly the snake, the more powerful the booze.

Last week we revealed that Kim is trousering millions of pounds from workers building a city for the 2022 World Cup.

Thousands of North Korean migrants are toiling on construction sites in Qatar, human rights groups claimed.

Labourers are told they will receive their wages when they return home, but when they get back Kim’s henchmen pocket at least 90% of the cash.

Aidan McQuade, of Anti-Slavery International, said: “Withholding of wages and excessive overtime are indicative of state-sponsored trafficking for forced labour, a modern form of slavery.”"	Kim Jong-un necks litres of rare SNAKE wine because he's too fat to please his wife	2014-11-24 00:00:00+00:00	['Nadeem Badshah']	['wine', 'rare', 'fat', 'jongun', 'wages', 'wife', 'korea', 'necks', 'north', 'litres', 'deadly', 'revealed', 'kim', 'problems', 'hes', 'snake']	"Locals believe snake wine helps men get their partners pregnant and improves the size of your manhood.

In the Omsk region of Russia, a teen boy developed ""superpowers"" after he suffered electric shock. The boy, Nikolai Kryaglyachenko, discovered that he could attract metal items. He currently considers an idea of becoming a superhero.

""Even when I do not want to do it, I still attract things. Once I even attracted a glass - it just moved towards me,"" the boy, a second-grader, told Omsk TV and Radio Company.

Electric shock changed the boy's life. He has now become the most popular boy at school. Classmates often ask him to demonstrate his superpowers. Moreover, Nikolai can ""share"" his power. According to his peers, he can influence others so that people turn into live magnets as well.

""I could even hang a ladle on my nose,"" Nikolai's classmate, Vika Balandina said.

Journalists compared Nikolai to Marvel Comics character Magneto, who had similar abilities. The boy also says that he wants to become a superhero, although his teachers say that Nikolai is a very kind and friendly boy.

Stories about ""living magnets"" began to appear at least in the middle of the 19th century. In 2004, the story of Russian factory worker Leonid Tenkaev and his family received an extensive media coverage - the people obtained the ability to attract objects after the Chernobyl nuclear disaster.

Although the people, who have the ability to attract metal items, are commonly referred to as ""magnets,"" many of them can also hold plastic, glass, wood and paper items on their body. Only some of them develop a ""preference"" for a particular material. In 1990, as many as 300 ""living magnets"" gathered for a conference in Sofia, Bulgaria, after young woman Marinela Brankova demonstrated her amazing ability on TV. The woman could hold 7 kilos of metal on a vertical palm.

Researchers of the anomalous say that environment around us is filled with various vibrations - mechanical movements, electromagnetic vibrations, molecular vibrations, etc. We all live in an ocean of electromagnetic waves. Some people may act as magnet coils, accumulating and intensifying energy, making various items stick to their body. Some researchers believe that such anomalous phenomena are more common in the areas where ecological situation is poor. People may mutate under the influence of environment and develop such unusual capabilities. Some may develop stronger mutations and even levitate. Levitation is also a manifestation of mutations. For example, in medieval legends, witches and wizards would be of abnormally low weight, and could even hover above the ground.

Nikolai Kryaglyachenko has suddenly started developiong the same powers of metallic attraction as X-Men villain, Magneto – and it was all because of an electri shock that nearly killed him.

The 12-year-old had been walking home after school when he leaned briefly against the lamp post that was live from a faulty wire, and was blasted across the pavement.

And the next day he discovered that metal objects stuck to him like glue.

He revealed: ""When I came round I felt groggy but managed to get home and told my mum what had happened.

""When I woke up the next day and got out of bed I found some coins that had been lying on the mattress had stuck to my body.

""Then when I was having breakfast and dropped my spoon, it stuck to my chest.""

The comic book fan naturally assumed he was turning into a reallife Magneto and decided to test out his new abilities.

He explained: ""I can do things I couldn't do before but I don't have a lot of control over it.

""Even when I do not want to do it, I still attract things. Once I even attracted a glass – it just moved towards me.""

Fortunately, Nikolai doesn't want to destroy the world so that mutants to take over – and has decided to help people instead.

He has also found himself one of the most popular boys at school with many of his classmates asking him to demonstrate his superpowers, and Nikolai even claims that he seems to be able to share his power.

According to his classmates, he can influence others so that other people turn into live magnets as well.

His classmate, Vika Balandina, said: ""I could even hang a ladle on my nose.""

Nikolai said he was a keen fan of comics and, believing that maybe he had developed some sort of super magnetic power to attract metal like Magneto, had decided to put it to the test.

""I can do things I couldn't do before but I don't have a lot of control over it,"" he said.

""Even when I do not want to do it, I still attract things.

""Once I even attracted a glass - it just moved towards me.""

Nikolai added that he has now decided instead of a fireman he wants to be a superhero when he is older, saying that he would want to do something that helped people, and the job would certainly fulfil that role.

He has also found himself one of the most popular boys at school with many of his classmates asking him to demonstrate his superpowers, and Nikolai even claims that he seems to be able to share his power.

According to his classmates, he can influence others so that other people turn into live magnets as well.

Nikolai's classmate, Vika Balandina, said: ""I could even hang a ladle on my nose.""

Stories about ""living magnets"" began to appear at least in the middle of the 19th century.

In 2004, the story of a Russian factory worker Leonid Tenkaev and his family received extensive media coverage when he appeared to obtain the ability to attract objects after the Chernobyl nuclear disaster.

Although people who have the ability to attract metal items are commonly referred to as ""magnets,"" many of them can also hold plastic, glass, wood and paper items on their body.

Only some of them develop a ""preference"" for a particular material.

In 1990, as many as 300 ""living magnets"" gathered for a conference in Sofia, the capital of Bulgaria, after young woman Marinela Brankova demonstrated her amazing ability on TV.

The woman could hold 7 kilos of metal on a vertical palm.

Scientists say however that rather than people being magnetic, it is probably nothing more than unusually sticky skin."

Twelve-year-old Nikolai Kryaglyachenko was walking home from school one day when he stopped to lean against a lamppost.

Unfortunately for Nikolai, the lamppost had a faulty wire and the schoolboy was blasted across the street by a jolt of electricity.

“When I came round, I felt groggy, but managed to get home and told my mum what had happened. When I woke up the next day and got out of bed, I found some coins that had been lying on the mattress had stuck to my body. Then when I was having breakfast and dropped my spoon, it stuck to my chest,” Nikolai revealed.

Being a comic book fan, Nikolai immediately set about testing his new power, which is eerily similar to the power wielded by Marvel character Magneto.

“I can do things I couldn’t do before, but I don’t have a lot of control over it. Even when I do not want to do it, I still attract things. Once I even attracted a glass — it just moved towards me,” he said.

Naturally, Nikolai’s schoolmates were fascinated by his new power, but what they didn’t know was that he could pass his ability to others, turning them into human magnets, too.

“I could even hang a ladle on my nose,” said classmate Vika Balandina.

Nikolai is not the first real-life Magneto. In fact, an entire Russian family got magnetism superpower in 1987.

A year after the 1986 Chernobyl nuclear disaster, Leonid Tenkaev, his wife, Galina, their daughter Tanya and grandson Kolya were all able to stick metal objects to their bodies, according to The Guardian.

When they discovered their powers, Russian and Japanese scientists examined the family and verified that their seeming magnetism was real.

“There is absolutely no doubt that the objects stick as if their bodies were magnetic,” said Dr. Atusi Kono in 1991.

Another famous real-life Magneto revealed herself at a Superfields conference of 300 “human magnets” in 1990.

Extending her arms out, Marinela Brankova was able to support a 15-pound weight from her vertically turned palm, according to the book “Far Out: 101 Strange Tales From Science’s Outer Edge” by Mark Pilkington."

The unidentified Briton, who savagely beheaded two British and two American hostages held captive by Islamic State, is believed to have narrowly escaped death when he attended a summit in Al Qaim, in Anbar Province, Western Iraq, an Iraqi town close to the Syrian border, last Saturday (8 November).

American and Iraqi jets targeted the meeting of around 30 of the militant group's leaders, held in a makeshift underground bunker beneath a house.

We are aware of reports that this individual [Jihadi John] has been injured, and we are looking into them. - The Foreign Office

The joint US-Iraqi mission left at least ten IS commanders dead, and around 40 injured.

It was originally thought that IS leader Abu Bakr Al-Baghdadi was killed in the attack, however audio recordings emerged later confirming he survived. It was not known that Jihadi John had been present at the meeting.

A Foreign Office spokesperson said: ""We are aware of reports that this individual [Jihadi John] has been injured, and we are looking into them.""

""We have a number of sources of information coming in. The incident occurred last weekend, and so we have received the reports in the last few days. We don't have any representation inside Syria, and so it is difficult to confirm these reports.""

The Foreign Office also issued an official statement saying: ""We are aware of reports. We cannot confirm these reports.""

A spokesman for US Central Command said they are also unable to confirm the details for security reasons.

The executioner, who goes by the nomme de guerre Jalman Al-Britani, was reportedly rushed to the Al Qaim General Hospital for treatment. According to source, a nurse who treated the wounded in a hospital in Deir-ez-Zour, confirmed that one of the names on the injured list was Jalman, commenting that it was ""the one who slaughtered the journalists.""

The extent of his injuries is not yet known, but a source said that urgent calls were made through the local mosque's loudspeakers, appealing for the town's residents to donate blood at the hospital.

After being treated at the hospital, Jihadi John, Al-Baghdadi and several other wounded IS personnel were then driven to Syria, and travelled 200 miles north along the Euphrates valley to the IS stronghold of Raqqa.

They were transferred to two captured Syrian army barracks and treated within the secure confines of the underground medical facilities. Hospitals in Raqqa and nearby Deir-ez-Zour were ordered to take their medical supplies and staff to the secure bases, for the treatment of the injured terrorist leaders.

Jihadi John was videoed beheading British aid workers David Haines, 44, from Perth, and Alan Henning, 47, from Manchester; and American journalists James Foley, 40, and Steven Sotloff, 31.

In the most recent execution video of Mr Henning, released last month, the murderer threatened to behead another US hostage, Peter Kassig, 26, an aid worker.

In September, FBI Director James Comey confirmed the American bureau had identified the foreign jihadist after weeks of transatlantic intelligence efforts, but would not be releasing his identity.

A western Muslim recruit with a British accent, Jihadi John is one of the most hunted terrorists in the world, and is said to have acquired a position of seniority within the terror group for his allegiance to them. He has been made a member of a shura council, or governing body, of an IS 'wilayat', or province.

While British converts are usually used as foot soldiers, Jihadi John usually travels in a black Audi jeep, and has six other British terrorists with him who serve as his bodyguards.

Aged between 28 and 31, he was named as Abdel-Majed Abdel Bary, a rapper from Maida Vale, west London. Fluent in English, Arabic and classical Arabic, he first joined IS in Iraq when he left the UK, but then moved to Syria.

In September, his father, Adel Abdul Bary, 54, pleaded guilty to terrorism charges in relation to al-Qaida's bombing on US embassies in Kenya and Tanzania in 1998."

As if women were not subjugated enough already in Saudi Arabia, the nation’s Committee for the Promotion of Virtue and the Prevention of Vice announced yesterday that “tempting eyes” would be subject to veils if deemed inappropriate.

Sheikh Motlab al Nabet, spokesman of the Saudi Arabian committee, said in the announcement that, ""The men of the committee will interfere to force women to cover their eyes, especially the tempting ones. We have the right to do so.""

The new ban on well-manufactured facial features is broad enough to lead to some inquiry on the definition of ""tempting eyes."" Moreover, what is the process by which a woman will be found guilty of having “tempting eyes?” A humorous image can only come to mind with long lines of “tempting eyed women” waiting to be brought before the 1984-esque committee.

According to an unnamed journalist in Saudi Arabia, “tempting eyes” could possibly be defined with these stipulations: ""Uncovered eyes with a nice shape and makeup. Or even without makeup, if they are beautiful, the woman will be in trouble.""

The unnamed journalist went onto say, ""It's so stupid. I don't know what to say. They have to stop this. Many people will oppose this in the country. They won't be silent.""

While in most Western nations there is harsh divide between Church and State, in Saudi Arabia no such segmentation exists. In March, King Abdullah awarded the committee more than $53 million to continue enforcing their religious dogma via the estimated 3,500 to 4,000 religious police officers, which patrol the streets.

As King Abdullah nears the end of his reign, there was hope that a younger and more liberal dictator would follow. Prince Naif was recently appointed as the heir to the throne, but after giving his support to the committee, there is little hope that Saudi Arabia will evolve in the human rights department.

""The committee is supported by all sides,” Naif said. “It should be supported because it is a pillar from Islam. If you are a Muslim, you should support the committee.""

The parental “because I told you so” argument lacks logic and rationale, but such is the case when a nation resides under monarch rule. It remains unclear how many women will be found or charged with ""tempting eyes,"" but if there is a great enough dissenting voices, public outcry will hopefully have some bearing on the obscene policy.

In this part of the world, women are known to cover their bodies completely from head-to-toe. The eyes are one of the only parts of their body that are seen in public.

Opposing Views reports that women who have eyes “with a nice shape and makeup” could be deemed too tempting to other men, and police can make them wear veils. Committee for the Promotion of Virtue and the Prevention of Vice announced this decision a few days ago. It’s one bound to get universal criticism.

Assyrian International News Agency covered what the Saudi Arabian committee’s spokesman has to say about the new law. Sheikh Motlab al Nabet, explains that Saudi police “have a right” to make a woman cover her eyes.

“The men of the committee will interfere to force women to cover their eyes, especially the tempting ones. We have the right to do so.”

This development has sparked the question of what defines “tempting eyes” and how will women be evaluated on having them? An unidentified journalist in the nation best describes what Saudi police are going after.

“Uncovered eyes with a nice shape and makeup. Or even without makeup, if they are beautiful, the woman will be in trouble.”

He adds that a lot of people in Saudi Arabia will be very upset about the law. This type of control will outrage citizens of the country, the unnamed journalist says.

“It’s so stupid. I don’t know what to say. They have to stop this. Many people will oppose this in the country. They won’t be silent.”

The report notes that no divide between Church and State exists in Saudi Arabia. The bad part is that the Committee for the Promotion of Virtue and the Prevention of Vice has powerful “backers” that include Prince Naif, the heir to the nation’s throne. He announced that the committee “should be supported because it is a pillar from Islam. If you are a Muslim, you should support the committee.”

If there was any hope among the people that King Abdullah’s son would steer Saudi Arabia in a different direction, it’s lost at this point. By supporting the committee, the prince also supports the “tempting eye ban.” Oppression will continue in the nation, as women are considered nothing more than property.

—Cole Porter

It’s a safe bet that Sheikh Motlab al Nabet, spokesman of Saudi Arabia’s religious police, isn’t a fan of Cole Porter. “The lure of you” is precisely why Nabet announced yesterday that the Committee for the Promotion of Virtue and the Prevention of Vice will cover any women’s eyes that are deemed “tempting.” “The men of the committee will interfere to force women to cover their eyes, especially the tempting ones” he said. “[We] have the right to do so.”

What are “tempting” eyes? One Saudi journalist mused on condition of anonymity that they are “uncovered eyes with a nice shape and makeup. Or even without makeup, if they are beautiful, the woman will be in trouble.” The Orwellian-named committee did not provide a definition of tempting, but if they happen to rely on Merriam-Webster, then it means “having an appeal.” What is an appeal? According to the dictionary, it is “arousing a sympathetic response.” And what is sympathetic? “Showing empathy,” according to Merriam-Webster.

So there you have it. To allow a women’s eyes to capture the unfettered glory of the world, one must empathize with her very existence. But the religious police—massively funded by King Abdullah—cannot do this. “It’s so stupid,” the Saudi journalist tells me. “I don’t know what to say. They have to stop this. Many people will oppose this in the country. They won’t be silent.”

Perhaps they won’t be, but the Committee for the Promotion of Virtue and the Prevention of Vice has some of the most powerful backers in the country. Prince Naif, recently appointed heir to the throne, has said: “The committee is supported by all sides ... It should be supported because it is a pillar from Islam. If you are a Muslim, you should support the committee.” No surprise, then, that King Abdullah awarded this draconian body an additional 200 million riyals (about $53 million) in March.

How should America respond to this latest affront to Saudi women? Perhaps it can sponsor a contest of the most tempting eyes in Saudi Arabia. Women will send in pictures of their most tempting look and the winner will get to accompany President Obama during his next meeting with the Saudi dictator.

If Congress reconsidered the recent $60 billion U.S.-Saudi arms deal, the religious police might quickly find it “tempting” to stop treating women as property."

Islamic state fears effect of 'tempting' eyes on men

Says it 'has the right' to issue repressive edict



Women must already cover their hair and wear full-length black cloak



Women with attractive eyes may be forced to cover them up under Saudi Arabia's latest repressive measure, it was reported yesterday.



The ultra-conservative Islamic state has said it has the right to stop women revealing 'tempting' eyes in public.



A spokesperson for Saudi Arabia's Committee for the Promotion of Virtue and the Prevention of Vice, Sheikh Motlab al Nabet, said a proposal to enshrine the measure in law has been tabled.

'Tempting' eyes: Muslim women could be forced to cover up even their eyes if a 'right' of the Saudi state is enforced

Women in Saudi Arabia already have to wear a long black cloak, called an abaya, cover their hair and, in some regions, conceal their faces while in public.

If they do not, they face punishments including fines and public floggings.

One report on the Bikya Masr news website suggested the proposal was made after a member of the committee was attracted by a woman’s eyes as he walked along a street, provoking a fight.

The woman was walking with her husband who ended up being stabbed twice in the hand after the altercation.

The virtue and vice committee has repeatedly been accused of human rights violations.



Founded in 1940, its function is to ensure Islamic laws are not broken in public in Saudi Arabia.



In 2002, the committee refused to allow female students out of a burning school in the holy city of Mecca because they were not wearing correct head cover.



The decision is thought to have contributed to the high death toll of 15.



They are also banned from driving by religious edict and cannot travel without authorisation from their male guardians.

In September, a Saudi women sentenced to 10 lashes for defying the driving ban was only spared when King Abdullah stepped in to stop the public flogging."

An airstrike has wounded the leader of the Islamic State group, Abu Bakr al-Baghdadi, according to Iraqi officials.

Pentagon officials said they had no immediate information on such a strike or of al-Baghdadi being wounded.

Iraq’s Defence and Interior Ministries issued statements saying al-Baghdadi had been wounded, without giving further detail.

An Interior Ministry intelligence official said al-Baghdadi was hit during a meeting yesterday with militants in the town of Qaim in Iraq’s western Anbar province.

The official, citing informants within the militant group, said the strikes wounded al-Baghdadi. A senior Iraqi military official also said he learned in operational meetings that al-Baghdadi had been wounded.

Al-Baghdadi, an ambitious Iraqi militant believed to be in his early 40s, has a 10 million dollar US (£6.2m) bounty on his head.

Since taking the reins of the group in 2010, he has transformed it from a local branch of al Qaida into an independent transnational military force, positioning himself as perhaps the pre-eminent figure in the global jihadi community.

Abu Bakr al-Baghdadi said to be among several hurt or killed ISIS leaders

Wounded? Abu Bakr al-Baghdadi, leader the so-called Islamic State, is said to be among those targeted

Speculation is mounting that the leader of ISIS, Abu Bakr al-Baghdadi, was indeed killed in a US led airstrike on Friday.

On Sunday senior Iraqi officials confirmed that the leader of the Islamic State group was at the very least wounded in the coalition attack and said that the terror chief's right hand man, Auf Abdulrahman Elefery, had perished during the aerial assault.

Elefery, who is known by his code name Abu Suja, died when planes hit an ISIS convoy near Mosul in northern Iraq.

However, conflicting reports surround the fate of Baghdadi.

ISIS members have taken to social media to claim that he was not traveling in the same convoy that claimed Elefery's life, while other sources have stated that the feared warlord was killed or seriously injured in the airstrike.

An Iraqi security official, Hisham al-Hashimi, told the UK's Daily Telegraph that Elefery was 'Baghdadi's very close companion' and was killed in the attack which destroyed up to 10 vehicles.

'He and Baghdadi were rarely separate. It's for this reason that it could be possible that Baghdadi was with him at the time of the attack,' he said to the British newspaper.

Hashimi revealed that Elefery's death was confirmed to him by relatives.

General Nicholas Houghton, the Chief of the Defence Staff of the British Armed Forces told the Daily Telegraph: 'I can't absolutely confirm that Baghdadi has been killed. Probably it will take some days to have absolute confirmation.'

Attacks: Two strikes were reported, one at al-Qaim, near the Syria-Iraq border, and a second in the ISIS stronghold of Mosul

The official, citing informants within the militant group, said the strikes wounded al-Baghdadi. A senior Iraqi military official also said he learned in operational meetings that al-Baghdadi had been wounded.

Prisoner: al-Baghdadi, shown before his rise to power, was held as a prisoner by the U.S. during the occupation of Iraq

On Friday, U.S. President Barack Obama authorized the deployment of up to 1,500 more American troops to bolster Iraqi forces, including into Anbar province, where fighting with Islamic State militants has been fierce.

The plan could boost the total number of American troops in Iraq to 3,100. There now are about 1,400 U.S. troops in Iraq, out of the 1,600 previously authorized.

Two witnesses confirmed that bombs had fallen on the town of al-Qaim, next to the Syrian border.

Local government sources described how an aircraft had swooped over a meeting of senior ISIS figures and dropped its payload, killing more than a dozen people.

Another witness said that eight people had died when a bomb struck a market.

A local hospital was said to be overwhelmed with the volume of patients from the raid - including al-Baghdadi.

Local ISIS officials were reportedly roaming the streets with loudspeakers ordering residents to donate blood to help the wounded.

Striking Baghdadi would be the most significant blow yet in the campaign against ISIS, who have been defiant in the face of sustained air attacks from the U.S. Air Force and allies.

A provincial leader from Anbar in western Iraq, as well as his deputy, are said to be among those killed instantly by the bombs.

Al-Qaim and the neighbouring Syrian town of Albukamal are on a strategic supply route linking territory held by Islamic State in Iraq and Syria.

The so-called Caliph, who declared himself leader of all the world's Muslims in a televised speech, was formerly a prisoner of the U.S. during their occupation of Iraq.

The shady figure was eventually released, and rose through the ranks of the jihadist groups which eventually united to form ISIS, or the Islamic State.

Iraqi security officials could not immediately comment on the reported raid. The U.S. military did not confirm or deny the strike.

Separately, the coalition of air forces, which includes Great Britain's RAF and Canadian fighter planes, struck a convoy just outside Mosul, ISIS's stronghold city in northern Iraq.

U.S. officials would not confirm or deny whether Baghdadi, the group's overall leader, had been targeted, though one said that the coalition's airstrikes had not been targeting any particular meeting.

IS-affiliated Twitter accounts rushed to deny the reports, with one tweeting: 'I can report to the Muslims that Amir Al-Momineen Abu Bakr Al-Baghdadi Hafid hu'allah is alive and well.'

The hardline Sunni Islamic State's drive to form a caliphate in the two countries has helped return sectarian violence in Iraq to the dark days of 2006-2007, the peak of its civil war.

It has also created a cross-border sanctuary for Arab militants, as well as foreign fighters whose passports could allow them to evade detection in Western airports.

The U.S. strikes coincide with violence elsewhere in Iraq, after jihadist-style attacks hit the Iraqi capital of Baghdad.

On Saturday night a car bomb killed eight people in Baghdad's mostly Shi'ite Sadr City, police and hospital sources said.

The blasts bring to 28 the day's toll from bombs in the Iraqi capital and the western city of Ramadi.

Two bombs exploded in separate attacks in Baghdad's mainly Shi'ite Amil district, said a police source.

'A driver parked his car and went to a cigarette stall, then he disappeared. Then his car blew up, killing passers-by,' the source said, describing one of the two attacks in Amil.

In the mostly Shi'ite al-Amin area of Baghdad, another car bomb killed eight people, medical sources said.

The attack by a suicide bomber on a checkpoint in Ramadi in Anbar killed five soldiers. 'Before the explosion, the checkpoint was targeted with several mortar rounds. Then the suicide humvee bomber attacked it,' said a police official.

There was no claim of responsibility for the bombings, but they resembled operations carried out by Islamic militants.

In the town of Baquba, 40 miles northeast of Baghdad, a gunman killed a Shi'ite militiaman, and a car bomb targeting a police officer killed his 10-year-old son, security sources said.

Western and Iraqi officials say U.S.-led air strikes are not enough to defeat the al Qaeda offshoot and Iraq must improve the performance of its security forces to eliminate the threat from the group, which wants to redraw the map of the Middle East.

President Barack Obama has approved sending up to 1,500 more troops to Iraq, roughly doubling the number of U.S. forces on the ground, to advise and retrain Iraqis in their battle against Islamic State.

The Iraqi prime minister's media office said the additional U.S. trainers were welcome but the move, five months after Islamic State seized much of northern Iraq, was belated, state television reported.

SOCCER-LOVING PHD STUDENT WHO BECAME WORLD'S WORST TERRORIST WITH $10 MILLION BOUNTY ON HIS HEAD: WHO IS ABU BAKR AL-BAGHDADI? Abu Bakr Al-Baghdadi is the relatively discreet leader of the Islamic State extremist group. He used to play for his mosque's soccer team and has a PhD in Islamic history. But after spending four years in a US camp during the Iraq occupation, he emerged as one of the most brutal terrorists in the world. The government placed a $10 million bounty on his head in 2011 when intelligence identified his movements as critically dangerous. This warrant was publicized once more following the beheadings of US nationals James Foley and Steven Sotloff as well as Britons David Haines and Alan Henning. He maintained a low profile for months as ISIS, the group's original name, rose to global infamy and Al Qaeda denounced them as 'too extreme'. But he finally revealed himself to the public with a speech, filmed and posted on YouTube, in the first week of July this year. Born Awwad Ibrahim al-Badri al-Samarri in 1971 near Samarra, Iraq, he came from a Sufi family - a tolerant form of Islam. In the 1990s, he completed a PhD in Baghdad and played soccer with friends. But he fell out with mosque leaders and fled to Anbar province where he joined Sunni groups protesting the US occupation. American forces detained Baghdadi at Camp Bucca in 2005 shortly after the Iraq invasion. He was released when the camp closed in 2009. He was thought to be 'bad but not the worst' sources told The Daily Beast. But he then joined the Islamic States of Iraq and Syria, and rose up the ranks rapidly. After allegedly killing the leader, Abu Omar Baghdadi, he took hold of the terror group.

The United States spent $25billion on the Iraqi military during the U.S. occupation that toppled Saddam Hussein in 2003 and triggered an insurgency that included al Qaeda.

Washington wants Iraq's Shi'ite-led government to revive an alliance with Sunni tribesmen in Anbar province which helped U.S. Marines defeat al Qaeda.

Such an alliance would face a more formidable enemy in Islamic State, which has more firepower and funding.

Police Colonel Shaaban Barazan al-Ubaidi, commander of a rapid reaction force in Anbar, said security forces retook eight villages. His account could not be immediately confirmed.

Why evil ISIS boss al-Baghdadi may be FAKING his own death in a Homeland-style plot to dupe the West

In the Channel 4 series, the Taliban mastermind battling CIA station chief Carrie Mathieson (pictured) is very much alive, pulling the strings from his perfect hiding place and spinning a web of lies to dupe the Americans

The ‘kill mission’ against Islamic State boss Abu Bakr al-Baghdadi carries chilling echoes of TV show Homeland where the chief terror suspect Haissam Haqqani is supposedly killed in a drone attack.

In the Channel 4 series, the Taliban mastermind battling CIA station chief Carrie Mathieson is very much alive, pulling the insurgent strings from his perfect hiding place and spinning a web of lies to dupe the Americans.

I wonder if al-Baghdadi is doing the same. It would certainly suit him to play dead for a while - plus, he's risen from beyond the grave before.

Even now, the Pentagon is seeking to confirm whether coalition air strikes have critically injured or even managed to kill the elusive ‘caliph’ – and we are none the wiser.

Could it be telling that the news of his death apparently leaked out from ISIS itself?

So far, U.S. officials are working on inference.

Late on Friday night, American warplanes hit a ten-car convoy southwest of Mosul, which functions as ISIS’s capital in northern Iraq.

Among the 20 people thought to have been killed was Auf Abdulrahman Elefery, who is known by his code name Abu Sajar, a key aide to Baghdadi.

If Abu Sajar was there, it is likely that Baghdadi was too, though he may also be among the casualties who were rushed to Mosul hospitals, where there were urgent appeals over loudspeakers for blood donations.

According to Iraqi sources, parallel attacks on Qaim in Anbar province killed one of the terror group's top strategists in a predominantly Sunni region where ISIS has made huge military advances in recent weeks as the world’s attention was distracted by its relentless siege of Kobane in northern Syria.

Normally so effusive on social media, ISIS are being strangely coy about the losses it may have sustained this weekend, though it has started arresting former members of the Iraqi army lest they are providing the US with actionable intelligence.

ISIS is probably scouring their deep substitute bench for replacements for anyone killed, including Baghdadi himself.

Baghdadi has made a lifelong virtue of anonymity, especially since his Al Qaeda mentor, Abu Musab al-Zarqawi was killed in a U.S. bombing raid in 2006.

Except for his brief appearance in Mosul in July to proclaim himself Caliph (an office that fuses political and religious leadership), Baghdadi has kept a low profile, so that the fate of ISIS does not appear to hinge on his personal survival.

It also offers the perfect cover should Baghdadi wish to disappear for a while, Homeland-style.

For Baghdadi has been careful to organize ISIS in such a way that power is highly decentralised, with a clear division between those responsible for administering territories the terror group controls and those who direct its military operations.

ISIS has been careful to include many Sunni tribal figures in administration, precisely to pre-empt any U.S. attempt to trigger a tribal uprising against them, a strategy the Americans pursued against Al Qaeda in Iraq (ISIS’s forerunner) in 2007-08 with some success.

Targeted: Baghdadi was reportedly wounded on Friday night when American warplanes hit a ten-car ISIS convoy like this one southwest of Mosul, which functions as ISIS's capital in northern Iraq (file picture)

ISIS’s military command includes at least two Sunni Muslim Iraqi army generals on the run since the Saddam era, who clearly have considerable tactical ability.

ISIS has used lightning advances and exemplary terror as well as suicide bombers to destroy enemy command and control centres.

They also use the destruction of bridges and controlled flooding to shape battlefields to their choosing, and the deployment of roadside bombs and embedded tanks to inhibit countermoves by their Iraqi or Kurdish opponents.

So far, the U.S. response has been to remove the unpopular Shia prime minister of Iraq, to reduce the alienation of the country’s Sunni and limited efforts to restore the fighting morale of the Iraqi national army, which, poorly led, effectively fled from this ferocious opponent.

The only effective obstacles to ISIS taking over the country have been Shia militias in Baghdad and further south, and the Kurdish peshmerga in the north.

Although the U.S. has added a further 1,500 military advisers, bringing their total strength to over 3000, they have to be careful since the same Shia militias are restive about a renewed U.S. ‘occupation’ of Iraq.

American airstrikes have been criticised as a drizzle when what is required resembles a cloud burst in a thunder storm.

So far there have been an average of five strikes a day, compared with 50 in Libya in 2011, 85 in Afghanistan, and 800 a day in Iraq itself during the 2003 US-led invasion.

So far, only 800 of the 3, 200 sorties over Iraq and Syria have actually involved dropping bombs or firing missiles.

Until these raids at the weekend, there has been an absence of actionable intelligence from the ground, while Pentagon lawyers are being ultra cautious about avoiding any civilian casualties.

The long distance planes have to fly from bases in Qatar or the UAE, or from carriers in the Persian Gulf, also makes it hard for them to loiter looking for targets of opportunity."

A female Kurdish fighter, who was viewed as an iconic face of the Kurdish resistance movement, has been reportedly beheaded by ISIS.

The woman, known by the nickname ‘Rehana’ became a face of the conflict after a picture of her holding a rifle and making a V sign was posted on Twitter, receiving over 5,000 retweets.

She fought for the Kurdish Women’s Defense Unit and claimed to have killed 100 ISIS militants.

It is now believed that Rehana may have been killed by IS militants after a picture circulated on Twitter, purporting to show her head being held aloft by a member of the jihadist organisation.

Her death has not been confirmed, however, by the Women’s Defense Unit.

She had been fighting to defend Kobane, a Syrian border town which has been under assault by ISIS for more than a month.

More than 10,000 women have helped to defend the town since the establishment of all female combat units in April.

They now reportedly play a major role in fighting against the IS.

Another female Kurdish fighter, who goes by the pseudonym of Afshin Kobani, said that the advancement of ISIS in Syria had forced to her to join the fight in Kobane.

‘I lost many friends to this, and I decided there was a need to join up,’

‘This is our land – our own – and if we don’t do it, who else will?

‘We are just the same as men; there’s no difference,’ she said. ‘We can do any type of job, including armed mobilisation.’

Baghdad (IraqiNews.com) Rehana, the Syrian Kurdish girl claimed to be killed by ISIS is reported to be alive and well according to the Kurdish journalist, Pawan Durani.

The Kurdish journalist, Pawan Durani, reported today that the famous Kurdish fighter is still alive and hunting ISIS fighters in the strategic town of Kobani. Durani wrote “Rehana is very much alive. ISIS supporters are just trying to lift morale.”

“Rehana keeps fighting and hunting ISIS militants in Kobani. Let them produce even a single picture of Rehana. Propaganda and falsehood run in their blood.”

Rehana, has become a famous symbol after she killed more than a hundred ISIS militants in Ain Al-Arab, Kobani. Rehana is fighting for the Kurdish Peshmerga forces, which includes an Independent Women’s Battalion for female volunteers.

In a lengthy press conference Thursday afternoon, RCMP Commissioner Bob Paulson also said Michael Zehaf Bibeau shot Cpl. Nathan Cirillo from behind, and the soldier did not see him coming. Zehaf Bibeau shot at a second soldier with Cpl. Cirillo, but missed.

Police say the video shows Zehaf Bibeau was able to get from Wellington Street to Centre Block in about one minute and 20 seconds and there was little time to respond. The video shows Mounties chasing him, closely behind.

The video does not show what occurred inside Parliament, where Zehaf Bibeau was killed. Police said they are still putting together what happened inside.

Paulson said Zehaf Bibeau was in Ottawa to apply for a passport, which was in the process of being evaluated, and they believe he wanted to travel to Syria. Paulson said there is no known link between Zehaf Bibeau and Martin Couture-Rouleau, who ran down two Canadian soldiers in Quebec Monday, killing one.

However, Zehaf Bibeau was associated with “an individual known to us,” Paulson said. He said the gunman’s email was found in the hard drive of a person charged with a terror-related offence.

The RCMP commissioner also said the gunman was not one of the 93 people on the RCMP’s high-risk travel list.

Zehaf Bibeau’s mother told the RCMP that her son wanted to travel to Syria when they spoke to her Wednesday, Paulson said.

Police say do not know how he got the weapon, a 30-30 Winchester lever action rifle, and that’s a significant part of their investigation. He was banned from owning a firearm, the RCMP said.

Zehaf Bibeau came to Ottawa on October 2 and was staying at the Ottawa Mission, a downtown men’s shelter. Residents there said he struggled with drug addiction and he was “furious” about not being able to get a passport.

“He went on for more than an hour about how much this country sucked and how he wanted to get out of here, and he was furious about the passport,” Mission resident Norman LeBlanc told The Canadian Press Thursday.

The vehicle used in the attack, an older-model Toyota Corolla, was only purchased on October 21, police said.

The commissioner also announced that the RCMP will now stay with Prime Minister Stephen Harper “24/7, no matter where he is.”"	RCMP release security footage of Michael Zehaf Bibeau during attack, say he shot soldier in back	2014-10-23 00:00:00	[]	['release', 'travel', 'soldier', 'paulson', 'commissioner', 'security', 'told', 'bibeau', 'say', 'video', 'ottawa', 'footage', 'zehaf', 'rcmp', 'shot', 'wanted', 'michael']	"The RCMP released security footage that showed Michael Zehaf Bibeau running towards Parliament with his gun drawn, carjacking a minister’s car and attempting to make his final assault on Centre Block.

However, local reports say that Zehaf-Bibeau was Canadian-born, while Reuters have reported that he was a convert to Islam and was from Quebec.

Earlier today at a press conference following the dramatic incident in Canada’s capital city of Ottawa, Mayor Jim Watson said: “I urge all of my fellow residents to think of the individual standing on guard this morning at the National War Memorial.

“Remember how that one person's life has been taken from us - from family, from friends, from the future that was to be his.”

As reported by CBC News, Cirillo was just one of the guards on duty, who make up of a larger roster of soldiers that rotate on an hourly or bi-hourly basis. They also carry unloaded rifles.

Officials also said that the incident ""caught us surprise"", despite the government upgrading its terror threat from low to medium a day prior due to ""general chatter"" online from jihadist groups including Isis.

An Facebook group in memory of Cirillo has already had over 10,000 followers, with friends and acquaintances of the solider reportedly emailing in their memories of him.

Michael Zehaf-Bibeau has been identified as the gunman in Ottawa who shot a soldier before firing shots in Centre Block, and people are looking for pictures of him.

Zehaf-Bibeau appeared to have no online presence–a term that basically refers to having accounts on social media or being reported on before–prior to being named as the shooter.

The only picture so far that allegedly shows the 32-year-old comes from an account linked to ISIS, or the Islamic State.

The photo has not been verified.

It shows a man holding a gun, in casual clothing with a scarf covering the lower part of his face.

More pictures will be posted as they come through.

Witnesses said the gunman who killed a soldier at the National War Memorial before entering Parliament and firing off more shots was dressed in all black and wearing a scarf around his face.

Tony Zobl, 35, told the Canadian Press news agency that he witnessed the soldier being gunned down from his fourth-floor window directly above the National War Memorial.

“I looked out the window and saw a shooter, a man dressed all in black with a kerchief over his nose and mouth and something over his head as well, holding a rifle and shooting an honor guard in front of the cenotaph point-blank, twice,” Zobl said.

“The honor guard dropped to the ground, and the shooter kind of raised his arms in triumph holding the rifle.”

CBS says that Michael’s full name was Michael Abdul Zehaf Bibeau–and that he dropped the Michael after converting to Islam. At other times he apparently dropped the Abdul.

Although Canadian police have not released the name of the Ottawa shooter, on Wednesday afternoon U.S. sources leaked that the suspect’s name is Michael Zehaf Bibeau, a 32-year-old Canadian who was a recent convert to Islam.

Bibeau’s name was first broadcast by CBS, allegedly via U.S. intelligence sources who had been in contact with their Canadian counterparts.

Later, Reuters also cited U.S. sources in confirming Bibeau was a recent convert to Islam and may have been born with the name Michael Joseph Hall.

The suspect—who was reportedly born and raised in Quebec—has a lengthy criminal past in Montreal, Aylmer, QC and British Columbia.

A Zehaf-Bibeau resided in Montreal’s Villeray-Saint Michel-Park Extension borough between 2004 and 2006.

His most recent court record indicates Zehaf-Bibeau fell off the map for three years, as far as the Montreal courthouse was concerned, because he failed to show up in court on a simple marijuana charge that had been filed against him on March 14, 2006.

He turned up in court more than three years later, on Dec. 12, 2009, to plead guilty to the charge. As part of his sentence he was granted an absolute discharge. (Under that charge the man was charged and convicted under the name Michael Bibeau-Zehaf.)

His most serious conviction came on Dec. 7, 2004, when Zehaf-Bibeau pleaded guilty to possession of phencyclidine, also known as PCP, and was sentenced to a 60-day prison term.

On the same day, he also pleaded guilty to marijuana possession and was sentenced to one day in prison. He has also been convicted for failing to comply with conditions of a release.

In court records related to another charge for breach of conditions, Zehaf-Bibeau listed his address as being in Aylmer, QC, a city of 40,000 just 23 minutes west of Downtown Ottawa.

And, just two years ago, Bibeau was on the West Coast.

According to British Columbia Court records, a “Michael Joseph Paul Zehaf Bibeau” committed robbery in Vancouver on December 16, 2011, and also racked up a lesser charge of uttering threats.

As of Tuesday evening, Vancouver Police were working with Ottawa law enforcement to pass on information about the suspect’s time in B.C.

“The Vancouver Police Department, along with the BC RCMP, are working together to assist an Ottawa City Police and RCMP National Security investigation,” wrote Vancouver Police spokesman Randy Fincham late Wednesday afternoon. “Due to the ongoing investigation, there is little information we can share at this time,” he added.

Citing confidential sources, the Globe and Mail reported Tuesday that Bibeau was a “high-risk traveller” whose passport had been seized to prevent him from travelling abroad to join ISIS fighters in Iraq or Syria.

On Tuesday, the RCMP confirmed that Martin Rouleau, the man accused of running over two Canadian Forces soldiers in Saint-Jean-Sur-Richelieu, had been one of 90 suspects under similar observation.

Nevertheless, as of Tuesday the RCMP had not confirmed that they had been monitoring Zehaf-Bibeau.

Unlike other Canadian homegrown terrorist suspects, Zehaf-Bibeau had no obvious web presence: No Twitter account, no Facebook page, and no Jihadist scrawls in random blogs or YouTube comment sections.

Witnesses say they saw Bibeau wearing a black coat with blue jeans, according to the CBC. The same report says gun used in the attack was a double-barrel shotgun.

Although, if the example of Saint-Jean-Sur-Richelieu terrorist suspect Martin Rouleau is any indication, he may have changed his name following his conversion to Islam.

Before he allegedly ran over two Canadian soldiers in the parking lot of a Service Canada location, Rouleau reportedly changed his name to Ahmad LeConverti (Ahmad The Converted).

Although there are no Zehafs listed in Canadian phone books, the name Bibeau is common throughout Quebec.

On Wednesday, Quebecer Michaël Bideau noted on his Facebook page that he shared virtually the same name and birth year of the alleged shooter.

“You will have hate messages on your Facebook before long!!” wrote one of his friends, although as of Wednesday night nobody appears to have mistaken him for the shooting suspect.

Early Tuesday afternoon, @V_IMS, a French-language pro-ISIS social media account posted a grainy photo that was allegedly of the Ottawa shooter.

The image, which was apparently snapped from a TV screen using a cell phone, showed a dark-haired man wearing a scarf and holding a light hunting rifle.

Witness accounts from the scene say that the shooter was armed with a double-barrelled shotgun.

According to reports from Ottawa Police, however, the shooter was armed with a 30-30 rifle, a caliber common to lever-action hunting rifles that would be consistent with the firearm held by the man featured in the Tweeted image.

Harper addressed the nation hours after a young soldier was gunned down at the National War Memorial in Ottawa and dozens of shots fired inside Parliament ended with the shooter’s death.

The attacks in Ottawa occurred just two days after a Quebec soldier was killed in what Harper called an Islamic State-inspired attack in St-Jean-sur-Richelieu, not far from Montreal. The suspect in that case was killed by police after brief chase.

Harper said more information about the “terrorist” killed in Ottawa will surface in the coming days. CTV News has confirmed that the suspect in Wednesday’s attack is Michael Zehaf-Bibeau, a Canadian citizen born in 1982.

“This week’s events are a grim reminder that Canada is not immune to the types of terrorist attacks we have seen elsewhere around the world,” the prime minister said.

“We are also reminded that attacks on our security personnel and on our institutions of governments are by their very nature attacks on our country, on our values, on our society, on us Canadians as a free and democratic people who embrace human dignity for all,” he said.

“But let there be no misunderstanding -- we will not be intimidated. Canada will never be intimidated.”

Harper said the attacks will only strengthen Canada’s resolve and lead the government to “redouble our efforts and those of our national security agencies to take all necessary steps to identify and counter threats and keep Canada safe here at home.”

National Defence Minister Rob Nicholson echoed Harper in a statement issued late Wednesday, saying that Canada’s deployments in Iraq as part of the U.S.-led fight against ISIS “will continue unimpeded.”

The prime minister offered his condolences to the friends and family of Cpl. Nathan Cirillo, the reservist who was “murdered in cold blood” Wednesday while standing guard at the war memorial. Harper also praised the passersby and first responders who tried to save his life.

Opposition Leader Thomas Mulcair called the shootings ""a cowardly attack designed to strike at the heart of our democracy, the heart of who we are.""

But he said Canadians will once again wake up in a country “blessed by love, diversity and peace.”

RCMP Commissioner Bob Paulson said Thursday that Zehaf-Bibeau had applied for a passport, and police were doing background checks. Zehaf-Bibeau was not on the list of “high-risk travellers” being tracked by Canadian authorities, Paulson said.

Court records show that a Michael Joseph Zehaf-Bibeau was accused of robbery in Vancouver in late 2011. He was found guilty of uttering threats, a lesser charge.

Panic on the Hill

The chaos in Ottawa began around 9:52 a.m. Wednesday, when police received multiple 911 calls about a shooting at the National War Memorial.

When paramedics and police arrived, the honour guard -- later identified as Cirillo -- was on the ground, surrounded by people who tried to help him.

A short time later, the gunman entered Parliament’s Centre Block and dozens ofshots rang out as MPs, staff and reporters rushed to safety. The suspect was gunned down by Kevin Vickers, the sergeant-at-arms for the House of Commons.

Three other people were taken to the Ottawa Hospital after the shootings. They were all discharged by Wednesday evening.

Parliament Hill and Ottawa’s downtown core were under lockdown for hours after the shootings, but police have not said if other suspects were still on the loose.

Ottawa Police Chief Charles Bordeleau said residents need to stay “vigilant” and report any suspicious activity to police. But he did not directly answer questions from reporters about the possibility that another shooter -- or shooters -- were still at large.

Earlier Wednesday, Ottawa police Const. Marc Soucy said officers believe there may be more than one assailant. He said that police will be assuming that any other assailants are armed.

Tony Zobl, 35, told The Canadian Press that he witnessed the soldier being gunned down from his fourth-floor office window directly above the war memorial.

""I looked out the window and saw a shooter, a man dressed all in black with a kerchief over his nose and mouth and something over his head as well, holding a rifle and shooting an honour guard in front of the Cenotaph point-blank, twice,"" Zobl told CP.

""It looked like the honour guard was trying to reach for the barrel of the gun. The honour guard dropped to the ground and the shooter kind of raised his arms in triumph holding the rifle.""

Zobl said he then saw the shooter run up the street toward Parliament Hill.

Video captured inside Parliament showed officers filing down the empty corridor of the Hall of Honour as at least a dozen shots could be heard ringing out in the background. A security guard was reported to be injured in the shooting.

“This is a dynamic and unfolding situation,” RCMP Assistant Commissioner Gilles Michaud told a news conference Wednesday afternoon.

He said the attack caught the RCMP by surprise, but would not elaborate.

“If we had known that this was coming, we would have been able to disrupt it,” he said.

The RCMP also said it’s too early to say if the gunman was among the 90 or so suspected extremists being tracked by the Canadian government.

Reports of a third shooting inside the Rideau Centre, a shopping mall near Parliament Hill, turned out to be false, Bordeleau said.

“Today is a sad and tragic day for our city and our country,” Ottawa Mayor Jim Watson said, adding that everyone is “looking for answers.”

The shooting comes two days after a man attacked two Canadian soldiers in St-Jean-sur-Richelieu, Que. One of those soldiers, Warrant Officer Patrice Vincent, died from his injuries. The suspect, Martin Couture-Rouleau, was shot and killed by police.

On Tuesday, Canada raised the domestic terror threat level from low to medium.

Security beefed up

The attack on Parliament Hill immediately prompted officials across the country to heighten security at government buildings, provincial legislatures and military bases.

Soldiers are also being cautioned about wearing their uniforms in public when they’re not on active duty.

U.S. President Barack Obama spoke with Harper Wednesday and offered “any assistance” needed in the response to the attack, according to a tweet from the U.S. National Security Council.

Obama also expressed “the American people’s solidarity with Canada,” according to the NSC.

The president later publicly condemned the Ottawa shootings, calling them “outrageous.”

“We’re all shaken by it,” he said, adding that the U.S. is closely watching the unfolding events.

A statement from NATO’s secretary general also said that “NATO stands in solidarity with our ally Canada at this difficult time.”

An earlier version of this story Wednesday incorrectly reported that Zehaf-Bibeau was on a list of “high-risk travellers” being tracked by Canadian authorities and had his passport seized.

Tributes have poured in for a Canadian soldier who paid the ""ultimate sacrifice"" when he was shot dead as he guarded the National War Memorial in Ottawa.

Ottawa police said the member of the Canadian Forces ""succumbed to injuries"" following a series of shooting incidents in the city this morning.

The soldier was named locally as Corporal Nathan Cirillo, with his name trending on Twitter tonight and thousands praising him on other social media.

Canadian officials tonight identified the gunman who killed him as Michael Zehaf-Bibeau. He was also shot dead, reportedly by parliament sergeant-at-arms Kevin Vickers.

MP Craig Scott wrote on Twitter: ""MPs and Hill staff owe their safety, even lives, to sergeant-at-arms Kevin Vickers who shot attacker just outside the MPs' caucus rooms.""

It was unclear whether other gunmen remained at large, with police describing the incident as an ""ongoing"" operation with no-one currently in custody.

Police received a number of calls at 9.52am after the soldier was shot, with further gunfire then taking place inside Parliament Hill.

""This is an ongoing operation and we are asking members of the public to stay away from the downtown core,"" Ottawa police chief Charles Bordeleau told a press conference.

He added that members of the public should remain ""vigilant"" as p olice warned people in the area to stay away from windows and rooftops and asked for them to not post videos or photos of the ""ongoing incident"" to ensure the safety of emergency services and the public.

Officers said that, contrary to reports, no third incident occurred at the Rideau Centre shopping mall.

The force said in a statement: ""The Ottawa Police Service and Royal Canadian Mounted Police (RCMP) responded to reports of shooting incidents this morning in the downtown area.

""Police can now confirm that incidents occurred at the National War Memorial and on Parliament Hill.

""One shooting victim succumbed to injuries. He was a member of the Canadian Forces. Our thoughts and prayers are with him and his loved ones.""

A Facebook page was set up named Rest In Peace Cpl Nathan Cirillo, which has already been looked at by thousands.

One message, from Bob Rodkin, read: ""RIP Nathan. Thank you for your service and the ultimate sacrifice. So tragic, so unnecessary. My prayers go out for you and to your family, friends and colleagues.""

Another message, from Olivia Marie, said: ""RIP Nathan! Thank you for defending our country, your son is so proud of you. I miss you.""

Cabinet minister Tony Clement tweeted that at least 30 shots were fired while a meeting was taking place between prime minister Stephen Harper and other MPs.

""I feared this day would come, and my prayers are with the fallen soldier,"" he added.

A spokesman for Mr Harper later confirmed he was safe and had left the area.

Video filmed from inside the parliament building shows officers rushing down a large marble hallway with weapons drawn in front of them, before the sound of gunfire and shouting rings out.

The footage becomes shaky as the cameraman, believed to be a local reporter, rushes for cover behind a pillar.

People inside the parliament building scrambled down scaffolding to escape, witnesses said.

A photograph of chairs piled up against a door as a barricade was being heavily circulated on Twitter, apparently taken inside the meeting room in the parliament building where MPs earlier held their talks.

Ottawa mayor Jim Watson said he was ""shocked and saddened"" by today's events.

""Ottawa police services are engaged with other law enforcement agencies at this time in pursuit of the criminal or criminals who have carried out this vicious and unwarranted attack,"" he said in a statement.

Alain Merizier, a waiter in the parliament dining room, said he was on his way to work when he saw a gunman run from a car towards the parliament.

""I saw a car suddenly stop,"" he told the BBC. ""There was only one man in the car. He went out of the left side.

""He had a long gun and he ran away to the front and went inside the parliament. I heard one shot. I saw an officer running after him.""

Mr Merizier said the man had long dark hair and a small beard.

Vancouver South MP Wai Young said it had been ""a difficult day"".

She said: ""I am absolutely stunned because here in Canada we pride ourselves on being open, democratic and welcoming. To have this type of random terrorist attack happen in one of the safest places in Canada is quite shocking.""

The shootings come two days after a recent convert to Islam killed one Canadian soldier and injured another in a hit-and-run incident before being gunned down by police.

David Cameron responded to the events on Twitter.

""I'm appalled by today's attack in Ottawa. I offer my full support to @pmharper and the Canadian people as they deal with this incident,"" he wrote."

Born in Quebec as Michael Joseph Hall and raised in Laval, just north of Montreal, the young man lived a quiet childhood of private schools and suburban homes, with a mother who was a high ranking federal employee.

Then, after years of run-ins with the law, he converted to Islam.

Gunman: Michael Zehaf-Bibeau (allegedly pictured above) has been named as the Muslim convert who shot dead Corporal Nathan Cirillo and opened fire on the Canadian Parliament injuring at least one officer

Final moments: Corporal Cirillo (left) is pictured guarding the National War Memorial on Wednesday morning - just minutes before he was shot and killed by the gunman

Attacks: There were shootings at the War Memorial and at the Canadian Parliament. Police also initially thought there was a shooting at the Rideau Centre Mall, but have since said this was not the case

Race: An Ottawa police officer runs with his weapon drawn outside Parliament Hill on Wednesday after Zehaf-Bibeau attacked Parliament and National War Memorial, injuring people and killing one

A criminal court database shows 13 identified Quebec court records dating back to June 2001 in Montreal involving Zehaf-Bibeau.

According to documents his full name is Michael, Joseph, Paul, Abdallah Bulgasem Zehaf Bibeau.

He was charged in February 2004 for possession of marijuana and possession of PCP. He pleaded guilty to both charges in December 2004, serving one day in prison for marijuana possession and 60 days for PCP possession.

He also spent a day in jail in March 2004 for a parole violation and was again convicted of marijuana possession in 2009.

In another case, he received a six-month sentence in 2003 and three years’ probation on a weapons charge, according to the Herald News.

There was also a prior conviction for assault causing bodily harm in 2001 for which he received a suspended sentence and a fine.

Gunned down: Cirillo is raced to an ambulance after he was fatally shot in the abdomen by a gunman as he stood guard at the National War Memorial outside the Canadian Parliament Wednesday morning

Armed: The man is seen holding what appears to be a gun as he gets in and drives away

His longest sentence was for robbery, possession of break-in tools, theft and conspiracy with a co-accused in 2003, for which he was sentenced to two years in jail and three years probation.

It is uncertain how much of that sentence he ultimately ended up serving.

In 2011, he was again charged with robbery, this time in Vancouver, but served only one day in prison after he pleaded guilty to the lesser offense of uttering threats, and was credited with 66 days in pre-trial custody.

Close friend: David Bathurst (above), a fellow Muslim convert, befriended Zehaf-Bibeau at their mosque and even got him a job, but says he soon seemed as if he might be 'mentally ill'

Records show that in the 2011 case, he underwent a psychiatric assessment prior to his conviction and was found fit to stand trial.

One of his friends, David Bathurst, a fellow convert, said he met him at at the Masjid al-Salaam mosque in Burnaby, British Columbia about three years ago.

Bathurst even got Zehaf-Bibeau a job at his family's business, Bathurst Irrigation.

He said the young man lived in a small and unfurnished apartment, and that while he did not 'at first appear to have extremist views or inclinations toward violence' he 'at times exhibited a disturbing side.'

'We were having a conversation in a kitchen, and I don’t know how he worded it: He said the devil is after him,' Bathurst said.

'I think he must have been mentally ill.'

He cited one time Bibeau called police to the mosque to confess to a crime he had committed years before.

Bathurst said Bibeau wanted to travel to the Middle East, and he urged him to make sure it was just studying on his mind.

He says Zehaf-Bibeau told him he was 'only going abroad with the intent of learning about Islam and to study Arabic.'

He was never able to go though, and sources told The Globe and Mail 'he had not been able to secure a valid travel document from federal officials, who have been taking measures to prevent Canadians from joining extremists overseas.'

Place of worship: The Masjid al-Salaam mosque where Bathurst and Zehaf-Bibeau met, and where Zehaf-Bibeau was asked to leave after clashing with elders

Questionable company: Bathurst says Zehaf-Bibeau knew Hasibullah Yusufzai (above), who was charged under an anti-terrorism law for allegedly leaving Canada to join Islamist fighters in Syria

Humble home: A look at The Beacon (above), a Salvation Army rooming house in Vancouver that was listed as one of Zehaf-Bibeau's last residences

It's understood that he traveled to the U.S on four occasions - most recently in 2013. Officials there are trying to trace who he met while in the country. It's not known at this time if he made contact with any extremists, according to CNN.

Bathurst says that after friction with the elders at the house of worship, Zehaf-Bibeau was eventually asked to stop attending prayers at the mosque.

Mother: CTV News reports that Zehaf-Bibeau's mother is Susan Bibeau, who works for the Immigration and Refuge Board of Canada

Bathurst also brought up that Zehaf-Bibeau knew Hasibullah Yusufzai, a British Columbia man, charged under an anti-terrorism law for allegedly leaving Canada to join Islamist fighters in Syria.

He remains at large.

Zehaf-Bibeau's mother, Susan Bibeau, still lives in Montreal and works as a a federal public servant for the Immigrant & Refugee board.

She is listed as Deputy Chairperson, Immigration Division.

According to the site, she joined IRB in 1990 as a refugee protection officer, working her way up over her 24-year career.

She holds a Bachelor of Law degree from the Université de Montréal, a Master of Business Administration from Concordia University, and a graduate certificate in business administration from the Public Administration University.

Zehaf- Bibeau's father is a Libyan businessman named Bulgasem Zehaf who once owned a local restaurant, Cafe Tripoli.

He divorced Susan Bibeau in 1999, and there are reports that he fought in Libya in 2011.

The Washington Times quoted a fighter named Belgasem Zahef in a dispatch from anti-Gaddafi rebels in 2011.

Describing himself as from Montreal but a Zawiyah native he said he witnessed torture when held in a regime prison.

In a statement on Thursday Ms Bibeau revealed she was reunited with her terrorist son last week when they met for lunch. She said they had been estranged for five years prior to that meeting.

Releasing the statement on behalf of herself and her ex-husband, she said the couple were 'mad at their son' and were crying for the victims.

I am mad at our son, I don’t understand and part of me wants to hate him at this time. Michael Zehaf-Bibeau's mother Susan Bibeau

'No words can express the sadness we are feeling at this time. We are so sad that a man lost his life. He has lost everything and he leaves behind a family that must feel nothing but pain and sorrow. We send our deepest condolences to them although words seem pretty useless.

'We are both crying for them. We also wish to apologize for all the pain, fright and chaos he created. We have no explanation to offer. I am mad at our son, I don’t understand and part of me wants to hate him at this time.

'You write that our son was vulnerable, we don’t know, we (he) was lost and did not fit in. I his mother spoke with him last week over lunch, I had not seen him for over five years before that. So I have very little insight to offer. Once again we are so sorry.'

Canadian Prime Minister Stephen Harper's Address To The Nation Canada is not immune to the types of terrorist attacks we have seen elsewhere around the world. But let there be no misunderstanding, we will not be intimidated. Canada will never be intimidated. In fact, this will lead us to strengthen our resolve and redouble our efforts and those of our national security agencies to take all necessary steps to identify and counter threats and keep Canada safe here at home, just as it will lead us to strengthen our resolve and redouble our efforts to work with our allies around the world and fight against the terrorist organizations who brutalize those in other countries with the hope of bringing their savagery to our shores. They will have no safe haven.

Sources describe Zehaf-Bibeau as 'a man who had had a religious awakening and seemed to have become mentally unstable.'

That was not always the case though it seems.

Janice Parnell, a former neighbor of the family, said Zehaf-Bibeau was a typical teen, though one who led a very privileged life.

She said he went to a 'private school' and lived in a 'nice home in a nice neighborhood,' and that the only problem she ever had with Bibeau was that he 'played loud music.'

She also said he seemed to be an only child.

That is a far cry from the Bibeau's last known address in Vancouver, which, according to the Ottawa Citizen, was The Beacon, a Salvation Army rooming house.

Canadian Prime Minister Stephen Harper addressed his nation on Wednesday evening from an undisclosed location, condemning this horrific act which he labeled a terrorist attack.

He also told his people that 'Canada will never be intimidated.'

On Thursday morning, he joined his wife Laureen in laying flowers at the scene of the fatal shooting.

Queen Elizabeth also paid her respects to the Canadian people and expressed her sadness.

'Prince Philip and I were shocked and saddened by the events in Ottawa. Our thoughts and prayers are with all those affected,' she said.

President Obama also spoke about what he called the 'tragic' situation in Canada, saying 'we have to remain vigilant when it comes to dealing with these kinds of acts of senseless violence or terrorism.'

He then added, 'I pledged, as always, to make sure that our national security teams are coordinating very closely, given not only is Canada one of our closest allies in the world but they’re our neighbors and our friends, and obviously there’s a lot of interaction between Canadians and the United States, where we have such a long border.'

President Obama faced a national incident himself hours later on Wednesday night when an intruder once again hopped the fence at the White House and made their way towards the residence

The shooting spree began at 9.52am when witnesses reported seeing a gunman climb out of a car, grab a rifle, shoot the soldier in the abdomen and then turn towards Parliament.

Corporal Cirillo was rushed to hospital but later succumbed to his injuries.

Cirillo, a fitness fanatic and animal lover with a six-year-old son, was a reservist serving with the Argyll and Sutherland Highlanders in Hamilton.

Horror: Footage shows the moment multiple gunshots ran out around the marble halls - too many to count - and the police were seen to advance on the shooter's apparent position

Defense: People inside the Conservative Party caucus room blocked the door with a stack of chairs

'Nathan was a good man,' friend Marie Michele told CBC News. 'He would give anything to anyone.'

Eye-witness Tony Zobl, 35, told The Canadian Press: 'I looked out the window and saw a shooter - a man dressed all in black with a kerchief over his nose and mouth and something over his head as well - holding a rifle and shooting an honour guard in front of the Cenotaph, point blank, twice.

'It looked like the honour guard was trying to reach for the barrel of the gun. The honour guard dropped to the ground and the shooter kind of raised his arms in triumph holding the rifle.'

An eye-witness told The Ottawa Citizen that he'd seen a man armed with a double-barreled shotgun wearing a scarf 'hijack a car'.

He added: 'It was pretty intense.'

Ottawa police received a call at 9.54am that shots had been heard inside the Parliament, while journalists cowering inside said they heard dozens of rounds and could smell gunpowder in the halls.

At least one staff member, Constable Samerarn Son was shot in the leg. He is expected to recover fully from his injuries.

A shootout unfolded and Zehaf-Bibeau was killed by Sergeant-At-Arms Kevin Vickers, who worked for the RCMP for 29 years before joining the Parliament in 2006. (He is pictured by the Hill Times.)

'I am safe & profoundly grateful to Sgt at Arms Kevin Vickers & our security forces for selfless act of keeping us safe,' said Julian Fantino, Canada's Minister of Veterans Affairs, on Twitter.

HERO IN ROBES WHO BRAVELY FELLED ARMED ATTACKER SERGEANT-AT-ARMS Kevin Vickers is being hailed a hero for shooting dead the gunman inside Canada’s parliament. Mr Vickers, 58, was praised by politicians for ‘selflessly keeping them safe’ after grabbing a gun he keeps in his office amid the rampage. A hero's welcome: Mr Vickers was greeted by a moving standing ovation just hours after he stopped terrorist Michael Zehaf-Bibeau It was the first time he fired his gun in a career spanning nearly thirty years The sergeant-at-arms is the person responsible for safety and security of parliament and has the ceremonial role of carrying a gold mace into the House of Commons. Ex-policeman Mr Vickers has held the position for eight years. MP Craig Scott wrote on Twitter: ‘MPs … owe their safety, even lives, to sergeant-at-arms Kevin Vickers who shot attacker just outside the MPs’ caucus rooms.’ Minister Julian Fantino added that he was ‘profoundly grateful’ for Mr Vickers’ ‘selfless act.' In Parliament on Thursday the public servant was greeted with a moving standing ovation An emotional Mr Vickers gave a humble nod of his head at the ceremony as he bravely returned to work just a day after saving the lives of his co-workers His sister, Mary, told the Sun News: 'We're always very proud of Kevin, but at this moment we are concerned about him - he had to make a very serious decision today.' 'He's always a natural leader. He would not have taken this decision lightly, and I can't stress that enough - but he would always expect of himself to do what he would expect of the men and women under him.' Vickers released a statement Thursday afternoon. 'I am very touched by the attention directed at me following yesterday’s events. However, I have the support of a remarkable security team that is committed to ensuring the safety of Members, employees and visitors to the Hill,' he said. 'On behalf of all members of the House of Commons Security Services team, I would like to extend our deepest condolences to the family of Cpl. Nathan Cirillo. Our prayers are with you. Our thoughts are also with Constable Samearn Son, who has been with the House of Commons Security Services for 10 years. Constable Son suffered a gun shot wound to the leg. He is in stable condition and expected to make a full recovery.'

The Sergeant-at-Arms is responsible for safeguarding the authority of the House of Commons and providing safety and security of the Parliament buildings and the people inside.

As gunfire erupted in the hallways, journalists and politicians scrambled for safety, while members in the Conservative Party caucus room blocked the door with a stack of chairs.

Prime Minister Stephen Harper was immediately evacuated from Parliament and taken to an undisclosed location.

He had been scheduled to give Pakistani activist Malala Yousafzai, co-winner of this year's Nobel Peace Prize, her Canadian citizenship in Toronto, but that trip was cancelled.

The teenage activist took to Twitter after the incident, writing, 'I extend my thoughts and prayers to the Canadian people during this difficult time.'

Scott Walsh, who was working on Parliament Hill, told CBC that he saw a man running with a shotgun, wearing a scarf and blue jeans.

He said that the man jumped over a fence around Parliament Hill and forced someone out of their car, then drove to the front doors of the Parliament building and fired at least twice.

Reporter Jordan Press added that the car - a Toyota Corolla - was parked in front of the building with its engine still running.

A video shot by a Globe and Mail reporter showed RCMP officers moving through Parliament's main hall toward the Parliamentary library, as the hallway echoed with gunfire.

Other reporters inside the building described the panic in the hallways.

'Dozens of shots in parliament,' Josh Wingrove, a reporter for the Globe and Mail, tweeted just before 10am. 'I see a body on the ground outside the library of parliament.

Speaking to CNN, Wingrove said it appeared Zehaf-Bibeau entered the front entrance that has 'many armed guards' but no metal detector'.

'If you flash your valid pass, they allow you to go in,' he said. 'This appears to be the entry point [of the gunman] based on witness accounts.'

Court documents obtained by CBC News show that Zehaf-Bibeau pleaded guilty to charges including drug possession and robbery.

Zehaf-Bibeau, a Canadian born in 1982, was charged with drug possession in 2004. He pleaded guilty and was sentenced to 60 days in jail.

Quebec court show Zehaf-Bibeau lived in Montreal at the time in the north-end neighbourhood of Villeray. CBC News in Montreal went to the address listed on the court documents. Neighbours said Zehaf-Bibeau had not lived there for years.

Attended Burnaby mosque

Zehaf-Bibeau was in trouble with the law again in 2011, this time in British Columbia.

Zehaf-Bibeau was charged with robbery and uttering threats in Vancouver. He pleaded guilty to the lesser charge of uttering threats and was sentenced to one day in jail, with credit for 66 days already served, according to court documents.

CBC News has also learned the 32-year-old may have had a connection to a mosque in Burnaby, B.C., and may have worked for a Burnaby irrigation company.

The owner of a Burnaby irrigation company said Zehaf-Bibeau may have worked for them for two days a couple of years ago,

The company owner also said his own son — who converted to Islam seven years ago and regularly attends the Masjid Al-Salaam Mosque in Burnaby — had some conversations with Zehaf-Bibeau,

The man's son was concerned about Zehaf-Bibeau's beliefs, and asked him what Allah would want him to do.

However, the son believed Zehaf-Bibeau was on a right path.

A chairperson at the mosque said he did not know Zehaf-Bibeau and that he was appalled by the day's events. He emphasized that they work very hard to ensure radicalization does not happen.

He said the measures included working with Canadian intelligence officers and even having Canadian military recruiters visit the mosque.

The chairperson said the mosque even forbids small group discussions about the Qur'an.

Zehaf-Bibeau was raised in Laval, just north of Montreal. Neighbours told CBC they remember Zehaf-Bibeau as a sweet boy, and are in shock at the news.

According to Radio-Canada, Zehaf-Bibeau's mother, Susan Bibeau, still lives in Montreal and works for the federal government. She and Zehaf-Bibeau's father, Bulgasem Zehaf, divorced in 1999."

A third witness reported seeing two suspects, one with black hair and a bandana and dressed in a long, brown coat, and a second who stayed in the car.

At 10:53 a.m., a reporter for the CBC was told that gunmen were on the roof of a building on Parliament Hill with ""brandished weapons."" That reporter also noted that there is a heavily wooded area near Parliament Hill, and at least one gunman appeared to be moving east away from the shooting location. At a police briefing Wednesday afternoon, the Ottawa Police Service did not confirm whether another suspect was still on the loose, noting only that because the investigation was ongoing they could not disclose details regarding the potential additional gunman. Officers urged citizens to call a hotline if they observed anything unusual over the coming days.

""We were standing nearby the monuments, we were waiting there for a city tour and I heard four [rapid] shots,"" a witness told the CBC. ""Suddenly I saw a small guy with long black hair, looked like a Native American to me, and he ran away after the shots toward Parliament Hill. Then I saw some military running to the monuments then to Parliament Hill chasing the man."" This witness confirmed that the shooter targeted a monument guard and that the gun was quite long.

Other reports indicated that there were as many as 30 to 40 shots; however, this could be due to an exchange of gunfire with police. In a video taken from inside the Parliament Hill building obtained by The Globe and Mail, roughly 24 shots are audible. ""The video has too many shots to determine the type of weapon. Not unlikely it is a rifle though,"" a member of the Canadian military told me on the condition of anonymity. ""You don't pre-plan an attack like this with only a pistol effective at a range of 50 meters.""

At the Wednesday afternoon briefing, police said that another shooting that had been reported just before noon across the river from Parliament Hill at the Rideau Centre Mall did not in fact take place. An employee at Kiehl's, a shop within the mall, who answered the phone said those at the store were calm and listening to the news.

At 2:15 p.m., the Ottawa police chief confirmed two shooting locations: the National War Memorial and Parliament Hill. The National War Memorial incident in which the soldier was shot occurred first, followed by the Parliament Hill incident. It was at Parliament Hill that the gunman was shot and killed by authorities. It has been reported that Sergeant-at-Arms Kevin Vickers shot the gunman; however, Vickers did not immediately confirm his involvement in taking down the suspect.

Members of Parliament were meeting in their party caucuses when the shooting broke out. Some staff and members of the media inside Parliament Hill were allowed to leave, ducking while running out of the building. Prime Minister Stephen Harper's safety was confirmed early on, and he was taken away from Parliament Hill to an undisclosed, safe location. Harper was set to meet with Nobel Peace Prize winner Malala Yousafzai in Toronto today, but all his public events were canceled."

Michael Zehaf-Bibeau ID’d as Canadian Shooting Suspect in Ottawa; Also Known as Michael Joseph Hall

Michael Zehaf-Bibeau has been identified as the suspect in the shooting at Parliament Hill in Ottawa, Canada on Wednesday.

Zehaf-Bibeau shot a soldier at the National War Memorial before entering the Centre Block and firing off more shots.

Epoch Times reporter Matthew Little says that the shooter got as far as the library before Sergeant-At-Arms Kevin Vickers shot him dead.

The soldier,later identified as Nathan Cirillo, was rushed to a hospital but later died. There are at least three other shooting victims who survived.

U.S. officials revealed Zehaf-Bibeau’s identity to CBS News. CBC said soon after that it had confirmed the identity.

The officials say Zehaf-Bibeau is a Canadian who was born in 1982.

Sources told the Globe and Mail that Zehaf-Bibeau was recently designated as a “high-risk traveler” and that the government seized his passport.

Reporter Domenic Fazioli said that during his time in Montreal, Zehaf-Bibeau was arrested five times–three times for drug possession and twice for parole violations.

The Vancouver Sun said Bibeau was charged in Vancouver for an unspecified crime in 2011.

While Bibeau was killed, there is reportedly at least one other suspect at large.

Ottawa police spokesman Chuck Benoit told CBS that two or three gunmen may have been involved.

No motive has been identified for the attacks, although some are linking them to an ISIS-related incident on Monday.

A picture allegedly showing Zehaf-Bibeau emerged on Twitter soon after the identification, but hasn’t been confirmed.

A witness told Reuters that the gunman was dressed in all black with a scarf over his face.

A Canadian parliament official described the gunman to BBC as looking “Arabian” with “long hair and a small beard.”

Tony Zobl, 35, told the Canadian Press news agency that he witnessed the soldier being gunned down from his fourth-floor window directly above the National War Memorial, a tall granite cenotaph, or empty tomb, with bronze sculptures dedicated to those who died in World War I.

“I looked out the window and saw a shooter, a man dressed all in black with a kerchief over his nose and mouth and something over his head as well, holding a rifle and shooting an honor guard in front of the cenotaph point-blank, twice,” Zobl said.

“The honor guard dropped to the ground, and the shooter kind of raised his arms in triumph holding the rifle.”

Several sources, who have requested anonymity, have confirmed that Michael Zehaf-Bibeau was fatally wounded by Mr. Vickers near the door of the Parliamentary library.

Zehaf-Bibeau burst into the Parliament buildings after fleeing the National War Memorial, where he had shot Cpl. Nathan Cirillo and hijacked a ministerial car. He ran in to Parliament’s Centre Block through the main entrance with RCMP officers in hot pursuit.

A security service source says the gunman was intercepted by a House of Commons security guard who unsuccessfully tried to wrestle his gun away from him.

The guard yelled “Gun!” to warn his colleagues and tried to yank the barrel of the weapon down but Zehaf-Bibeau managed to fire, wounding the man.

The gunman then bolted several metres down the Hall of Honour with police and guards chasing him. More shots were fired.

Zehaf-Bibeau, his body riddled with bullets, huddled behind a column by the Parliamentary library. It was there that Mr. Vickers fired the fatal shots.

Mr. Vickers then walked to a nearby room where the Conservative caucus was meeting, and told MPs the shooter was dead. Prime Minister Stephen Harper was rushed to safety

Mr. Harper had been speaking to his caucus when the gunfight erupted.

“I had images of people hiding behind pillars and shooting,” said Manitoba Conservative MP Steven Fletcher. “There were so many shots.”

The police and military officers in the Conservative caucus sprang into action, including Manitoba cabinet minister Shelly Glover. They used chairs and tables to barricade doors that wouldn’t lock, while others began fashioning makeshift spears from flagpoles.

Ms. Glover said that for the former police officers in the room, training and experience kicked in. “Those boots I had on came off pretty quickly,” she said.

CBC News has learned the dramatic details of that face-to-face encounter, when the 58-year-old Vickers confronted Zehaf-Bibeau and killed him at point-blank range.

Zehaf-Bibeau had exchanged gunshots with parliamentary security at the entrance of Centre Block and ran down the long Hall of Honour towards the doors to the Parliamentary Library.

As he ran down the hall, pursued by RCMP officers, he passed the barricaded doors on his left, behind which the prime minister and the Conservative MPs were meeting. On his right, the doors to another caucus room where NDP MPs were diving for cover.

He shot at both doors, with one bullet penetrating the outer doors to the NDP caucus room.

Zehaf-Bibeau continued down the hall toward the wooden doors of the Library of Parliament, where he lodged himself behind a stone pillar beside an alcove to the right of the library's entrance.

Vickers' office is around the corner, a few metres away.

Hearing gunshots, Vickers grabbed his side arm, a semi-automatic pistol, and immediately ran out. His security team, who had been chasing Bibeau, yelled to Vickers that the suspect was hiding in the alcove.

Vickers immediately ran behind the other side of the pillar. That put him an arm's-length away from Bibeau.

According to guards, Vickers actually could see the barrel of Bibeau's gun pointing out, a foot away.

Vickers did not hesitate.

In one motion, sources told CBC News he dove to the floor around the pillar, at the feet of Bibeau, turning on his back as he landed and simultaneously firing his weapon upwards at Bibeau.

Bibeau was hit multiple times and fell to the ground. Vickers kept firing, emptying his entire magazine.

As soon as Bibeau dropped, the rest of the security team sprinted forward and opened fire.

Several bullet holes in the walls in the alcove give a sense of the numbers of rounds fired, and many more hit Bibeau.

One bullet passed right through the wooden library doors, hitting the librarians' desk deep inside.

But no one else was injured in that final exchange of gunfire.

According to sources, Vickers calmly got up after the firing was over and went back to his office to reload his gun in case a threat remained.

He then went to the Conservative caucus room where Prime Minister Stephen Harper and his MPs had barricaded the room's doors with chairs.

After identifying himself to gain entry to the room, Vickers strode to the microphone at the front of the room and explained what had happened:

""I engaged the suspect and the suspect is deceased,"" he said.

According to sources, the entire room erupted in cheers, as Vickers left to continue to secure the grounds.

The heroic sergeant-at-arms who shot dead a lone gunman in Canada's Parliament on Wednesday has been greeted back to work with a lengthy standing ovation.

Kevin Vickers, 58, struggled to contain his emotions as members of the House of Commons paid tribute to his bravery, which put an end to Michael Zehaf-Bibeau's shooting spree.

Rousing footage shows Vickers leading a ceremonial parade into the chamber on Thursday morning and being greeted by enthusiastic applause from the members of Parliament.

He managed to stay mostly expressionless throughout the standing ovation - simply nodding in thanks several times - but as the cheers continued, he appeared to tear up with emotion.

Overwhelmed: Kevin Vickers, the sergeant-at-arms for Canada's House of Commons, becomes emotional as members of Parliament applaud him on Thursday, a day after he shot dead a gunman inside the building

On their feet: Members of Parliament clap for Vickers after he led a ceremonial parade into the chamber

Stoic: He managed to keep a straight face as he completed the ceremonial parade on Thursday morning

The rousing standing ovation in the House of Commons continued as he walked through the chamber

Thankful: After he assumes his position at the end of the chamber, the minutes-long applause continues

After reaching his position at the end of the chambers, he was greeted by Prime Minister Stephen Harper, who shook his hand.

Following a minute of silence, Harper embraced Liberal leader Justin Trudeau and Opposition leader Thomas Mulcair and read a statement expressing thanks to the bravery of the security staff.

'We will not be intimidated,' he said, CTV News reported 'We will be vigilant, but we will not run scared. We will be prudent, but we will not panic.

'Here we are, in our seats, in our chamber in the very heart of Canadian democracy, and the work is going on.'

His speech also came just days after a previous terror attack, in which a man with jihadist sympathies ran over two Canadian soldiers in Quebec, killing one.

Following the show of support, Vickers released a statement expressing his gratitude.

Appreciation: Vickers nodded in thanks several times as the applause continued for his heroic feat

Service: Prime Minister Stephen Harper shakes hands with the sergeant-at-arms during the meeting

Thankful: He thanked Vickers for shooting the suspect during Wednesday's incident and ending the terror

Humbled: He took over the role of sergeant-at-arms 8 years ago after working with the RCMP for 29 years

'I am very touched by the attention directed at me following yesterday’s events,' he said. 'However, I have the support of a remarkable security team that is committed to ensuring the safety of Members, employees and visitors to the Hill.'

He went on: 'On behalf of all members of the House of Commons Security Services team, I would like to extend our deepest condolences to the family of Cpl. Nathan Cirillo. Our prayers are with you.

'Our thoughts are also with Constable Samearn Son, who has been with the House of Commons Security Services for 10 years. Constable Son suffered a gun shot wound to the leg. He is in stable condition and expected to make a full recovery.'

Vickers served with the RCMP for 29 years before assuming the role at Parliament eight years ago. The sergeant-at-arms is in charge of security at the House of Commons.

Despite his lengthy service, family members have revealed that Wednesday's attack was the first time Vickers had ever shot anyone.

'For it now to happen at Parliament ... is unbelievable,' his brother John Vickers told CNN. 'We're just relieved he's OK.'

His sister, Mary, added to the Sun News: 'We're always very proud of Kevin, but at this moment we are concerned about him - he had to make a very serious decision today.'

'He's always a natural leader. He would not have taken this decision lightly, and I can't stress that enough - but he would always expect of himself to do what he would expect of the men and women under him.'

Heroic: He took down Michael Zehaf-Bibeau, pictured - his first ever exchange of gunfire in his career

Hailed a hero: MPs line up to shake hands with the sergeant-at-arms on Thursday morning

Determined: Prime Minister Stephen Harper tells the House of Commons that they will not be initimated

Vickers' family gathered at homes in their hometown of Miramichi, New Brunswick to talk about previous shows of leadership.

The National Post explained how Vickers had been dispatched to the Burnt Church wharf 14 years ago when native and non-native fisherman were scrapping. He often visited when he was off-duty ready to listen to the fishermen and helping to resolve their arguments.

'The inspector was a real community man,' Bobby Sylliboy, a longtime band constable with the Burnt Church First Nation, said. 'He was a professional. And for him to use force, it would have had to have been life or death.'

Relatives added that Vickers' constable son, Andrew, is also a selfless leader after he saved a drowning woman three years ago.

After Wednesday's fraught events, MPs hailed Kevin Vickers a hero.

'I AM MAD AT OUR SON': SHOOTER'S MOTHER SPEAKS OUT 'I am writing this note on behalf of my husband and myself. No words can express the sadness we are feeling at this time. 'We are so sad that a man lost his life. He has lost everything and he leaves behind a family that must feel nothing but pain and sorrow. We send our deepest condolences to them although words seem pretty useless. We are both crying for them. We also wish to apologize for all the pain, fright and chaos he created. 'We have no explanation to offer. I am mad at our son, I don't understand and part of me wants to hate him at this time. You write that our son was vulnerable, we don't know, we (he) was lost and did not fit in. I his mother spoke with him last week over lunch, I had not seen him for over five years before that. So I have very little insight to offer. We don't wish to be part of any media circus, we don't think it will add anything to the conversation. Please respect our privacy although many may not feel we deserve any ... Once again we are so sorry.'

'MPs and Hill staff owe their safety, even lives, to Sergeant at Arms Kevin Vickers who shot attacker just outside the MPs' caucus rooms,' tweeted New Democrat MP Craig Scott on Wednesday.

Matt Miller, the Vancouver Observer's parliamentary bureau chief, concurred.

'Kevin is definitely a hero,' Miller told CNN.

Vickers serves a largely ceremonial role at the House of Commons, carrying a scepter and wearing rich green robes, white gloves and a tall imperial tricorne hat.

A fit, tall 6-foot-4, Vickers spends many of his lunch breaks running in order to stay fit. He also carries a 9mm pistol while at work.

Both things appeared to come in extremely handy while Vickers took down the parliament terrorist Wednesday.

'It's Kevin being Kevin,' his cousin Keith told CBC. 'He's a very intelligent and responsible person. He's a people person-type fellow, too, but you don't want to mess with him.'

He was called into action after Michael Zehaf-Bibeau ran towards the National War Memorial just before 10am on Wednesday and shot Corporal Nathan Cirillo, a single dad, in the abdomen.

He then ran towards the Parliament and opened fire, shooting dozens of shots as politicians and journalists barricaded doors inside.

Video taken inside Ottawa's House of Commons shows a rush of armed police running toward an unseen suspect.

Victim: Nathan Cirillo, 24, was standing guard at the memorial when he was fatally shot in the abdomen

Remembered: A Canadian flag flies at half staff on top of the Peace Tower at the Parliament on Thursday

Patrol: Members of the Ottawa Police stand guard in front of the War Memorial one day after the attack

Vigilant: A police officer patrols the hallway near the entrance to the Parliamentary Library on Thursday

Chilling: Bullet holes are seen in a window of the rotunda of the House of Commons in Ottawa on Thursday

At the head of the pack is a man - Vickers - moving swiftly with his gun toward Zehaf-Bibeau. Vickers takes aim and fires off multiple shots, killing the gunman.

As shots echo throughout the hall, the video goes wobbly as the men behind their leader Vickers move for cover.

It has since emerged that the gunman - whose full name was Michael, Joseph, Paul, Abdallah Bulgasem Zehaf Bibeau - had recently converted to Islam and had a length history of petty crime.

He had also recently been designated a 'high-risk traveler' by the Canadian government and had his passport seized, according to reports.

On Thursday, his mother Susan Bibeau, who sits on the country's Immigration board, released a statement saying she had been shocked by the shooting spree and, because she had long been estranged from her son, she was unable to shed much light on why he carried out the crime.

Tribute: Prime Minister Stephen Harper visited the scene of the shooting on Thursday morning to lay flowers

All quiet: Evidence tags can be seen on the steps of the memorial as the Harpers walk away

Remembered: Flowers with a card for Corporal Cirillo can be seen at the foot of the War Memorial

She said she felt pain for the victims - not for the loss of her son.

'We are both crying for them,' she told the Associated Press. 'We also wish to apologize for all the pain, fright and chaos he created.

'We have no explanation to offer. I am mad at our son, I don't understand and part of me wants to hate him at this time. You write that our son was vulnerable, we don't know, he was lost.'

On Thursday, flags were flown at half-mast across Canada as a shocked and still fearful Ottawa awoke.

Harper and other MPs stopped to lay a wreath at the war memorial - but as the prime minister arrived, police wrestled a man to the ground for getting too close to the leader, CTV reported.

Security remains tight around the Parliament, as politicians and their staff returned to work on Thursday. The grounds, nearby streets and war memorial are still closed to visitors.

Arrest: An uniendtified man was arrested for disturbing the crime scene as Harper visited the area

Queen Elizabeth released a statement to the country saying she was saddened by the events.

'Prince Philip and I were shocked and saddened by the events in Ottawa. Our thoughts and prayers are with all those affected' she said.

Cirillo, from Hamilton, Ontario, has been remembered as a generous man and a fitness fanatic, who rescued dogs and was bringing up a kindergarten age son on his own.

'He was an amazing guy,' Michelle Howlett, who briefly dated Cirillo this summer, told the Washington Post. 'He was a real sweetheart. He had a son and was a real great father. He was an exceptional person.'

Just moments after he gunned down Canadian Parliament shooter Michael Zehaf-Bibeau, heroic sergeant-at-arms Kevin Vickers was seen calmly walking through the halls, gun in hand.

The 58-year-old RCMP veteran has been hailed a hero after putting a swift stop to the attacker's hail of gunfire after he shot dead a soldier and then stormed the building on Wednesday morning.

A CBC News still shows Vickers holding the gun and walking through the House of Commons' moments after taking down the assailant.

Vickers has been the House of Commons' head of security since 2005 and will now go down in history as one of its most memorable after he bravely pursued and took down Zehaf-Bibeau.

Job done: Kevin Vickers, Canada's House of Commons' sergeant-at-arms, looks around the hallways with a gun in his hand after shooting dead an attacker, Michael Zehaf-Bibeau, on Wednesday morning

In control: Vickers, who worked for the RCMP for 29 years before taking on the role, is being hailed a hero

Despite working for the RCMP for three decades, relatives said the incident was the first time in his career that Vickers had ever shot anyone.

Riveting video taken inside Ottawa's House of Commons on Wednesday makes startlingly real just how heart-thumpingly dangerous the situation was that Vickers heroically diffused.

A rush of armed police can be seen running toward an unseen suspect as the video from Globe and Mail opens.

At the head of the pack is a man moving swiftly with his gun in hand toward Zehaf-Bibeau, who had moments before murdered a reservist who stood guard at Canada's Tomb of the Unknown soldier.

The death of that man, a 24-year-old father of a young son, Nathan Cirillo, would soon be avenged as Vickers takes aim inside the cavernous parliamentary building and fires off multiple shots.

Inches from disaster: The terrifying morning attack happened just outside the MPs' caucus rooms

And like that, it was over. Vickers had brought to a close the terrifying scene of senseless violence in mere moments of professional poise.

'MPs and Hill staff owe their safety, even lives, to Sergeant at Arms Kevin Vickers who shot attacker just outside the MPs' caucus rooms,' tweeted New Democrat MP Craig Scott.

He's a very intelligent and responsible person... but you don't want to mess with him Kevin Vickers' cousin

Matt Miller, the Vancouver Observer's parliamentary bureau chief, concurred.

'Kevin is definitely a hero,' Miller told CNN.

Vickers has honed his peacekeeping skills over a prestigious 28-year career as a member Royal Canadian Mounted Police.

And peacekeeping is the word. According to his brother, Wednesday's showdown was Vickers' first exchange of gunfire with a suspect in his nearly three-decade long career.

'For it now to happen at Parliament ... is unbelievable,' John Vickers told CNN. 'We're just relieved he's OK.'

His sister, Mary, added to the Sun News: 'We're always very proud of Kevin, but at this moment we are concerned about him - he had to make a very serious decision today.'

'He's always a natural leader. He would not have taken this decision lightly, and I can't stress that enough - but he would always expect of himself to do what he would expect of the men and women under him.'

Vickers serves a largely ceremonial role at the House of Commons, carrying a scepter and wearing rich green robes, white gloves and a tall imperial tricorne hat.

A fit, tall 6-foot-4, Vickers spends many of his lunch breaks running in order to stay fit. He also carries a 9mm pistol while at work.

Both things appeared to come in extremely handy while Vickers took down the parliament terrorist Wednesday.

'It's Kevin being Kevin,' his cousin Keith told CBC. 'He's a very intelligent and responsible person. He's a people person-type fellow, too, but you don't want to mess with him.'

On Thursday, flags were flown at half-mast across Canada as a shocked and still fearful Ottawa awoke.

Vickers - already back in work - was greeted by a standing ovation from parliament. Humbly nodding his head, the police veteran received handshakes from leading politicians.

Vickers remained mostly expressionless during the ovation before briefly appearing close to tears, and eventually acknowledging the applause with several nods of thanks

He released a statement paying tribute to Nathan Cirillo and revealed another police officer was shot in the leg.

'I am very touched by the attention directed at me following yesterday’s events. However, I have the support of a remarkable security team that is committed to ensuring the safety of Members, employees and visitors to the Hill,' he said.

'On behalf of all members of the House of Commons Security Services team, I would like to extend our deepest condolences to the family of Cpl. Nathan Cirillo. Our prayers are with you. Our thoughts are also with Constable Samearn Son, who has been with the House of Commons Security Services for 10 years. Constable Son suffered a gun shot wound to the leg. He is in stable condition and expected to make a full recovery.'

Earlier in the morning, a man was arrested for getting too close to Prime Minister Stephen Harper and his wife Laureen as they placed flowers at the scene of the shooting.

Armed officers ordered the unidentified man to the ground for 'disturbing the crime scene' after he was warned not to cross the crime tape but did.

On Wednesday evening Harper addressed his nation from an undisclosed location and condemned the horrific actions but vowed his country's foreign policy would not be thrown off course.

'Canada will never be intimidated,' he said.

Queen Elizabeth released a statement to the country saying she was saddened by the events.

'Prince Philip and I were shocked and saddened by the events in Ottawa. Our thoughts and prayers are with all those affected' she said.

'I AM MAD AT OUR SON': TERRORIST'S MOTHER SPEAKS OUT Immigration chief Susan Bibeau - mother of terrorist Michael Zehaf-Bibeau 'I am writing this note on behalf of my husband and myself. No words can express the sadness we are feeling at this time. 'We are so sad that a man lost his life. He has lost everything and he leaves behind a family that must feel nothing but pain and sorrow. We send our deepest condolences to them although words seem pretty useless. We are both crying for them. We also wish to apologize for all the pain, fright and chaos he created. 'We have no explanation to offer. I am mad at our son, I don’t understand and part of me wants to hate him at this time. You write that our son was vulnerable, we don’t know, we (he) was lost and did not fit in. I his mother spoke with him last week over lunch, I had not seen him for over five years before that. So I have very little insight to offer. We don’t wish to be part of any media circus, we don’t think it will add anything to the conversation. Please respect our privacy although many may not feel we deserve any ... Once again we are so sorry.'

One of them had an automatic rifle. A third man in green fatigues and a Kevlar vest was with them, with a police dog at his feet.

This, I thought with dismay, will now be a more common sight.

A few minutes closer to the Hill, on Wellington Street, across from the National War Memorial, I run into an ashen-faced John Ivison, of the National Post, who had arrived minutes earlier. He pointed to an older model Toyota Corolla car parked on the street and told me it was believed to be the shooter’s car.

A female police officer was walking down Wellington, putting up a line of police tape, shutting down the area.

Everyone was quiet, serious, tense.

I walked past Langevin building to the corner of Wellington and Metcalfe, across the street from the Hill. This was still minutes after the shooting, and nobody knew what was going on. Police were streaming to the Hill.

A few minutes earlier, a gunman had shot Cpl. Nathan Cirillo, 24, a member of the Argyll and Sutherland Highlanders, a reserve regiment based in Hamilton, Ont.

Bystanders gave him mouth to mouth in a vain attempt to save his life.

After that, witnesses say, the gunman got into the Corolla, drove a very short distance and parked the car on Wellington. He then appears to have somehow got into Centre Block, where he shot and injured two guards before he was shot to death by Kevin Vickers, the gentlemanly former RCMP officer in charge of security on the Hill.

For the next several hours, police streamed to the Hill, organized themselves and slowly set up an expanding security perimeter.

I watched it for hours, being politely and firmly told to move back by very professional Ottawa Police Service officers.

Their calmness and resolve was impressive, and it was impressive to listen to the calm talk of the commanders on their police radios, all of them focused on making Canadians safe.

On the street, as in the Hall of Honour, where security guards bravely rushed the shooter, the courage and resolve of our police is a source of comfort to us when we are scared.

And people were scared. Cell towers downtown were overwhelmed with people calling and texting their loved ones. There were false reports of a third shooting scene at the Rideau Centre, and a fourth, at the Chateau Laurier. Police were scanning the rooftops looking for a shooter at large. At one point, a police officer warned me to get out of the street and take cover behind a building, so that I wouldn’t be a target.

It is too early to say for sure, but it seems likely that this was the work of one disturbed individual, someone swayed by the dark propaganda of extremists on the other side of the world.

It appears to be the same thing with the death of Warrant Officer Patrice Vincent, 53, who was run down in St-Jean-sur-Richelieu, Que., on Monday.

This is a terrible business, and we must mourn the loss of Vincent and Cirillo.

But we had best guard against giving into our fears.

On Wednesday afternoon, the Canadian Forces sent out an email to some members warning them against wearing their uniforms off base, cautioning they shouldn’t be seen to be soldiers when they stop for gas, for instance.

I think we should think of our ancestors. The war memorial that Cpl. Cirillo gave his life protecting was erected in 1938 to commemorate our losses in the First World War.

We lost almost 60,000 people in that war and more than 40,000 in the Second World War. We lost 158 in Afghanistan, not to mention the thousands of Canadian Forces members and veterans who will never fully recover from their physical and psychological wounds they suffered over there.

Our ancestors would not have allowed themselves to be cowed by two or three or 10 incidents like this.

On Wednesday evening, DND told me they have decided to suspend the sentry program in front of the war memorial “until further notice.”

Over time, as our society has become safer, we have become increasingly risk-adverse and fearful.

The blood-soaked maniacs in Iraq who are inspiring these killings know that about us, and they want us to be afraid. They want us to pay attention to their demented rants, to worry about more attacks.

If we give in to our fears, we will be engaged in an impossible quest for perfect security, and our streets will be lined with police. We will spend half our lives going through metal detectors, give up our civil liberties, and we won’t be any safer.

Or we can meditate on the courage of our ancestors, mourn the loss of Warrant Officer Vincent and Cpl. Cirillo, get those sentries back in front of the memorial, and take every opportunity to thank Canadian Forces members for having the courage to wear their uniforms in the street.

Vickers said he is ""grateful and proud"" to be a part of the security team that took down suspected shooter Michael Zehaf-Bibeau on Wednesday. ""Yesterday, during extraordinary circumstances, security personnel demonstrated professionalism and courage,"" Vickers said in a statement released Thursday afternoon. He also thanked Speaker of the House Andrew Scheer ""for his leadership and calm demeanour throughout.""

Vickers is credited with shooting Zehaf-Bibeau during a gunfight inside Parliament Hill. Zehaf-Bibeau entered the Hall of Honour at around 10 a.m. Wednesday after soldier Nathan Frank Cirillo was fatally shot at the National War Memorial just off Parliament property.

CTV’s Craig Oliver reported Zehaf-Bibeau was carrying a firearm when he walked into the building.

“Kevin Vickers came out of his office carrying a pistol, and apparently saw that he had a better shot, because the gunman had come in his direction,” Oliver reported, relaying a first-hand account from the scene.

Oliver said Vickers unloaded “a lot of shots,” killing Zehaf-Bibeau.

Vickers' younger brother John Vickers said he is relieved his brother is okay and not surprised at his actions.

""Kevin was always about the country and the community in which he served…When the time called for it and when the nation called him for service yesterday he responded,"" John told CTV's Canada AM on Thursday. ""He knew what he had to do and I'm very proud of my big brother.""

John said he was watching events unfold on TV in Victoria Wednesday morning when he heard his brother's name mentioned over and over again.

""The first thing was concern for his wellbeing and it was certainly a relief to know as the day progressed that he was okay,"" he said.

John hasn't spoken directly with Vickers since the incident, but said the Sergeant-at-Arms texted their other brother and spoke to their mother.

John said he thinks most people believe the Sergeant-at-Arms role is a ceremonial one, but Vickers has a long career in public service and oversees thousands of workers as head of Parliament security.

Vickers was a 29-year RCMP veteran when he took the position of director of security operations at the House of Commons in 2005.

As the Sergeant-at-Arms, Vickers is responsible for “safeguarding the authority of the House of Commons” and for “the safety and security of the Parliament buildings and their occupants, ensuring and controlling access to the House of Commons,” according to the government release announcing his appointment in 2006.

The 58-year-old has previously worked as an Aide-de-Camp for the Lieutenant Governor of New Brunswick, and has provided personal security for high-profile visitors like Queen Elizabeth and Prince Andrew.

Vickers has received several commendations throughout his career, including being recognized by the United States Drug Enforcement Agency for ""outstanding contribution to drug enforcement.""

According to Oliver, the security staff at Parliament Hill had been extensively trained for the scenario that unfolded Wednesday.

“They even have rehearsed how to hide behind the marble pillars you see at the top of the stairs and return fire,” he said. “That may have saved a lot of lives today.”

Several Members of Parliament thanked Vickers for his actions, including Justice Minister Peter MacKay and Veterans Affairs Minister Julian Fantino.

“MPs and Hill staff owe their safety, even lives, to Sergeant at Arms Kevin Vickers who shot attacker just outside the MPs' caucus rooms,” MP Craig Scott tweeted Wednesday.

Vickers deflected the praise toward the House of Common Security Services in his statement on Thursday.

He also offered his condolences to the family of Cpl. Nathan Cirillo, who was shot and killed while serving as an honour guard at the National War Memorial in Ottawa.

""On behalf of all members of the House of Commons Security Services team, I would like to extend our deepest condolences to the family of Cpl. Nathan Cirillo,"" Vickers said in the statement. ""Our prayers are with you.""

Vickers said his thoughts are also with Const. Samearn Son, a 10-year veteran of the HoC security staff, who was shot in the leg during the gun battle. Vickers said Son is in hospital and expected to make a full recovery.

Vickers' full statement is included below.

Statement from Sergeant-at-Arms Kevin Vickers

I am very touched by the attention directed at me following yesterday’s events. However, I have the support of a remarkable security team that is committed to ensuring the safety of Members, employees and visitors to the Hill. Yesterday, during extraordinary circumstances, security personnel demonstrated professionalism and courage. I am grateful and proud to be part of this team.

House of Commons Security Services also maintains a close working relationship with its security partners, including Senate Security, the RCMP and the Ottawa Police. This close collaboration made it possible to pull together and quickly restore order in the Parliamentary Precinct and throughout the downtown core.

I would also like to take this opportunity to thank the Speaker, the Hon. Andrew Scheer, for his leadership and calm demeanour throughout.

On behalf of all members of the House of Commons Security Services team, I would like to extend our deepest condolences to the family of Cpl. Nathan Cirillo. Our prayers are with you. Our thoughts are also with Constable Samearn Son, who has been with the House of Commons Security Services for 10 years. Constable Son suffered a gun shot wound to the leg. He is in stable condition and expected to make a full recovery.

As this is an ongoing investigation, I unfortunately cannot comment any further at this time, nor can any member of my Security Services team.

“This the first time in his career that he’s shot anyone,” said Erin, Vickers’ niece.

A retired RCMP officer who once served in Calgary, 58-year-old Vickers is known to most Canadians as the symbol of order at the House of Commons: a grey-haired man in a black hat and robes, often carrying the ceremonial sceptre of Canada over his shoulder.

On Wednesday, Vickers reportedly showed just how serious his role really is, the head of security for Canada’s government killing a gunman who charged into the Centre Block on Parliament Hill.

“To all in Ottawa, stay safe & strong. Thank God for Sgt at Arms Kevin Vickers & our Cdn security forces. True heroes …” tweeted Minister Peter MacKay.

Julian Fantino, Canada’s Minister of Veterans Affairs, added his own tweet of gratitude.

“I am safe & profoundly grateful to Sgt at Arms Kevin Vickers & our security forces for selfless act of keeping us safe.”

After the shooting, Vickers immediately contacted his family in New Brunswick to tell them he is safe — “I’m doing okay,” he said — but that hasn’t stopped them worrying about the emotional trauma that will follow, having being forced to pull the trigger for the first time.

“We’re always very proud of Kevin, but at this moment we are concerned about him — he had to make a very serious decision today,” said Mary, Vicker’s older sister.

“He’s always a natural leader — he would not have taken this decision lightly, and I can’t stress that enough — but he would always expect of himself to do what he would expect of the men and women under him.”

Raw footage of the Centre Block attack show officers and guards moving cautiously down the hall, before gunfire suddenly erupts, with dozens of shots echoing in the distance.

Various witnesses have credited Vickers with leading the security response and killing the infiltrator, a man who may have been the same cold-blooded murderer who gunned down an unarmed solider outside the national cenotaph moments before.

Anyone who thought Canada’s Sergeant-At-Arms role was an archaic novelty now understands the man holding the sceptre has a deadly serious job.

“It’s not ceremonial at all, and he has tremendous responsibility — and he wears it well,” said Mary.

In an RCMP career spanning 29 years, Vickers rose up the ranks from a constable in the Northwest Territories to serving ten years in Alberta, and then to chief superintendent in Ottawa.

After retiring from the force, he took the Sergeant-At-Arms job on Parliament Hill, and was once famously photographed escorting a protestor masquerading as a page from the House of Commons.

His niece Erin says her uncle is a calm, gentle man — but someone who handles pressure with utmost calm.

“He’s a thoughtful and considerate person — he’s halfway to a saint in my opinion,” she said.

“He’s a very capable human being.”

A former Mountie is being hailed a hero for reportedly shooting a gunman who went on the rampage inside the Canadian Parliament today.

Sergeant-at-Arms Kevin Vickers is being praised by politicians for 'selflessly keeping them safe' following today's terrifying shooting spree, with unconfirmed reports he was the one who took the suspect down.

Veteran Mr Vickers undoubtedly saved lives by bravely taking down the alleged shooter, putting his own safety at risk in doing so.

Canadian media are reporting that he is a former Royal Canadian Mounted Police officer, better known as a Mountie, and that he has held his current position as Sergeant-at-Arms since 2006. Comments on Twitter have widely described him as being 'a Canadian hero'.

Earlier today a gunman shot a Canadian soldier at the National War Memorial in the city of Ottawa before entering the nearby Parliament Hill building where further shots were fired.

A third shooting took place at a shopping mall in the city as police warned people in the area to stay away from windows and rooftops.

Canada's Minister of Veterans Affairs Julian Fantino is one of the many thanking Mr Vickers's selfless efforts.

Writing on Twitter, he said: ""I am safe and profoundly grateful to Sergeant-at-Arms Kevin Vickers and our security forces for selfless act of keeping us safe.

""I want to commend the courage and bravery of the first responders on the ground in Ottawa right now.""

Canada's Minister of Justice Peter MacKay added his support for Mr Vickers and the others who came to their aid.

He wrote: ""To all in Ottawa, stay safe and strong. Thank god for Sergeant-at-Arms Kevin Vickers and our Canadian security forces. True heroes.""

The Sergeant-at-Arms is responsible for the safety and security of the Parliament buildings and everyone in them, though it also includes a ceremonial element of carrying the ceremonial gold mace into the House of Commons before every sitting.

Video filmed from inside the Parliament building shows officers rushing down a large marble hallway with handguns held in front of them, before the sound of gunfire and shouting rings out.

In footage from the Globe and Mail, armed police can be seen running down a corridor as they search for the suspect gunman before a volley of shots are heard.

The footage becomes shaky as the cameraman, believed to be a local reporter, rushes for cover behind a pillar.

A spokesman for Prime Minister Stephen Harper said he was safe and had left the area.

Cabinet minister Tony Clement tweeted that at least 30 shots were fired during a meeting with Mr Harper and other MPs.

""I feared this day would come, and my prayers are with the fallen soldier,"" he added.

Kevin Vickers, Sergeant-At-Arms, Shoots a Shooting Suspect in Ottawa; Called a ‘Hero’ (+Pictures)

A shooting at Canada’s Parliament Hill took place on Wednesday morning, with one suspect shot dead.

Two sources told the Canadian Press that Sergeant-At-Arms Kevin Vickers shot the first suspect.

“I am safe & profoundly grateful to Sgt at Arms Kevin Vickers & our security forces for selfless act of keeping us safe,” said Julian Fantino, Canada’s Minister of Veterans Affairs and a member of Parliament, via Twitter.

“To all in Ottawa, stay safe & strong. Thank God for Sgt at Arms Kevin Vickers & our Cdn security forces. True heroes…” added Minister Peter MacKay.

“Some people question why there is a sergeant at arms #cdnpoli #ableg #yql #Lethbridge …this is why!” added YQL on the Fringe Podcast, with a link to this story.

Vickers is being described by many as a hero.

“It’s not too early to say it, Sergeant-At-Arms Mr. Kevin Vickers is a Canadian hero,” said university student Dave Beninger.

Vickers was a 29-year veteran of the RCMP before joining the House of Commons as Director of Security Operations in June 2005. He assumed the position of Sergeant-at-Arms on Sept. 1, 2006.

The Sergeant-at-Arms is a position steeped in parliamentary tradition, noted Metro News.

The Sergeant-at-Arms, one of four positions reporting to the Clerk of the House of Commons, is responsible for safeguarding the authority of the House of Commons, the safety and security of the Parliament buildings and their occupants, ensuring and controlling access to the House of Commons, the preservation of order and the management of all Parliamentary buildings, assets and related services.

According to the Globe and Mail, Vickers, who grew up in Miramichi, N.B., is the tall man in black carrying mace into the House familiar to officials.

He sits quietly in his seat in the chamber when the Commons is in session, it said.

Michael Zehaf-Bibeau fatally shot Corporal Nathan Cirillo, a 24-year-old father, as he stood guard at the War Memorial on Wednesday morning.

Zehaf-Bibeau then ran inside the Parliament, where he opened fire before he was shot dead by the House of Commons Sergeant-at-Arms.

Zehaf-Bibeau, who had a criminal history for drug trafficking in Montreal and robbery in Vancouver, was born in Quebec as Michael Joseph Hall but recently converted to Islam, CBS reported.

Sources told the Globe and Mail that he had been designated 'high-risk traveler' and government had seized his passport

Killed: Corporal Nathan Cirillo, was shot dead by a gunman as he stood guard at the National War Memorial outside the Canadian Parliament in Ottawa on Wednesday morning. He leaves behind a young son

Left behind: Cirillo leaves behind one young son, pictured, according to his Instagram page

Gunned down: Cirillo is raced to an ambulance after he was fatally shot in the abdomen by a gunman as he stood guard at the National War Memorial outside the Canadian Parliament

His attack comes just two days after another Canadian soldier was killed in Quebec by a man with jihadist sympathies.

Authorities initially said they believed 'two or three' gunmen were responsible for the attack in Ottawa on Wednesday, but at an afternoon press conference, Chief of Police Charles Bordeleau would not confirm whether or not they are still searching for other shooters.

'We're still in the process of clearing Parliament Hill,' he said. 'It is a slow and methodical process.'

The shooting spree began at 9.52am when witnesses reported seeing a gunman climb out of a car, grab a rifle, shoot the soldier in the abdomen and then run towards Parliament.

Corporal Cirillo was rushed to hospital but later succumbed to his injuries.

Cirillo, a fitness fanatic and animal lover with a young son, was a reservist serving with the Argyll and Sutherland Highlanders in Hamilton.

'Nathan was a good man,' friend Marie Michele told CBC News. 'He would give anything to anyone.'

Ottawa police then received a call at 9.54am that shots had been heard inside the Parliament, while journalists cowering inside said they heard dozens of rounds and could smell gunpowder in the halls.

Attacks: Ottawa police said there were shootings at the War Memorial and at the Parliament. They initially thought there was a shooting at the Rideau Centre mall, but have since said this was not the case

Gunned down: He had been in Ottawa because members of the Argylls were standing guard this week

Loss: 24-year-old Carillo served with the Argyll and Sutherland Highlanders in Hamilton, Ontario

A shootout unfolded and Zehaf-Bibeau was killed by Sergeant-At-Arms Kevin Vickers, who worked for the RCMP for 29 years before joining the Parliament in 2006. (He is pictured by the Hill Times.)

'I am safe & profoundly grateful to Sgt at Arms Kevin Vickers & our security forces for selfless act of keeping us safe,' said Julian Fantino, Canada's Minister of Veterans Affairs, on Twitter.

The Sergeant-at-Arms is responsible for safeguarding the authority of the House of Commons and providing safety and security of the Parliament buildings and the people inside.

As gunfire erupted in the hallways, journalists and politicians scrambled for safety, while members in the Conservative Party caucus room blocked the door with a stack of chairs.

A parliamentary guard was shot in the leg during the gunfight but is recovering in hospital, according to Globe and Mail reporter Josh Wingrove, who is inside the building.

A spokesman for Prime Minister Stephen Harper said Harper was safe after being evacuated from Parliament Hill.

He had been scheduled to give Pakistani activist Malala Yousafzai, co-winner of this year's Nobel Peace Prize, her Canadian citizenship on Wednesday.

The government said there is not yet any evidence that Zehaf-Bibeau has any ties to violent Islamic extremism but noted that it is still early in the investigation.

An Ottawa Citizen reporter inside the Parliament building, Jordan Press, wrote on Twitter that a suspect was '5'9-5'10, overweight & wearing a dark jacket'.

Witnesses also told the Citizen that they saw a man wearing an 'Arabic scarf' and carrying a long rifle, while others said the suspect looked South American.

Scott Walsh, who was working on Parliament Hill, told CBC that he saw a man running with a shotgun, wearing a scarf and blue jeans.

He said that the man jumped over a fence around Parliament Hill and forced someone out of their car, then drove to the front doors of the Parliament building and fired at least twice.

Reporter Jordan Press added that the car - a Toyota Corolla - was parked in front of the building with its engine still running.

A video shot by a Globe and Mail reporter showed RCMP officers moving through Parliament's main hall toward the Parliamentary library, as the hallway echoed with gunfire.

Other reporters inside the building described the panic in the hallways.

'Dozens of shots in parliament,' Josh Wingrove, a reporter for the Globe and Mail, tweeted just before 10am. 'I see a body on the ground outside the library of parliament.

He went on: 'I was in the west wing of the building and shooter appears to have entered through main door on south side, heading north along hallway.

'I heard dozens of gunshots and the smell of gunpowder is heavy in the hallways right now.'

He added: 'One security guard said that it appears one officer may have been shot but we have no way to confirm that.'

Speaking to CNN, Wingrove said it appeared Zehaf-Bibeau entered the front entrance that has 'many armed guards' but no metal detector'.

'If you flash your valid pass, they allow you to go in,' he said. 'This appears to be the entry point [of the gunman] based on witness accounts.'

Terror struck at the heart of Canada earlier today when a gunman shot dead a 24-year-old reservist soldier at the national war memorial in Ottawa, before running to the nearby Parliament building where he was shot dead.

Mr Harper said the shootings today and earlier this week in Quebec showed that “Canada is not immune to terrorist attacks”.

While much of Ottawa was in lockdown yesterday amid reports of shots from the roof of Parliament and at a nearby mall, police concede now that there was only one gunman.

Ottawa police Constable Marc Soucy confirmed to AP that police are satisfied there was one attacker, while Ottawa police Chief Charles Bordeleau told the Canadian Broadcasting Corp. that “there is no longer a threat to public safety.”

‘I CRY FOR THE VICTIMS, NOT FOR MY SON’

‘I ASKED HANDSOME GUARD FOR A PHOTO’

The lone gunman — who has been named as Michael Zehaf-Bibeau — is said to have calmly walked up to Corporal Nathan Cirillo, pulled out a rifle and shot him in the stomach “multiple times” at point blank range.

He then reportedly raised his arms in triumph before fleeing the scene.

BREAKING | This is a photo of Michael Zehaf-Bibeau, gunman in this morning's shootings in Ottawa. #cbcOTT #OTTnews pic.twitter.com/OLSxlYPelj — CBC Ottawa (@CBCOttawa) October 22, 2014

Zehaf-Bibeau, a recent convert to Islam, reportedly was already on a Canadian terror-watch list as a “high risk” suspect and had his passport revoked in order to prevent him travelling to Syria to join the Islamic State.

After shooting dead Corporal Cirillo, the gunman then headed to the nearby Parliament buildings.

He burst into the vaulted entrance hall of Canada’s Parliament house and opened fire before he was shot dead by the Parliament’s Sergeant-at-Arms Kevin Vickers.

Vickers has a ceremonial role but is also a former policeman.

As Canada reeled from the attack, Mr Harper said he had every confidence that Canadians would band together.

He added: “In days to come, we will learn more about the terrorist and any accomplices. We will redouble our efforts to fight against terrorist organisations around the world. They will have no safe haven.

ABBOTT OFFERS CONDOLENCES

In a statement to Parliament this afternoon, Prime Minister Tony Abbott said Australia stood “shoulder to shoulder with our Canadian comrades”.

“We are both multicultural federations with British institutions. They speak our language and they share our heritage and our danger.

More than 100 Canadians are believed to be fighting with the Islamic State and other terrorist groups in the Middle East, he said.

“Today more than ever Australians and Canadians are family.

“We feel Canada’s shock, pain and anger.”

Mr Abbott said he had visited Canberra’s Parliament and war memorial.

“I regard Stephen Harper, their Prime Minister as a friend and almost a brother.

“So an attack on their Parliament is an affront to this Parliament too.”

Both Mr Abbott and Opposition Leader Bill Shorten recognised the country’s High Commissioner who was present in the Parliament.

HOW THE ATTACK UNFOLDED

The incident comes just one day after 25-year-old Martin Couture-Rouleau ran over a Canadian soldier, killing him before being shot dead by police as he emerged from his wrecked car wielding a knife.

The Parliament building in Ottawa today immediately went into lockdown and the city was on terror alert amid the confusion, with fears of as many as three gunmen being on the loose.

Terrified MPs used chairs to barricade themselves inside the office within the building amid the chaos.

Jan Luchtenburg, a tourist, told TV news station CBC he witnessed today’s shooting.

“We were waiting there for a city tour and suddenly I heard four shots.

“Suddenly I saw a small guy with long black hair... with a long rifle, and he ran away after the shots, across streets in the direction of Parliament Hill.”

Shooting suspect Zehaf-Bibeau had recently converted to Islam and his passport had been revoked, it was reported. He is also understood to have had a criminal record involving drugs and robbery.

Zehaf-Bibeau was raised in Laval, a town just north of Montreal. Neighbours told CBC they remember Zehaf-Bibeau as a sweet boy

Kevin Vickers, 58, the Sergeant-at-Arms in the House of Commons, fatally shot the gunman inside Canada’s Parliament house.

RAPID RESPONSE: Heroic Sergeant-at-Arms kills gunman

Vickers serves a largely ceremonial role at the House of Commons, carrying a sceptre and wearing rich green robes, white gloves and a tall imperial hat.

Canadian police initially said there were three shooting locations: The first at the National War Memorial, another over the road on Parliament Hill and another outside Rideau Centre mall.

They later retracted the Rideau Centre report.

Reports say Parliament's Sergeant-at-Arms Kevin Vickers was the person to shot the suspected Shooter! #hero #cdnpoli pic.twitter.com/M07ImmLllR — Brent Nichols (@BNinventa) October 22, 2014

People fled the parliament by scrambling down scaffolding erected for renovations, while others barricaded themselves inside as police with rifles and body armour took up positions outside and blocked the normally bustling streets.

Ottawa police spokesman Chuck Benoit initially reported there may have been one or two more gunmen involved.

But as the day wore on, the cordon around Parliament was eased, employees were allowed to go home, and it appeared increasingly likely that the attack was the work of one person.

Ottawa Hospital reported it had received three patients, two of which were listed as being in a stable condition. They have since been discharged.

Corporal Nathan Cirillo died while undergoing emergency surgery.

David Cirillo, who identified himself as the slain soldier’s cousin, expressed anger at the killing in a posting on Facebook.

CEREMONIAL DUTY: Dead guard was defending sacred memorial

“To the gunman that shot my cousin point blank in front of the Parliament Hill this morning for no reason, you will get what’s coming to you,” the posting read.

“You destroyed my whole family for life. If there’s a way I can find you I will kill you.”

The shooting happened before 10am (1am AEDT) with police saying the first they knew of the incident was when they got a call at 9.52am saying shots had been fired.

Gunfire echoed through the gothic halls of the Canadian parliament as police swarmed in to tackle the gunman.

Witnesses have told the Ottawa Citizen that they saw two men get out of a car immediately in front of the National War Memorial just before the attack. One was carrying a rifle, and opened fire towards the Ceremonial Guard in front of the Monument of the Unknown Soldier.

Passers-by told reporters that a bearded man had gunned down the soldier and hijacked a passing vehicle to take him the short distance to Parliament Hill, on a bluff over the Ottawa River.

Tony Zobl, 35, said he witnessed the soldier being gunned down from his fourth-floor window directly above the War Memorial, a 21-metre, arched granite cenotaph, or tomb, with bronze sculptures commemorating World War I.

“I looked out the window and saw a shooter, a man dressed all in black with a kerchief over his nose and mouth and something over his head as well, holding a rifle and shooting an honour guard in front of the cenotaph point-blank, twice,” Mr Zobl told the Canadian Press news agency.

“The honour guard dropped to the ground, and the shooter kind of raised his arms in triumph holding the rifle.”

Witnesses said the gunman then entered Parliament, a few hundred yards away, where dozens of shots soon rang out.

One witness, parliamentary aide Marc-Andre Viau, said he saw a man run into a caucus meeting at the Parliament, chased by police armed with rifles who yelled “take cover.” That was followed by “10, 15, maybe 20 shots,” possibly from an automatic weapon, he said.

“I’m shaken,” said Mr Viau.

CBC had video of the gunman going to his car alone with his weapon after the shooting at the memorial. The car was later spotted parked in front of Parliament Hill, just down the block.

Royal Canadian Mounted Police sent a tweet advising people to stay away from Parliament Hill due to ongoing police activity. People in the buildings were advised to stay away from windows and rooftops.

Video footage posted online showed police ducking for cover as they advanced along a stone hallway, loud gunfire echoing among the stone columns.

Gilles Michaud, assistant commissioner of the Royal Canadian Mounted Police, called it a “dynamic, unfolding situation.”

Police officers said that one or more shooters were feared to be on the roof of the building.

Prime Minister Stephen Harper was in the parliament building at the time of the shooting but was taken to safety, his office said.

PARLIAMENTARIANS UNDER ATTACK

The top spokesman for Stephen Harper said the Prime Minister was safe and had left Parliament Hill.

Mr Harper had been scheduled to award honorary Canadian citizenship to girls’ education activist and Nobel Peace Prize winner Malala Yousafzai.

“I was just taking off my jacket to go into caucus. I hear this pop, pop, pop. Possibly 10 shots, don’t really know,” the spokesman said.

“Suddenly the security guards come rushing down the hallways and usher us all out to the back of the parliament buildings.”

Shots fired at the HoC...lone gunman is deceased. We are ok. — Bob Zimmer MP (@bobzimmermp) October 22, 2014

But the attack was over almost as soon as it began.

“I am safe and profoundly grateful to Sergeant-at-Arms Kevin Vickers and our security forces for selfless act of keeping us safe,” Veterans Affairs Minister Julian Fantino broadcast on Twitter.

Tony Clement, a senior government member of parliament, tweeted that shots were fired near where cabinet was meeting in Parliament. He added that he and his colleagues were “patiently awaiting rescue”.

SERGEANT-AT-ARMS HAILED A HERO

The Canadian Parliament’s 58-year-old head of security was being hailed as a hero after shooting dead a gunman who stormed the building.

Canadian ministers and lawmakers identified the House of Commons’ Sergeant-At-Arms, Kevin Vickers, as the man responsible for firing the shots that brought down the assailant.

Member of Parliament Craig Scott said on Twitter Vickers had slain the gunman just as he approached rooms packed with politicians.

“MPs and Hill staff owe their safety, even lives, to Sergeant at Arms Kevin Vickers who shot attacker just outside the MPs’ caucus rooms,” Scott wrote.

Vickers, a 29-year veteran of the Royal Canadian Mounted Police, was appointed Sergeant-At-Arms in 2006.

The position leaves him in charge of security at the parliamentary buildings. He also carries the mace, the symbol of parliamentary authority, during formal proceedings and ceremonies.

Canada’s Minister of Justice Peter Mackay named Vickers in a post on Twitter following the shootout drama.

“To all in Ottawa, stay safe & strong. Thank God for Sgt at Arms Kevin Vickers & our Cdn security forces. True heroes,” Mackay wrote.

Canadian minister of veteran affairs, Julian Fantino also identified Vickers in a post.

“I am safe & profoundly grateful to Sgt at Arms Kevin Vickers & our security forces for selfless act of keeping us safe,” he wrote.

Senator Linda Frum responded to a tweet identifying Vickers as the man who had brought the shootout to a bloody conclusion with one word: “Hero.”

Several journalists also praised Vickers, with CTV News broadcaster Mercedes Stephenson remarking: “Heroic actions by Sgt. at Arms Kevin Vickers today. He saved lives.”

CBC reporter Kady O’Malley meanwhile added: “Remind me to hug Kevin Vickers next time I see him.”

NATION ON ALERT

The attack came two days after a recent convert to Islam killed one Canadian soldier and injured another with his car before being shot to death by police. The killer had been on the radar of federal investigators, who feared he had jihadist ambitions and seized his passport when he tried to travel to Turkey.

The incident happened in Saint-Jean-sur-Richelieu, 40 kilometres southeast of Montreal.

Canada had raised its domestic terror threat level from low to medium on Tuesday because of what it called “an increase in general chatter from radical Islamist organisations.”

“Canada will not be terrorised or intimidated,” senior cabinet minister Jason Kenney declared on Twitter.

In a statement released on Tuesday Jason Tamming, a spokesman for Minister of Public Safety Steven Blaney, said the decision to raise the level was linked to an increase in “general chatter” from radical Islamist organisations like Islamic State, al-Qaeda, the extremist group al-Shabaab and others who pose a threat to Canadians."

11.40 (6.40) Corporal Nathan Cirillo , the soldier murdered this morning, posed with a tourist on Sunday. This tragic picture is doing the rounds on social media.

11.25 (6.25) We're expecting to get Stephen Harper, the Canadian prime minister, speaking soon. In the meantime here's Reuters on how a lot of the information on the alleged shooter is coming from the US, which maintains huge databases on suspected jihadists.

Canadian police are investigating a man named as Michael Zehaf-Bibeau as a possible suspect in the shootings around parliament, a source familiar with the matter said on Wednesday.

Two U.S. officials said that U.S. agencies have been advised that the shooter was a Canadian convert to Islam. One of the officials said that the man was from Quebec.

11pm (6pm) The suspected gunmen appears to have been arrested several times in Montreal:

<noframe>Twitter: Domenic Fazioli - During his time in Montreal, Michael Zehaf-Bibeau arrested 5 times. 3 times for drug possession; twice for not respecting parole conditions</noframe>

10pm (5pm) The soldier killed today is being named as Nathan Cirillo, a 24 year-old reserve soldier with the Hamilton Argyll and Sutherland Highlanders who had been assigned to to hold the honour guard over the war memorial.

-

9.45 (4.45) Reuters reports that police are investigating Michael Zehaf-Bibeau as the possible shooter, a Canadian in his early thirties. His name is widely circulated by US officials speaking to American media:

<noframe>Twitter: CBS Evening News - JUST IN: U.S. officials tell CBS News the name of the dead Ottawa shooting suspect is Michael Zehaf-Bibeau, a Canadian born in 1982.</noframe>

9.35 (4.35) Obama spoke briefly about the attack in Ottawa from the Oval Office, expressing his condolences and saying it was still unclear what motivated the shooter:

8.55 (3.55) My colleagues Richard Spencer and Rosa Prince on how Canada, like many other Western countries, has struggled with homegrown jihadism:

A 23-year-old called Mohammed Ali, known by his nickname Abu Turaab al-Kanadi, has become a celebrity for cheering on Isil beheadings.

Before he left, he was an oil worker.

Other Canadians were involved in high-profile international incidents: two Ontario school-friends, including a convert, were killed when an al-Qaeda offshoot took over a gas plant in southern Algeria; another Canadian bombed a bus in Bulgaria; yet another was said to be one of the gang who stormed the Westgate Mall in Nairobi, Kenya, last year killing 63 people.

8.25 (3.25) Update from Ottawa hospital on the injuries in today's attack:

8.16 (3.16) This is interesting: The Royal Canadian Mounted Police have set up a website where people can upload pictures or photographs they may have shot with their smart phones. Anyone at the scene may have gathered crucial evidence with their mobile.

8pm (3pm) The White House has tweeted a readout of Obama's call with Harper earlier:

7.52 (2.52) Soldiers who guard the National War Memorial were carrying unloaded rifles, according to CBC. Their role was purely ceremonial, with the duties being carried out by full-time and part-time soldiers, who were rotated ever hour or every two hours.

7.36 (2.36) Police are asked if the gunman was targeting the prime minister or some other senior government official. ""It's way too early to determine a motive,"" police say.

-

7.31 (2.31) Police aren't saying whether they're looking more shooters only that they're continuing to clear and secure the area around Parliament Hill. They are still ""trying to ascertain the identity of the suspect"".

7.30 (2.30) Jim Watson, the mayor of Ottawa, says ""Today is a sad and tragic day for our city and our country"" but that motive for the shooting remains unknown.

7.20 (2.20) Charles Bordeleau, the chief of Ottawa police, confirms that the soldier is dead, as is one gunman. He says nothing about whether there are more gunman being hunted. He also offers reassurances to military personnel in the area: ""I want them to know that we're committed to their safety.""

7.10 (2.10) David Cameron has tweeted his solidarity with the people of Canada:

<noframe>Twitter: David Cameron - I'm appalled by today's attack in Ottawa. I offer my full support to <a href=""http://www.twitter.com/pmharper"" target=""_blank"">@pmharper</a> and the Canadian people as they deal with this incident.</noframe>

7.01 (2.01) Ottawa police have put out their first formal statement. They're confirming that the soldier at the war memorial has been killed and also saying that one gunman was killed inside the parliament.

Importantly, they're now saying there was no shooting incident at the Rideau Centre shopping mall, a retraction of earlier information.

It's now sounding possible that one gunman was responsible for shooting the soldier and then charging into the parliament but we're waiting for more information.

6.45 (1.45) We're expecting the Royal Canadian Mounted Police to begin a media briefing shortly on today's shooting.

6.42 (1.42) The White House has expressed its solidarity with Canada and that Obama and Harper are due to speak at some point later today.

6.40 (1.40) Tony Zobl, a witness who says he saw the first shooting at the war memorial, says the gunman ""raised his arms in triumph"" after the shooting.

I looked out the window and saw a shooter, a man dressed all in black with a kerchief over his nose and mouth and something over his head as well, holding a rifle and shooting an honour guard in front of the cenotaph point-blank, twice. The honour guard dropped to the ground, and the shooter kind of raised his arms in triumph holding the rifle.

6.33 (1.33) Here's Stephen Harper, the Canadian prime minister, being briefed by police about today's shooting

6.30 (1.30) Chrystia Freeland, a Liberal member of the Canadian parliament, described how she heard shots as she was walking to a party caucus meeting. “I recognised they were gunshots,” she told MSNBC. “The right thing to do was hide. I took off my high heels and put on my runners because I had to run.”

She said she was given a bullet proof vest to wear and she hid in the canteen used by staff.

6.22 (1.22pm) A number of Canadian MPs are saying that the gunman inside of Parliament was brought down by Kevin Vickers, the sergeant-at-arms in the House of Commons.

<noframe>Twitter: Craig Scott - MPs and Hill staff owe their safety, even lives, to Sergeant at Arms Kevin Vickers who shot attacker just outside the MPs' caucus rooms.</noframe>

While the sergeant-at-arms plays a ceremonial role during the official opening of parliament, he is also a security professional trusted with protecting the institutions of Canadian democracy.

Vickers is a veteran of the Royal Canadian Mounted Police and is said to be at an Ottawa police station giving a statement.

6.15 (1.15pm) Canadian military personnel are being told not to wear their uniforms in public, according to CBC.

6.03 (1.03pm) Police are said to be looking for two more suspects and the streets of central Ottawa remain on lockdown. More than three hours after the first shots were fired this doesn't appear to be over.

6.01pm (1.01pm) Another Conservative MP says the soldier is dead and says a parliamentary guard was wounded.

<noframe>Twitter: Jason Kenney Ù&dagger; - Condolences to family of the soldier killed, &amp; prayers for the Parliamentary guard wounded. Canada will not be terrorized or intimidated.</noframe>

<noframe>Twitter: John Williamson - Government Caucus received confirmation shortly ago that one CAF soldier was killed. A moment of silence followed.</noframe>

The soldier was standing a ceremonial guard at the National War Memorial near parliament. The military has not yet confirmed his status.

5.55 (12.55) Police confirm that they are still looking for more suspects. Armed officers remained flooded on the streets of downtown Ottowa.

5.50 (12.50) There are conflicting reports about the status of the soldier shot at the war memorial. Police have not yet said if he's dead or alive.

5.40 (12.40) This picture from earlier appears to show Canadian MPs huddled in a caucus room with chairs piled against the door:

-

5.35 (12.35) CBC, the Canadian broadcaster, is reporting that two people were injured in the incident at the Rideau Centre and have now arrived at the hospital.

<noframe>Twitter: CBC Ottawa - BREAKING | Civic hospital confirms 2 victims on way to hospital now; one shot.

That would appear to mean three people have been injured: the soldier and two others.

5.20 (12.20) Stephen Harper, the Canadian prime minister, has put out a brief statement and says he will address the nation later on today.

5.10 (12.10) The chaos in Canada is being closed watched in Washington, the American capital. President Obama's aides have briefed him on the situation there and the Capitol Police, who guard the US Congress, are aware of the situation but not making any significant adjustments to their security posture.

5.00 (12.00) Let's quickly recap what's happening. Police say there have been three shootings:

National War Memorial: A Canadian soldier was shot there and his condition remains unclear

Centre Block building of Canadian parliament: A shooter ran through the halls of the main building of the Canadian parliamentary complex. Candian MPs and staff report that a shooter was killed there.

Rideau Centre: A shopping mall not far from Parliament. Ottawa Police have confirmed there was a shooting there but it isn't clear whether that shooting happened before or after the other two incidents.

4.59 (11.59) My colleague David Lawler has confirmed that the Rideau Centre, a shopping mall near the parliamentary complex, is on lockdown. Police are saying shots were fired there but it's not clear if it was the same shooter who opened fire at the mall, the war memorial and inside the parliamentary building or if we're looking at multiple shooters.

<noframe>Twitter: The Associated Press - BREAKING: Canada police say shots also fired at a mall near Parliament.</noframe>

4.55 (11.55) The Canadian soldier is being treated at the Civic Hospital not far from the parliamentary complex. The New York Times is reporting that the soldier is dead but that has not been confirmed.

4.46 (11.46) This tweet captures the sense of shock in Canada right now:

<noframe>Twitter: John Ivison - Canada has just lost her innocence.</noframe>

Although Canadian forces fought in Afghanistan and have joined the US-led coalition against Isil, the threat of terrorism has never been as palpable there as it has been in the US and Britain since 9/11. For some Canadians that may have changed this week.

4.45 (11.45) The first reports of gunfire reached Ottawa police at 9.52am, meaning that it's been nearly two hours since the first shots. We haven't heard any fresh reports of gunfire but police are still combing the area.

4.35 (11.35) Police are reportedly concerned about a shooter on a roof at the Parliamentary complex.

4.27 (11.27) It is still not clear if this was the work of a lone gunman or if multiple shooters were involved. Reuters reports that police are still looking for more shooters:

And the Rideau Centre, a nearby shopping mall, has also been evacuated

4.25 (11.25) It's not clear if the soldier shot in the first moments of this incident is stil alive.

4.22 (11.22) Dramatic footage from the shooting inside Parliament. You can hear dozens of shots fired, although it's not clear if they came from the shooter or from police.

4.12 (11.12) The situation appears to have calmed but lockdown remains in place and police and warning people to stay away from windows:

<noframe>Twitter: Josh Wingrove - We are still in lockdown here in Parliament's Centre Block. The building appears to still be under a search, officers with guns drawn</noframe>

<noframe>Twitter: Josh Wingrove - Inside the building, we've been told to keep away from windows</noframe>

4.06pm (11.06am) It's not clear who is responsible for today's shooting but the shocking scenes in Ottawa come two days after a 25-year-old convert to radical Islam ran down two Canadian soldiers, killing one. The driver, Martin Couture-Rouleau, was shot and killed by police.

My colleague David Lawler has a little more detail:

Warrant Officer Patrice Vincent, 53, was struck by the vehicle and died from his injuries on Monday evening.

Couture-Rouleau had been previously placed on a government watch list as a possible Islamic extremist, because items on his Facebook page had indicated that he was ""radicalising himself.""

In a news conference held yesterday, police spokesman Martine Fontaine explained why Couture-Rouleau had not been arrested:

""We could not arrest someone for having radical thoughts. It is not a crime in Canada.""

Canadian authorities are now trying to establish any links between Couture-Rouleau and the Islamic State or other terror groups, but say all indications at present are that the incident was a ""lone wolf"" attack.

4.03pm (11.03am) The Canadian prime minister, Stephen Harper, is safe and has been evacuated from the Parliament Hill area, according to his spokesman.

<noframe>Twitter: Jason MacDonald - .<a href=""http://www.twitter.com/pmharper"" target=""_blank"">@pmharper</a> is safe and has left Parliament Hill.</noframe>

4.01pm (11.01am) Bernard Trottier, another Canadian MP, is echoing reports that the shooter is dead.

<noframe>Twitter: Bernard Trottier - Gunman at Parliament's Centre Block has been shot and killed</noframe>

3.55pm (10.55) The shooting appears to have begun at the National War Memorial outside of the Canadian parliament in Ottawa, where a soldier in uniform was shot. The shooter then appears to have moved inside of Centre Block, the main building of the Canadian parliamentary complex. More shots were reported, presumably some fired by law enforcement.

Bob Zimmer, a Canadian MP, says there was a single gunman who is now dead:

<noframe>Twitter: Bob Zimmer MP - Shots fired at the HoC...lone gunman is deceased. We are ok.</noframe>

3.45pm London (10.45am Ottawa) The Canadian parliament has been placed on lockdown after a soldier was shot at a nearby war memorial and the shooter seen running towards the building, according to reports.

Gunshots were heard at the site in Ottawa shortly after 3pm and police and tactical teams have since arrived at the scene.

A Canadian soldier is believed to have been injured in the attack. It has since been reported that the gunman has been shot and killed.

Bernard Trottier, a conservative member of the Canadian parliament, said on Twitter: ""Gunman at Parliament's Centre Block has been shot and killed.""

Gerry Byrne, another politician, has tweeted a photograph of the police presence in the Canadian capital.

Stephen Harper, the Canadian prime minister, was in parliament but has since left the area, Reuters news agency has said.

The shooting comes two days after an Islamic convert ran down two Canadian soldiers, killing one, near Montreal.

The gunman in the parliament building was shot dead, and Harper was safely removed in incidents that may have been linked to Islamic militants.

Witness accounts indicated the man who shot dead the soldier guarding the National War Memorial in central Ottawa, went on to attack the parliament building minutes later. Canadian police said however they could not “at this point” confirm it was the same person.

The shootings followed an attack on two soldiers in Quebec on Monday carried out by a convert to Islam. Two U.S. officials said U.S. agencies had been advised the dead gunman in Wednesday’s shootings was also a Canadian convert to Islam.

Witnesses said a flurry of shots were fired after a gunman entered the parliament building, pursued by police.

The assault took place very near the room where Harper was meeting with members of his Conservative party, a government minister said.

“PM (Harper) was addressing caucus, then a huge boom, followed by rat-a-tat shots. We all scattered. It was clearly right outside our caucus door,” Treasury Board Minister Tony Clement told Reuters.

The incident, shocking in Canada’s normally tranquil capital, began shortly before 10 a.m. ET and was not over late in the afternoon. Parliament and buildings in downtown remained on emergency lockdown at 6 p.m.

Canadian police were investigating a man named as Michael Zehaf-Bibeau as a possible suspect in the shootings, a source familiar with the matter said. U.S. government sources said the suspect was born Michael Joseph Hall but later changed his legal family name to Zehaf-Bibeau.

Security in Ottawa came under criticism after the gunman was able to run through the unlocked front door of the main parliament building. Police said an operation was under way to make parliament safe.

“It caught us by surprise... If we had known that this was coming, we would have been able to disrupt it,” Gilles Michaud, assistant commissioner of the Royal Canadian Mounted Police, (RCMP) told a news conference.

It was unclear whether there was any connection between Wednesday’s shootings and an attack on Monday when a convert to Islam ran down two Canadian soldiers with his car, killing one, near Montreal, before being shot dead by police in the first fatal attack on Canadian soil tied to Islamic militants.

No group, Islamic or otherwise, claimed responsibility for either the attack in Ottawa or the one near Montreal. Monday’s attacker, 25-year-old Martin Rouleau, who converted to Islam last year, was among 90 people being tracked by the RCMP on suspicion of taking part in militant activities abroad or planning to do so.

Canada announced this month it was joining the battle against Islamic State fighters who have taken over parts of Iraq and Syria.

GUNS DRAWN IN PARLIAMENT

From witness accounts it appeared the suspect dashed into parliament, ran past the room where Harper was speaking and was gunned down outside the entrance to the library, only about 60 feet (20 meters) away.

Dramatic video footage posted by the Globe and Mail newspaper showed police with guns drawn inside the main parliament building. At least a dozen loud bangs can be heard on the clip, echoing through the hallway.

Veterans Affairs Minister Julian Fantino, a former policeman, told the Toronto Sun that parliament’s head of security, Sergeant-at-Arms Kevin Vickers, shot dead a suspected gunman.

Canadian cabinet minister Jason Kenney said a guard in parliament buildings was also wounded in the incident.

Harper stressed that government and parliament should continue its work, a spokesman said. “While the prime minister stated that facts are still being gathered, he condemned this despicable attack,” the spokesman said.

Harper, who was meeting with cabinet ministers on Wednesday evening, was expected to make a statement later in the day.

Canada said on Tuesday it had raised the national terrorism threat level to medium from low because of a rise in “general chatter” from radical groups such as Islamic State and al Qaeda but said there had not been a specific threat.

The RCMP’s Michaud said the threat level on Parliament Hill had been on medium for some time.

The soldier who died in the shooting at the War Memorial was identified as Cpl. Nathan Cirillo, according to his aunt.

Cirillo was a member of the Argyll and Sutherland Highlanders, a regiment of Reserve Forces based in Hamilton, and was training to join the Canada Border Services Agency, a federal agency responsible for border and immigration enforcement, his aunt told The Globe and Mail.

It was not clear if Cirillo was armed or not when he was shot.

‘YOU ARE IN DANGER HERE’

The attack on the heart of the country’s government shook Canada’s self-image as generally non-violent, particularly compared to the United States, where gun violence is much more common. Canadian cities and towns hiked security around government buildings, schools and mass transit systems.

As the drama in Ottawa unfolded, police in dark bulletproof vests and carrying automatic rifles flooded the streets near parliament, clearing several blocks of downtown Ottawa.

Some took cover behind vehicles and shouted to people to clear the area, saying: “We do not have the suspect in custody. You are in danger here.”

When the shooting started, most members of parliament were in the two caucus rooms past which the gunman ran. Members were told to lock or barricade themselves in their rooms or offices, and stay away from the windows.

A tweeted picture sent from the room where the opposition New Democrats were holding a weekly caucus showed a pile of chairs jammed up against the main door to prevent anyone from entering.

U.S. officials said there was no specific indication of a similar attack in the United States, a strong Canadian ally, but reinforced warnings to Americans to be alert.

“As a matter of precaution due to recent events, the FBI has reminded our field offices and government partners to remain vigilant in light of recent calls for attacks against government personnel by terrorist groups and like-minded individuals,” U.S. Federal Bureau of Investigation spokesman Paul Bresson said.

Canadian and U.S. stock markets declined after the shootings in Ottawa. The Toronto Stock Exchange's TSX index .GSPTSE dropped 1.6 percent, while the S&P 500 .SPX gave back 0.7 percent.

Mass shootings are relatively rare in Canada, which has stricter gun laws than the United States, and the regulations at one point included a national registry of rifles and shotguns. Legislation was passed in 2012 to scrap the registry.

Ottawa also has a low murder rate. There were nine homicides in 2013 and seven in 2012, in a city of 885,000 people. Compared with Capitol Hill in Washington, security on Parliament Hill is also fairly low key. Anybody could walk right up to the front door of parliament’s Centre Block with arms and explosives without being challenged before entering the front door, where a few guards check accreditation.

Centre Block is the main building on Parliament Hill, a sprawling complex of buildings and open space in downtown Ottawa. It contains the House of Commons and Senate chambers as well as the offices of some members of parliament, senators, and senior administration for both legislative houses.

A construction worker who was on the scene in Ottawa when the shooting began told Reuters he heard a gunshot, and then saw a man with a scarf over his face running towards parliament.

“He was wearing blue pants and a black jacket and he had a double barreled shotgun and he ran up the side of this building here and hijacked a car at gunpoint,” construction worker Scott Walsh told Reuters.

The driver got out safely, then the man drove the car to the Centre Block, where construction work is under way, Walsh said.

The Canadian military closed its bases across the country to the public following the events in Ottawa, CBC TV said.

The attacks in Ottawa and Quebec took place as the Canadian government prepared to boost the powers of its spy agency, the Canadian Security Intelligence Service. Public Safety Minister Stephen Blaney said last Thursday the new legislation would let the agency track and investigate potential terrorists when they travel abroad and ultimately prosecute them.

Outside Washington, unspecified extra security was authorized at the Tomb of the Unknown Soldier in Arlington National Cemetery, where ceremonial guards mount a constant watch, a U.S. Defense Department official said."

Witnesses told CBC News that the suspected shooter was carrying a rifle.

The Canadian parliament building was reported to be in lockdown following the shooting. Police have cordoned the area and blocked access to Parliament Hill.

Other reports said shots were fired inside the parliament.

Police say that they have located the car belonging to suspect and advised people to stay away from Parliament Hill due to the ongoing incident. Canadian prime minister Stephen Harper was said to be safe and evacuated the building after the shooting.

At least 20 shots were inside the Canadian parliament, according to witnesses.

A Globe and Mail journalist said that ""dozens of shots"" have been fired inside the parliament building. Other reports said the man was wearing a long dark coat and had a ""Middle Eastern scarf covering his face"".

The report seems to be confirmed by CBS, which quoted Ottawa Police as saying that multiple suspects are at large in the shooting.

Two MPs tweeted that the gunman has been killed by police.

Another member of parliament, Michelle Rempel, tweeted:

Royal Canadian Mounted Police warned people in downtown Ottawa to stay away from windows and rooftops.

The attack came a day after a 25-year-old Muslim convert was shot dead by police after he killed a Canadian solider and injured a second near Montreal.

Police said the man, Martin Couture Rouleau, had recently become influenced by radical Islam, with friends suggesting he acted in response to an appeal by the Isis (Islamic State) group for jihadi sympathisers across the world to launch 'lone wolf' attacks on westerners ""wherever they can be found"".

Canada raised the terror threat level in the country from low to medium following the attack.

Corporal Nathan Cirillo, 24 was guarding near the country's parliament in Ottawa when he was gunned down by Canadian Michael Zehaf-Bibeau. Zehaf-Bibeau, who was a recent convert to Islam, raised his arms in celebration after the shooting which sparked a lockdown in the Ottawa downtown area. Government sources reported the 32-year-old was shot dead by parliament's sergeant-at-arms Kevin Vickers. In his first address to the nation since the attack, prime minister Stephen Harper condemned it as a "" brutal attack"" and said terrorists would find ""no safe haven"" in his country.

The country's leader was evacuated from the parliament building where he was holding a meeting at the time of the shooting. He said: ""For the second time this week, there has been a brutal and violent act on our soil. ""In the days to come we will learn more about the terrorist and any accomplices he may have had. ""This week's events are a grim reminder that Canada is not immune to the types of terrorist attacks we have seen elsewhere around the world. ""But let there be no misunderstanding, we will not be intimidated. Canada will never be intimidated. He continued: ""In fact this will lead us to strengthen our resolve and redouble our efforts to take all necessary steps to identify and counter threats and keep Canada safe here at home. ""Just as it will strengthen our resolve and redouble our efforts to work with our allies around the world and fight against the terrorist organisations who brutalise those in other countries with the hope of bringing their savagery to our shores.

Ottawa Mayor Jim Watson said: ""Today is a sad and tragic day for our city and our country"".

Britain's prime minister David Cameron said he was ""appalled"" by the attack on Twitter last night. He wrote: ""I offer my full support to @pmharper and the Canadian people as they deal with this incident,"" the Prime Minister wrote. The country's MP Craig Scott wrote on Twitter: ""MPs and Hill staff owe their safety, even lives, to sergeant-at-arms Kevin Vickers who shot attacker just outside the MPs' caucus rooms.""

AP Soldiers stand guard after the Ottawa shooting

It was unclear whether other gunmen remained at large, with police describing the incident as an ""ongoing"" operation with no-one currently in custody. Police received a number of calls at 9.52am local time after the soldier was shot, with further gunfire then taking place inside Parliament Hill. Officers said that, contrary to reports, no third incident occurred at the Rideau Centre shopping mall.

INSTAGRAM The soldier shot dead in Ottawa was identified by Canadian media as Nathan Cirillo

Cops said in the initial hours that as many as two other gunmen may have taken part in the attacks. But by late in the evening, the cordon around parliament was lifted and police said there was no longer any threat to the public in the area. Thousands of tributes have poured in on a Facebook page set up in memory of Cpl Cirillo. One message, from Bob Rodkin, read: ""RIP Nathan. Thank you for your service and the ultimate sacrifice. So tragic, so unnecessary. My prayers go out for you and to your family, friends and colleagues.""

AP Police secure the area surrounding Parliament Hill in Ottawa

While another from Olivia Marie, said: ""RIP Nathan! Thank you for defending our country, your son is so proud of you. I miss you."" Cabinet minister Tony Clement tweeted that at least 30 shots were fired while a meeting was taking place between Mr Harper and other MPs. ""I feared this day would come, and my prayers are with the fallen soldier,"" he added.

""There was only one man in the car. He went out of the left side. ""He had a long gun and he ran away to the front and went inside the parliament. I heard one shot.

WATCH ABOVE: Prime Minister Harper addresses the nation following what he called a “terrorist” attack in Ottawa

TORONTO – One male suspect is dead after a Canadian soldier was shot and killed at the War Memorial in Ottawa Wednesday morning, according to Ottawa Police.

A lockdown that lasted into the evening ended at 8:25 p.m. ET, when the safety perimeter in downtown Ottawa was lifted. Police said there was no longer “a threat to public safety” in the downtown core, but police operations continued on Parliament Hill “and as such the Hill continues to be off limits to the public.”

Cpl. Nathan Cirillo was identified by his cousin, David, as the victim of the shooting in a Facebook post on Wednesday.

Zehaf-Bibeau was reportedly recently designated a “high-risk traveller” and had his passport seized, according to The Globe and Mail.

The suspect in Monday’s terror-linked attack in Quebec, Martin Couture-Rouleau, also had his passport seized. He was suspected of being an extremist with possible terrorist links. Commissioner Bob Paulson said the passport was confiscated and he confirmed he was one of 90 suspected extremists being investigated by the RCMP.

In a statement to the nation, Prime Minister Stephen Harper said we will learn more about the “terrorist and any accomplices he may have had” in the days to come.

“This is a grim reminder that Canada is not immune to the types of terrorist attacks we have seen elsewhere around the world,” he said.

“Canada will never be intimidated. In fact, this will lead us to strengthen our resolve and redouble our efforts and those of our national security agencies to take all necessary steps to identify and counter threats and keep Canada safe here at home.”

NDP Leader Thomas Mulcair spoke after Harper, saying Wednesday’s events have “only succeeded in drawing us closer, in making us stronger.”

“To the brave women and men of law enforcement, our security services and our Canadian Forces I want to say that your determination, your professionalism and indeed your heroism today will not soon be forgotten.”

Liberal Leader Justin Trudeau was last to address Canadians, saying Canada has “never been innocent” to the threats it faces.

“We have never let those threats shape us. … We will get answers to how and why this happened. They will be vital in preventing any future attack,” said Trudeau.

“And to our friends and fellow citizens in the Muslim community, Canadians know acts such as these committed in the name of Islam are an aberration of your faith.

The Civic Campus of the Ottawa Hospital received four patients between 10 a.m.- 1p.m. ET, including the soldier who succumbed to his injuries. All three patients with minor injuries were discharged as of 6:20 p.m. ET.

Cirillo was a member of the Argyll and Sutherland Highanders of Canada, based in Hamilton, Ont.

“Our thoughts and prayers are with the family, friends, and colleagues of the Argyll and Sutherland reservist who was killed today, serving his country,” said Hamilton Police Chief De Caire in a statement. “He is a part-time soldier, and a full-time Canadian.”

Some members of the Argylls of Canada – 91st Canadian Highlanders were known to be on tour guarding the War Memorial in the days before the shooting, according to the Hamilton Spectator.

Members of the military were told not to wear their uniforms outside of the Ottawa garrison or stop in public venues starting Thursday.

Contrary to earlier reports, Ottawa Police said no incident occurred near the Rideau Centre.

Police didn’t confirm how many suspects were armed, if any weapons had been retrieved, or whether the suspect was a Canadian citizen. When asked whether a Global News report that Canada’s domestic terror threat level had been elevated in recent days also applied to Parliament Hill, RCMP Assistant Commissioner Gilles Michaud declined to confirm that was the case.

Witnesses on the scene at the War Memorial said they were in shock; a number of them performed CPR on the victim.

“I’m just trying to grasp it now,” said a male witness, who said soldiers were doing their “normal drill.”

“They were doing their march with their rifle in their hand and he [the suspect] came out on the right hand side here and fired a shot right at one of the soldiers. [The soldier] went down and the other went to his aid. The suspect took off across the street into a vehicle,” he said.

A second witness described the suspect as having long, dark hair and wearing long pants and a long jacket.

“I heard the first shot and I saw the guard go down, then three more shots and I was taking cover myself, so I wasn’t paying attention to everything that was going on,” said the witness. “He just took off.”

The slain soldier is Cpl. Nathan Cirillo, 24, a reservist from Hamilton.

Moments after Cirillo was shot at his post by the Tomb of the Unknown Soldier, MPs and other witnesses reported 30 to 50 shots fired inside the main Parliament building.

It was confirmed later that the gunman was shot dead inside the building, felled by the House of Commons sergeant-at-arms and RCMP, according to MPs' accounts.

CBC News has confirmed the dead shooting suspect is Michael Zehaf-Bibeau, a Canadian born in 1982. CBC News has learned that Zehaf-Bibeau has a criminal record in Quebec dating back 10 years on some drug-related charges. Court documents from that time show that he lived at an address in Montreal.

He also has a criminal record in B.C., where he was convicted in 2012 of uttering threats and served one day in jail.

In his brief address, Harper offered condolences for Cirillo's family, and for the family of Patrice Vincent, another soldier who was killed in an attack earlier this week.

""For the second time this week, there has been a brutal and violent attack on our soil,"" he said.

""But let there be no misunderstanding — we will not be intimidated, Canada will never be intimidated.""

NDP Leader Tom Mulcair and Liberal Leader Justin Trudeau delivered their own statements, condemning the attacks and pledging support for the government.

Harper, who was on Parliament Hill at the time of the shooting and was safely whisked away, met with members of his cabinet before making his address. He then met with the Conservative caucus, who had been in lockdown on the Hill until after 8 p.m. ET.

Harper's spokesman Carl Vallée said on Twitter that Harper also spoke briefly to U.S. President Barack Obama on Wednesday afternoon. Harper also spoke with Mulcair and Trudeau, the Prime Minister's Office said.

Hundreds of people, including children at a daycare, waited hours to be evacuated from Parliament Hill as the area remained under lockdown. Late Wednesday OC Transpo buses began taking people away from the Hill as the lockdown eased.

Caught 'by surprise'

In an afternoon news conference, police would not say whether they still suspect another shooter is involved, saying only ""there is no one in custody at this time.""

""This is a dynamic and unfolding situation,"" said RCMP Assistant Commissioner Gilles Michaud, commanding officer of the national division.

Michaud also suggested that police had no forewarning of the attack, saying ""it caught us by surprise."" He added that it's too soon to say whether the dead gunman was already known to security officials.

Michaud added that police have maintained a ""medium"" level of security of Parliament for the past number of years, and that had not changed in recent days.

Ottawa police Chief Charles Bordeleau asked witnesses to the incidents to come forward.

Ottawa Civic Hospital confirmed four people were taken to hospital: the soldier who died, and three who were released after treatment for minor injuries. One of those injured was a parliamentary security guard shot in the foot, according to CBC's Judy Trinh.

Despite earlier reports of shots fired near the Rideau Centre shopping mall east of Parliament Hill, police later said ""no incident occurred near the Rideau Centre.""

Chaos and bravery inside Parliament

Alain Merisier, who works at the cafeteria in one of the Parliament Buildings, told CBC News that he saw a man in a car at the Centre Block with a long gun.

CBC video and cellphone video shot by a Globe and Mail reporter showed a chaotic scene in the elegant hallway leading from the front doors of Parliament's Centre Block to the Library of Parliament during the attack.

A sustained volley of shots was fired. Startled security personnel and political staff scrambled to take cover in the limestone alcoves as bullets flew.

In the minutes after the shooting, MPs and parliamentary staff began tweeting and telling reporters that it was Sergeant-at-Arms Kevin Vickers who shot the gunman. The tweets included:

NDP MP Craig Scott: ""MPs and Hill staff owe their safety, even lives, to Sergeant at Arms Kevin Vickers who shot attacker just outside the MPs' caucus rooms.""

Veterans Affairs Minister Julian Fantino, former head of the Ontario Provincial Police and ex-Toronto chief of police: ""I am safe & profoundly grateful to Sgt at Arms Kevin Vickers & our security forces for selfless act of keeping us safe.""

Justice Minister Peter MacKay: ""Thank God for Sgt at Arms Kevin Vickers & our Cdn security forces. True heroes.""

Eyewitness accounts

Earlier, police sealed off the area around the National War Memorial while the injured soldier was given emergency medical aid.

""We were waiting there for a city tour and suddenly I heard four shots,"" said Jan Lugtenborg, a tourist visiting downtown Ottawa from Holland.

""Suddenly I saw a small guy with long black hair … with a long rifle, and he ran away after the shots, across streets in the direction of Parliament Hill,"" he said.

Raivo Nommick, another bystander, said ""all of a sudden, I just heard a shot, turned around and there was a guy with a rifle .... and just pow pow.

""Then I saw one of the other Armed Forces guys just running. He barrelled over, just ran right over. The other guy just dropped. I looked back and just dived underneath and immediately called 911.""

Scott Walsh, who was working on Parliament Hill, said he saw a man running with a double-barrelled shotgun, wearing a scarf and blue jeans.

Walsh said the man hopped over the stone fence that surrounds Parliament Hill, forcing someone out of their car at gunpoint. He then drove to the front doors of Parliament and fired at least two shots, Walsh said.

New Democrat MP Hélène Laverdière said she heard 20 to 30 shots inside Parliament, and hit the floor. She and fellow MPs Charlie Angus and Rosane Doré Lefebvre were later led out of the Centre Block to safety.

MP Doré Lefebvre worried about getting her daughter from the daycare facility on Parliament Hill. Children from the daycare were not released until about 8 p.m.

Harper addressed the nation hours after a young soldier was gunned down at the National War Memorial in Ottawa and dozens of shots fired inside Parliament ended with the shooter’s death.

The attacks in Ottawa occurred just two days after a Quebec soldier was killed in what Harper called an Islamic State-inspired attack in St-Jean-sur-Richelieu, not far from Montreal. The suspect in that case was killed by police after brief chase.

Harper said more information about the “terrorist” killed in Ottawa will surface in the coming days. CTV News has confirmed that the suspect in Wednesday’s attack is Michael Zehaf-Bibeau, a Canadian citizen born in 1982.

“This week’s events are a grim reminder that Canada is not immune to the types of terrorist attacks we have seen elsewhere around the world,” the prime minister said.

“We are also reminded that attacks on our security personnel and on our institutions of governments are by their very nature attacks on our country, on our values, on our society, on us Canadians as a free and democratic people who embrace human dignity for all,” he said.

“But let there be no misunderstanding -- we will not be intimidated. Canada will never be intimidated.”

Harper said the attacks will only strengthen Canada’s resolve and lead the government to “redouble our efforts and those of our national security agencies to take all necessary steps to identify and counter threats and keep Canada safe here at home.”

National Defence Minister Rob Nicholson echoed Harper in a statement issued late Wednesday, saying that Canada’s deployments in Iraq as part of the U.S.-led fight against ISIS “will continue unimpeded.”

The prime minister offered his condolences to the friends and family of Cpl. Nathan Cirillo, the reservist who was “murdered in cold blood” Wednesday while standing guard at the war memorial. Harper also praised the passersby and first responders who tried to save his life.

Opposition Leader Thomas Mulcair called the shootings ""a cowardly attack designed to strike at the heart of our democracy, the heart of who we are.""

But he said Canadians will once again wake up in a country “blessed by love, diversity and peace.”

RCMP Commissioner Bob Paulson said Thursday that Zehaf-Bibeau had applied for a passport, and police were doing background checks. Zehaf-Bibeau was not on the list of “high-risk travellers” being tracked by Canadian authorities, Paulson said.

Court records show that a Michael Joseph Zehaf-Bibeau was accused of robbery in Vancouver in late 2011. He was found guilty of uttering threats, a lesser charge.

Panic on the Hill

The chaos in Ottawa began around 9:52 a.m. Wednesday, when police received multiple 911 calls about a shooting at the National War Memorial.

When paramedics and police arrived, the honour guard -- later identified as Cirillo -- was on the ground, surrounded by people who tried to help him.

A short time later, the gunman entered Parliament’s Centre Block and dozens ofshots rang out as MPs, staff and reporters rushed to safety. The suspect was gunned down by Kevin Vickers, the sergeant-at-arms for the House of Commons.

Three other people were taken to the Ottawa Hospital after the shootings. They were all discharged by Wednesday evening.

Parliament Hill and Ottawa’s downtown core were under lockdown for hours after the shootings, but police have not said if other suspects were still on the loose.

Ottawa Police Chief Charles Bordeleau said residents need to stay “vigilant” and report any suspicious activity to police. But he did not directly answer questions from reporters about the possibility that another shooter -- or shooters -- were still at large.

Earlier Wednesday, Ottawa police Const. Marc Soucy said officers believe there may be more than one assailant. He said that police will be assuming that any other assailants are armed.

Tony Zobl, 35, told The Canadian Press that he witnessed the soldier being gunned down from his fourth-floor office window directly above the war memorial.

""I looked out the window and saw a shooter, a man dressed all in black with a kerchief over his nose and mouth and something over his head as well, holding a rifle and shooting an honour guard in front of the Cenotaph point-blank, twice,"" Zobl told CP.

""It looked like the honour guard was trying to reach for the barrel of the gun. The honour guard dropped to the ground and the shooter kind of raised his arms in triumph holding the rifle.""

Zobl said he then saw the shooter run up the street toward Parliament Hill.

Video captured inside Parliament showed officers filing down the empty corridor of the Hall of Honour as at least a dozen shots could be heard ringing out in the background. A security guard was reported to be injured in the shooting.

“This is a dynamic and unfolding situation,” RCMP Assistant Commissioner Gilles Michaud told a news conference Wednesday afternoon.

He said the attack caught the RCMP by surprise, but would not elaborate.

“If we had known that this was coming, we would have been able to disrupt it,” he said.

The RCMP also said it’s too early to say if the gunman was among the 90 or so suspected extremists being tracked by the Canadian government.

Reports of a third shooting inside the Rideau Centre, a shopping mall near Parliament Hill, turned out to be false, Bordeleau said.

“Today is a sad and tragic day for our city and our country,” Ottawa Mayor Jim Watson said, adding that everyone is “looking for answers.”

The shooting comes two days after a man attacked two Canadian soldiers in St-Jean-sur-Richelieu, Que. One of those soldiers, Warrant Officer Patrice Vincent, died from his injuries. The suspect, Martin Couture-Rouleau, was shot and killed by police.

On Tuesday, Canada raised the domestic terror threat level from low to medium.

Security beefed up

The attack on Parliament Hill immediately prompted officials across the country to heighten security at government buildings, provincial legislatures and military bases.

Soldiers are also being cautioned about wearing their uniforms in public when they’re not on active duty.

U.S. President Barack Obama spoke with Harper Wednesday and offered “any assistance” needed in the response to the attack, according to a tweet from the U.S. National Security Council.

Obama also expressed “the American people’s solidarity with Canada,” according to the NSC.

The president later publicly condemned the Ottawa shootings, calling them “outrageous.”

“We’re all shaken by it,” he said, adding that the U.S. is closely watching the unfolding events.

A statement from NATO’s secretary general also said that “NATO stands in solidarity with our ally Canada at this difficult time.”

With files from Marlene Leung and The Canadian Press

An earlier version of this story Wednesday incorrectly reported that Zehaf-Bibeau was on a list of “high-risk travellers” being tracked by Canadian authorities and had his passport seized.

Why did it turn out wrong? Because some of the weapons they dropped from those C130s were seized by ISIL.""

As we noted on Tuesday, at least one cache of American weapons was reportedly intercepted by Islamic State fighters, who have been engaged with Syrian Kurds in a feverous battle for Kobani for over a month now. The Pentagon claims that an overwhelming majority of weapons reached the Kurds.

So did the misstep negate the whole act of arming the Kurdish peshmerga? According to Erdogan, yes. However, Turkey was already disinclined to support the arming of the Kurds to begin with. In announcing the military boost earlier this week, U.S. Secretary of State John Kerry addressed both American and Turkish misgivings about arming the Syrian Kurds.

""We understand fully the fundamentals of (Ankara's) opposition and ours to any kind of terrorist group, and particularly, obviously, the challenges they face with respect to the PKK.""

The Syrian Kurds are linked to the Kurdistan Workers' Party (PKK), a group of Turkish Kurds that both Turkey and the United States have previously declared to be a terrorist organization. However, as Kerry implored, ""We cannot take our eye off the prize here.""

Despite its historic opposition, Turkey may be slowly changing its tune. After some prodding, Turkish Foreign Minister Mevlut Cavusoglu said it would allow Iraqi Kurdish fighters to cross into Syria to help aid the efforts in Kobani. On Wednesday, reports of the attempted kidnapping of a high-profile Syrian commander in Turkey surfaced and, along with it, the sense that the Islamic State is taking root in another country.

Col. Steve Warren said it appears the wind caused the parachute to go off-course, and that the weapons in the bundle were not enough to make a difference.

In a video posted online Tuesday, the militant group said it captured the material, which was intended for Kurdish forces defending an embattled Syrian city near the Turkish border. ISIS claims some of the weapons and ammunition was air-dropped by mistake on its positions in Kobani.

The video showed the weapons seized included hand grenades, ammunition and rocket-propelled grenade launchers.

The airdrops, which happened on Sunday were the first of their kind and followed weeks of U.S. and coalition airstrikes in and near Kobani.

One bundle missed the drop zone and was destroyed, Pentagon officials told CBS News. A second had also missed the drop zone and was captured by ISIS. However the items in it make no real strategic difference to either side.

""One bundle worth of equipment is not enough equipment to give the enemy any type of advantage at all,"" said Col. Steve Warren, Pentagon press officer. ""This is stuff...that ISIS already has."" He said he has no reason to believe any of the other pallets went astray.

Turkish President Recep Tayyip Erdogan said the United States made a mistake in airdropping weapons to Kurdish fighters in Kobani earlier this week because some of the weapons ended up in IS hands.

""It turns out that what was done was wrong,"" he said, according to Turkey's private Dogan news agency.

The Turkish government is reluctant to aid the Syrian Kurdish forces - the People's Protection Units, or YPG - because it views them as an extension of the Kurdistan Workers' Party, or PKK, which has waged a 30-year insurgency in Turkey and is designated a terrorist group by the U.S. and NATO.

The caches were dropped to Kurds in embattled Kobani. Differences about how to defend Kobani have sparked tensions between Turkey and its NATO partners.

Turkey's decision to give Kurds passage to fight in Syria marked a shift in position, even though Ankara in recent years has built friendly ties with the leadership of the largely autonomous Iraqi Kurdish region.

Peshmerga spokesman Halgurd Hekmat in Irbil said there is still a lot of uncertainty on the details of the deployment, including how many forces will be sent and when.

""We're sending the peshmerga, not to become YPG but to fight alongside the YPG,"" Hekmat said. ""We will send the peshmerga to do their job for as long as they're needed and to come back after that.""

Hekmat said Iraqi forces will also provide weapons, but he did not say what kind.

Turkey is under pressure to take greater action against the ISIS militants - not only from the West but also from Kurds in Syria and Turkey who accuse Ankara of inaction while their people are slaughtered. Earlier this month across Turkey, widespread protests threatened to derail talks to end the PKK insurgency.

Sunni extremists of the Islamic State group, which has rampaged across Iraq and Syria, have been attacking Kobani for a month. The U.S. and its allies are assisting the Kurds with airstrikes targeting IS infrastructure in and around the town.

Meanwhile, Kurdish officials and doctors said they believed Islamic State militants had released some kind of toxic gas in a district in eastern Kobani.

Aysa Abdullah, a senior Kurdish official based in the town, said the attack took place late Tuesday, and that a number of people suffered symptoms that included dizziness and watery eyes. She and other officials said doctors lacked the equipment to determine what kinds of chemicals were used.

The reports could not be independently confirmed. Kurdish officials have made similar allegations before.

Also Wednesday, Syria's information minister said the country's air force destroyed two of three fighter jets seized and reportedly test-flown over Aleppo by the Islamic State group last week.

Omran al-Zoubi told Syrian TV late Tuesday that Syrian aircraft bombed the jets on the runway as they landed at Jarrah air base.

The Britain-based Syrian Observatory for Human Rights reported that IS militants flew three MiG fighter jets with the help of former Iraqi air force pilots who were now members of the militant group. The report could not be independently confirmed, and U.S. officials said they had no reports of the militants flying jets.

The group is known to have seized warplanes from at least one air base captured from the Syrian army in Raqqa province earlier this year.

U.S. military officials said the supplies might have gone astray because of the wind, and assured that they were not enough to cause any significant advantage to ISIS militants.

The Syrian Observatory for Human Rights, a Britain-based monitoring group, reported on Tuesday that ISIS had seized at least one cache of weapons airdropped by U.S.-led coalition forces.

Video footage released on Tuesday showed ISIS militants displaying a parachute and wooden crates full of grenades and rockets.

U.S. defense spokesman Army Lieutenant Colonel Steve Warren told reported on Wednesday two caches out of 28 had gone astray but the air force had managed to destroy one. The bundle that went off course and “probably fell into enemy hands,"" he said.

“One bundle worth of equipment is not enough equipment to give the enemy any type of advantage at all. It’s a relatively small amount of supplies. This is stuff [Isis] already has.”



Warren said dropping supplies from the air was “extraordinarily complex” and it was “very common” for wind to blow a bundle off its intended target.

“We still know that the vast majority of the resupply bundles that we dropped went to friendly forces and were received by friendly forces,” he said.



“There is always going to be some margin of error in these types of operations. We routinely overload these aircraft because we know some bundles may go astray.”

Washington has expanded its support to the Kurdish fighters in Kobane in the past week, ramping up air strikes and air dropping supplies from three C-130 cargo aircraft. The ammunition and medical items dropped by parachute were supplied by Kurdish authorities in Iraq, officials said.

ISIS has been trying to seize the town for more than a month now, causing the exodus of some 200,000 people from the area into Turkey. While Kurds are battling on the ground, a U.S.-led coalition is also targeting the militants from the air.

Turkey's president has said it was wrong for the United States to deliver military supplies to Kurdish fighters defending the Syrian city of Kobane after some of the weapons ended up in ISIS' hands.

The Pentagon claims the vast majority of the U.S. supplies dropped over the weekend had reached the Kurdish fighters despite an online video showing jihadists in possession of a bundle.

Tayyip Erdogan today said the mission had been a mistake - adding that he could not understand why the U.S. was so keen to defend Kobane as there were no longer any citizens in the city.

The weapons drop had been considered a highly sensitive subject for Turkey, who says the Kurdish fighter provided with American weapons are linked to the Kurdish People’s Protection Unit (YPG) – a group Ankara considers to be a terrorist organisation.

Error: Turkish president Tayyip Erdogan said it was wrong for the United States to deliver military supplies to Kurdish fighters defending the Syrian city of Kobane after some of the weapons ended up in ISIS' hands

A still from an Islamic State (ISIS) video, purportedly shows an IS militant displaying the content of a crate carrying grenades near the town of Ain al-Arab, known by the Kurds as Kobane, on the Syria-Turkey border

Speaking at a news conference in Ankara today, Erdogan described the weapons drop as a mistake.

'What was done here on this subject turned out to be wrong. Why did it turn out wrong? Because some of the weapons they dropped from those C130s were seized by ISIL,’ he said, using an alternative acronym for ISIS.

Asked about a plan for Turkey to facilitate the passage of Iraqi Kurdish peshmerga fighters to Kobane to help in its defence, Erdogan said he proposed this move in a telephone call with Barack Obama at the weekend.

'I have difficulty understanding why KobanE is so strategic for them because there are no civilians there, just around 2,000 fighters,' Erdogan said.

'At first they didn't say yes to peshmergas, but then they gave a partial yes and we said we would help.'

He added that talks were continuing among officials on the details of the peshmergas' transit through Turkey.

One Turkish journalist close to the government said on Wednesday some 500 of them were expected to cross into Kobani this weekend

A U.S. military airdrop of weapons meant for Kurdish fighters fell into the hands of their jihadist foes near the Syrian battleground town of Kobane, the Syrian Observatory for Human Rights said

Earlier, the US Defense Department said is investigating video footage appearing to show Islamic State fanatics with at least one cache of weapons airdropped by coalition forces that was meant for Kurdish militiamen battling the extremist group in a border town.

The cache of weapons included hand grenades, ammunition and rocket-propelled grenade launchers, according to a video uploaded by a media group loyal to the Islamic State (ISIS) group.

The video appeared authentic and corresponded to The Associated Press' reporting of the event.

The Britain-based Syrian Observatory for Human Rights, which bases its information on a network of activists on the ground, said the militants had seized at least one cache.

The caches were airdropped early Monday to Kurds in the embattled Syrian town of Kobane that lies near the Turkish border.

The militant group has been trying to seize the town for over a month now, causing the exodus of some 200,000 people from the area into Turkey. While Kurds are battling on the ground, a U.S.-led coalition is also targeting the militants from the air.

Yesterday ISIS loyalists on social media posted sarcastic thank you notes to the United States, including one image that said 'Team USA.'

But the lost weapons drop was more an embarrassment than a great strategic loss.

The Islamic State militants already possess millions of dollars-worth of U.S. weaponry that they captured from fleeing Iraqi soldiers when the group seized swaths of Iraq in a sudden sweep in June.

On Tuesday, the U.S. Central Command said U.S. military forces conducted four airstrikes near Kobani that destroyed IS fighting positions, an IS building and a large IS unit.

Also Tuesday, Syrian government airstrikes hit a rebel-held town along the country's southern border with Jordan, killing at least eight people.

Activists with the Local Coordination Committees and the Observatory said the number of those killed was likely to rise as there are more victims under the rubble.

The LCC said Syrian government planes dropped crude explosives-laden canisters on the town of Nasib on the Syria-Jordan border.

The airstrikes are part of battles between Syrian government forces and Islamic rebel groups for control of the area."

Earlier on Tuesday, the militant group released a video showing a cache of weapons, apparently dropped by the U.S., in their possession.

“They are certainly of the kinds of material that was dropped,” Pentagon spokesperson Rear Admiral John Kirby said on Tuesday, referring to the weapons showed in the ISIS video. “We’re taking a look at this…and when we have something definitive that we can provide in terms of an assessment on that, we'll do that.”

Kirby, however, added that he is “very confident” that most of the airdropped weapons had reached the Kurds battling the Islamic State group in Kobani. “In fact, we're only aware of one bundle that did not,” Kirby said.

The video released by the Islamic State group shows a large consignment of packages containing hand grenades and rounds for small rockets wrapped in clear plastic attached to parachute cords. The Syrian Observatory for Human Rights also confirmed that ISIS had seized at least one cache of weapons meant for the Kurds, according to media reports.

The U.S. military had delivered nearly 30 packages containing weapons, ammunition and medical supplies on Sunday, in an attempt to “enable continued resistance against ISIL's attempts to overtake Kobani,” according to a statement by the United States Central Command, or CENTCOM, released Sunday.

Redur Xelil, a spokesperson for the YPG, a Kurdish militia, had confirmed on Monday that Kurdish fighters had received the weapons, and said that they would “help greatly” in the battle against the Islamic State group in Kobani, according to an Al Jazeera report.

The situation in the Syrian border town, meanwhile, continues to remain “tenuous,” Kirby said on Tuesday.

“We do assess that Kurdish forces in the city are in control of the majority of the city. I would hesitate to put a number figure on that, but we do believe that they are in possession of the majority of it,” he said, adding that the U.S.-led coalition had continued to conduct airstrikes in the region."

The Pentagon admitted on Wednesday that one of the airdrops of weapons intended for Kurds in the besieged Syrian town of Kobani almost certainly ended up in the hands of the Islamic State (Isis) fighters.

The Pentagon blamed the wind for possibly blowing the supplies off course and argued that one cache was not enough to make a significant difference to Isis.

Video footage released by Isis shows what appears to be one of its fighters in desert scrubland with a stack of boxes attached to a parachute. The boxes are opened to show an array of weapons, some rusty, some new. A canister is broken out to reveal a hand grenade. Other equipment appeared to be parts for rocket-propelled grenades.

The Pentagon said the pallet of weapons was one of 28 dropped, not six as previously reported.

US defence spokesman Army Lieutenant Colonel Steve Warren said: “One bundle worth of equipment is not enough equipment to give the enemy any type of advantage at all. It’s a relatively small amount of supplies. This is stuff [Isis] already has.”

The Pentagon cleared up some confusion about a cache going astray on Sunday that had subsequently been destroyed in a US strike, once it had been realised it was in danger of falling into Isis hands.

Warren said two caches had gone astray but the air force had managed to destroy one. A steady stream of US-supplied weapons are being lost to Isis forces, mainly from the dysfunctional Iraqi army. Isis is reported to have stolen seven American M1 Abrams tanks from three Iraqi army bases in Anbar province last week.

A spokesman for the Pentagon, Rear Admiral John Kirby, told reporters that analysts at Centcom headquarters in Tampa, Florida, were examining the video. “We’re still taking a look at it and assessing the validity of it,” he said. “So I honestly don’t know if that [box] was one of the ones dropped.” he said.

Turkey’s president, Recep Tayyip Erdoğan, criticised the airdrops strategy, saying it was “wrong” that weapons had fallen into the hands of Isis, as well as the Kurdish fighters they were intended for.

Turkey’s government sees the fighters as part of the Syrian arm of the Kurdistan Workers Party (PKK), a faction that has battled for self-rule in Turkey for over three decades.

“It has become clear that [the airdrops are] wrong,” Erdoğan told reporters in Ankara. “It’s impossible to achieve results with such an operation,” he added.

In an abrupt shift, Turkey agreed on Monday to allow Iraqi Kurdish fighters to cross its territory and reinforce fellow Kurds in the besieged town of Kobani, but did not comment on whether it backed the airdrops.

The US has dropped munitions, supplied by Kurdish authorities in the semi-autonomous region of northern Iraq, to their compatriots in Kobani, which sits close to the Iraqi-Turkish border; Isis fighters have encircled much of the town.

Kirby confirmed the weapons shown in the video were the kind that were dropped. “So it’s not out of the realm of the possibility in that regard,” he said.

“I do want to add, though, that we are very confident that the vast majority of the bundles did end up in the right hands. In fact, we’re only aware of one bundle that did not.”

The airdrops were carried out by three C-130 planes. The video shows a man in camouflage clothes and balaclava looking through the boxes of munitions. He says they were dropped by US forces and had been intended for the Kurds. He described them as the spoils of war.

As well as grenades, the boxes appeared to contain parts for rocket-propelled grenades. Some of the equipment appears to be east European in origin, which might seem odd given the weapons were dropped by Americans, but the munitions were supplied by the Kurdish authorities who had been stocking up.

Kirby said that the situation in Kobani remained tense, with Kurdish forces in control of most of the city. The US-led coalition has mounted more than 130 air strikes round the town in an effort to stop Isis taking complete control.

While the US has carried out air strikes in Kobani, cloud cover last week prevented them hitting much of the rest of Iraq, particularly around the contested Mosul dam. If the dam was to fall to Isis it would provide huge leverage for the group.

The Britain-based Syrian Observatory for Human Rights said the militants seized at least once cache, but may have seized more, the Associated Press reported.

The cache of weapons included hand grenades, ammunition and rocket-propelled grenade launchers, according to a video uploaded by a media group loyal to ISIS, the agency said.

The video appeared authentic and corresponded to The Associated Press' reporting of the event.

The Observatory, which bases its information on a network of activists on the ground, said the caches were airdropped early Monday to Kurds in the embattled Syrian town of Kobane that lies near the Turkish border.

The militant group has been trying to seize the town for more than a month now, causing the exodus of some 200,000 people from the area into Turkey. While Kurds are battling on the ground, a U.S.-led coalition is also targeting the militants from the air.

On Tuesday, ISIS loyalists on social media posted sarcastic thank you notes to the United States, including one image that said, “Team USA.”

But the badly-aimed weapons drop was more an embarrassment than a great strategic loss. The ISIS militants already possess millions of dollars-worth of U.S. weaponry that they captured from fleeing Iraqi soldiers when the group seized swaths of Iraq in a sudden sweep in June.

Also Tuesday, Syrian government airstrikes hit a rebel-held town along the country's southern border with Jordan, killing at least eight people on Tuesday.

Activists with the Local Coordination Committees (LCC) and the Britain-based Observatory said the number of those killed was likely to rise as there are more victims under the rubble.

The LCC said Syrian government planes dropped crude explosives-laden canisters on the town of Nasib on the Syria-Jordan border.

The air strikes are part of battles between Syrian government forces and Islamist rebel groups for control of the area.

Syrian government forces have been heavily bombing rebel areas in recent weeks, while the U.S-led coalition has been conducting air strikes against ISIS militants elsewhere in Syria.

Despite these objections, the United States eventually sent military aid to the Free Syrian Army last year. The policy change was precipitated by Syrian dictator Bashar Assad's violation of the Obama administration's ""red line"" after the regime used chemical weapons against civilians.

Last month, with the rise of ISIS in mind, Congress approved the president's plan to to train and arm the Syrian rebels. There was some familiar dissent at the time. ""How will we ensure that the United States weapons we are providing to Syrian rebels will not get into the wrong hands, as they did with the rebels we supported in Libya?""

An army officer, speaking anonymously, said the militants tried to enter the town of Damboa late on Sunday through Alagarno, a Boko Haram hideout, but that soldiers had fought them off.

""Our men gunned down 25 of the insurgents because they would have entered Damboa and unleashed more terror on the town that is just picking up from its ruins,"" the officer said.

Damboa, near the border with Cameroon, has been the site of fierce fighting between the militants and Nigerian forces for months. The insurgents sacked the town in July but were driven out by a military counter-offensive.

Ceasefire 'incomplete'

The Borno Elders Forum, made up of retired Nigerian civilian and military officials from the Borno state, said attacks in recent days indicated that not all Boko Haram fighters were aware of the deal.

""I don't think they would continue attacking innocent people if they are aware and they are in agreement that there is a ceasefire,"" said spokesman Bulama Mali Gubio.

The Borno Elders Forum, which last month warned that Boko Haram was preparing preparing to take over key sites in Borno, suggested the government had not negotiated with the entire group.

""If the federal government does not know who the real Boko Haram is, I think they should come here to find out from us,"" Gubio said.

""The real Boko Haram who are killing us, who are burning our towns and villages, are not the Boko Haram that a peace deal was reached with.""

The government claimed a deal was reached after talks in Chad, which included provisions for the release of more than 200 schoolgirls kidnapped from the Borno town of Chibok in April.

LAGOS, Nigeria — More than 200 missing schoolgirls kidnapped by the Islamic extremist group Boko Haram may be released as part of an immediate cease-fire agreement with Nigerian officials, the government said Friday.

""The insurgents have assured the government that all those in their captivity, including the missing Chibok girls, are well and alive,"" Mike Omeri, the government spokesman, said in a statement. ""They have also promised to release them without attaching any condition.""

Officials said the girls could be freed next week.

Omeri said talks with the insurgents focused on ending violence in northeastern Nigeria, where Boko Haram is based, and releasing other captives held by the group, in addition to the schoolgirls. ""The terrorists indicated their willingness to discuss and resolve all associated issues during the discussion.""

Boko Haram, which means ""Western education is forbidden,"" kidnapped 276 girls in Chibok in April, according to the Nigerian government, which said that several dozen had subsequently escaped.

Nigerian presidential aide Hassan Tukur told CNN, ""We have agreed on the release of the Chibok schoolgirls, and we expect to conclude on that at our next meeting with the group's representative next week in Chad.""

The girls' abduction has drawn global attention, including an international social media campaign — #BringBackOurGirls — that has pushed for their release.

""Boko Haram issued the ceasefire as a result of the discussions we have been having with them,"" said Hassan Tukur, who represented the Nigerian government at talks with the militant organization in neighboring Chad. ""They have agreed to release the Chibok girls.""

The girls have been missing for the past six months, despite international efforts mobilized by the Twitter hashtag campaign #BringBackOurGirls to rescue them from captivity. France, Great Britain and the United States have helped with the search for the girls, while China, Israel and other nations have also provided various forms of assistance.

Nearly 300 girls were kidnapped from a boarding school in the northeastern town of Chibok on April 14, but dozens managed to subsequently escape. Nigerian President Goodluck Jonathan has been criticized by the girls' families for responding slowly to their abduction.

Brutal war in Nigeria's north

Boko Haram, whose name roughly translates to ""Western education is sacrilege,"" seeks to impose a strict interpretation of Shariah law in northern Nigeria. During its early years, the Sunni militant group engaged in isolated skirmishes with Nigerian security forces. But after a bloody government crackdown in 2009, Boko Haram launched a broad insurgency. Last summer, Boko Haram leader Abubakar Shekau declared a caliphate in the areas under the control of his forces.

Boko Haram's insurgency has been characterized by a brutal campaign of bombings and shootings targeting Christian churches, Muslim mosques, schools, markets, bars, villages, police stations and even a UN building. An estimated 5,000 Nigerians have been killed and a further 300,000 displaced by the violence.

In 2013, the Nigerian government declared a state of emergency in the northeastern states of Borno, Yobe and Adamawa. Amnesty International has accused the Nigerian military of war crimes, including extrajudicial killings, in its fight against Boko Haram. The United Nations and Human Rights Watch have also alleged that Nigeria's security forces have committed human rights abuses.

Nigeria's population of 177 million people is 50 percent Muslim and 40 percent Christian. Muslims are concentrated in the north and Christians in the south. The remaining 10 percent of the population practices indigenous beliefs.

Their release is part of a ceasefire deal agreed between the militants and the Nigerian authorities at three days of secret talks, reportedly held in Saudi Arabia and mediated by Chad.

Air Chief Marshal Alex Badeh, the head of Nigeria’s military forces, announced last night: “I wish to inform this audience that a ceasefire agreement has been concluded.”

Mike Omeri, a government official, confirmed that the deal included the release of the girls and other people held prisoner by the group. Boko Haram has, he said, given them assurances “that the schoolgirls and all other people in their captivity are all alive and well”.

Rock Star tweeted: 'Join The Movement'

Last night it was not clear what concessions had been made on behalf of the government of President Goodluck Jonathan to secure the release of the Chibok schoolgirls. Marshal Badeh is already reported to have issued an order to his forces to “comply with the ceasefire agreement between Nigeria and Boko Haram in all theatres of operations”.

Danladi Ahmadu, the self-proclaimed “secretary-general” of Boko Haram, which has wreaked five years of havoc in Nigeria, told the Voice of America website that a ceasefire agreement had been reached.

A Nigerian presidential aide, Hassan Tukur, was quoted by the BBC as saying Boko Haram had announced a unilateral ceasefire and the government had responded. “They’ve assured us they have the girls and they will release them,” he said. “I am cautiously optimistic.”

Both domestically and internationally, President Jonathan has been pilloried for his sluggish response to the kidnapping, and for his seeming inability to quell the violence from the Islamist militants who control swathes of Nigeria’s north-east.

This week a group of British politicians and a general called for the UK to help Nigeria fight the militants.

Boko Haram has killed thousands of people in its attempt to create an Islamic caliphate. It has indiscriminately targeted civilians, bombing markets, bus stations, government buildings, churches and even mosques.

A senior Nigerian security source confirmed the existence of the talks, but told Reuters it was unclear whether the negotiations were taking place between Boko Haram’s self-proclaimed leader, Abubakar Shekau, or other factions within the group. “Commitment among parts of Boko Haram and the military does appear to be genuine. It is worth taking seriously,” the source said.

Several rounds of negotiations with Boko Haram have been attempted in recent years but they have never achieved a peace deal, partly because the group has so many different factions. “There are some talks but it depends on the buy-in of the whole group. I would be surprised if Shekau had suddenly changed his mind and is ready for a ceasefire,” the source added.

The Nigerian military said Shekau was killed in August 2013. But earlier this month a video was released purportedly showing Shekau dismissing rumours of his demise.

Even as the supposed ceasefire emerged last night, it was claimed that eight Cameroon soldiers and 107 Boko Haram militants had been killed in fierce fighting in the far north of Cameroon yesterday."

ISIS fighters are being trained to fly three captured fighter jets at an air base in Syria, observers claimed yesterday.

The reported flights are believed to be the first time the militant group has taken to the air and raises the possibility of attacks on British, US and French targets in neighbouring Iraq.

Rami Abdulrahman, who runs the UK-based Syrian Observatory for Human Rights, said the militants were flying the planes on ‘short flight’ training at the al-Jarrah military airport east of the city of Aleppo, where the group has a major base.

Fighter: It is not clear if ISIS' jets are equipped with weaponry nor if the pilots are able to fly long distances, but witnesses said the planes appear to have been seized from the Syrian Air Force (pictured)

Power: ISIS has been steadily building a full-equipped military - including large tanks, such as the one pictured here in Raqqa). Much of the equipment in their possession has been seized from Syrian regime forces

Show of strength: ISIS militants take part in a military parade along the streets of Raqqa earlier this year

‘They have trainers, Iraqi officers who were pilots before for (former Iraqi president) Saddam Hussein,’ Mr Abdulrahman said.

‘People saw the flights, they went up many times from the airport and they are flying in the skies outside the airport and coming back,’ he added, citing witnesses in northern Aleppo province near the base, which is 45 miles south of Turkey.

It was not clear if the jets were equipped with weaponry or whether the pilots could fly longer distances. Witnesses near the base in northern Syria said the jets appeared to be decades old MiG21 or MiG23 models captured from the Syrian military.

Twitter accounts linked to ISIS, also known as ISIL and Islamic State, had previously posted pictures of captured jets in other parts of Syria, but the aircraft had appeared unusable, according to analysts and diplomats.

The group has captured several major military airfields, including the vast Tabqa complex, close to their headquarters in the Syrian city of Raqqa and seized aircraft, helicopters and heavy weapons.

The base was reportedly one of the Syrian military’s largest facilities in the region, with several warplane squadrons, helicopters, tanks, artillery and ammunition.

Defence analysts say that it unlikely the group's MiGs could be used conventionally as the US-led coalition of Syrian forces would shoot them down.

Leader: News of ISIS' test flights comes as Al Qaeda - which has previously condemned ISIS for being too brutal - ostensibly sought to repair ties with the group led by Abu Bakr al-Baghdadi (pictured)

Declaration: Titled 'Statement on the Crusader Coalition', the document is Al Qaeda's strongest show of support for ISIS since leader Ayman al-Zawahiri denounced the group for the brutal tactics late last year

'WE'VE REDUCED ISIS TO JUST TWO POCKETS', BOAST KOBANE KURDS Islamic State militants have been almost entirely driven out of the Syrian city of Kobane after a fightback by Kurdish forces, who vowed to either defeat the terrorists or die trying. The extremists have abandoned all their positions in the city except two small pockets of resistance in the east, Kurdish commander Baharin Kandal said. As recently as Monday it looked as if the fall of Kobane was imminent. The massively outgunned Kurdish fighters had been pushed back ever closer to the city centre by ISIS militants advancing into the suburbs, leaving hundreds of mainly elderly residents facing rape and massacre. But with the help of the most intense U.S. and Arab bombing raids of the anti-ISIS campaign so far, the Kurdish forces have been able to kill hundreds of militants over the past two days. They have also managed to force the militants have not been killed to retreat further into the outskirts of the town. News that ISIS have been almost entirely forced out of Kobane comes after two days of heavy air strikes by U.S. warplanes.

Instead, they could be deployed for spectacular low-level suicide attacks on western targets in the Kurdish city or Irbil or the Iraqi capital Baghdad where the US and Britain have a major presence.

The U.S. military said yesterday it was unaware of any flight operations by the group ‘in Syria or elsewhere’.

‘We’re not aware of ISIL (IS) conducting any flight operations in Syria or elsewhere,’ said Central Command spokesman Colonel Patrick Ryder.

‘We continue to keep a close eye on ISIL activity in Syria and Iraq and will continue to conduct strikes against their equipment, facilities, fighters and centres of gravity, wherever they may be,’ he added.

Meanwhile Kurdish forces, backed by US-led air strikes, are said to be continuing to make gains in their fight with militants in the key northern Syrian town of Kobani.

US-led warplanes again struck militants' positions yesterday, taking advantage of new coordination with the town’s Kurdish defenders, who are identifying targets.

Kurdish commander Baharin Kandal claimed the extremists have abandoned all of their positions in the town, except for two small pockets of resistance in the east.

As recently as Monday it looked as if the fall of Kobani was imminent, with the massively outgunned Kurdish fighters pushed back ever closer to the city centre by ISIS militants advancing into the suburbs, leaving hundreds of mainly elderly residents fearing rape and massacre.

Advance: The Islamic State and its allied Sunni militants seized the Anbar city of Fallujah, parts of Ramadi and large rural areas of Anbar early this year

Checkpoint: Earlier today, Iraqi officials in the western Anbar province said a curfew has been imposed in the provincial capital Ramadi (pictured) over fears that the Islamic State group might try to advance on the city

Security: ISIS has been making gains around Ramadi in recent weeks against the embattled Iraqi military, despite ongoing U.S.-led coalition airstrikes on the militants

Activists say more than 600 people have been killed since the jihadist group launched its assault on the mainly Kurdish town a month ago.

Capturing the town would give the jihadists unbroken control of a massive stretch of the Syrian-Turkish border.

Despite their gains, Kurdish leaders say Kobani cannot survive long-term without arms and ammunition reaching the defenders.

Claims of Kurdish successes in Kobani came as the new UN human rights commissioner, Zeid Ra’ad al Hussein, described ISIS as the antithesis of human rights and ‘a diabolical, potentially genocidal movement’.

‘The way it has spread its tentacles into other countries, employing social media and the internet to brainwash and recruit people from across the globe, reveals it to be the product of a perverse and lethal marriage of a new form of nihilism with the digital age,’ he added."

The planes, which are believed to be MiG-21 and MiG-23 jets, are capable of flying although it is unclear if they are equipped with missiles, according to the Syrian Observatory for Human Rights.

The jets were seized from Syrian military airports now under IS control in the northern provinces of Aleppo and Raqa, according to the Britain-based group, which has a wide network of sources inside the war-torn country.

It said that former Iraqi army officers who once served under Saddam were supervising the training at the military airport of Jarrah, east of the city of Aleppo.

Witnesses have reported seeing planes flying at a low altitude to avoid detection by radar after taking off from Jarrah.

It comes as the US and its allies carry out a wave of air strikes on IS positions in Syria and Iraq.

The jihadists also control two other airports in Syria — Albu Kamal near the Iraqi border and Tabqa in Raqa province.

IS has captured large parts of Syria and Iraq, committing atrocities and declaring an Islamic “caliphate”.

After the US-led invasion of Iraq in 2003, some Sunni former officers from Saddam’s army joined the ranks of the Islamic State of Iraq, a branch of al-Qaeda which later became IS.

Meanwhile, sniper and mortar fire from jihadists are preventing authorities from evacuating civilians caught up in the battle for the Syrian border town of Kobane, a local official says.

At the same time, Kobane district chief Anwar Muslim, said US-led air strikes had destroyed many Islamic State group vehicles and artillery pieces, and that the town’s defenders are reinforcing their positions.

“There are civilians trapped in the centre and south of town, whom we cannot evacuate because of snipers and mortar fire,” Mr Muslim told AFP on Friday.

“Their situation is difficult.”

There are no precise figures on how many non-combatants remain in Kobane, also known as Ain al-Arab.

Last week, the United Nations spoke of as many as 700, mostly elderly, civilians being trapped in the centre of the town. Another 10,000-13,000 were said to be gathered near the Turkish border.

For its part, the Britain-based Syrian Observatory for Human Rights says there are hundreds of civilians in the centre and west of town and that many of them refuse to leave, preferring to die than go into exile.

The IS jihadists, who have seized swathes of Syria and neighbouring Iraq and declared a “caliphate,” first attacked Kobane on September 16 in a bid to seal their control of a long stretch on the Syrian side of the border.

They succeeded in taking nearly half the town before its defenders, aided by US-led air strikes, began pushing them back.

Describing the situation on Friday, Muslim said “you can see their bodies (IS jihadists) in the streets ... Our forces are reinforcing their defensive positions.”

The IS fighters are “mostly in the east and south, and have hidden their Hummers, artillery and tanks among the houses so as not to be targeted by the air strikes.”

He saluted what he called the “incredible resistance” of Kobane’s defenders, adding that the situation is still dangerous and that there is “no other choice but to resist.”"	Saddam Hussein’s pilots training Islamic State group	2014-10-17 14:19:00+00:00	['Afp', 'Network Writers']	['islamic', 'husseins', 'group', 'iraq', 'air', 'civilians', 'training', 'town', 'pilots', 'kobane', 'syrian', 'state', 'jihadists', 'saddam', 'syria']	"ISLAMIC State group jihadists are being trained by Saddam Hussein’s former pilots to fly three fighter jets captured from the Syrian military, a monitoring group says.

BEIRUT (Reuters) – Iraqi pilots who have joined Islamic State in Syria are training members of the group to fly in three captured fighter jets, a group monitoring the war said on Friday, saying it was the first time the militant group had taken to the air.

The group, which has seized swathes of land in Syria and Iraq, has been flying the planes over the captured al-Jarrah military airport east of Aleppo, said Rami Abdulrahman, who runs the Britain-based Syrian Observatory for Human Rights.

Reuters was not immediately able to verify the report and U.S. Central Command said it was not aware of Islamic State flying jets in Syria.

U.S-led forces are bombing Islamic State bases in Syria and Iraq. The group has regularly used weaponry captured from the Syrian and Iraqi armies and has overrun several military bases but, if the report is confirmed, this would be the first time it has been able to pilot warplanes.

""They have trainers, Iraqi officers who were pilots before for (former Iraqi president) Saddam Hussein,"" Abdulrahman said.

""People saw the flights, they went up many times from the airport and they are flying in the skies outside the airport and coming back,"" he said, citing witnesses in northern Aleppo province near the base, which is 70 km (45 miles) south of the Turkish border.

Witnesses reported the flights were at a low altitude and only lasted five to 10 minutes before landing, the Observatory said. It was not possible to reach the Syrian government for comment and state media did not mention the report.

It was not clear whether the jets were equipped with weaponry or whether the pilots could fly longer distances in the planes, which witnesses said appeared to be MiG 21 or MiG 23 models captured from the Syrian military.

U.S. MILITARY KEEPING ""CLOSE EYE""

""We're not aware of ISIL conducting any flight operations in Syria or elsewhere,"" U.S. Central Command spokesman Colonel Patrick Ryder said, using a former name for Islamic State.

""We continue to keep a close eye on (Islamic State) activity in Syria and Iraq and will continue to conduct strikes against their equipment, facilities, fighters and centres of gravity, wherever they may be.""

General Lloyd Austin, head of the U.S. military’s Central Command, said he could not confirm that Iraqi pilots had joined Islamic State.

""We don’t have any operational reporting of ISIL flying jets in support of ISIL activity on the ground and so I cannot confirm that. And to the degree that pilots may have defected and joined the ranks of ISIL, I don’t have any information on that either,"" he told a Pentagon news briefing.

Pro-Islamic State Twitter accounts have previously posted pictures of captured jets in other parts of Syria but the aircraft appeared unusable, according to political analysts and diplomats.

The countryside east of Aleppo city is one of the main bases of Islamic State in Syria. The al Qaeda offshoot controls up to a third of the territory of Syria, whose civil war pitting various rebel groups against the regime of President Bashar al-Assad has raged for more than three years.

Members of a German motorcycle gang have arrived in the besieged Syrian city of Kobane to fight against Islamic State militants who have been attacking the city for the past four weeks.

Leaders of the Cologne-based Median Empire Motorcycle Club, which has strong Kurdish links, have posted images of their riders posing in the city - some of them carrying weapons.

The news comes just after three members of a notorious motorcycle gang from the Netherlands were told they had not committed any crime by travelling to Kobane to join the fight against ISIS.

Leaders of the Cologne-based Median Empire Motorcycle Club, which has strong Kurdish links, have posted images of their riders posing in the besieged Syrian city of Kobane. They are there fighting ISIS terrorists

Images of the Median Empire Motorcycle Club emerged on the group's Facebook page, and showed the heavily tattooed riders with rifles slung over the shoulders.

In a shot of the Germans huddled together, the gang's logo - a sinister looking white face on a black background - could clearly be seen on their leather vests.

The image was captioned: 'Our boys were in Kobane today and told me today they were shot at but nothing happened. They are okay.'

Four days earlier, the same Facebook user wrote: 'While others blabber and blabber, our boys are at the front fighting.'

The gang's official Facebook page says the riders have travelled to the Middle East to distribute aid, and several images show them handing out food to Yazidis in what looks like a refugee camp.

Defence: A biker from the No Surrender gang in the Netherlands, identified only as Ron (right) poses alongside a Kurdish soldier in Syria after going to fight against ISIS

Elsewhere of their Facebook page, the Median Empire Motorcycle Club praise the notorious Netherlands based No Surrender gang, three members of which have also travelled to fight in Kobane, according to its leader Klaas Otto.

Last week a Dutch prosecutor told the members that they will not be prosecuted for going to fight abroad, because such actions are only illegal if you are fighting troops from the Netherlands.

Public prosecutor spokesman Wim de Bruin said: 'Joining a foreign armed force was previously punishable, now it's no longer forbidden. You just can't join a fight against the Netherlands.'

While several countries including Britain have taken steps to stop their citizens joining ISIS, joining the Kurds is generally permissible because they are not considered a terrorist organisation.

However, anyone going to fight ISIS would be banned from joining the Kurdistan Workers' Party, who run several of the brigades fighting ISIS, because they are considered to be terrorists.

Blast: A US-led airstrike on a Syrian gas facility in Kobane killed at least eight people this afternoon. It had been held by militants from the Islamic State terror group, who expert Justin Bronk believes has made fatal errors in its attempt to capture the city

Fire: Flames rise over an ISIS-held building inside Kobane following American and Arab airstrike this evening

Dutch citizens fighting on the Kurdish side would of course be liable to prosecution if they committed crimes such as torture or rape, De Bruin said.

'But this is also happening a long way away and so it'll be very difficult to prove,' he added.

Video footage apparently from a Kurdish broadcaster shows an armed European man with Kurdish fighters saying in Dutch: 'The Kurds have been under pressure for a long time.'

There are estimated to be around 70,000 Kurds living in the Netherlands, most of whom are political refugees who fled from Turkey and the Middle East looking for work.

An ISIS propaganda video released last week featured a German militant who threatened any Western soldier who travels to fight in Syria.

Identified as Abu Dauoud al-Almani steps in front of the camera and speaks in German, subtitled in English.

Al-Amani claimed the video is being shot in the Syrian town of Dabiq and urges Western nations to send their armies to fight ISIS because 'We have been waiting for you for over 1,400 years.'

He also urges his fellow Muslims in Germany, Austria and Switzerland to join ISIS.

Al-Almani is far from the first German citizen to embrace radical Islam.

Former rapper Denis Cuspert spent several years as a major player in the Berlin hip hop scene under the name Deso Dogg before embracing radical Islam and travelling join ISIS in Syria.

It is understood Cusbert now calls himself Abu Talha al-Almani and leads a unit of German-speaking ISIS terrorists operating under the name 'The German Brigade of Millatu Ibrahim'.

It is not known whether Abu Dauoud al-Almani is a member of Cuspert's militant unit."

Islamic State militants have publicly crucified and murdered a teenager they accused of taking photographs of the terror group's headquarters in Syria.

Sickening images purportedly taken in the central square of the extremists' de facto capital Raqqa show the battered and bloodstained body of an unnamed 17-year-old boy strapped to a cross.

A handwritten placard hangs around the teenager's neck, accusing him of 'apostasy' - the abandonment of his religion - and says he had been crucified for three days after being caught receiving 500 Turkish lira for every photograph he took of an Islamic State military base.

Sickening: Images purportedly taken in the central square of the extremists' de facto capital Raqqa show the battered and bloodstained body of an unnamed 17-year-old boy strapped to a cross

The image of the murdered teenager appeared on a social media account of an activist group known as Raqqa is Being Slaughtered Silently.

The group is made up of a handful of incredibly brave individuals who oppose ISIS and - despite the city being the group's de facto, the centre of its leadership and full of bloodthirsty religious police - attempt to document the violence the terrorists group has brought to their hometown.

The image has been circulated on Twitter both by anti-ISIS campaigners and by ISIS supporters, who sickeningly trumpet it as a positive example of the group's brutal interpretation of Islam.

Charlie Winter, programs officer at counter-extremism think tank the Quilliam Foundation, said crucifixion is a prescribed punishment meted out by Isis for specific crimes.

'Crucifixion has been used many times before – it's an age-old punishment dealt out to people who have committed treason,' he told The Independent.

Horror: Raqqa's central square has been bathed in blood since the terror group fully seized control of the city earlier in the year

The Islamic State's use of crucifixion as a punishment stems from its fundamentalist interpretation of Verse 33 of the fifth book of the Koran.

The verse reads: 'Indeed, the penalty for those who wage war against Allah and His Messenger and strive upon earth [to cause] corruption is none but that they be killed or crucified or that their hands and feet be cut off from opposite sides or that they be exiled from the land.'

'That is for them a disgrace in this world; and for them in the Hereafter is a great punishment.'

Despite this, ISIS chooses to ignore the next passage which emphasises forgiveness and removes the imperative to use such a punishment, saying: 'Except for those who return [repenting] before you apprehend them. And know that Allah is Forgiving and Merciful.'

Raqqa's central square has been bathed in blood since the terror group fully seized control of the city earlier in the year.

Severed heads are regularly displayed impaled on spikes surrounding a small patch of grass in the square, and there are a number of wooden and metal crosses standing ready for the next execution."

The extremists have abandoned all of their positions in the city, except for two small pockets of resistance in the east of the city, Kurdish commander Baharin Kandal said.

As recently as Monday it looked as if the fall of Kobane was imminent, with the massively outgunned Kurdish fighters pushed back ever closer to the city centre by ISIS militants advancing into the suburbs, leaving hundreds of mainly elderly residents facing rape and massacre.

But with the help of the most intense U.S. and Arab bombing raids of the anti-ISIS campaign so far, the Kurdish forces have been able to kill hundreds of militants over the past two days and force those remaining back into the outskirts of the town.

News that ISIS have been almost entirely forced out of Kobane comes after two days of heavy air strikes by U.S. warplanes.

Turkish and U.S. officials last week said that ISIS was on the verge of taking Kobane from its heavily outgunned Kurdish defenders after seizing strategic points deep inside the town.

But as the tempo of coalition air strikes increased over the past few days, amid claims the warplanes were coordinating the raids with Kurdish fighters on the ground, ISIS's advances dramatically slowed.

The militants were eventually forced to flee from almost all of their locations in the south and west of the city, including the strategic Tal Shair hill, as well as abandoning a number of key buildings and neighbourhoods in the east.

Despite their gains, Kurdish leaders say Kobane cannot survive long-term without arms and ammunition reaching the defenders, something Turkey - which lies just 200 yards to the city's north - has so far refused to allow.

The news comes as the new UN human rights commissioner, Zeid Ra'ad al Hussein, described ISIS as the antithesis of human rights and 'a diabolical, potentially genocidal movement'.

'The way it has spread its tentacles into other countries, employing social media and the internet to brainwash and recruit people from across the globe, reveals it to be the product of a perverse and lethal marriage of a new form of nihilism with the digital age,' he added.

BRITISH DEATH TOLL IN SYRIA HITS 24 BUT EXPERTS BELIEVE WOULD-BE JIHADISTS ARE STILL NOT PUT OFF TRAVELLING TO THE REGION As many as 30 Britons may now have died fighting for terror groups in Syria, it was reported on Wednesday night. Researchers believe 24 jihadists have been killed fighting with Islamic State and other groups but think the true figure is higher. Hundreds, and possibly thousands, of Britons are believed to have fled to Syria and Iraq to join radical Islamic groups such as Islamic State (ISIS) and the Al Qaeda affiliated Jabhat al-Nusra. But despite the deaths and the mounting political pressure on extremist groups both at home and abroad, there remains little consensus on how prevent radicalisation of more British nationals. Shiraz Maher of the International Centre for the Study of Radicalisation at King's College London said death reports were rising but it remain hard to verify.

Activists say more than 600 people have been killed since the jihadist group launched its assault on Kobane a month ago. Meanwhile more than 160,000 people have fled the mainly Kurdish town.

Yesterday the U.S. State Department revealed that one of its officials has held direct talks with a Syrian Kurdish group involved in the fight against ISIS. It is the first time such talks have taken place.

Earlier a Kurdish spokesmen said their forces had been providing American warplanes with the precise coordinates of the militants' positions in and around Kobane.

ISIS has been keen to take Kobane to consolidate its position in northern Syria after seizing vast swathes of territory both there and in Iraq. A defeat in Kobane would be a major setback for ISIS.

Heavy and light weapons fire were audible from across the border in Turkey yesterday afternoon, with one stray mortar hitting Turkish soil close to abandoned tents.

Turkish security forces moved civilians and media away from hills overlooking Kobane as the fighting raged.

Six air strikes hit eastern Kobane and there was fierce fighting between Kurdish and Islamist fighters overnight on Wednesday, but neither side made significant gains, according to the British-based Syrian Observatory for Human Rights.

Kurdish fighters later managed to seize a street in Kobane that had been held by militants, it added.

A journalist inside Kobane said air strikes had allowed Kurdish forces to go on the offensive for the first time since Islamic State launched their assault four weeks ago.

'We walked past some (YPG) positions in the east yesterday that were held by IS only two days ago,' Abdulrahman Gok said.

'Officials here say the air strikes are sufficient but ground action is needed to wipe out IS. YPG is perfectly capable of doing that, but more weapons are needed,' he said, referring to the acronym for the Kurdish People's Protection Units.

NOW ISIS BEHEAD THEIR OWN FIGHTERS: TWO FANATICS KILLED FOR 'SPYING' AND 'BANDITRY' IN BRUTAL NEW TWIST TO EXTREMIST REGIME Islamic State militants have publicly beheaded two of their own fighters after they were accused of 'banditry' and spying on behalf of the Syrian government. The executions took place in the Syrian city of Al-Bukamal after the two men were arrested by members of the terror group's police force and brought before a Sharia law court. One of the men was successfully tried on charges of 'banditry and robbing Muslims' money', while the second man was convicted of 'spying and embezzlement', with both being sentenced to being beheaded in the centre of Al-Bukamal, which is on the Euphrates River near the border with Iraq. News of the executions came from the Syrian Observatory for Human Rights, a British-based group monitoring violence in Syria using sources on the ground. The first man, they said, was convicted of 'banditry and robbing Muslims' money' - a charge likely to have been linked to the practice of money lending or usury. The second militants was accused of 'dealing with the regime and throwing electronic chips to keep track of Mujahedeen,' according to the Observatory. The use of the phrase 'electronic chips' is understood to refer to small geolocation devices that can be hidden inside ISIS-held buildings or vehicles belonging to senior militants. The devices can then provide Syrian regime warplanes with detailed information on which to base a bombing raid.

ISIS' Kobane offensive is one of several it has conducted after a series of lightning advances since June, which have sent shockwaves through the region and sparked alarm in the West.

U.S. officials have ruled out sending troops to tackle the group, but Kurdish forces have been identified as viable partners for the coalition, and Kurds in Iraq have received western arms shipments to bolster their cause.

Hundreds, and possibly thousands, of Britons are believed to have fled to Syria and Iraq to join radical Islamic groups such as Islamic State (ISIS) and the Al Qaeda affiliated Jabhat al-Nusra.
Kurdish fighters later managed to seize a street in Kobane that had been held by militants, it added."

MOSCOW, October 16 (RIA Novosti), Ekaterina Blinova - The Islamic State (IS or), also known as the Islamic State in Iraq and the Levant (ISIL) beheads and crucifies its own fighters if they break the laws and ruling of the terrorist organization.

""ISIS is known for crucifying those who have tried to rebel against them. They do not flinch at killing anyone if they have committed a serious crime, which goes against their interpretation of sharia, such as usury or embezzlement,"" Charlie Winter, the Quilliam Foundation think tank Program Officer, told the Independent.

The media outlet reports that at least two ISIL jihadists have been publicly executed for spying and embezzlement in the Syrian city of Al-Bukamal. It is still unclear whether the men were beheaded or crucified, since both forms of punishment are widely used by the Islamic State militants.

According to the Syrian Observatory for Human Rights, one of the executed fighters was charged with ""banditry and robbing Muslims' money"" and the second one was accused of ""dealing with the regime and throwing electronic chips to keep track of Mujahedeen,"" as cited by the Independent.

Experts say they are not surprised by the harsh methods used by the IS, as decapitation and crucifying are common forms of punishment practiced by Sunni Wahhabi sectarians.

""Jihadist groups have a strict no corruption policy, meaning that while they can benefit financially from charging bank transactions and claiming a percentage of everyone’s monthly income, they don’t extort people like some secular groups have done in the past,"" notes Charlie Winter.

Experts emphasize that decapitation has long been a routine practice in Saudi Arabia, a country where Islam's Sharia Law is used.

""According to Amnesty International at least 79 people were executed [beheaded] in Saudi Arabia in 2013 and between 1 January and 18 August this year 34 more people were executed, making a total of 113. This does not include any estimates for executions at the end of 2012,"" the Independent reported in September 2014.

However, while denouncing IS's methods as gruesome and barbaric, the western policy-makers have turned a blind eye to Saudi Arabia's beheading practice.

NORTH Korean leader Kim Jong Un is in firm control of his government but has hurt his leg, a source with access to North Korea’s leadership said yesterday, playing down speculation over the 31-year-old’s health and grip on power.

North Korea’s state media, which usually chronicles Kim’s whereabouts in great detail, has not made any mention of his activities since he attended a concert with his wife on September 3.

The source said that Kim hurt his leg while inspecting military exercises.

“He ordered all the generals to take part in drills and he took part, too. They were crawling and running and rolling around, and he pulled a tendon,” the source said on condition of anonymity.

“He injured his ankle and knee around late August or early September while drilling because he is overweight. He limped around in the beginning but the injury worsened.”

Kim, who has rapidly gained weight since coming to power after his father died of a heart attack in 2011, had been seen walking with a limp since an event with key officials in July, which would imply he may have aggravated an earlier injury.

Kim needs about 100 days to recuperate, said the source.

“Kim Jong Un is in total control,” added the source, who has close ties to Pyongyang.

North Korean officials have denied that Kim’s public absence is health-related and a United States official following North Korea said this week there were no indications that he was seriously ill or in political trouble. It remains unclear why a leg injury would keep Kim out of the public eye for so long, although this is not the first time he has been missing from public view.

In June 2012, six months after coming to power, state media failed to report on or photograph him for 23 days.

He re-surfaced the next month at a dolphinarium.

Speculation that Kim’s unusually long absence from public view may be due to ill health was fuelled by a TV report late last month that said he was suffering from “discomfort.”

Some Pyongyang watchers also suggest that Kim may have been sidelined in a power struggle, a scenario they say was reinforced by the unexpected visit last Saturday of a high-level delegation to the closing ceremony of the Asian Games in Incheon, South Korea.

The source with knowledge of Kim’s health said rumors of a coup were “rubbish.”

Kim was absent from a September 25 meeting of the Supreme People’s Assembly, or parliament, the first he has not attended since coming to power three years ago.

However, Kim’s name has not disappeared from state propaganda. Yesterday’s edition of the Workers’ Party newspaper, the Rodong Sinmun, carried three letters to Kim from overseas allies on its front page."	N.

Is There an ISIS Threat on the Texas-Mexico Border or Not?

Yesterday we noted the surprising statement from Representative Duncan Hunter, Republican of California, that “at least ten ISIS fighters have been caught coming across the border in Texas” by the U.S. Border Patrol.

That statement generated a pretty firm denial from DHS Wednesday:

“The suggestion that individuals who have ties to ISIL have been apprehended at the Southwest border is categorically false, and not supported by any credible intelligence or the facts on the ground,” a DHS spokesman said in a statement today. “DHS continues to have no credible intelligence to suggest terrorist organizations are actively plotting to cross the southwest border.”

But then a few hours later, the government watchdog group Judicial Watch released a shocking statement with some more specific claims about ISIS members being caught — but with no named sources attached to it:

Islamic terrorists have entered the United States through the Mexican border and Homeland Security sources tell Judicial Watch that four have been apprehended in the last 36 hours by federal authorities and the Texas Department of Public Safety in McAllen and Pharr.

Judicial Watch’s release also noted:

In late August JW reported that Islamic terrorist groups are operating in the Mexican border city of Ciudad Juarez and planning to attack the United States with car bombs or other vehicle borne improvised explosive devices (VBIED). High-level federal law enforcement, intelligence and other sources confirmed to JW that a warning bulletin for an imminent terrorist attack on the border has been issued. Agents across a number of Homeland Security, Justice and Defense agencies have all been placed on alert and instructed to aggressively work all possible leads and sources concerning this imminent terrorist threat.

Because we haven’t heard about any car bombs in cities near the U.S.-Mexican border, one might conclude this is merely chatter and rumors.

But then there’s this wrinkle, from KVIA, the ABC affiliate in El Paso, Texas, August 31, 2014:

Fort Bliss officials announced Sunday morning that several recent security concerns have forced them to increase security at the entry gates.

Officials told ABC-7 that their concern for safety will affect vehicle, motorcycle, bicycle and pedestrian access to the installation through 5 a.m. Tuesday morning.

ABC-7 asked Fort Bliss spokesperson Lt. Col. Lee Peters if this was related to the alleged Islamic State threat in Juarez.

He said, “Based on [Department of Defense] guidance from recent nationwide incidents, and our own internal assessments coupled with recent media reporting, we decided to implement increased security measures on Bliss. These changes are not as a result of a specific threat but rather to simply get prudent security measures in place to protect our military, employees and visitors.”

Fort Bliss in El Paso, Texas, is directly across the border from Ciudad Juarez:

So apparently someone in our government was indeed on alert about “several recent security concerns” in late summer."

Last Saturday, officials uncovered unmarked graves with human remains of at least 28 individuals after two suspects in custody tipped off authorities. According to CNN, Guerrero State Attorney General Iñaky Blanco Cabrera told reporters that the bodies were burned and then buried, making the identification process time consuming and difficult.

The students — who were mostly young men studying to become teachers at Escuela Normal Rural de Ayotzinapa — were protesting unfair hiring practices of teachers on Sept. 26 when they were rounded up by the hitmen, taken to the mass grave site on a hill in Pueblo Viejo and killed. ""A bed of branches and tree trunks was made, on which the bodies of the victims were laid and a flammable substance was used,"" Inaky Blanco, the chief prosecutor of violence-plagued Guerrero state, said.

It all started over two weeks ago when gunmen started shooting at buses in in Iguala, Mexico — buses carrying students and members of the third division Chilpancingo Hornets soccer club.

""We were just watching a movie and we saw the bullets come in and then it was like we were going off a cliff and the bus tipped over,"" said Omar Sanchez about the violence to CNN en Español. ""And it was then that they started firing at us with machine guns,"" he said. ""It sounded so ugly, the gunshots and my teammates screaming, 'Help, leave us alone, we are injured.' A teacher said, 'you have already blinded me, please, we are the team from Chilpancingo.""

Thus far, authorities do not know the motive behind the murders. That said, one thing is for clear: The people of Mexico are not standing by.

State prosecutors in the country said a man they arrested told how 17 of the missing youths were rounded up and killed, then thrown in pits, where badly charred remains have now been unearthed.

Authorities said that the man told them how the students, who went missing after a violent clash on September 26, were marched to the site on the outskirts of Iguala, Guerrero state before their deaths.

Hunt: A forensic investigator works at the site of the mass graves, near Iguala in Mexico

The bodies found by authorities are so damaged that they could not be identified. All that is left are bones and small pieces of flesh.

Investigators found 28 bodies there, though local officials say as many as 34 were buried across six separate pits.

It could be days before the identities of the dead are known for sure.

Security officials said earlier they believed the victims had been driven to the end of the track, walked up the hillside, executed and buried in six graves.

As investigators worked at the site, up to 2,000 protesters blocked a main highway in the Guerrero state capital of Chilpancingo demanding justice.

'You took them alive, we want them returned alive,' read a huge banner hung across the road linking Mexico City and Acapulco.

Victims: The above poster shows the 43 missing students and offers a reward for their recovery

Remote spot: Officers stand watch near the site of the mass grave on the outskirts of Iguala in Mexico

Mass grave: The roughly 30 bodies in the grave are believed to belong the group of 43 missing students

Jesus Lopez, an Acapulco street vendor whose 19-year-old son Giovani is among the missing, said he hoped the remains weren't those of the students.

Other relatives 'told us that (the remains) were burned, and that they couldn't be the kids,' Lopez said. 'But we're really nervous.'

Mexico's National Human Rights Commission opened its own investigation into the case for possible 'serious human rights abuses,' such as extrajudicial executions and forced disappearances by Iguala city police.

Police infiltrated by local drug cartels are suspected of abducting some of the students, a local security official said, speaking on condition of anonymity.

One security official said: 'You really can't call them police'.

He added that suspected gang members had told investigators that police had handed over the students to the people who killed them, who belonged to the gang.

Suspicion: Masked police officers stand guard atop a vehicle outside of the morgue in Iguala

Forensic workers arrive at the morgue: Relatives of the missing have given DNA samples for identification

Grim work: The remains of nine people had been brought from the hillside so far, with another 25 to follow

Heartbroken: Relatives and colleagues blockade a toll road near the site of the disappearance

Demonstration: Fellow students protested earlier this week over the dissapearance

The suspected gang members had also helped the authorities identify the site, the security official said.

Soldiers and police had cordoned off the dirt track where it ended not far from the graves, which lay about a 40-minute walk across rocky terrain inaccessible by vehicle.

The fatal clashes took place in Iguala on the night of September 26. Thirty people, including 22 police, have been arrested in connection with the violence, which claimed the lives of at least six people and left 25 injured.

Information leading to the discovery of the graves had in part come from the interrogation of local police arrested after the clashes in Iguala, the security official said.

On Saturday, the burned bodies of 28 people, believed to be missing student protesters, were found in a mass grave just outside the city center.

The students went missing on September 25 after a protest over hiring practices at the Ayotzinapa Normal School turned violent. The students are known as radicals who have done battle with police in the past. This time, police officers reportedly opened fire on the protesters, killing three. However, officials and students tell very different stories of how the protests ended.

Students have said they were attempting to leave the scene of the protest by bus, only to be chased by officers who opened fire, whereas officials have said the students ""commandeered the buses by force,"" resulting in the violence. Those investigating the mass grave found video showing the police officers arresting and taking away an undisclosed number of students.

Iguala is the door to the cartel-controlled Tierra Caliente territory, where gangs recently burned four trucks transporting Coca-Cola to the ground and the opium trade is still alive and well. The area cartels—which rival one another in both drug sales and acts of brutality—have been implicated in the deaths of the 28 students, by several mobsters-turned-police tipsters who disclosed the location of the bodies."

Guerrero State Attorney General Iñaky Blanco said there was a connection between the burial site and the students’ disappearance from a teachers’ college the previous weekend, the Wall Street Journal reports. However, Blanco said it would be “irresponsible” without DNA tests to confirm that the bodies were the missing students.

Mexico’s Proceso, citing anonymous sources, reported that 20 bodies had been discovered. The Associated Press reports that six pits had been discovered but did not report a body count.

The students disappeared after clashing with police during a protest that turned violent. Officials have detained 30 people, including 22 police officers, in the case. Blanco said that a local criminal organization, Los Guerreros Unidos, was connected with the violence and the disappearances.

Close to 100,000 Mexicans have been killed or gone missing in drug-related violence since 2006, when former President Felipe Calderon ordered the country’s military to reclaim parts of the country under the influence of drug cartels.

The North Korean capital city has been under intense lockdown, reports are now saying, raising questions on whether the reclusive regime is on the verge of its doom. Quoting reliable sources in the country, the Telegraph reported that a ban on new travel passes to leave or enter Pyongyang was introduced on 27 September.

While the North Korean capital has always been a difficult place to either enter or exit, the latest restrictions reportedly even apply to permanent residents of Pyongyang.

""This sort of action suggests that there has either been an attempted coup or the authorities there have uncovered some sort of ploy against the leadership,"" the British daily quoted Toshimitsu Shigumura, a professor at Tokyo's Waseda University and an authority on North Korean affairs.

""If it is a military-backed coup, the situation in Pyongyang will be very dangerous and I have heard reports that Kim has been moved out of the capital,"" he said adding that some senior officials of the regime have attempted to defect and ""they are closing the escape routes, such as the airport and the border.""

Reports on the lockdown first appeared in a report published on Tuesday in New Focus International. The leader has not been seen in public for over a month prompting speculations on his whereabouts. His little-known sister, Kim Yo Jong, has taken official charge of North Korea as he is said to be under 'medical treatment'."

Kim Yo-jong, the younger sister of North Korean leader Kim Jong-un, might be leading the hermit kingdom instead of her brother, a recent report from Seoul-based think tank, North Korea Intellectuals Solidarity (NKIS) revealed.

According to NKIS on October 1, Kim Jong-un — who has failed to appear at official events since early September — is getting medical treatment at Bonghwa Clinic from both domestic and foreign medical teams. Meanwhile, in his absence, Kim Yo-jong is charged with handling important government decisions.

An unnamed source told NKIS that a decision to give Kim Jong-un extended medical treatment was made at a meeting of the Political Bureau of the Central Committee of the Workers’ Party of Korea on September 6. The meeting was reportedly held at Kim Yo-jong’s suggestion.

As a result of the meeting, Pyongyang decided four things. First, to give special and extended medical treatment to Kim Jong-un in order to quickly restore his health. Second, all North Korean high level officials and party members should be responsible in following Kim’s previous orders. Third, the party and army should be on wartime-like alert while Kim Jong-un is out of commission. Lastly, all the important matters related to government administration should be reported to Kim Yo-jong, so that Kim Jong-un can concentrate on getting better.

Kim Yo-jong is the daughter of the former North Korean leader Kim Jong-il and his wife, Kim Yong-hui. She was first spotted at a photo session for participants at the 3rd Conference of the Workers’ Party of Korea in September 2010, when she stood next to her father’s personal secretary.

She was officially mentioned for the first time on March 9, 2014, as she accompanied her brother in voting for the Supreme People’s Assembly. She was identified as a “senior official” of the Central Committee of the Workers’ Party of Korea. She is widely seen as having taken over the role of her aunt, Kim Kyong-hui, the wife of the executed Jang Song-thaek. Kim Kyong-hui supported her elder brother Kim Jong-il during his rule.

“Some say Hwang Byong-so, director of the General Political Bureau of the Korean People’s Army, may have assumed new No. 2 status, but given what has been confirmed this time, we can say Hwang is just a shadow, and Kim Yo-jong is the second-in-command of North Korea,” said Kim Heung-gwang, the head of NKIS.

Meanwhile, speculation over Kim Jong-un’s sustained absence continues unabated.

South Korea’s Yonhap News Agency reported, citing an unnamed source, that he is suffering from gout.

A Daily Mirror report said that Kim Jong-un is addicted to Swiss cheese, which may have contributed to his health problems.

Curtis Melvin, a researcher with the U.S.-Korea Institute at Johns Hopkins University, told Foreign Policy that Kim Jong un spends much of his time at the family compounds in Wonsan and Kangdong. The family compound in Kangdong is where Kim Jong-il recovered from his stroke.

In addition, Free North Korea Radio (FNK) reported on September 29 that Kim hadsurgery on his ankle. The surgery was reportedly successful.

However, the South Korean government has refused to confirm that Kim is suffering from any health problem.

“I think it is hard to relate Kim’s absence to his health since there used to be a time when Kim disappeared from official events [for] over ten days,” said Lim Byeong-chul, a spokesman of the Ministry of Unification."

Kim Jong Un had surgery done by ""European experts,"" lawmaker said

There is a possibility a cyst could recur because of obesity and health conditions

Kim Jong Un reappeared in photos on October 14 after about six weeks

(CNN) North Korean leader Kim Jong Un, who recently disappeared from public view for about six weeks, had a cyst removed from his right ankle, a lawmaker told CNN.

South Korea's National Intelligence Service told lawmakers during a closed-door meeting that a cyst was found on Kim's right ankle earlier this year, between May and June. That cyst may have caused muscle or nerve damage and prompted him to have ankle surgery between September and October, lawmaker Lee Cheol-woo said.

At the briefing, lawmakers were told that ""European experts"" handled the surgery for tarsal tunnel syndrome. The syndrome is caused by compression at the ankle -- known to cause pain during standing and walking.

Kim is believed to be recovering, South Korean lawmakers were told, but the cyst could recur due to his obesity and heavy schedule.

After his conspicuous absence throughout most of September, Kim seemed to reappear October 14, when North Korean state media published the first photos of him , in which the beaming Kim held a cane in his left hand as he gave ""field guidance"" at a newly built residential district.

No craving can be more important than your health as the North Korean leader finds it out the hard way. Kim Jong-un broke his ankle after he had put on extra weight from regularly consuming imported cheese, said a report on Tuesday.

And the reason for his mysterious disappearance has been finally put to rest when his condition was revealed. He was put to bed after a surgery to fix his fractured ankles.

Uncontrolled daily eating of Emmental, imported from Switzerland, is believed to be responsible for his rapid weight gain, the metro.co.uk reported.

The report citing a South Korean daily said that the tyrant is recovering from the fractured ankles after the strain of his expanding waistline put pressure on a pre-existing injury - and caused the bones to crack.

""I heard that Kim Jong-un injured his right ankle in June after pushing ahead with on-site visits and ended up fracturing both ankles because he left the injury unattended,"" the South Korean daily Chosun Ilbo quoted a source as saying.

Rumours of a coup after the mysterious disappearance of despot Kim Jong-un have been put to bed after it was revealed the North Korean leader is merely recovering from surgery – after cheese-fuelled weight gain caused him to fracture his ankles.

Unbridled daily binges on Emmental imported from Switzerland are believed to be responsible for the dictator’s rapid weight gain, with some defectors speculating he was trying to match the considerable bulk of his grandfather, Kim Il-sung.

And South Korea’s largest newspaper claims that the tubby tyrant is in fact recovering from two fractured ankles after the strain of his expanding waistline put pressure on a pre-existing injury – and caused the bones to crack.

North Korea dictator Kim Jong-un has undergone a hospital operation after he fractured both ankles.

The 20-stone leader of one of the world’s most impoverished countries has soared on the scales due to his love of fine wine and dining.

Kim, believed to be aged 31, is under armed guard by his personal protection team at a hospital in North Korea’s capital, Pyongyang.

One source in South Korea’s Seoul said there had been a marked increase in elite officials visiting the ward after Kim’s official car did not appear to have left Pyongyang in recent weeks.

Kim is believed to have sprained then fractured his ankles during a gruelling tour of military bases and factories in shoes with Cuban heels to give him a little more height and a physical appearance of more authority.

The 31-year-old leader got a taste for Swiss cheese while studying in Switzerland and imports vast quantities despite Western sanctions.

One intelligence source said: “He has become noticeably overweight since he came to power.”

Kim was seen limping when he visited a government establishment in a clip shown on North Korea’s Central TV.

There were earlier suggestions Kim’s obesity and binge drinking had brought on gout which confined him behind closed doors for several days.

But aides were determined to turn his health problems to good advantage, with the official Rodong Sinmun daily newspaper saying he had “laboured on” by visiting various facilities in the hot summer weather.

Kim even missed a regular session of the Supreme People’s Assembly in Pyongyang last Thursday fuelling belief he was still confined to hospital.

A Seoul government official said it was unlikely “a young man like Kim Jong-un would have missed the Supreme People’s Assembly just because he has gout.”

His absence from the assembly was followed by a rare admission by state TV, which not only showed footage of him limping but also stated that he was ill.

A team of doctors from Europe is also believed to have travelled to North Korea recently.

A political observer said ""coming down closer to the level of his people"" was the only way Kim was going to return to health, beat his gout, lose weight and prevent a repeat of his reported fractured ankles.

Malnutrition is widespread in North Korea, with famines often breaking out in a country still relying on foreign food aid as a result of economic mismanagement and the loss of Soviet support in the 1990s.

The march into the largest city in the country comes on the heels of President Barack Obama admitting that the threat of the group was “underestimated.” The fighting near the city has become fierce, as reports from inside the Middle East region maintain the Islamic State fighters are just about to reach the doorstep of Baghdad.

The ISIS fighters have already garnered a large portion of both Iraq and Syria, but some experts fear that a takeover by the Islamic State in Baghdad could prove “disastrous” for the United States. Thwarting the reach of the group could prove significantly more difficult if Baghdad, with a population of about 7 million, falls under the complete control of ISIS.

“The Islamic State are now less than 2km away from entering Baghdad. They said it could never happen and now it almost has,” Canon Andrew White, a priest leading the only Anglican church in the Iraq city, said.

“Obama says he overstated what the Iraqi Army could do. Well you only need to here a very short while to know that they can do very, very, little,” The Foundation for Relief and Reconciliation in the Middle East member added.

Islamic State militants took over the control of Mosul, the second-largest city in Iraq. Massive fighting is still ongoing in Fallujah – a town about 25 miles away from Bagdad. BBC News is reporting that Iraqi troops are fighting ISIS militants approximately six miles away from Baghdad. If reports from the news agency are accurate, the Iraqi Army could “barely contain” the ISIS fighters or force a retreat even with the airstrikes offered by the United States.

During the 60 Minutes interview, President Obama had this to say about ISIS and the turmoil in the Middle East.

“During the chaos of the Syrian civil war, where essentially you had huge swaths of the country that are completely ungoverned, they [ISIS] were able to reconstitute themselves and take advantage of that chaos. [ISIS is] sort of a hybrid of not just the terrorist network, but one with territorial ambitions, and some of the strategy and tactics of an army.”

According to Obama administration military advisers, ISIS now numbers about 40,000 fighters – all of which have sworn allegiance to Abu Bakr al-Baghdadi and his plan to create an Islamic caliphate.

Fierce fighting has been reported on the outskirts of Baghdad where ISIS militants are attempting to seize control of the Iraqi capital – despite ongoing Western airstrikes against the terror group.

The fighting is taking place just one mile to the west of the city, with government forces desperately trying to hold off the militants, who allegedly killed up to 1,000 soldiers during clashes yesterday.

ISIS have held a number of towns and villages close to the Iraqi capital since earlier in the year, when government troops melted away following a lightning advance in the west of the country – enabling the terrorist group to seize further swaths of territory for their so-called caliphate.

Reports that ISIS militants are now just one mile from Baghdad came from the Foundation for Relief and Reconciliation in the Middle East – an organisation supporting the work of Canon Andrew White, vicar of the city’s St George’s Church, the only Anglican church in Iraq.

In a message posted on Facebook, the group said: ‘The Islamic State are now less than 2km away from entering Baghdad. They said it could never happen and now it almost has.

‘Obama says he overestimated what the Iraqi Army could do. Well you only need to be hear a very short while to know they can do very very little,’ they added.

The claims were backed up by Canon White himself, who shared the message just hours after he had earlier suggested the group were approximately six miles from the centre of Baghdad.

In a message he also posted on Facebook, Canon White had said: ‘The Islamic State are now within 10km of entering Baghdad. Over a 1000 Iraqi troops were killed by them yesterday, things are so bad. As I said all the military air strikes are doing nothing. If ever we needed your prayer it is now.’

The militants are understood to have had their advance halted by airstrikes yesterday at Ameriyat Al-Falluja yesterday – a small city about 18 miles south of Fallujah and 40 miles west of Baghdad.

But the clashes did not force the bulk of the fighters – with many of them now having made their way to the Baghdad suburbs for this morning’s fighting.

Airstrikes against ISIS targets were supposed to stop the group from taking Baghdad.

“The Islamic State are now less than 2km (1.2 miles) away from entering Baghdad. They said it could never happen and now it almost has,” Canon Andrew White of the Foundation for Relief and Reconciliation in the Middle East, a British-based charity that supports Iraq’s only Anglican church in Baghdad, said on his Facebook page early Monday morning. “Obama says he overestimated what the Iraqi Army could do. Well, you only need to be here a very short while to know they can do very, very little.”

The Christian aid group was referring to the U.S. president’s interview Sunday night on “60 Minutes,” the CBS news magazine show, where Obama conceded that his administration underestimated the ascendancy of ISIS. More than 1,000 Iraqi troops were reportedly killed Sunday in clashes with ISIS about 10 miles outside of Baghdad.

The advance by ISIS toward Baghdad shows that the group isn't weakening despite U.S.-led airstrikes in Iraq. ISIS executed 300 Iraqi soldiers last week during their march toward the Iraqi capital and attempted to break into a prison in northern Baghdad.

""This attack is very significant. It is the first infantry-like, complex, and penetrating attack in Baghdad city by ISIS since the fall of Mosul in June of this year,"" the Washington-based nonprofit Institute for the Study of War wrote on its website, referring to Iraq's second-largest city, which is in the Islamic State's hands. ""ISIS likely carried out the attack to release some of the pressure it is facing as a result of the recent U.S. air campaign targeting its positions. The attack also signifies that, despite the heightened defenses of Baghdad in the aftermath of the fall of Mosul, ISIS is still able to carry out attacks in an area where it is unlikely to have active sleeper cells.""

U.S.-led airstrikes against ISIS in Iraq and Syria have come under criticism over their effectiveness. U.S. Secretary of State John Kerry defended the military action last week in a CNN interview. Kerry claimed “Baghdad could have fallen” if it weren't for the airstrikes, which have predominantly been launched in the northern part of Iraq."

What began as an Occupy-inspired student sit-in exploded in Hong Kong over the weekend as police responded with excessive force toward peaceful demonstrators, using tear gas, pepper spray, and rubber bullets. The Occupy Central protests spread from Hong Kong’s financial district to just outside the city’s government offices in Admiralty, but the law-enforcement crackdown had the opposite effect, sending thousands more into the streets in solidarity and shutting down portions of the city. The protests have now bled into the work week and riot police have pulled back, at least for now. Here’s what you need to know so far.

What started this?

After 150 years of British rule, Hong Kong was returned to China in 1997, but has operated semi-autonomously under what’s known as “one country, two systems,” outside of Beijing’s communist rule. The promise was that in 2017, Hong Kong would be allowed, for the first time, to elect its own leader (known as chief executive) in democratic elections, instead of having the slot filled by a committee from Beijing. But earlier this summer, China decided a committee was still necessary, and it would select the candidates for Hong Kong’s 2017 elections. Outrage has been building ever since.

Who’s out there?

The protests were organized in part by the Hong Kong Federation of Students, which has since called for an indefinite student strike, the New York Times reports. Young people are everywhere, but not alone. The Hong Kong Professional Teachers’ Union has joined them with a general strike, as have some professionals after the weekend violence — “office workers in slacks and dress shirts mixed with crowds of students in black T-shirts,” according to the Times.

Occupy Central with Love and Peace, meanwhile, is led by a University of Hong Kong law professor named Benny Tai, Businessweek reported earlier this summer. Tai has been organizing for months, and a look at his planning from June now serves as some serious foreshadowing:

At some point, Tai says the movement may follow through on the threat in its name and occupy Central, where most of Hong Kong’s top banks and other financial institutions (as well as Bloomberg) have their offices. Many companies are already taking no chances, developing plans in case demonstrators block the streets and prevent employees from getting to work.

What do they want?

In addition to democratic elections in 2017 and continued autonomy for Hong Kong, as previously promised, protesters are now demanding the resignation of current chief executive Leung Chun-ying. The economics are also less than ideal, and the country could be slipping into a recession.

How is the government reacting?

Not well, especially at first. Here’s a video from the ground of protesters being teargassed, in attacks that look familiar from Ferguson and helped stoke outrage among citizens:

The use of pepper spray has been equally alarming, and is reminiscent of previous Occupy protests in the U.S.

As Vox notes, some protesters have taken to using the “hands up, don’t shoot” imagery of the Michael Brown demonstrations in Ferguson. It’s still a powerful image on the other side of the world:

Protesters in Ferguson have sent a message back:

It’s not surprising, then, that Beijing is blaming the West for stoking tensions. From the Times:

A commentary on the website of the People’s Daily, the Chinese Communist Party’s main newspaper, claimed that the upheavals in Hong Kong were instigated by democratic radicals who had sought support from “anti-China forces” in Britain and the United States, and had sought lessons from independence activists in Taiwan. It called them a “gang of people whose hearts belong to colonial rule and who are besotted with ‘Western democracy’.”

Hong Kong has canceled its annual fireworks celebration of China’s National Day on Wednesday, indicating that this thing may continue for the foreseeable future.

“The protesters, they are so young,” a mother of two who joined the protests on Monday told the Times. “They are fighting for our future, for my children’s future.”

I was at the uneventful (if tense) Legco [Legislative Council] demonstration on Saturday as well as last night's demonstrations between Causeway Bay and Central. It was as much depressing as, ultimately, uplifting. When I was incapacitated by a blast of pepper spray, I somehow found myself being reverse crowd-surfed to a safe area. There, a young girl cradled my head and poured water into my eyes. Some others wiped the chemicals off my arms and legs. When they went on to help the next injured person, an old woman kept watch over me, speaking soft Cantonese and plying me with all manner of snacks and drinks. These were complete strangers. Later, when we scrambled to avoid the first tear gas attack, a small band of people committed to staying put and helping the crush of smoke victims climb over the concrete barriers and into safety.

When we felt threatened, we opened umbrellas and raised our hands. When the police decided to retake the street, they sprayed chemicals in our faces, pointed rifles at us, smashed our limbs with batons. While they were throwing tear gas with reckless abandon, our side threw not one rock, not one bottle, not one egg, nothing. None from our side brandished a firearm, a knife, a club, anything at all. I have neither seen nor heard any reports of protesters looting, burning cars, destroying property, or intentionally injuring police. Young women felt safe enough to doze off during the lulls. In what other city would tens of thousands of 'rioters' act with such restraint? The government warned against the chaos Occupy Central would cause. It's all too clear to me which side is supplying the chaos and which side is conducting itself with dignity. These demonstrations may have been sparked by anger, but they're sustained by compassion and love.

I have been working around the clock on a non-China-related magazine project (as the time of this post indicates) and will wait until tomorrow to say something more about the consequential events underway in Hong Kong.

It is of course interesting to note the spread of the ""hands-up/ don't shoot!"" gesture from Ferguson to Hong Kong, but the circumstances in the two places have 100 times more differences than similarities. There are profound differences as well with the other obvious comparison for mass movements among Chinese people, namely the movements throughout China in the summer of 1989."

Demonstrators have gathered outside government headquarters near the city’s financial district calling for the Chinese government to grant democratic reforms in Hong Kong. Protesters raised their hands up in the air in a symbolic “hands up, don’t shoot” gesture which some observers saw as reminiscent of the recent response by protesters in Ferguson, Missouri over the killing of unarmed teen Michael Brown.

Students – many of whom have already boycotted a week of classes – and activists began camping out on Friday, and were later joined by members of a civil disobedience movement known as Occupy Central.

Protesters told the Associated Press that the demonstrations were peaceful when riot police started to use pepper spray and launch tear gas canisters. That sent coughing protesters running in all directions, but many later reconvened vowing to keep the rally going. Police officers were wearing both helmets and respirators to protect them from the gas.

Government leaders in Hong Kong and Beijing called the demonstrations “unlawful” and “illegal” respectively, but many protesters say they will not waver.

“If today I don’t stand out, I will hate myself in future,” taxi driver Edward Yeung told Reuters. “Even if I get a criminal record,” he said, “it will be a glorious one.”

Hong Kong does have some autonomy from Beijing which took over sovereignty of the former British colony in 1997.

But Beijing has asserted more control in the city in recent months. This includes requiring Beijing’s approval of election candidates and allegations of intimidation from mainland officials on free business practices in Hong Kong, according to The Washington Post. Occupy Central vowed to protest the Chinese government’s actions back in June when the city’s Beijing-backed leader said a trio of reforms the group was suggesting failed to comply with existing laws, The New York Times reported.

Beijing has promised Hong Kong a free election to choose its leader by 2017, but pro-democracy supporters there and Chinese officials on the mainland have so far failed to agree on guidelines for such a vote.

Government officials in Hong Kong warned that the continued demonstrations may disrupt public transport in the financial hub on Monday, Reuters reported. Police have not used tear gas in Hong Kong in nearly a decade, according to NBC News. The tactic was last used in 2005 during World Trade Organization protests.

“We will fight until the end,” one protester told NBC News. “We will never give up.” Another protester – a student named Alexandra Wong – said, “We will not just say yes to whatever they do. We will fight for our rights, and fight for our democracy.”

A common thread: As many online commentators have noted, there's a striking similarity between the gesture of the ""umbrella revolution"" taking place in Hong Kong and the ""hands up, don't shoot"" gesture from the protests in Ferguson, Mo.

Is there an actual connection? It doesn't look like the hands-up gesture by Hong Kong protesters is a callback to the events still unfolding in Ferguson. As reported by Quartz, ""The gesture is a result of training and instructions from protest leaders, who have told demonstrators to raise their hands with palms forward to signal their peaceful intentions to police.""

While the gesture might not have been a deliberate cultural reference like Thai protesters adopting the Hunger Games salute, the unplanned nature of its similarity to the Ferguson gesture makes it all the more powerful: Although the two sites of protest are a world apart from each other and are fighting against very different sociopolitical issues, both movements are dealing with police brutality and demonstrating peaceful intent in an act of nonviolent civil unrest.

And the fact that Ferguson protesters are marching in solidarity with the Hong Kong protesters makes it all the more moving:

Hong Kong's protesters have good reason to put their hands up: police are using what many observers describe as an unprecedented level of force against the demonstrations, which are rallying against the Chinese government for reneging on its promise to grant them full democracy in 2017. While injuries in the protests have been relatively few so far, the clashes have been bad enough that Hong Kongers appear to earnestly fear the police might crack down violently, and that anxiety is showing in these photos.

It's impossible to say the degree to which protesters are using the gesture as a deliberate nod to Ferguson, or borrowing something they'd seen on the news for their own purposes, or using it coincidentally.

One 22-year-old protester told Quartz's Lily Kuo that she had never heard of the events in Ferguson. Another said that the similarity was coincidental, a result of protest leaders telling people to raise their hands to police to signal peacefulness. Still, Hong Kongers pride themselves on being plugged in to the world, so it is within the realm of possibility that some of them followed the events in Ferguson and are now appropriating the gesture for their own use, even if only subconsciously.

Some of the protesters are organized within a group called Occupy Central, named for Hong Kong's Central financial district and for the global protest movement that began with Occupy Wall Street.

Chinese riot police were forced into an embarrassing back down today as they withdrew from the streets of Hong Kong amid fury over their heavy-handed use of tear gas to disperse anti-democracy protesters.

Tens of thousands of people, mainly students, have brought central Hong Kong to a standstill, blocking roads and forcing the closure of banks and schools, in a major pushback against Beijing's decision to limit democratic reforms.

However the Chinese government has refused to budge on the issue, warning other countries not to support the 'illegal rallies', as demonstrators demanded that Britain and the U.S. 'stand up for democracy'.

The UK has called for the right to protest to be protected and the Foreign and Commonwealth Office said it is concerned about the tense standoff.

'Hands up, don't shoot': Protesters have responded to the government's use of tear gas by using the 'hands up, don't shoot' gesture first employed by demonstrators in Ferguson, Missouri, last month as they marched over the police shooting of unarmed black teenager Mike Brown

Solidarity: As a show of defiance this evening, the protesters turned on the lights on their mobile phones and held them in the air in central Hong Kong

Reaction: Police have turned to softer tactics today in an attempt to quell the protests, after their use o tear gas drew thousands more on to the streets

Defiant: Protesters block the main street to the financial Central district, outside the government headquarters

Peaceful: The Occupy Central movement say they will remain in Hong Kong's finance district until their demands for greater democratic freedoms are met

Scuffles: Protesters have accused the police of using heavy-handed tactics to break up the demonstration, but authorities say 12 police have been injured

There were fears that the Chinese People's Liberation Army could become involved, echoing the crackdown on protesters in Tiananmen Square in 1989 which ended with the massacre of several hundred people, but Hong Kong chief executive Leung Chun-ying has denied this.

The uprising is fast becoming known as the 'Umbrella Revolution' due to the fact that protesters are using little more than parasols to protect themselves against the volleys of tear gas being fired at them by police - in an unprecedented crack down on dissent - leaving many choking under thick clouds of toxic vapour.

The protesters yesterday adopted the 'hands up, don't shoot' gesture, first employed last month by demonstrators in Ferguson, Missouri, as they marched over the police shooting of unarmed black teenager Mike Brown. There, the gesture became a symbol of the fight against racism and police violence in America.

In response, the Chinese government announced that riot police had been taken off the streets as citizens 'have mostly calmed down' and urged people to unblock roads and disperse.

Sit in: The students, who have been occupying Hing Kong's finance district since yesterday, are preparing to spend another night on the streets today

We shall not be moved: The activists are demanding a free vote in upcoming elections in Hon Kong, which they fear are being heavily influenced by Beijing

Settled in: Around 100,000 students are camping out in the middle of Hong Kong tonight ahead of a public holiday tomorrow

Protection: The protests are being dubbed the 'umbrella revolution' after activists used umbrellas to protect themselves against tear gas and pepper spray

Gas: A protester wearing goggles, a mask and carrying an umbrella protects himself against tear gas, which has been used for the first time in nearly a decade

Defence: The protesters, mostly students, have come equipped with goggles, anoraks and face masks to protect themselves against tear gar and pepper spray

Instead, the government switched its focus to social media, banning Instagram across the country in a further bid to stifle dissent in the Asian financial hub.

The popular photo-sharing service was shut down today in an apparent attempt to prevent demonstrators sharing photographs of the upheaval with their countrymen, as they expanded their rallies throughout Hong Kong.

Many photos already posted on the image-sharing website - labelled under the hashtag #OccupyCentral, a phrase officials went on to block from Weibo, China's version of Twitter.

The social media crack down comes as police officers tried to negotiate with protesters, some wearing surgical masks and holding up umbrellas to protect against tear gas, camped out on a normally busy highway near the Hong Kong government headquarters that was the scene of impassioned clashes that erupted the evening before.

An officer with a bullhorn tried to get them to clear the way for the commuters. A protester, using the group's own speaker system, responded by saying that they wanted Hong Kong's Chief Executive Leung Chun-ying to demand a genuine choice for the territory's voters.

Barricade: An activist wrapped in clingfilm to shield himself stands beside a barricade in Hong Kong's financial district during a second day of protests yesterday

Sit in: Thousands of students gathered together in a 'sit in' to block main roads of a popular fashion district in Hong Kong

Appropriation: Protesters in Hong Kong have appropriated the gesture, which came to symbolise the fight against racism and police violence in America, as a symbol of democracy and freedom

Toxic fumes: Fury continues to grow over the police's heavy-handed attempts to disperse protesters, including the widespread use of tear gas

Their use of the gesture has been hailed as a sign of how 'plugged in' to world affairs Hong Kongers are despite the mainland government's attempts to stifle social media and other information-gathering tools

Resistance: Thousands of protesters are still gathered in Hong Kong's financial district despite police throwing tear gas at them and launching a baton charge

Heavy-handed: Many photos already posted on the image-sharing website - labelled under the hashtag #OccupyCentral - show police firing tear gas canisters into crowds leaving protesters choking under thick clouds of toxic vapour

Face off: Protesters parade a large cut out of the head of C.Y. Leung in the streets outside the Hong Kong government complex

'Do something good for Hong Kong. We want real democracy!' he shouted.

As the mayhem continued, London-based banks HSBC and Standard Chartered were today forced to shut bank branches in Hong Kong as the territory's political unrest spills into the financial markets as the Hang Seng stock market to fall 2 per cent to a two-month low.

Meanwhile, the Foreign Office confirmed it is carefully monitoring the situation with a spokesman saying the British Government was 'concerned' about the events there and highlighted people's right to protest.

Banned: The popular photo-sharing service was shut down today in an apparent attempt to prevent demonstrators sharing photographs of the upheaval with their countrymen

Crack down: The social media crack down comes as pro-democracy protesters, some wearing surgical masks and holding up umbrellas to protect against tear gas, expanded their rallies throughout Hong Kong today

Rest time: The unrest is a major pushback against Beijing's decision to limit democratic reforms in the Asian financial hub

Protesters rest following pro-democracy protests in Hong Kong. China has called the protests illegal and endorsed the Hong Kong government's crackdown

Nap time: Policemen rest following pro-democracy protests in Hong Kong after tens of thousands of pro-democracy demonstrators brought parts of central Hong Kong to a standstill in a dramatic escalation of protests that have gripped the semi-autonomous Chinese city for days

Respite: Demonstrators take a break from the action, as they sleep in the streets outside Hong Kong Government's complex

Plugged in: Student protesters connect their mobile phones to chargers during the sit-in protest calling for greater democracy

He went on: 'It is Britain's long-standing position, as a co-signatory of the Sino-British Joint Declaration, that Hong Kong's prosperity and security are underpinned by its fundamental rights and freedoms, including the right to demonstrate.

'It is important for Hong Kong to preserve these rights and for Hong Kong people to exercise them within the law.

'These freedoms are best guaranteed by the transition to universal suffrage.

'We hope that the upcoming consultation period will produce arrangements which allow a meaningful advance for democracy in Hong Kong, and we encourage all parties to engage constructively in discussion to that end.'

Hands up: Protesters in Ferguson, Missouri, adopted the 'hands up, don't shoot' gesture after claims Mike Brown had his arms in the air when he was shot by a police officer in the city

Defiance: The clashes - images of which have been beamed around the world - are undermining Hong Kong's image as a safe financial haven, and raised the stakes of the face-off against President Xi Jinping's government

Anger: Beijing has taken a hard line against threats to the Communist Party's monopoly on power, including clamping down on dissidents and Muslim Uighur separatists in the country's far west

Force: The authorities have threatened to increase their use of force if the student activists, who are demanding democratic elections, do not disperse

Disruption: The protest marks the end of a week of activities which has become the worst unrest in Hong Kong since Britain handed the province back to China

Hong Kong police rained tear gas on thousands of pro-democracy protesters in the city's financial district today as tensions over the island's democratic rights grow

Gas: Officers used tear gas to break up the protest for the first time in Hong Kong since 2005, though officers denied rumours they had also fired rubber bullets

Fry up: A man cooks sausages for protesters, who are blocking the main street to the financial Central district in Hong Kong

China has called the protests illegal and endorsed the Hong Kong government's crackdown. The clashes - images of which have been beamed around the world - are undermining Hong Kong's image as a safe financial haven, and raised the stakes of the face-off against President Xi Jinping's government. Beijing has taken a hard line against threats to the Communist Party's monopoly on power, including clamping down on dissidents and Muslim Uighur separatists in the country's far west.

The mass protests are the strongest challenge yet to Beijing's decision last month to reject open nominations for candidates under proposed guidelines for the first-ever elections for Hong Kong's leader, promised for 2017. Instead, candidates must continue to be hand-picked by Beijing - a move that many residents viewed as reneging on promises to allow greater democracy in the semi-autonomous territory.

With rumours swirling, the Beijing-backed and deeply unpopular Leung reassured the public that speculation that the Chinese army might intervene was untrue.

'I hope the public will keep calm. Don't be misled by the rumors. Police will strive to maintain social order, including ensuring smooth traffic and ensuring the public safety,' Leung said. 'When they carry out their duties, they will use their maximum discretion.'

Democracy: The students are demanding a free vote in upcoming elections after the Chinese government hand-picked candidates loyal to the regime

Protection: Protesters wearing home-made gas masks and goggle throw tear gas grenades back at police as they demand democratic elections in Hong Kong

Unlawful: Hong Kong leader C.Y. Leung has said authorities will do whatever is necessary to break up the protest, which he said were illegal

Violent: An officer holding a riot shield shouts at protesters during a second day of demonstrations in Hong Kong where police have clashed with activists

The protest has been spearheaded largely but student-age activists but has gathered momentum among a broad range of people from high school students to the elderly.

Protesters also occupied streets in other parts of Hong Kong Island, including the upscale shopping area of Causeway Bay as well as across the harbor in densely populated Mong Kok on the Kowloon peninsula. The city's transport department said roads in those areas were closed.

More than 200 bus routes have been canceled or diverted in a city dependent on public transport. Subway exits have also been closed or blocked near protest area. Authorities said some schools in areas near the main protest site would be closed.

Leung urged people to go home, obey the law and avoid causing trouble.

'We don't want Hong Kong to be messy,' he said as he read a statement that was broadcast early Monday.

Arrests: While police have dispersed many of the protesters there are still thousands from the Occupy Central group gathered in the city's financial district

Protest: It is believed that the city's financial district will try to operate as normal tomorrow, despite thousands of protesters camped in the street

Crowd control: Riot police prepare to defend the Hong Kong government complex, although it was later reported that some protesters had made it inside

Standoff: Protesters have now erected barricades in the centre of Hong Kong and are preparing to settle in for the night as riot police surround them

Unrest: The night of demonstrations follows on from clashes between activists and police yesterday when students charged through a cordon and broke into the Hong Kong government complex

That came hours after police lobbed canisters of tear gas into the crowd on Sunday evening. The searing fumes sent demonstrators fleeing, though many came right back to continue their protest. The government said 26 people were taken to hospitals.

To ward off tear gas, demonstrators improvised with homemade defenses such as plastic wrap, which they used to cover their face and arms, as well as umbrellas, goggles and surgical masks.

The protests began with a class boycott last week by students urging Beijing to grant genuine democratic reforms to this former British colony.

'This is a long fight,' business and law student Edward Yau, 19, said overnight. 'The government has to understand that we have the ability to undo it if they continue to treat us like we are terrorists.'

Riot teams wearing protective headgear and carrying body-length shields faced off with crowds on one of the financial district's main streets as fumes from the gas rose above the crowds

Thousands of students and activists frantically dispersed as fumes from the gas spread among demonstrators calling for democratic reform in Hong Kong

Crowds hopped over the barriers separating some of the city's main roads to flee the streaming gas as riot police became more violent in their efforts to control crowds

When China took control of Hong Kong from the British in 1997, it agreed to a policy of 'one country, two systems' that allowed the city a high degree of control over its own affairs and kept in place liberties unseen on the mainland. It also promised the city's leader would eventually be chosen through 'universal suffrage.'

Hong Kong's residents have long felt their city stood apart from mainland China thanks to those civil liberties and separate legal and financial systems.

Beijing's insistence on using a committee to screen candidates on the basis of their patriotism to China - similar to the one that currently hand-picks Hong Kong's leaders - has stoked fears among pro-democracy groups that Hong Kong will never get genuine democracy.

University students began their class boycotts over a week ago and say they will continue them until officials meet their demands for reforming the local legislature and withdrawing the proposal to screen election candidates.

Students and activists had been camped out since late Friday on streets outside the government complex. Sunday's clashes arose when police sought to block thousands of people from entering the protest zone. Protesters spilled onto a busy highway, bringing traffic to a standstill.

The police threatened using 'a higher level of force' to stomp out the protests in Hong Kong if crowds returned to the site but were unsuccessful as hundreds stood their ground

The force threatened tougher action on the protesters if they returned to the site following the tear gas. Undeterred demonstrators did indeed come back however later in the evening

Crowds grab umbrellas and throw them above their heads in a desperate attempt to shield themselves from the gas as tensions flared during the third day of protests

A man throws his arms in the air and walks away from streaming canisters of tear gas as photographers - some of whom were wearing masks - scramble to capture the dramatic moment in Hong Kong

The Hong Kong leader C.Y. Leung backed the police's efforts to control swelling crowds as Beijing branded the previously peaceful protests 'illegal'

One of the main streets in Hong Kong's financial district was blocked as thousands of protesters staged a planned mass sit-in in the name of democratic reform

Outrage: Protestors chanted in opposition of the Hong Kong leader outside his headquarters today as their campaign for democratic reform was thwarted by police

A lone protester stands among armoured riot police waving their body-length shields as the third day of demonstrations in Hong Kong reached boiling point

Demonstrators covered their eyes with sunglasses and goggle and their mouths and noses with clingfilm to avoid breathing in tear gas at the protest

Two young demonstrators stood their ground at the scene of the protests this evening, wearing waterproof ponchos and protective eye gear in anticipation of more gas

Students and activists covered themselves entirely in protective clothing in the event more gas was distributed. One man wrapped cling film around his forearms in a bid to avoid burns

As night fell hundreds had returned to the scene with protective eyewear and waterproof ponchos in the fear that more tear gas will be distributed tonight

In a statement issued after midnight, the Hong Kong police said rumors that they had used rubber bullets to try to disperse protesters were 'totally untrue.'

Police in blue jumpsuits, wearing helmets and respirators, doused protesters with pepper spray when they tried to rip metal barricades apart.

Thousands of people breached a police cordon Sunday as they tried to join the sit-in, spilling out onto a busy highway and bringing traffic to a standstill.

Although students started the rally, leaders of the broader Occupy Central civil disobedience movement joined them early Sunday, saying they wanted to kick-start a long-threatened mass sit-in demanding Hong Kong's top leader be elected without Beijing's interference.

Occupy Central issued a statement Monday calling on Leung to resign and saying his 'non-response to the people's demands has driven Hong Kong into a crisis of disorder.' The statement added that the protest was now 'a spontaneous movement' of all Hong Kong people.

Police said they had arrested 78 people. They also took away several pro-democracy legislators who were among the demonstrators, but later released them.

A police statement said the officers 'have exercised restraint and performed their duties in a highly professional manner.' It urged the public to not occupy roads so that emergency vehicles can get through."

Activists demanding free elections for the semi-autonomous territory have been holding their hands up in the air in a symbol of non-violent protest, a gesture many in the US recognize from recent protests in Ferguson, Missouri after an unarmed 18-year-old was shot to death by police.

Most Hong Kong protesters aren’t purposefully mimicking ”hands up, don’t shoot,”as some have suggested. Instead, the gesture is a result of training and instructions from protest leaders, who have told demonstrators to raise their hands with palms forward to signal their peaceful intentions to police.

Asked about any link between the gesture and Ferguson, Icy Ng, a 22-year-old design student at Hong Kong Polytechnic University said, “I don’t think so. We have our hands up for showing both the police and media that we have no weapons in our hands.” Ng had not heard of the Ferguson protests. Another demonstrator, Ellie Ng, 24, said the gesture had nothing to do with Ferguson and is intended to demonstrate that “Hong Kong protesters are peaceful, unarmed, and mild.” (A more important symbol for the movement may be the umbrella, which protesters have been using to protect themselves against pepper spray and tear gas.)

Still, the gesture has taken on new meaning for Hong Kong residents whose relationship with the city’s police may never be the same. Hong Kong is one of the most intensively policed cities in the world, with a police force of 30,000 that rivals New York City’s but serves a fraction of New York’s population. The last time Hong Kong authorities used tear gas against demonstrators was in 2005, during demonstrations outside of a World Trade Organization meeting, and in 1967, when leftist activists rioted throughout the city.

Now, residents are shocked by images of students being tear gassed and elderly demonstrators being pepper sprayed in the face, footage that has prompted more protesters to join demonstrations on Monday.

A transgender teenager who committed suicide left a heartbreaking note saying she could not ever see herself being happy.

Leelah Alcorn, 17, died in the early hours of Sunday morning when she walked out into a busy road on the I-71 highway in Ohio, USA.

She had scheduled the post to to go live on her Tumblr account before she died.

In the letter Leelah from Kings Mill, Ohio, wrote that although she was born a boy, she began identifying as a girl at the age of four.

The note begins: ""If you are reading this, it means that I have committed suicide and obviously failed to delete this post from my queue.”

Leelah also spoke about growing up with strict devout Christian parents who did not understand her and had not allowed her to transition when she turned 16.

""When I was 14, I learned what transgender meant and cried of happiness. After 10 years of confusion I finally understood who I was.

""I immediately told my mom, and she reacted extremely negatively, telling me that it was that I would never truly be a girl, that God doesn’t make mistakes, that I am wrong,” said the letter.

It continued: ""I’m never going to be happy with the way I look or sound. I’m never going to have enough friends to satisfy me. I’m never going to have enough love to satisfy me. I’m never going to find a man who loves me.

""I’m never going to be happy. Either I live the rest of my life as a lonely man who wishes he were a woman or I live my life as a lonelier woman who hates herself. There’s no winning. There’s no way out.""

At the end of the note Leelah pleaded that someone needed to look at the number of transgender people who committed suicide, and do something to “fix society”.

She signed it: ""Goodbye, (Leelah) Josh Alcorn”

Leelah's mother Carla Wood Alcorn posted a tribute to her child on her Facebook, but referred to Leelah as her 'son', used her birth name, and made no mention of a suicide.

Many in the LGBT community have been angered by the disregard for Leelah’s wishes to be identified as a girl, and a Facebook group calling for Justice for Leelah Alcorn has been set up.

The Ohio resident scheduled her suicide note to appear on Tumblr hours after her death. The 16-year-old, who was born Joshua Alcorn, was hit by a tractor-trailer early Sunday morning as it sped along Interstate 71 in Union Township in Warren County, the Independent wrote.

Leelah didn’t grow up knowing what it meant to be transgender, but when she found a word to describe herself, she “cried of happiness,” the teen wrote in her suicide note. Her religious mother reacted “extremely negatively” and started taking her to Christian therapists, the note said. Her mother told her “it was a phase, that I would never truly be a girl, that God doesn’t make mistakes, that I am wrong.”

But Leelah pleaded with other parents not to make the some mistake. “Even if you are Christian or are against transgender people don’t ever say that to someone, especially your kid,” she wrote. “That won’t do anything but make them hate them self. That’s exactly what it did to me.”

“Orange is the New Black” star Laverne Cox, who is a transgender activist, didn’t comment on Leelah’s death directly. Instead, she shared the teen’s final wish. “My death needs to mean something. My death needs to be counted in the number of transgender people who commit suicide this year,” Leelah finished her message. “I want someone to look at that number and say ‘that’s f--ked up’ and fix it.” Cox also shared a message posted by Janet Mock, writer and transgender rights activist.

Leelah Alcorn, 16, stepped in front of a tractor trailer on a rural highway a few kilometres from her family home in Kings Mill, Ohio.

Her mother posted a tribute to her child on Facebook using her birth name Joshua and not mentioning the suicide.

However, the teen had published a note hours before her death on her Tumblr account explaining in detail why she had chosen to end her life.

She says that she identified as a girl from the age of four and that when she discovered that she could be transgender at aged 14 she “cried of happiness”.

“After 10 years of confusion I finally understood who I was,” she wrote.

Heartbreakingly, her devout Christian mother, Carla Wood Alcorn, refused to accept her desire to identify as a girl.

She wrote: “I immediately told my mom, and she reacted extremely negatively, telling me that it was a phase, that I would never truly be a girl, that God doesn’t make mistakes, that I am wrong.”

‘Gay conversion therapy killed my son’

Leelah went on: “If you are reading this, parents, please don’t tell this to your kids. Even if you are Christian or are against transgender people don’t ever say that to someone, especially your kid. That won’t do anything but make them hate them self. That’s exactly what it did to me.”

She was forced by her parents to see a Christian therapist who told her she was selfish and wrong and should seek God’s help. When she didn’t receive her parents’ consent to transition at aged 16 she cried herself to sleep.

She said she turned against her parents, coming out as gay at school but despite positive responses from her friends she continued to be viewed by her mum and dad as “an embarrassment” because she was not “their perfect little straight christian boy (sic)”.

Writing about her reasons for suicide she said: “I’m never going to find a man who loves me. I’m never going to be happy. Either I live the rest of my life as a lonely man who wishes he were a woman or I live my life as a lonelier woman who hates herself. There’s no winning. There’s no way out.”

She ended the note: “My death needs to mean something. My death needs to be counted in the number of transgender people who commit suicide this year. I want someone to look at that number and say “that’s f***ed up” and fix it. Fix society. Please.”

In a short Facebook tribute Carla Wood Alcorn ignored her child’s female persona, calling her Joshua and saying she had gone “home to heaven” after she was hit by a truck during “an early morning walk”.

Leelah Alcorn, 17, of Kings Mills, Ohio, was struck and killed by a tractor-trailer on I-71 about 2:30 a.m. on Sunday, according to local media.

Posthumous posts started to appear on her Tumblr page, titled “Lazer Princess,” including her suicide note and a post apologizing to her closest friends.

“My death needs to mean something,” she wrote. “My death needs to be counted in the number of transgender people who commit suicide this year. I want someone to look at that number and say ‘that’s f---ed up’ and fix it. Fix society. Please.”

Alcorn's note explains that she has felt like a girl trapped in a boy’s body ever since she was 4. Then she cried tears of joy when she learned what transgender meant at 14.

“After 10 years of confusion I finally understood who I was,” the suicide note reads. “I immediately told my mom, and she reacted extremely negatively, telling me that it was a phase, that I would never truly be a girl, that God doesn’t make mistakes, that I am wrong.”

After her death, Alcorn’s mother was harshly criticized for referring to her child by her given name — “Joshua Ryan Alcorn” — and using male pronouns.

""My sweet 16 year old son, Joshua Ryan Alcorn went home to heaven this morning. He was out for an early morning walk and was hit by a truck,” the mother wrote.

Alcorn requested that all of her belongings and savings be donated to transgender civil rights movements and support groups.

Many people took to Twitter to mourn her death using #LeelahAlcorn and criticize the continued injustice facing transgender people today.

Similarly, members of the LGBT community and their allies have already started to organize candlelight vigils for Alcorn. One such event, called #StandUp4Leelah, is scheduled for 7 p.m. Friday in Columbus, Ohio.

“This will be a short vigil but one that we feel must take place and one that will take a moment to educate, inform, and bring our community together to work towards a dream of one life. We may not have an instant fix but it's time to make it better,” the organizer wrote on the event's Facebook page.

Suicide rates in the transgender community are exceptionally high, with more than 50 percent of transgender teens reporting at least one suicide attempt by their 20th birthday, according to the Youth Suicide Prevention Program.

Why we wrote about this: ""As the mother of teenagers, my heart breaks for this family,"" said Enquirer Editor Carolyn Washburn. ""But this suicide took place in a very public place and manner; we needed to explain what happened. And it raises important issues we hope will prompt conversations in families throughout our region.""

In life, Leelah Alcorn felt alone. Born male, she feared she would never be the woman she felt like inside.

In death, the transgender 17-year-old - born Josh Alcorn - wanted to make sure others never felt the way she did.

""The only way I will rest in peace is if one day transgender people aren't treated the way I was, they're treated like humans, with valid feelings and human rights,"" Alcorn wrote in a post on the social media blog site Tumblr.

""My death needs to mean something,"" she wrote in the post, which she scheduled to appear the day after her death.

That plea marked her final public words.

On Sunday, just before 2:30 a.m., Alcorn walked 4 miles from her middle-class Kings Mills neighborhood with its views of Kings Island to Interstate 71. There, she was struck and killed by a tractor-trailer. The highway was closed for more than a hour.

By Tuesday evening, Leelah's story had become a worldwide story - one of how transgender teens often feel alone and afraid. The hashtag #LeelahAlcorn was topping Twitter; news sites worldwide had picked up the story; and someone had even created a Wikipedia page for Alcorn.

The State Highway Patrol continues to investigate; no charges have been filed. Her body was sent to the Montgomery County coroner for an autopsy, which will take several weeks.

Alcorn's family declined to comment to The Enquirer. In a statement via the Kings Local School District, the family requested privacy.

Alcorn's mother, Carla Wood Alcorn, wrote on Facebook Sunday, ""My sweet 16-year-old son, Joshua Ryan Alcorn, went home to Heaven this morning. He was out for an early morning walk and was hit by a truck. Thank you for the messages and kindness and concern you have sent our way. Please continue to keep us in your prayers."" The post has since been taken down.

According to the school statement, Alcorn attended Kings schools and was most recently enrolled as an 11th grader at the Ohio Virtual Academy, an online school.

""Joshua Alcorn was a sweet, talented, tender-hearted 17-year-old,"" the statement from Kings read. Counselors will be available when students return from winter break.

Before her death, Alcorn scheduled her note to post on her Tumblr blog at 5:30 p.m. the day of her death. A note titled ""Sorry"" came later. In it she told her younger brother and sisters she loved them. She thanked her friend Abby Jones for ""dealing with my pathetic problems."" And she told her mom and dad, ""You just can't control other people like that.""

Forty-eight hours after the first note was posted on Tumblr, it had 82,272 views.

There are no national statistics about how many transgender people commit suicide, partly because it's not always known.

In 2010, the National Center for Transgender Equality and the National Gay and Lesbian Task Force reported 41 percent of 7,000 transgender people surveyed had attempted suicide.

An analysis of the survey responses by the American Foundation for Suicide Prevention and UCLA Law School's Williams Institute last January showed transgenders who experienced rejection by family and friends, discrimination, victimization or violence have a higher risk of attempting suicide.

Cincinnati City Councilman Chris Seelbach, the city's first openly gay councilman, has taken on Alcorn's cause. In a post on Facebook - shared more than 4,700 times - Seelbach said Alcorn's death shows just how hard it is to be a transgender today in the U.S.

""By reading her letter, Leelah makes it clear she wants her death to, in some ways, help 'trans civil rights movements,'"" he wrote.

A Kings Island caricaturist

Jones met Alcorn last spring when Alcorn, a talented artist, applied to work as a caricaturist at Kings Island.

Alcorn's work was the best of any new employee. They drew caricatures of each other and a friendship took root.

""She was super bubbly and upbeat, with a really brash sense of humor; she could make anyone laugh,"" said Jones, 17, of Milford.

Jones drew Alcorn as Elsa from ""Frozen.""

""It was her favorite thing ever,"" Jones said.

Living far from each other, they would get together before and after work. They saw ""Fault in Our Stars."" They got ice cream.

They texted. A lot.

During late-night texting in July, Alcorn wrote, ""I have something to tell you.""

She came out as transgender.

The whole story spilled. Jones recounted Alcorn's story, much the way Alcorn herself talked in her online note.

Freshman year of high school, Alcorn came out as gay as a way to transition. Her friends were kind. She wrote her family ""wanted me to be their perfect little straight Christian boy, and that's obviously not what I wanted.""

She had never really understood what she was feeling. At 14, she finally understood. But, she said, her family didn't understand.

""She would get really down, there was just no talking her out of it,"" Jones said. ""She always said, 'Nothing is going to get better, I am never going to transition successfully, I am never going to be the pretty girl I want to be.' ""

Shane Morgan, founder and chair of TransOhio, which provides education and advocacy, said 2014 has been a year filled with progress for transgender people.

""If we look back at 2014 there have been really incredible changes and liberation for trans people across the world,"" Morgan said. ""There were prominent faces on TV and on the cover of Time and that is all fantastic. But there have been a lot of murders of trans people this year; trans people are still being victimized and still being disrespected.

""Nobody should commit suicide because of who they are,"" Morgan said. ""With as much change as there has been, there is still much to do.""

Josh Wagoner with the local chapter of the Gay, Lesbian and Straight Education Network says several young people struggle with this same issue.



""When I heard about Leelah I was, and am, really troubled that someone so close to us felt so alone,"" he said. ""A person who is trans is always experiencing a difference around, not just their orientation, who they love, who they're attracted to, but also who they are.""



""It's horrible that people think that that's the only option they have,"" added Nicki Sullivan.



Nicki Sullivan knows all too well what it's like to raise a transgender child. Earlier this year, amid controversy, Sullivan made public her 7 year olds identity is now female, despite being born male. She says her daughter Ella is happier now, but it still presents challenges.



""It's always emotional though because she comes home from school crying, comes home from school excited. You never know I guess what exactly is going to happen that day,"" said Sullivan.



The Greater Cincinnati Youth Group meets every week to engage young people struggling with these same issues and Wagoner encourages anyone who needs help to start here.



""When middle school age and high school age come to that they really get the sense that there are people who are a lot like them,"" said Wagoner.

The 17-year-old Ohio teen left a suicide note blaming her Christian parents for her death. Leelah was upset that her parents would not allow her to get the gender transitioning surgery she desired.

Alcorn left a suicide note on her Tumblr account which has since gone viral. Posting the suicide note, Leelah Alcorn said her parents refused to acknowledge her gender and forbid her from transitioning into a female.

The Leelah Alcorn suicide note begins by stating, “If you are reading this, it means that I have committed suicide and obviously failed to delete this post from my queue.”

The note posted by the transgender teenager was scheduled to post just several hours after Alcorn committed suicide by walking onto Ohio I-71 in the Kings Mill area and stepping in front of a tractor-trailer.

Ohio transgender teen Joshua Alcorn committed suicide and blame Christian parents.

“When I was 14, I learned what transgender meant and cried of happiness. After 10 years of confusion I finally understood who I was,” Leelah Acorn’s suicide note said. “I immediately told my mom and she reacted extremely negatively, telling me that is was a phase, that I would never truly be a girl, that God doesn’t make mistakes, that I am wrong.”

The transgender teen went on to say that her parents would not allow her to transition and began taking her to Christian therapists who allegedly told her that she was “selfish and wrong.” Alcorn added in the suicide note, “I formed a sort of a f**k you attitude towards my parents and came out as gay at school, thinking that maybe if I eased into coming out as trans, it would be less of a shock. Although the reaction from my friends was positive, my parents were pissed. They felt like I was attacking their image, and that I was an embarrassment to them.”

Leelah’s viral suicide note goes on to state, “They wanted me to be their prefect little straight Christian boy, and that’s obviously not what I wanted. On my 16th birthday, when I didn’t receive consent from my parents to start transitioning, I cried myself to sleep.”

“I’m never going to be happy. Either I live the rest of my life as a lonely man who wishes he were a woman or I live my life as a lonelier woman, who hates herself.”

Another excerpt from the suicide letter reads, “So they took me out of public school, took away my laptop and phone, and forbid me of getting on any sort of social media, completely isolating me from my friends. This was probably the part of my life when I was the most depressed, and I’m surprised I didn’t kill myself. I was completely alone for five months. No friends, no support, no love. Just my parent’s disappointment and the cruelty of loneliness. At the end of the school year, my parents finally came around and gave me my phone and let me back on social media. I was excited, I finally had my friends back. They were extremely excited to see me and talk to me, but only at first. Eventually, they realized they didn’t actually give a sh*t about me, and I felt even lonelier than I did before. The only friends I thought I had only liked me because they saw me five times a week.”

The remainder of Leelah’s suicide letter states, “After a summer of having almost no friends plus the weight of having to think about college, save money for moving out, keep my grades up, go to church each week and feel like sh*t because everyone there is against everything I live for, I have decided I’ve had enough. I’m never going to transition successfully, even when I move out. I’m never going to be happy with the way I look or sound. I’m never going to have enough friends to satisfy me. I’m never going to have enough love to satisfy me. I’m never going to find a man who loves me. I’m never going to be happy. There’s no way out. I’m sad enough already, I don’t need my life to get any worse. People say ‘it gets better’ but that isn’t true in my case. It gets worse. Each day I get worse.

Carla Wood Alcorn posted a memorial tribute to her child on Facebook, but reportedly made no mention of the suicide or any reference to her child’s transgender identity or adopted name. A Facebook group, entitled Justice for Leelah Alcorn, has been created.

We’re at a loss for words right now. Our hearts are completely broken by this news.

17-year-old transgender teen Leelah Alcorn, also known as Joshua Alcorn, was killed after being struck by a tractor-trailer on a highway in Ohio around 2:30 a.m.

The death, however, was NOT accidental.

Leelah took her own life and detailed exactly why she was killing herself in a lengthy and heart-shattering suicide note posted to her tumblr page.

[ Related: Salvation Army Documents Show LGBTQ Discrimination ]

After explaining to her followers why exactly they were seeing the note, she revealed she took her own life because she was never accepted for being transgender.

Especially from her family.

Some of the more gut-wrenching parts of her note are as follows:

“When I was 14, I learned what transgender meant and cried of happiness. After 10 years of confusion I finally understood who I was. I immediately told my mom, and she reacted extremely negatively, telling me that it was a phase, that I would never truly be a girl, that God doesn’t make mistakes, that I am wrong. If you are reading this, parents, please don’t tell this to your kids. Even if you are Christian or are against transgender people don’t ever say that to someone, especially your kid. That won’t do anything but make them hate them self. That’s exactly what it did to me…. When I was 16 I realized that my parents would never come around, and that I would have to wait until I was 18 to start any sort of transitioning treatment, which absolutely broke my heart. The longer you wait, the harder it is to transition. I felt hopeless, that I was just going to look like a man in drag for the rest of my life. On my 16th birthday, when I didn’t receive consent from my parents to start transitioning, I cried myself to sleep. I formed a sort of a “fuck you” attitude towards my parents and came out as gay at school, thinking that maybe if I eased into coming out as trans it would be less of a shock. Although the reaction from my friends was positive, my parents were pissed. They felt like I was attacking their image, and that I was an embarrassment to them. They wanted me to be their perfect little straight christian boy, and that’s obviously not what I wanted… I have decided I’ve had enough. I’m never going to transition successfully, even when I move out. I’m never going to be happy with the way I look or sound. I’m never going to have enough friends to satisfy me. I’m never going to have enough love to satisfy me. I’m never going to find a man who loves me. I’m never going to be happy. Either I live the rest of my life as a lonely man who wishes he were a woman or I live my life as a lonelier woman who hates herself. There’s no winning… That’s the gist of it, that’s why I feel like killing myself. Sorry if that’s not a good enough reason for you, it’s good enough for me. As for my will, I want 100% of the things that I legally own to be sold and the money (plus my money in the bank) to be given to trans civil rights movements and support groups, I don’t give a shit which one. The only way I will rest in peace is if one day transgender people aren’t treated the way I was, they’re treated like humans, with valid feelings and human rights. Gender needs to be taught about in schools, the earlier the better. My death needs to mean something. My death needs to be counted in the number of transgender people who commit suicide this year. I want someone to look at that number and say “that’s fucked up” and fix it. Fix society. Please.“

Leelah shall not be forgotten. Her life will NOT be in vain.

Leelah Alcorn, born Joshua Ryan Alcorn, was walking along Interstate 71 when she was hit and killed by a semi-truck around 2:30 a.m. on the morning of Sunday, December 28. The local news accounts refer to Alcorn as male, but she blogged frequently on a Tumblr called ""Lazer Princess"" about living as a trans teen. Judging by the Tumblr, she was a fan of Sailor Moon, feminism, and stockings with cats on them; she regularly re-blogged inspirational photos of trans adults.

It's also where she published a post titled ""Suicide Note,"" which she had pre-scheduled before her death. From the beginning of the note:

If you are reading this, it means that I have committed suicide and obviously failed to delete this post from my queue. Please don't be sad, it's for the better. The life I would've lived isn't worth living in… because I'm transgender. I could go into detail explaining why I feel that way, but this note is probably going to be lengthy enough as it is. To put it simply, I feel like a girl trapped in a boy's body, and I've felt that way ever since I was 4. I never knew there was a word for that feeling, nor was it possible for a boy to become a girl, so I never told anyone and I just continued to do traditionally ""boyish"" things to try to fit in. When I was 14, I learned what transgender meant and cried of happiness. After 10 years of confusion I finally understood who I was. I immediately told my mom, and she reacted extremely negatively, telling me that it was a phase, that I would never truly be a girl, that God doesn't make mistakes, that I am wrong. If you are reading this, parents, please don't tell this to your kids. Even if you are Christian or are against transgender people don't ever say that to someone, especially your kid. That won't do anything but make them hate them self. That's exactly what it did to me. My mom started taking me to a therapist, but would only take me to christian therapists, (who were all very biased) so I never actually got the therapy I needed to cure me of my depression. I only got more christians telling me that I was selfish and wrong and that I should look to God for help. When I was 16 I realized that my parents would never come around, and that I would have to wait until I was 18 to start any sort of transitioning treatment, which absolutely broke my heart. The longer you wait, the harder it is to transition. I felt hopeless, that I was just going to look like a man in drag for the rest of my life. On my 16th birthday, when I didn't receive consent from my parents to start transitioning, I cried myself to sleep.

Alcorn apparently believed she'd never be able to transition successfully. She concludes:

After a summer of having almost no friends plus the weight of having to think about college, save money for moving out, keep my grades up, go to church each week and feel like shit because everyone there is against everything I live for, I have decided I've had enough. I'm never going to transition successfully, even when I move out. I'm never going to be happy with the way I look or sound. I'm never going to have enough friends to satisfy me. I'm never going to have enough love to satisfy me. I'm never going to find a man who loves me. I'm never going to be happy. Either I live the rest of my life as a lonely man who wishes he were a woman or I live my life as a lonelier woman who hates herself. There's no winning. There's no way out. I'm sad enough already, I don't need my life to get any worse. People say ""it gets better"" but that isn't true in my case. It gets worse. Each day I get worse. That's the gist of it, that's why I feel like killing myself. Sorry if that's not a good enough reason for you, it's good enough for me. As for my will, I want 100% of the things that I legally own to be sold and the money (plus my money in the bank) to be given to trans civil rights movements and support groups, I don't give a shit which one. The only way I will rest in peace is if one day transgender people aren't treated the way I was, they're treated like humans, with valid feelings and human rights. Gender needs to be taught about in schools, the earlier the better. My death needs to mean something. My death needs to be counted in the number of transgender people who commit suicide this year. I want someone to look at that number and say ""that's fucked up"" and fix it. Fix society. Please.

On Facebook, Alcorn's mother has written, ""My sweet 16 year old son, Joshua Ryan Alcorn went home to heaven this morning. He was out for an early morning walk and was hit by a truck."" The message has been shared repeatedly by people who are upset that she is misgendering her child.

This is gut-wrenching, and it was avoidable. On Twitter, trans activists are mourning Leelah:

When I was 16 I realized that my parents would never come around, and that I would have to wait until I was 18 to start any sort of transitioning treatment, which absolutely broke my heart. The longer you wait, the harder it is to transition. I felt hopeless, that I was just going to look like a man in drag for the rest of my life. On my 16th birthday, when I didn’t receive consent from my parents to start transitioning, I cried myself to sleep.

I formed a sort of a “f*** you” attitude towards my parents and came out as gay at school, thinking that maybe if I eased into coming out as trans it would be less of a shock. Although the reaction from my friends was positive, my parents were pissed. They felt like I was attacking their image, and that I was an embarrassment to them. They wanted me to be their perfect little straight christian boy, and that’s obviously not what I wanted.

So they took me out of public school, took away my laptop and phone, and forbid me of getting on any sort of social media, completely isolating me from my friends. This was probably the part of my life when I was the most depressed, and I’m surprised I didn’t kill myself. I was completely alone for 5 months. No friends, no support, no love. Just my parent’s disappointment and the cruelty of loneliness.

At the end of the school year, my parents finally came around and gave me my phone and let me back on social media. I was excited, I finally had my friends back. They were extremely excited to see me and talk to me, but only at first. Eventually they realized they didn’t actually give a s**t about me, and I felt even lonelier than I did before. The only friends I thought I had only liked me because they saw me five times a week.

After a summer of having almost no friends plus the weight of having to think about college, save money for moving out, keep my grades up, go to church each week and feel like s**t because everyone there is against everything I live for, I have decided I’ve had enough. I’m never going to transition successfully, even when I move out. I’m never going to be happy with the way I look or sound. I’m never going to have enough friends to satisfy me. I’m never going to have enough love to satisfy me. I’m never going to find a man who loves me. I’m never going to be happy. Either I live the rest of my life as a lonely man who wishes he were a woman or I live my life as a lonelier woman who hates herself. There’s no winning. There’s no way out. I’m sad enough already, I don’t need my life to get any worse. People say “it gets better” but that isn’t true in my case. It gets worse. Each day I get worse.

That’s the gist of it, that’s why I feel like killing myself. Sorry if that’s not a good enough reason for you, it’s good enough for me. As for my will, I want 100% of the things that I legally own to be sold and the money (plus my money in the bank) to be given to trans civil rights movements and support groups, I don’t give a s**t which one. The only way I will rest in peace is if one day transgender people aren’t treated the way I was, they’re treated like humans, with valid feelings and human rights. Gender needs to be taught about in schools, the earlier the better. My death needs to mean something. My death needs to be counted in the number of transgender people who commit suicide this year. I want someone to look at that number and say “that’s f***ed up” and fix it. Fix society. Please.

As he was boarding American Airlines Flight 1140, headed to Dallas on Tuesday, an airline employee wished him a ""Merry Christmas,"" according to the New York Post.

He lectured the employee about how it was inappropriate to say that to everyone, because not everyone celebrates the holiday. Unfortunately that was not the end of it. The Post:

Once on the plane, he was warmly greeted by a flight attendant who also wished him a “merry Christmas.” That was the last straw. “Don’t say, ‘Merry Christmas!’ ” the man raged before lecturing the attendants and the pilot about their faux pas.

The crew was unable to calm the man, and he was eventually removed from the flight (to the cheers of the other passengers).

Jonathan Daly, who commented below, says he was on the flight and did not think that the passenger was behaving in an irate manner.

""He was not acting crazy, or in anyway cranky, but simply calmly explaining to cops why he got into an argument with the flight crew,"" he said.

The flight left LaGuardia about 40 minutes late, according to FlightAware.

For proper greeting etiquette, Mashable turns to Miss Manners, who says annoyance at ""Merry Christmas"" is understandable but ""friendly overtures require pleasant replies.""

""While some people are offended by 'Christmas,' because they do not celebrate it, even more are offended by 'merry' because they do not feel it,"" she says.

But even though it's proper to respond to a well-intentioned greeting in kind, the holiday spirit can be a little overwhelming this time of year.

The small time capsule is believed to contain items such as old coins, documents, newspapers and a metal plate that was owned by Revere.

Secretary of State William Galvin speculated that some of the items could have deteriorated over time.

Official plan to X-ray the capsule on Sunday at Boston's Museum of Fine Arts to get some idea of the contents and possibly details on their condition, then open it next week.

Originally made of cowhide, the time capsule was believed to have been embedded in the cornerstone when construction on the state Capitol began in 1795. Adams was governor of Massachusetts at the time.

The time capsule was removed in the mid-19th century and its contents transferred to a copper box, Galvin said. Its removal Thursday was due to an ongoing water filtration project at the building. Galvin said the plan is to return it to the site sometime next year.

Pamela Hatchfield, a conservator at the museum, was exhausted Thursday after spending hours chiseling and drilling on the massive cornerstone, taking care not to damage the time capsule or coins that were thrown in the mortar that held it in place.

She held up the capsule for viewing by state officials, reporters and contractors involved in the renovation of the Statehouse.

'It's heavy,' Hatchfield said. 'I feel happy and relieved and excited and really interested to see what's in this box.'

Hatchfield said state officials did not know that the time capsule was embedded in the cornerstone until 60 years after some of the nation's leading founding political figures put it there.

'It was first put in there in 1795 by Paul Revere and Sam Adams and was unearthed accidentally when in 1855 there were some amendments to the building,' Hatchfield said. 'They put the contents back into a new box and placed it in a depression in the stone, which is on the underside.'

Galvin said there were notes from 1855 indicating that officials washed some of the contents in the capsule with acid before putting them in the new copper box.

It also was a humid day when the items were restored and, Galvin said, the corner of the Statehouse where the capsule was fixed has had a water leakage problem for 30 years.

'We have to see what held up since that time,' he said. 'That's the biggest question we have right now — are the contents in good condition or not?'

Galvin said the Massachusetts Statehouse is one of the oldest, active statehouses in the country.

'Obviously, when we talk about the original box being presided over by then-Gov. Sam Adams, Paul Revere, it's pretty significant,' he said. 'I'm very fond of saying ... that the history of Massachusetts is the history of America, and it's very true and this is another evidence of that.'"

More than two centuries later, a recently unearthed time capsule he buried with fellow revolutionary Samuel Adams -- the man whom Revere was riding to see that night to warn that the British were coming -- has got his former city, state and most of the Internet abuzz.

The artifact was unearthed Thursday thanks to a water leak near its resting place inside a cornerstone at the Massachusetts State House in Boston.

When workers investigating the leak stumbled upon it, Secretary of State William Galvin, who heads the state historical commission, called Pamela Hatchfield, the head of object conservation at Boston's Museum of Fine Arts.

""There was a big discussion about whether or not it should be removed,"" Hatchfield told Brooke Baldwin on ""CNN Newsroom"" on Friday. ""(But) because there was water infiltration in that area of the building, it was decided that we'd try to see if we could find it, investigate and see whether the box was still intact.""

Hatchfield spent seven hours Thursday delicately and painstakingly chipping away at the stone to extricate it.

""The contents are of concern, but the plaster that held the box in place is in good condition,"" Galvin said.

According to Galvin, the box-shaped capsule was placed by the Revolutionary-era duo in 1795, a year when Adams was governor and when construction began on the State House and its iconic dome, which would eventually be overlaid with copper by Revere.

Both he and Hatchfield said that based on historical records, the box is believed to contain coins, a plate and a Revere-inscribed plaque -- but no one knows for sure.

""It may contain other stuff, too,"" said Galvin. ""We don't know that yet.""

But we might soon: Galvin, whose office is inside the State House, said the capsule's contents are expected to be revealed sometime next week.

For now, it's getting some TLC and a thorough exam -- including X-rays over the weekend -- by the museum's staff.

This is not the first time this capsule was unearthed. In 1855 it was dug up during emergency repairs to the State House and put back in place, something that has Hatchfield ""a little worried.""

""We're a little worried because in 1855, they cleaned the contents with acid,"" she said. ""So we're a little concerned that things maybe deteriorated inside.""

Galvin sounded more optimistic.

""There were some coins that were tossed in the 1855 ceremony in the mix of the mortar. They are in good condition, so we are optimistic that the box itself has withstood the test of time and that it will therefore be holding the contents securely,"" he said.

Galvin told CNN affiliate WBZ the capsule will probably be returned to the State House, and that he's mulling both a new container for the capsule and new items from the current era.

And excited. And really interested to see what’s in this box,” she said Thursday night, after posing for a selfie with the capsule for her mom. The extrication took more than seven hours and involved about a dozen workers.

After a full day spent lying on her back on a muddy wooden plank, chipping with painstaking care at the underside of a stone block to free the time capsule hidden within, Museum of Fine Arts conservator Pam Hatchfield sat up in front of the State House to a round of applause, a green box held delicately in her hands.

The original contents of the time capsule were first placed in 1795 by Governor Samuel Adams, Paul Revere, and William Scollay in a ceremony that started in downtown Boston and proceeded to the State House, according to historical accounts. It was unearthed during emergency repairs to the foundation in 1855 and then buried again, and had not seen daylight until it emerged on Thursday.

“Hopefully there will be no damage and we will be able to observe the artifacts that trace us back to the history not only just of this building, but of our Commonwealth and our country,” said Secretary of State William Galvin, who was on hand for the capsule’s first appearance in more than 150 years.

The capsule is believed to include a collection of silver and copper coins dating from between 1652 and 1855; an engraved silver plate; newspapers; the seal of the Commonwealth; cards; and a title page from the Massachusetts Colony Records, according to Meghan Kelly, a spokeswoman for the Executive Office of Administration and Finance.

Hatchfield, who is head of Objects Conservation at the Museum of Fine Arts, said the corroded copper alloy box that holds the collection was undamaged by the removal process, and appeared to be in good shape. It was a little smaller than a cigar box and, she said, heavier than she expected.

The box was taken by State Police escort to the Museum of Fine Arts, where Hatchfield said it will be X-rayed to determine the contents. There was some concern, Galvin said, that there may be some damage to some of the coins, which may have been washed in acid before the box was reburied in 1855.

“It will be opened probably sometime next week,” said Galvin. The contents will be examined, he said, but the time capsule will not remain unburied. “Ultimately it will be put back in the box and ultimately back in the stone.”

Galvin said officials have not yet decided whether they will add any objects to the capsule before re-burying it. The capsule was discovered during the course of a water infiltration investigation at the State House, which identified the corner where it was hidden as an area of concern.

It is believed to be one of the oldest time capsules in the state, according to Kelly. In October, a century-old time capsule was opened after it was removed from its perch in the head of a golden lion statue that had sat atop the Old State House in downtown Boston. Its contents included sealed letters, photographs, and newspaper articles in near-perfect condition.

On Thursday, excavation of the State House time capsule began at about 9 a.m., with workers unwedging the stone block from the corner of the building and propping it up on blocks of wood so Hatchfield could slide underneath. The block was not flipped upside down, said Hatchfield, because she did not want to risk dislodging any of the contents.

From about 10:30 a.m. to 4:30 p.m., Hatchfield tapped away at the block, taking periodic breaks to warm up away from the whipping wind and snow. Workers brought her a space heater. The plaster that sealed the box in, she said, was much harder than she anticipated.

As she worked, tiny coins fell out of the plaster. During the 1855 reburial, public officials threw the coins in for good luck. Michael Comeau, executive director of the State Archives, said they appeared to be silver.

As the day wore on, Hatchfield used a small circular saw and a drill to try to free the capsule, and several times, she appeared to think she was close, only to have the box remain stuck. It was the most physically challenging conservation job she has ever done, she said.

“I have been privileged to spend all of my working life handling incredibly precious and important objects, and it is very exciting every single time,” said Hatchfield. “The sense of continuation of history that you get by entering a museum or historic site, but also by having it in your hands, is incredibly rewarding and enriching. And it gives meaning to a lot of people.”

Conner's boyfriend, De’Angelas Lee, was reportedly driving the car out of the gas station when police opened fire.

Conner says he was trying to drive around the officers. However, police say he was driving toward them, and that the officer fired because he feared for his own safety, according to local media. The bean bag round hit and shattered the front passenger window.

A pregnant woman has lost an eye after cops reportedly fired a BEAN BAG round through a car window during the Ferguson riots.

Violence erupted in the Missouri city of Ferguson earlier this week following a grand jury decision that white policeman Darren Wilson should not face trial for the shooting of unarmed black teenager Michael Brown.

The destruction and looting that followed is believed to have cost the city millions in repair bills - and several lives have been lost.

Dornella Conner was travelling through the mayhem in the St. Louis suburb on Monday night, when a cop is reported to have fired a non-lethal bean bag round at her boyfriend's car, which smashed the window and left her with severe injuries.

“I will have justice for what they did to me,” Ms Conner wrote on Facebook on Thursday following the incident. “But I’m happy I’m alive.”

Ms Conner and her boyfriend were parked a BP petrol station when police moved in to clear the area, the New York Daily News reports.

Officers made 16 arrests after reporting gunfire coming from the petrol station.

Mirror correspondent witnesses the riots:

Police claim a driver tried to run over a cop who then fired at the car in fear for his safety.

Ms Conner's told KMOV that her boyfriend was trying to drive around police so they could escape the violence at the time.

Ms Conner's injured eye could not be saved, and she has blurred vision in the other.

Police have reportedly issued a warrant for her boyfriend's arrest.

She claims the couple were just bystanders who were caught up in the mayhem.

Dornella Conner said she and her boyfriend, De’Angelas Lee, were “just riding around and respecting Mike Brown” when they stopped at a gas station in the the 10000 block of Halls Ferry early Tuesday, KMOV St. Louis reported.

Once at the gas station, Conner said, police confronted the couple.

“They pulled up while we were coming towards the street,” she told the local TV station. “De’Angelas was trying to get away, they blocked us from the side, front and back.”

But cops are crying foul — they say it was Conner and Lee who were the aggressors during the mayhem after Lee drove the car straight at them, according to KMOV.

That’s when one of the cops fired a specialized bean bag round into the front passenger window, in order to stop the car, police said.

Broken glass went flying into Conner’s face and eyes and she was rushed to a nearby hospital, but doctors were unable to save her left eye.

“Thanks [to] all my Facebook friends for your support,” she wrote Wednesday on Facebook. “Im blind in my left eye and they took it out because i got [shot] in my face … but thank god that i can see the world.”

Conner also remained optimistic for Thanksgiving, but made it clear that she feels the police should pay for what they did.

“Im soo thankful that im here too spend thanksgiving with my family and my kids even tho im still in pain,” she wrote Thursday. “I will have justices for what they did too me but I happy im alive.”

Conner’s father, Donnell, also called for something to be done for what happened to his daughter.

“I’m very upset, very disappointed with tactics that they used trying to get control of the situation,” he told KMOV. “I understand it’s a tough job, I understand that it was chaos, [but] there was no reason to fire upon an innocent person sitting in a vehicle.”"	Pregnant woman loses eye after Ferguson cops fire bean bag	2014-11-28 00:00:00	['November']	['car', 'woman', 'loses', 'window', 'face', 'ferguson', 'eye', 'bean', 'wrote', 'conner', 'bag', 'lee', 'im', 'station', 'pregnant', 'cops', 'left']	"A pregnant woman lost her left eye when cops in Ferguson shot out a car window with a bean bag — sending shards of glass flying into her face, it was revealed on Friday.

Dornella Conner says she was at a gas station in the St Louis suburb in a car being driven by her boyfriend when an officer fired a non-lethal ‘bean bag’ round at them as they tried to drive away, showering her with glass

Police, who were responding to reports of gunshots in the area, said that the officer fired at the car because it was being driven towards him and he feared for his safety – but Conner claims that he had no need to use a weapon on them.

She told Kmov.com: ‘I didn’t have any weapons, I wasn’t looting or anything. I was just out with my boyfriend. We was just riding around respecting Mike Brown.’

Conner told the news channel that several police vehicles had blocked their exit from the gas station ‘from the side and the back’.

WHAT IS A 'BEAN BAG' ROUND? A non-lethal bean-bag round A bean-bag round, or flexible baton round, is a projectile used by law enforcement officers to incapacitate suspects without killing them. They are fired from a shotgun and take the form of lead shots housed in a small 'pillow'. They are designed not to penetrate skin, but are capable of causing muscle spasms. Deaths from bean bag rounds are rare. They have killed people in the past by causing internal bleeding, breaking the neck and even fatally damaging the heart by sending pieces of broken rib into it. Shotguns with bean-bag rounds are normally colored bright orange to prevent lethal rounds being loaded.

Conner’s father, Donnell, said he was ‘very disappointed at police tactics’. He added: ‘There was no reason to fire upon an innocent person who was sitting in a vehicle.’

Her sister, who goes by the name Tikal Goldie, said: ‘I really just want to have closure and justice for my sister.’

Meanwhile, dozens of people have interrupted holiday shopping at major retail stores around the St. Louis area to speak out about a grand jury's decision not to indict the officer who fatally shot Michael Brown.

The protests began Thanksgiving night and continued early Friday. Protesters spent a few minutes at each store, shouting inside as law enforcement stood watch. There was no immediate word of any arrests.

According to Johnetta Elzie, who had been tweeting and posting videos of the protests, demonstrations occurred at a Wal-Mart and Target in Brentwood, two Wal-Marts in St. Charles and one Wal-Mart in Manchester.

In Ferguson, where Brown was shot on August 9, it was a quiet holiday night. There were no visible protests as the National Guard patrolled the area.

Earlier thousands of Walmart employees threatened to walk out from stores across the country on the biggest shopping day of the year.

Days after a grand jury decided not to charge officer Darren Wilson, demonstrators have led a campaign not to visit stores the day after Thanksgiving.

The group has used hashtags on social media such as #HandsUpDon'tSpend, in reference to the death of the teen in August, and #BlackOutBlackFriday.

Some demonstrators showed up outside Macy's in New York as crowds gathered to get an early jump on the sales.

Others in Ferguson walked through a Target store with their hands up, as unrest continued followed the controversial decision earlier this week.

Early Tuesday morning, Dornella Conner was “riding around, respecting Mike Brown” with her boyfriend De’Angelas Lee when she was injured with flying shards of glass after police officers fired into her car with specialized “bean bag” bullets, designed to help control rioters and unruly protesters. According to Conner, she and Lee pulled up at a gas station, and were blocked off on all sides by approaching police officers before one of them fired their weapon, injuring Conner in her face. However, according to police officers, Conner’s boyfriend, De’Angelas, aggressively drove the car straight at them, which is why they decided to fire the bean bag into the car to stop their approach. Broken glass from the shattered car window flew into Conner’s eye, and despite being rushed to a hospital shortly after, doctors were unable to save her left eye.

She released a statement to Facebook:

Elon University is the latest college to replace the word with ""first-year.""

Elon University in North Carolina banned the word “freshman” from its website and student orientation, claiming it’s sexist and suggests that the young women might make good rape victims.

It’s replacing the term with “first-year.”

“The term has often been felt to refer to the vulnerableness of young women in college for the first time,” Leigh-Anne Royster, the school’s “Inclusive Community Wellbeing Director” told the College Fix.

“Given the rates of sexual violence perpetrated against women on college campuses, it is useful to examine any use of a term that suggests that a group of people just entering college might be targets for such violence in any way,” she added.

In fact, the word is apparently so dangerous that any orientation leader who dared to use it was immediately corrected.

“They engrained over and over in our brains that it was supposed to be ‘first-year,’ not ‘freshman,’” sophomore orientation leader Alaina Schukraft told the Fix. “They were very adamant . . . and stressed the importance of using language that would make the new students feel comfortable.”

Ironically, Schukraft said that multiple students approached her and said they were actually more comfortable with the word “freshman.”

But no matter. Greg Zaiser, vice president of admissions and financial planning, insists that it will make the school a better place for women — telling the Fix that people consider “freshman” to be a “sexist” word.

“As an inclusive community, Elon strives to incorporate language that is current and reflective of our student body,” Zaiser said in an e-mail to the Fix.

TALLAHASSEE — A lawyer and Florida State University alum was identified by police Thursday as the gunman whose rampage left three people wounded and sent hundreds of panicked students scrambling for exits and ducking for cover.

Officers responding to 911 calls early Thursday fatally shot Myron May, a 2005 FSU grad who had moved back into the area in recent weeks,Tallahassee Police Chief Michael DeLeo said.

""He refused to surrender and as a result he was shot and killed by officers,"" DeLeo said. DeLeo did not say whether May fired at police, a contention cited by a department spokesman earlier in the day.

DeLeo said May had written documents and made videos that discuss ""being targeted"" by the government. May's Facebook page includes Bible verses and links to conspiracy theories about the government reading people's minds.

""Mr. May was in a state of crisis ... struggling either psychologically or emotionally,"" DeLeo said.

One victim was hospitalized in critical condition and another in good condition, a spokesperson for Tallahassee Memorial HealthCare said. A third person was grazed by a bullet and was treated at the scene and released.

Campus Police Chief David Perry said classes will resume Friday and the library will reopen. He promised a strong police presence. Officials canceled classes Thursday but kept the campus open and made counseling available to students and staff.

""We will get through this as a community, we will get through this as a university,"" Perry said.

More than 300 students were in Strozier Library when the shooting began at about 12:15 a.m. DeLeo said May, firing a semiautomatic .380 caliber handgun he reloaded at least once, never got past the library lobby.

Jason Derfuss, 21, said he was leaving the library when the shooter opened fire near him. Derfuss posted on Facebook pictures of a bullet and a book, Great Medieval Thinkers: John Wyclif, which the bullet had torn through. Derfuss says in his post he was near the gunman when the shooting started, but never felt the shot and only discovered the damage three hours later.

""He was about 5 feet from me, but he hit my books,"" Derfuss said. ""I assumed I wasn't a target, I assumed I was fine. The truth is I was almost killed tonight and God intervened.""

""You never think something like this is going to happen to you until you have to react in that situation when someone is screaming there is a gun in the building. I ran for my life,"" said Allison Kope, a freshman from Cocoa Beach, Fla. ""I ran right out the back door. My laptop and everything is still in there. It was shock. It was just instinct. You don't think about anything else, you just go.""

University President John Thrasher described the shootings as an isolated incident, but also said police did ""an extraordinary job taking quick and decisive action to prevent further tragedy.""

Daniel Morales, a 19-year-old freshman from Fort Pierce, Fla., said that when he first heard someone say, ""'Somebody's got a gun.' I thought he was joking."" But after realizing a gunman was in the library, Morales and others raced to a back room on the second floor where they barricaded a door with desks.

Three freshmen who were in the DeGraff Hall dormitory at the time said they began getting reports from friends locked down in the library.

""We know there are definitely people who saw the shooter,"" Anthony Coons said.

His friend Max Martin described the surreal scene.

""You hear all these stories on the news, then it happens,"" Martin said. ""This is something you never want to happen.""

Nikolai Hernandez, who was in another dorm room nearby, said he heard ""consecutive gunshots"" that sounded as if they came from an automatic rifle.

""That was confirmed when I went outside and talked to someone who said they saw police open fire on a shooter who was armed right on the front steps of the library,"" the freshman said.

The video below was posted on Facebook by Jessica Davis. An individual can be heard over the intercom saying, ""There has been a shooting in the library. Stay where you are,"" and instructing people to call 911 if they have been shot.

Students were allowed to leave the library about 3 a.m. Before that, students were on lockdown at the campus' library and in dorms.

FSU police issued an alert warning its 40,000 students that read: ""Dangerous Situation! Main Campus — Tallahassee. Seek shelter immediately, away from doors and windows.""

""If there is any positive news we can take from this occurrence, (it) is that the victim count was not higher,"" Tallahassee Mayor-elect Andrew Gillum said.

Social media immediately lit up with messages of concern and prayer requests.

A Texas turkey farm employee is now under quarantine after he tested positive for the Ebola virus. Texas Prime Turkey Farm, the largest supplier of turkeys in the United States, has been ordered by the CDC to quarantine over 250,000 holiday turkeys. The CDC has confirmed 3,000 turkeys have tested positive for the virus since Friday’s incident.

According to investigators, long time employee Philip Canseco was seen vomiting in the facilities restroom three days prior to the incident on Friday. “I was passing by the restroom, when I heard somebody throwing up inside,” said one Texas Prime Turkey Farm employee. “I opened the door and looked inside and saw Canseco throwing up in one of the urinals. I asked him if he was okay, he said yes, and I left. I didn’t want to get close to him and get sick.”

Management confirmed that Canseco worked three full work days at the facility with flu-like symptoms, before passing out unconscious with a fever of 106°. Due to his symptoms, he was rushed to a local hazmat tent where he tested positive for the Ebola virus. The CDC reports an additional 7 coworkers are being quarantined and tested. However, they have not released those results as of yet.

The facility has been ordered by the CDC to burn their entire flock of turkeys, over 250,000. Texas Prime Turkey Farm is requesting permission from the state of Texas to send the shipment of incinerated turkey ashes to Veolia’s Port Arthur environmental waste facility. This facility has already accepted one shipment of Ebola waste from household goods where Thomas Eric Duncan had stayed. Duncan was the first man to die of Ebola on US soil.

Activists are protesting the shipments of contaminated Ebola waste to their community. “We feel every precaution should be taken to protect our community, our children and our elderly. We are not a dumping ground for the nations, or the world’s bio waste.”

Plant manager Mitch Osborne said on Saturday that even though no contract has yet been signed, the plant will likely receive the second shipment of contaminated Ebola waste. “It is a safe and sound process,” Osborne said. “I am not going to place my employees in harms way, or the community. The company is here to improve the environment and I believe we are doing a pretty darn good job of that. I believe we are doing the right and safe thing.”

A spokesperson for Texas Prime Turkey Farm said there is a good chance Ebola turkeys may have already shipped out to major suppliers for distribution. Each retailer will have to perform recalls individually if they feel they have received a contaminated shipment.

The historic move marked a public about-face for Bratton, who earlier this year vowed NYPD practices wouldn’t change after the Brooklyn district attorney’s decision not to prosecute first-time offenders for low-level pot possession.

Sources said the new policy was ordered by de Blasio, whose campaign promises included ending marijuana arrests that overwhelmingly targeted minorities.

“It began with the mayor, as his initiative,” said an elected official familiar with the issue. “It was something very dear to the mayor that had to happen, no matter what.”

Bratton, the sources noted, did not resist de Blasio’s directive.

The NYPD declined to comment. City Hall credited both men with the idea.

“This is a joint policy initiative, developed and implemented by Commissioner Bratton and the leadership team at the NYPD, and fully supported by the mayor,” a de Blasio spokesman said.

Joined by de Blasio at 1 Police Plaza, Bratton said he and other police officials had been working on the change in policing tactics for “the last number of months.” Under the new policy, people busted for possessing 25 grams or less of pot — a violation under New York law — will no longer be cuffed, hauled off to a police station, fingerprinted and booked.

Bratton held up a plastic sandwich bag stuffed almost full of oregano to illustrate how big a stash was at issue.

“To give you, the public, a sense of what 25 grams of marijuana would look like, that’s about it,” he said.

“It’s not a large amount.”

Chief Thomas Purtell of the NYPD’s Organized Crime Control Bureau put the value of that much actual weed at $300.

The new policy covers only marijuana that appears to be for “personal use,” rather than for sale. Anyone caught smoking in public will still be subject to arrest regardless of the amount of pot in view, the commissioner said.

Other exceptions to the no-arrest rule include people with open arrest warrants, those wanted in connection with active investigations or pot carriers who don’t have identification.

Bratton said the policy would be put into writing and a training video would be shown to cops during roll call before it goes into effect on Nov. 19.

But law-enforcement sources said an unwritten version of the policy was enacted “on the command level” about a year and a half ago under then-Police Commissioner Ray Kelly.

“If you saw someone smoking a joint, you would bring them back to the precinct and give them a summons if they didn’t have a record,” a source said.

Kelly declined to comment Monday.

The new policy effectively neutralizes Brooklyn DA Ken Thompson’s refusal to prosecute low-level pot arrests, which he said were clogging the justice system and taking “an unnecessary toll on offenders.”

It also maintains a revenue stream for the city, because the summonses carry fines of up to $100 for first-time offenders and up to $250 for second-timers.

In a statement, Thompson said, “I applaud Mayor de Blasio’s decision.” which he called “similar to the approach that I have taken in Brooklyn.”

But he said he was “concerned about the due-process rights” of Brooklynites who get issued pot summonses, because almost all Brooklyn violations are prosecuted in Manhattan Criminal Court.

De Blasio described the new policy as a win-win, especially for young minorities, saying, “We don’t want to saddle people who have made one small mistake with something that will follow them for the rest of their lives.”

“It will certainly be good for New Yorkers of color, and particularly young people of color,” the mayor said.

“When an individual is arrested, even for the smallest possession of marijuana, it hurts their chances to get a good job, it hurts their chances to get housing, it hurts their chances to qualify for a student loan — it can literally follow them the rest of their lives and saddle young people with challenges that for many are very, very difficult to overcome,” the mayor said.

“I think you will see fewer unnecessary arrests,” he said.

Monday’s announcement followed a Post report last week that revealed the NYPD had stopped marijuana “buy and bust” operations to focus on harder drugs.

Bratton called the article “false” Monday while admitting he had changed strategy to target only “significant” drug sales.

Law-enforcement sources on Monday confirmed the accuracy of the Post report and said they weren’t surprised by Bratton’s attempt to dance around the issue.

“You can’t go on the record that you’re pulling back on marijuana arrests when it’s a law on the books,” one source said.

Elected officials and activists in New York are reacting positively to the city's new policy that loosens how it treats people found in possession of marijuana.

Many had earlier said that young minority males often were the subject of arrests for marijuana possession, and asserted that punishment for what they considered a relatively minor crime could often affect a person's entire future.

""In light of the fact that there have been a disproportionate amount of blacks and browns subjected to low level marijuana arrests, as well as the fact that many cities around the country are legalizing marijuana use, it is timely for the City of New York to revise its policies,"" said the Rev. Al Sharpton, a New York City-based activist, in a statement.

""With excessive gun violence, hard drug trafficking, and other criminal ills that have plagued our community, I feel that the police ought to concentrate on things of importance rather than things that are now being legalized in many places around the country,"" he said.

Starting Nov. 19, anyone found with less than 25 grams of the drug on them will be issued a summons rather than being arrested, the administration of Mayor Bill de Blasio announced Monday. The only caveat is there must not be a warrant out for the person's arrest and they must not be found near a location that presents extra concern, such as a school, according to the city.

""This new policy will reduce unnecessary arrests for minor marijuana possession and put an end to an era where many of young New Yorkers were being arrested and saddled with criminal records for minor violations,"" de Blasio said. ""Today's action is the latest in a series of steps Commissioner Bratton and I have taken to rebuild the relationship between the NYPD and the communities they serve. We are also enhancing public safety with this new initiative by directing police resources towards more serious crime, and not wasting officer time processing unnecessary arrests.""

Voices of dissent with the current policy were underscored by Brooklyn District Attorney Ken Thompson, who said in July that he would not prosecute low-level marijuana possession cases because of the concerns about how such arrests can affect the lives of young, minority men.

Five black and Hispanic members of the New York City Council applauded the mayor's move and said that on Oct. 31, they jointly sent a letter to the mayor and Police Commissioner Bill Bratton calling for an end to such arrests.

""The mayor and commissioner have taken a significant step towards ensuring fewer New Yorkers face the consequences that arrest records bring,"" read a joint statement from the council members: Ritchie Torres, Rafael Espinal, Carlos Menchaca, Antonio Reynoso and Donovan Richards.

""We commend the mayor and commissioner for this move, and we will continue to monitor its implementation,"" the council members said. ""The relationship between police and communities, particularly communities of color, frayed significantly during the previous administration. Today's announcement will make substantial progress towards rebuilding that relationship. We look forward to working with the Mayor and Commissioner to implement additional measures needed to restore trust between police and communities."""

Advocates expressed cautious support.

NEW YORK CITY — The New York Police Department will no longer arrest people for low-level marijuana possession, Mayor Bill de Blasio and Police Commissioner William Bratton announced in a press conference on Monday. The NYPD will issue violation summonses to people caught with small amounts marijuana, instead of putting them in handcuffs and taking them to a precinct. The summonses will require people to appear in court at a later date and pay a fine. The policy, which will go into effect on Nov. 19, will not protect people who are found with more than 25 grams of marijuana, those who are smoking in public, or those caught with the drug near schools or playgrounds, the officials said. People who have open warrants, are subject to an active investigation, or do do not have proper identification could also be arrested. Speaking at the press conference, Mayor de Blasio said that the new policy is intended to refocus the attention of police officers away from petty offenses and toward more serious crimes. ""When an individual gets arrested for even the smallest quantity of marijuana it hurts their chances to get a good job, to get housing, to qualify for a student loan,"" de Blasio said. ""This policy will allow officers to continue on with their work and to put more time and energy into fighting more serious crime rather than get bogged down with an unproductive arrest.""

Jeny Chang for BuzzFeed / Via Drug Policy Alliance data

The new policy could bring about a sea change in the way the city is policed. Misdemeanor-level marijuana possession accounts for a large percentage of the city's arrests, a vast majority of which happen to young black or Latino men living in poor neighborhoods. De Blasio and Bratton said that they had been working on the new policy for months, in conjunction with the city's five district attorneys and other law-enforcement officials. Manhattan District Attorney Cyrus Vance​ ​said​ Monday​ he supported the change two years ago and still does. ""This policy — by diverting thousands of cases from criminal court — will also keep low-level offenders, particularly teens, from an arrest and all its attendant consequences, including a night or more in jail,"" he said. Some public defenders praised the policy. ""This is a huge improvement,"" Lisa Schreibersdorf, executive director of Brooklyn Defender Services, told BuzzFeed News. ""Summonses don't get you fingerprinted. This will be better for people who are vulnerable to collateral consequences, like immigrants."" Still, Schreibersdorf cautioned that the policy will not fulfill its goal unless the NYPD relaxes its identification requirements for summonses. Immigrants and teenagers often do not carry valid identification, she said, which often means that they cannot be processed for a summons. She added that the policy change does not address what she called the root cause of the problem — police officers in New York routinely stopping people without probable cause. ""Having summonses is an improvement for people who are already being stopped, but that doesn't mean they should be stopped in the first place,"" she said. ""The problem, from my perspective, is that stopping people without cause is unconstitutional."" Advocates also warned that the new policy could result in an increased number of arrest warrants, which are issued to people who fail to show to court for a summons. As The New York Times reported, up to a quarter of people issued summons fail to appear for their court appointments. As a consequence, there are currently 1.2 million open bench warrants in New York City — about one per every eight residents. Possession of less than 25 grams of marijuana has not been a crime in New York State since 1977 — yet he NYPD made 59,000 arrests for misdemeanor possession in 2010. Under current law, the only way to get arrested and charged with a misdemeanor for having less than 25 grams of marijuana is to display it ""in public view."" The legal definition of that term, however, is ambiguous. ""Public view"" can mean smoking pot in a public place, but it can also mean that a police officer stopped you, frisked you, and pulled a small bag of marijuana from your pocket. When the bag leaves your pocket, it has technically entered public view, and the officer can legally arrest you and charge you with a misdemeanor — even though you had less than the decriminalized amount. This broad interpretation of ""public view"" helped low-level marijuana possession become one of the NYPD's most commonly used arrest charges during stop-and-frisks. At Monday's press conference, Commissioner Bratton said that the NYPD has not interpreted ""public view"" to include marijuana removed from suspects' pockets since 2010, when then-Commissioner Ray Kelly told officers that misdemeanor charges would not be appropriate in such cases. Advocates for softer drug law enforcement policies, however, took to Twitter to disagree.

The policy change will only affect cases involving up to 25 grams of marijauna

The mayor said the old law disproportionately affected minority youth

A ticket has a lighter penalty than an arrest, police said

New York City will change its policy on possession of small amounts of marijuana, giving police officers the option of writing offenders a ticket instead of taking them into custody, city officials said Monday at a press conference.

Mayor Bill de Blasio said the change will remove the stigma of a criminal conviction for many young people who are arrested for misdemeanor marijuana possession. Such a conviction can prevent people from getting a job or housing, he said.

""A summons will not affect their future,"" he said. ""An arrest could.""

The policy change, which goes into effect November 19, will only affect cases involving 25 grams (.88 ounce) or less of marijuana, Police Commissioner William Bratton said.

The officer can choose to write a citation, which requires the suspect to appear in court later, Bratton said. The marijuana would be seized and the person who had the marijuana would continue with their day. The fine for a first offense would usually be $100, officials said.

Officers will make judgment call

If the officer does decide to take the suspect into custody, the suspect would be handcuffed and taken to the station house for fingerprinting and a mugshot, Bratton said. Police didn't specify the penalties but said they'd be tougher than for a citation.

As to how that decision would be made, de Blasio said, ""An officer ultimately has to make the judgment on the scene.""

If police find somebody smoking marijuana -- as opposed to simply possessing it -- the suspect would have to go through the entire arrest procedure, Bratton said. People without proper identification or people with outstanding warrants would be taken into custody, he said.

De Blasio said misdemeanor marijuana arrests disproportionately affect young people in minority groups in New York City. He said many job applications ask about arrests or convictions, but not summonses.

""We don't want to saddle someone who made one small mistake with something that will follow them all their lives,"" the mayor said.

'You will see fewer unnecessary arrests'

De Blasio said the policy change will also free up New York City police to concentrate on more serious crimes. The officers won't have to spend hours at the station house or in court because of small amounts of marijuana.

""You will see fewer unnecessary arrests,"" he said, noting that misdemeanor marijuana arrests have declined for several years.

New York law still bans possession of the drug. The policy shift only changes how police would enforce the existing law.

De Blassio and Bratton said they do not support legalizing recreational marijuana.

The policy change was first reported Sunday by the New York Times."

Missing Nuke In Colorado Sparks Intense Russian Fears

By: Sorcha Faal, and as reported to her Western Subscribers

The Foreign Intelligence Service (SVR) is reporting today that President Putin’s order to begin deploying tactical nuclear weapons throughout the Crimean Federal District is “intensely/directly related” to a “missing”, and believed stolen, low-yield atomic cannon shell from its storage bunker in Fort Carson, Colorado, which is a United States Army installation located near the city of Colorado Springs.

According to the SVR, the atomic weapon missing from Fort Carson has been identified as a W48 nuclear artillery shell that measures 155 mm (6.1 inches) in diameter and 845.82 mm (33.3 inches) long.

This report notes that the W48 was produced in two models, Mod 0 and Mod 1, which weighed 53.5 and 58 kg (118 and 128 pounds) respectively and have an explosive yield equivalent to 0.072 kiloton (72 tons of TNT).

Though the US had reported that all of their W48 nuclear shells had been “retired” by 1992, this report says, the SVR has long noted their continued “use for training” by US Army 4th Infantry Division forces headquarter at Fort Carson and under the command of North American Aerospace Defense Command (NORAD) forces operating from the Cheyenne Mountain nuclear bunker complex, all of whom are located in El Paso County, Colorado.

The specific US weapons platform designed to fire the W48, this report notes, is the Paladin M109A6 155mm Artillery System [3rd photo left] which is currently operated by forces belonging to the 1st Brigade Combat Team of the 4th Infantry Division.

Over the past few days when this W48 nuclear shell “disappeared”, this report continues, the forces of the 1st Brigade Combat Team were involved in training exercises with the 1st Battalion of the 66th Armored Regiment at Fort Carson ahead of their planned deployment in the next few weeks to the Fort Irwin National Training Center, in California, which will span much of November, after which they will be prepared to deploy to combat worldwide.

US media reports about this missing W48 nuclear shell are “nonexistent”, this report further notes, other than their noting that Fort Carson has been put on a “total lockdown” as US military forces there continue their search for what they call a lost ""sensitive item"", a term they use that refers to gear including weapons, ammunition and night vision goggles - items that cause high-level concern when missing.

These media reports further report that whatever is missing, it must be small enough to fit in a car causing Fort Carson security officers to spend about two hours inspecting all vehicles leaving Fort Carson's gates yesterday and their spokesman stating: “As part of random searches at the gate, we are conducting outbound vehicle searches in order to prevent the unauthorized removal of government property from the installation.”

Of critical concern to the Kremlin regarding this missing W48 nuclear shell, SVR intelligence analysts in this report state, is that if fits nearly exactly to the strange and mysterious war game sprung on world leaders this past March by President Barack Obama that he named “nukes on the loose” and involved a terrorist attack with an atomic “dirty bomb” that takes place in the financial heart of an unnamed but Western metropolis.

London ’s Telegraph News Service in their report on this “nukes on the loose” war game further noted:

“David Cameron joined Barack Obama, Angela Merkel and Xi Jinping and other world leaders to play a ""nukes on the loose"" war game to see how they would cope with a terrorist nuclear attack. The German chancellor grumbled at being asked to play games and take tests with the Prime Minister, US and Chinese presidents around a table with dozens of heads of state at a nuclear summit in The Hague. Her complaints were overruled because Mr Obama was keen on the idea and in on the surprise.”

Of equal concern to the Kremlin, this report continues, are that these events are occurring as predicted by former US Assistant Treasury Secretary Dr. Paul Craig Roberts who this past June warned that Obama regime was planning for a preemptive nuclear attack.

In his warning Dr. Roberts stated: “Washington not only has war plans for launching a preemptive nuclear attack on Russia, and also possibly China, but Washington has a cadre of people who advocate nuclear war. We have people running around Washington saying things such as ‘What’s the good of nuclear weapons if you can’t use them.”

With the “suicidal tendencies” of the Obama regime becoming more apparent by the day, the SVR in this report grimly concludes, Russia’s near record de-Dollarization efforts, when coupled with the “secret deal” between the US and Saudi Arabia to destroy Syria, point towards a truly tragic global outcome as the American-backed Western economy is near collapse…and all who oppose them will surely suffer their wrath….including the 1.2 million of their own citizens they currently have under surveillance and targeted for destruction.

http://www.emergent.info/ebola-frisco	Claim: A man in Frisco, Texas being examined for Ebola came into direct contact with Ebola victim Thomas E. Duncan	false	[]	2014/10/08	emergent	['http://www.dailymail.co.uk/news/article-2785514/Second-person-rushed-hospital-Ebola-symptoms-contact-patient-zero-Thomas-Duncan.html']	http://www.dailymail.co.uk/news/article-2785514/Second-person-rushed-hospital-Ebola-symptoms-contact-patient-zero-Thomas-Duncan.html	http://www.dailymail.co.uk/	"A Dallas County sheriff's deputy remains hospitalized today with Ebola symptoms, more than a week after he went unprotected into the apartment of 'patient zero' Thomas Duncan.

Sgt Michael Monnig went on Wednesday to an urgent-care facility in Frisco, Texas with his wife, after complaining of stomach problems.

The deputy presented at the clinic a week after he visited the Dallas home where Duncan was staying when he developed Ebola symptoms. Sgt Monnig was at the home to deliver a quarantine order to family members.

Neither Sgt Monnig, nor the other two health officials, Zachary Thompson and Christopher Perkins with him, were wearing protective clothing or masks despite being in the apartment as cleaning crews were going about their work in full protective gear.

Sgt Monning was given an Ebola test at Texas Health Presbyterian Hospital in Dallas, though results usually take 48 hours and aren't due back until Friday night.

A possible Ebola patient, believed to be Dallas County Sheriff's Deputy Michael Monnig, is brought to the Texas Health Presbyterian Hospital on Wednesday in Dallas, Texas

The sheriff's deputy arrives at Texas Health Presbyterian Hospital today via ambulance after attending an urgent-care clinic with symptoms

Sgt Monnig walked into Texas Presbyterian Hosptial today accompanied by medics in hazmat suits

Sgt Monnig, pictured here with his family, went to an urgent-care facility in Frisco, Texas on Wednesday with Ebola-like symptoms. His family said he was simply taking precautions

'It was pretty scary': Monnig's wife recalled the fear she had after learning her husband was in the apartment where Duncan took ill and likely relived that fear on Wednesday

Sgt Monnig's son, Logan Monnig, told CBS that his father had woken up with 'stomach issues' and had gone to the clinic as a precaution.

Logan said family were told by the CDC that their father was not at risk of the virus, as he had only been in the apartment for 30 minutes and had not come in contact with bodily fluids.

'We are not expecting him to' test positive for Ebola, said Logan.

The day after going into the apartment, Sgt Monnig and his fellow officers were told to bag up the clothes they'd been wearing. Their police cars were also taken out of commission.

'That starts putting question marks in your mind,' Monnig told WFAA in an October 3 report. 'You know when you go home and then the next day you start hearing that equipment is being quarantined or asked to be bagged up, that you had on or were driving.

'Then your question is, ""well, what about me?"" And so those were the questions that were raised.'

Now the question is: Why wasn't Monnig warned before entering the home completely without protection?

'There should be some kind of protocols as far as what kind of a response we're going to have and what kind of safety equipment we're going to have,' Christopher Dyer, president of the Dallas County Sheriff's Association, said in the WFAA interview. 'Those kinds of things didn't happen.'

Monnig's wife Lisa echoed his sentiment.

'It was pretty scary,' Lisa Monnig said about the day her husband entered the apartment. 'I was awake until he got home that night.'

No doubt Monnig is now feeling that pit in her stomach again as she and her family are forced to wait out the next two days it will take to determine whether Monnig managed to catch the dreaded virus.

Mr Duncan, 42, died on Wednesday morning at Texas Health Presbyterian Hospital, two weeks after developing symptoms of the virus.



Sgt Monnig told medics at the Frisco clinic today that he had been in contact with first victim Mr Duncan and had not been wearing protective clothing.

A medical team in hazmat suits along with law enforcement rushed to the scene at a CareNow clinic in Frisco, Texas on Wednesday after a man turned up with Ebola-like symptoms

The person, reportedly a Dallas County sheriff's deputy, was exhibiting Ebola symptoms today and claimed to have had contact with patient Thomas Duncan, who died from the virus on Wednesday morning

An ambulance, driven by a firefighter-paramedic wearing a hazmat suit, carries an individual, believed to be a Dallas County sheriff's deputy, with Ebola symptoms to a hospital in Frisco, Texas on Wednesday afternoon after the person turned up at an urgent care clinic

The CareNow clinic was immediately placed in lock-down because Monnig was exhibiting signs of the deadly virus - including feeling sick and appearing flushed with a fever.

The CDC told MailOnline today that the person is not one of the 48 contacts being monitored, and there is no indication of any direct contact with the initial patient, Mr Duncan.

None of the 48 individuals with verified or possible contact with the patient has shown symptoms, the CDC said today.

A father who had taken his teenage son to the clinic to get a flu shot on Wednesday told WFAA that the man entered the clinic with his wife, appeared flushed and was hunched over.

Chuck Moreno said that he and his son had self-quarantined in an exam room, put on surgical masks and sprayed themselves with disinfectant.

Sgt Monnig answered yes in a screening questionnaire to a question about travel to West Africa and is said to have contact with Duncan, referred to as ‘patient zero’.

The Frisco patient was rushed to Texas Health Presbyterian Hosptial by ambulance after turning up at the urgent care clinic on Main Street.

Medics at the clinic called 911 at around 12.30pm to request an ambulance for the patient. A team in hazmat suits and face masks transported the law enforcement officer.

A hospital spokesman said: 'Texas Health Presbyterian Dallas can confirm today that a patient has been admitted to the Emergency Room after reporting possible exposure to the Ebola virus.

'Right now, there are more questions than answers about this case. Our professional staff of nurses and doctors is prepared to examine the patient, discuss any findings with appropriate agencies and officials.

A second person is exhibiting Ebola symptoms in Texas today and claimed to have had contact with Thomas Duncan who died from Ebola today

A sign on the door of the apartment where Thomas Eric Duncan stayed with family warns that the unit has been quarantined by the commissioner of health on Wednesday

Where it began: Neither Sgt Monnig, nor the other two health officials, Zachary Thompson (left) and Christopher Perkins (right) with him, were wearing protective clothing or masks. The two other men are seen here leaving the apartment where Patient Zero stayed while ill. Neither Thompson nor Perkins have reported any worrisome symptoms

'We are on alert with precautions and systems in place. At the same time, we are caring for routine cases which are completely separate in operations.'

The clinic was keeping everyone at the center until they are checked out by the CDC - it is unknown how many people were exposed to the patient.

All those at the clinic will be transferred to a hospital but it is unclear which medical facility.

While no doubt in a fearful and nearvous state now, Mr. Monnig's career has often hinged largely on his physical toughness, even more so than most cops.

The large-framed Monnig once worked as a sort of human punching bag for incoming Dallas County police recruits who learned how to use batons by beating Monnig.

At least that was his job until 2008, when Monnig was temporarily terminated from the police force after getting seriously injured during one of his brutal training sessions.

He was unable to work in active duty and the force was apparently not interested in giving him a desk job.

Concerned son: Monnig's son Logan (pictured) spoke to reporters outside the family home not long after his father checked himself in with doctors Wednesday. Logan Monnig said he and his family are worried about Mr. Monnig but said 'we are not expecting him to' test positive for Ebola

A patient attended CareNow clinic in Frisco, Texas today and was rushed to a nearby hospital after presenting with Ebola symptoms. The clinic was placed on lockdown until everyone inside can be checked by the CDC

'Your job is basically to get beaten up by recruits,' CBS DFW said in a 2008 interview about his firing.

'Part of it is,' he replied. 'I want it to be as realistic as possible.'

Thanks in part to the 2008 broadcast, Monnig was rehired by the force.

Mr Duncan, a 42-year-old Liberian national, exposed nearly 50 people to the disease in America before he was put in isolation at Texas Presbyterian.

His fiancee Louise Troh is currently in quarantine with her 13-year-old son and two nephews and under constant monitoring by health officials over fears that they, too, could develop symptoms during a 21-day incubation period.

Tough guy: Part of Monnig's job, at least back before 2008, was to take the physical blows dealt by Dallas county police recruits learning how to use batons

Fired: After sustaining an injury during his extreme training sessions that kept him off his beat, Monnig was fired. However, a local CBS report that cast light on the apparent unfair treatment got Monnig his job back

Ten people, including seven healthcare workers and three family members, are considered at high risk for Ebola after they were exposed to Duncan after he became contagious.

Another 38 more are being monitors by the CDC for possible risk of the disease.

Duncan's fiancee Louise Troh, who is perhaps highest at risk of catching the disease after she cared for him at her Dallas apartment while he sweated and vomited through the early staged of the disease, says she does not blame him for possibly exposing her.

The White House said on Wednesday that extra screening for fever will be carried out for arriving aircraft passengers from West Africa, where the virus has killed nearly 4,000 people in three countries.

The screening will start at New York's John F. Kennedy airport from the weekend, and later at Newark Liberty, Washington Dulles, Chicago O'Hare and Hartsfield-Jackson Atlanta.

Authorities will use a non-invasive device to take the temperature of passengers and have them fill out a questionnaire created by the U.S. Centers for Disease Control and Prevention (CDC) asking for detailed information about their activities.

A cleaning crew in bio-hazard suits decontaminated the Dallas apartment where Ebola patient Thomas Duncan fell ill almost two weeks ago. He died from the deadly virus on Wednesday

That a man with a weapon was able to make it into the White House is a huge failure of security. But as the story evolves, the telling of the story has evolved as well.

When news broke that Omar Gonzalez didn’t just make it in the building, but ran through quite a bit of it before captured, the Post was all over it. But, in reading various accounts of the latest revelations, I noticed a change in the story. One word was removed.

The Post‘s original story read:

The female officer posted inside the front door appeared to be delayed in learning that the intruder, Omar Gonzalez, was about to burst through. Officers are trained that, upon learning of an intruder on the grounds, often through the alarm boxes posted around the property, they must immediately lock the front door.

Later in the night, in both the online and print edition, one word was omitted from that text:

The officer posted inside the front door appeared to be delayed in learning that the intruder, Omar Gonzalez, was about to burst through. Officers are trained that, upon learning of an intruder on the grounds — often through the alarm boxes posted around the property — they must immediately lock the front door.

Notice it? The word “female” is gone, down the memory hole and changed to just the androgynous “officer.”

Why make that change? The original was factually accurate, the new version is technically accurate. One offers some information, the other offers all the information.

According to officials familiar with the incident, the Secret Service agent who stopped Gonzalez, who had a knife in his pocket, just happened to be walking by when he saw Gonzalez. The agent was on his way out of the White House at the time. Had he not been there by sheer coincidence, Gonzalez could have made it even further into the White House.

The agent was on the security detail for President Barack Obama’s daughters, who had left the White House several minutes before Gonzalez broke in. There was not an agent posted at the door to the Green Room, where he stopped Gonzalez.

“There’s no telling how long this guy could have run around if the detail guy hadn’t happened to be there,” an anonymous person told the Post.

Secret Service director Julia Pierson faced the House Oversight and Government Reform Committee Tuesday morning, but did not tell the committee that the agent who tackled Gonzalez wasn’t on duty or at his post.



Pierson testified Tuesday that the Secret Service had known for years that the White House fence was not capable of keeping out intruders. (RELATED: Secret Service Was Concerned For Years That White House Fence Was Not Secure)

After jumping the insecure fence and making through the unlocked front door, Gonzalez then overpowered a female Secret Service officer, who was at her post, and wasn’t stopped until the off-duty agent managed to tackle him. He ran through the White House foyer and into the East Room, making it all the way across the 80-foot conference room before being stopped.

It was also by chance, perhaps, that Gonzalez chose to rush into the East Room, while running right past the stairway that leads just half a flight up to the Obama family’s living area. There is not a Secret Service officer assigned to guard those steps while the family isn’t at the White House.

Secret Service chief says agents used ""restraint in making a very difficult decision""

Gonzalez entered White House via unlocked door, Pierson tells congressional committee

Rep. Darrell Issa cites instances of ""misbehavior"" that undermine trust in Secret Service

U.S. Secret Service Director Julia Pierson called an incident in which a man scaled a fence and entered the White House ""unacceptable"" and told a congressional committee Tuesday that she takes ""full responsibility.""

Omar Gonzalez, a 42-year-old knife-wielding Iraq war veteran, entered an unlocked door to the executive mansion, Pierson told the House Committee on Oversight and Government Reform, which grilled her on the September 19 security breach.

A federal grand jury on Tuesday indicted Gonzalez on three separate federal and District of Columbia charges that could carry a maximum of 17 years in prison. His first court appearance is expected Wednesday in Washington.

The White House door through which Gonazlez barged had no remote locking mechanism and needed to be manually locked, Pierson told lawmakers, adding that such a mechanism has since been installed.

""It's clear that our security plan was not properly executed,"" she said. ""I take full responsibility. What happened is unacceptable, and it will never happen again.""

Saying she couldn't give complete responses because presidential protection is highly sensitive or classified, Pierson said the incident remains under investigation, and she doesn't ""want to get ahead of the investigation.""

It didn't come up at the hearing, but the Washington Post reported that the officer who tackled Gonzalez wasn't even on duty but was leaving a shift protecting the president's daughters.

Republicans and Democrats questioned how Gonzalez penetrated ""five rings of security "" in jumping the White House fence, overpowering a Secret Service officer and running deep into the White House, where he was finally subdued.

""How on earth did this happen?"" asked Chairman Darrell Issa. ""Why was there no guard stationed at the front door of the White House, and yes, how much would it cost to lock the front door of the White House?""

Added Rep. Elijah Cummings, the top Democrat on the panel, ""I hate to even imagine what could have happened if Gonzalez had been carrying a gun instead of a knife when he burst inside the White House. That possibility is extremely unsettling.""

Rep. Jason Chaffetz asked whether officers who caught Gonzalez acted appropriately by not using lethal force. Pierson said the Secret Service agents ""did use restraint in making a very difficult decision"" but conceded that she didn't believe the security plan was properly executed, which is why the incident is being reviewed.

The Secret Service should take a more aggressive posture, not a restrained one, Chaffetz said, and if agents kill someone who has breached White House security, ""I will have their back.""

Former Secret Service Director Ralph Basham later said that neither he nor the American public wants the Secret Service's first reaction at seeing someone invade the White House lawn to be: kill that person.

But after 3½ hours, it was clear that the committee wasn't confident in the agency's own review. Issa concluded the hearing by saying he and Cummings agreed that ""an internal investigation by the secret service is not sufficient"" and said they plan to formally request an independent inquiry.

Another security lapse

Meanwhile, in another incident involving a violation of security protocol, an armed security contractor was allowed on an elevator with President Barack Obama during a visit to the Centers for Disease Control and Prevention in Atlanta on September 16, according to a whistleblower. This whistleblower spoke to Chaffetz's office, and the incident was confirmed by a Secret Service official.

Chaffetz tweeted on Tuesday evening, ""security contractor with a gun next to the President happened two weeks ago, according to my whistleblower.""

The security worker was acting strangely and had his phone out while on the elevator with the President, according to Chaffetz's office.

When the security worker was confronted about his behavior, it was revealed that he was armed. The incident was first reported by the Washington Examiner and was followed up with additional reporting by the Washington Post. The Post reported that the Secret Service was not aware he was armed until after the worker was confronted.

Pierson's future in question

At the end of the public session of the congresssional hearing, Cummings said ""the jury is still out"" on whether Pierson can stay on in and fix the problems at the agency.

Asked about his confidence in the director's ability to continue in her post, Issa told reporters, ""This hearing did not add to my confidence.""

Over and over, Democrats and Republicans sharply criticized the Secret Service director's leadership and expressed disbelief that no one at the agency had been held accountable. Pierson noted she has been on the job for 18 months and took steps to reform the agency but also said, ""when you bring change into an organization, there is pushback.""

But Pierson's testimony only appeared to further inflame some members of the committee.

""I wish to God you had protected the White House like you are protecting your reputation,"" said a scolding Rep. Stephen Lynch, D-Massachusetts.

Holding up a sign featuring the blue ADT security logo, Rep John Mica, R-Florida, asked Pierson, ""have you ever heard of these guys?""

White House fence jumpers

Pierson told the committee that people jump the White House fence a few times a year.

""The Secret Service has apprehended 16 individuals who have jumped the fence over the last five years, including six this year alone. In fact, on September 11, 2014, a week prior to the events that are the subject of today's hearing, officers apprehended an individual seconds after he scaled the fence and ran onto the grounds,"" she said.

Sitting beside Pierson, Basham said the ""unprecedented and unacceptable"" breach poses difficult questions about the use of lethal force and the tolerance for additional fortifications around the executive mansion. There are no easy answers, and long-term consequences of any changes must be thought through, he told the committee.

Last week, a law enforcement official speaking on condition of anonymity said that prior to the intrusion, Secret Service agents interviewed Gonzalez twice before determining both times that they didn't have enough reason to keep him.

Pierson confirmed reports raised by a committee member that two Secret Service agents saw Gonzalez near the White House fence on September 19, prior to the breach, and ""observed him for some time."" Ultimately, Pierson said, the agents determined that Gonzalez wasn't acting inappropriately or violating any laws.

Later, referring to the Secret Service's contacts with Gonzalez before the September 19 breach, she said there's not a lot that the service can do to manage ""people with mental illness who do not commit a crime.""

The Secret Service has said Gonzalez has acknowledged having post-traumatic stress disorder.

""We're limited by the system we have to work within: the laws of our country,"" Pierson said.

Incidents strain public trust

The Gonzalez breach and other ""misbehaviors"" and security failures by the Secret Service have ""tested the trust of the American people"" and blemished the Secret Service record, Issa said.

The California Republican cited several examples of misbehavior, including a reality TV subject crashing a state dinner, a 2012 prostitution scandal, an agent falling asleep outside a room in the Netherlands and gunshots fired at the White House in November 2011, an incident in which damage wasn't properly reported.

Committee members pointed out that in regard to the 2011 incident, The Washington Post reported a Secret Service employee was told to stand down after hearing gunshots near the White House and then felt unable the next day to contradict her superiors' false belief that the White House wasn't shot at.

Cummings called the report a ""major problem,"" and Pierson said the contention that the officer did not challenge her supervisors for fear of being criticized is a concern.

""It's unacceptable,"" she said.

Answering another question from Issa about why damage to the White House wasn't initially detected but rather found days later, Pierson defended her agency's response and said records show that the Secret Service ""did respond properly"" by sweeping the area to see whether anyone was injured and whether there were obvious signs of damage.

Rep. Trey Gowdy and Pierson had a contentious exchange over why the Secret Service did not know that the White House had been struck by gunfire until days after the incident. Gowdy repeatedly asked Pierson why a housekeeper -- and not the Secret Service -- discovered the damage to the mansion.

She answered, in part, that agents swept the area that night to look for injuries or an intruder and found nothing. She noted that it was also difficult to see at night.

Pierson told the committee that any disciplinary action was pending the agency's investigation of the Gonzalez incident. But that answer did not satisfy Nevada Democratic Rep. Steven Horsford, who told her ""someone should be held accountable.""

Pressed by Chaffetz about how many times she has personally briefed the president in 2014 about incidents involving his security Pierson said once, and it was regarding the September incursion by Gonzalez.

The committee said that it would hold an executive session after the hearing so that Pierson could address some of the sensitive questions being asked."

While initial reports from the Secret Service said the man had been “physically apprehended” after entering through the North Portico, the Washington Post’s Carol D. Leonnig reported that Gonzalez made it much further, running past the stairway, across the 80-foot East Room and to the doorway of the Green Room, where he was tackled by an agent – who was off-duty at the time.

“This is unacceptable and I take full responsibility,” Secret Service Director Julia Pierson told the House Oversight and Government Reform Committee on Tuesday. Pierson faced an intense grilling by bipartisan members of the committee, including Republican Rep. Jason Chaffetz of Utah, who heads the subcommittee on national security. “I want it to be crystal clear,” he said, “you make a run and a dash for the White House, we’re going to take you down. I want overwhelming force.”

The New Yorker’s Amy Davidson said the committee was right to question Pierson on the Secret Service’s fumbled response plan, but warned that the kind of brute force Chaffetz alluded to would be a step in the wrong direction. “[S]imply adding more fences and armed-camp features – making the White House more of a disheartening militarized bubble – could be counterproductive,” she wrote. “The issue here,” she added, “is basic competency, not super-spy technology.”

U.S. News & World Report's Susan Milligan agreed that a militarized White House wouldn’t keep the first family any safer, nor would it project an image of American openness. “Such events are discomforting,” Milligan wrote, “but have given people license to demand further militarization of our communities – and Washington, while being the seat of government, is still a community.”

As made clear by family and friends, Gonzalez was troubled. He was prescribed anti-depressants, suffers from post-traumatic stress disorder and, according to a relative, injured his foot while on active duty in Baghdad. Dan Lamothe raised this point in a Washington Post piece but identified the vet-turned-criminal as “a common narrative that frustrates many veterans.” While Lamothe acknowledges that Gonzalez was dealing with PTSD, he suggests “it may be best to reserve judgment” until all the facts are available.

In the meantime, Rep. John Mica, R-Fla., suggested the Secret Service look into an alternative security plan, ThinkProgress reported. “Have you heard of these guys?” Mica asked at the Oversight Committee hearing, holding up a sign for the Florida-based home alarm system ADT and eliciting laughs from the room. “It is not very costly,” he said, adding that a vegetation barrier of Spanish bayonet, a plant known for its pointy and sharp leaves, would make for “quite a greeting” to any future intruders.

WASHINGTON — A man who scaled a White House fence this month and breached the mansion's front door apparently rushed past a Secret Service agent inside and was stopped only after reaching the building's East Room, a government official confirmed Monday.

New details of the incident involving Omar Gonzalez, who allegedly penetrated the mansion deeper than was previously known, were first reported Monday by The Washington Post.

The government official, who is not authorized to comment publicly about the incident, did not dispute the contents of the Post account.

Secret Service spokesman Ed Donovan, citing an ongoing investigation, declined to comment on the report.

The disclosure comes as Secret Service Director Julia Pierson prepares to testify Tuesday before the House Oversight and Government Reform Committee.

Pierson is likely to address the Gonzalez incident, along with a shooting incident in 2011 which, according to a separate Post report, the Secret Service failed to recognize as an attack on the White House until days after discovering damage left by multiple rounds fired by a high-powered rifle.

In the more recent incident, Gonzalez reportedly overpowered a Secret Service officer and ran through the main floor.

An alarm box near the front entrance apparently had been muted.

Gonzalez, who was armed with a knife, allegedly made it into the East Room before he was taken down by an agent.

The fence-jumping incident and the delayed reporting of the White House shooting in 2011 represent the latest in a series of missteps by the elite protective service.

This year, three agents were sent home from the Netherlands before a presidential trip after one of the agents was discovered intoxicated in a hotel hallway.

That episode followed a well-publicized incident in 2012 in Cartagena, Colombia, when Secret Service agents and other U.S. authorities brought escorts back to a hotel after a night of heavy drinking."

After he pushed past the female agent, he ran past the stairway that leads to the president’s personal quarters before he was detained.

The Secret Service’s response to Gonzalez’s dash from the front railing was slowed because perimeter alarms — dubbed “crash boxes” — had been muffled at the request of the White House’s ushers.

The man, Omar Gonzalez, is a former soldier, and was having delusions. The president was not at the White House when Gonzalez ran into the building.

The new revelation was published by the Washington Post and CBS.

The Post credited the new information to whistleblowers and Rep. Jason Chaffetz, the chairman of the House Oversight subcommittee on Homeland Security.

Chaffetz said the intrusion was a “failure of leadership” by the Secret Service.

Secret Service Director Julia Pierson has said the intrusion was “unacceptable” to her.

The report — likely leaked by Chaffetz — comes one day before Pierson testifies at his committee on Tuesday.

“The agency needs a solution that goes deeper than more fences and more people,” Chaffetz told the Washington Post.

“It must examine what message is being sent to the men and women who protect the president when their leader sacrifices security to appease superficial concerns of White House ushers.”

 -- The man who broke into the White House two weeks ago was able to make his way far into the property before being tackled in the East Room -- the room where President Obama and many other presidents have made some of their most important announcements, a law enforcement official confirmed today to ABC News.

The development calls into question the narrative originally released by the Secret Service, which had suggested that Omar Gonzalez, 42, of Texas, had been taken into custody near the front doors of the White House after jumping the fence and running more the 100 yards into the national landmark.

White House Fence Jumper Omar Gonzalez Had 800 Rounds of Ammo in Car, Prosecutors Say

Obama 'Obviously Concerned' Over Security Breach

“Gonzalez failed to comply with responding Secret Service Uniformed Division Officers’ verbal commands, and was physically apprehended after entering the White House North Portico doors,” the Secret Service said in a statement on Sept. 20.

When he jumped over the fence outside of the White House, Gonzalez was allegedly carrying a folding pocket knife. After pushing through the front doors, he ran to the East Room, according to the official, confirming details first reported by The Washington Post.

A Secret Service spokesperson declined to comment, but the agency’s director, Julie Pierson, will be on the hot seat Tuesday as the House Oversight and Government Reform Committee hold a hearing to examine several issues dogging the Secret Service.

In an interview with ABC News, the chairman of the committee, Darrell Issa, R-Calif., said Gonzalez got deep enough into the White House that had President Obama or Vice President Joe Biden been there “they could have been attacked.”

Signs of increased security around the White House were almost immediate after Gonzales made it into the complex, including additional barriers outside of the White House gates. In addition, the Secret Service beefed-up foot patrols along the fence line of the White House complex and deployed additional surveillance resources, a White House spokesman said at the time.

Gonzalez had been homeless in the nation’s capital for the past three months after 13 years in the U.S. Army, including a tour in Iraq.

Omar Gonzalez, the White House fence-jumper from earlier this month, apparently surprised the guard at the front door because a nearby alarm box had been muted:

After barrelling past the guard immediately inside the door, Gonzalez, who was carrying a knife, dashed past the stairway leading a half-flight up to the first family’s living quarters. He then ran into the 80-foot-long East Room, an ornate space often used for receptions or presidential addresses.

Gonzalez was tackled by a counter-assault agent at the far southern end of the East Room. The intruder reached the doorway to the Green Room, a parlor overlooking the South Lawn with artwork and antique furniture, according to three people familiar with the incident.

Secret Service officials had earlier said he was quickly detained at the main entry. Agency spokesman Edwin Donovan said the office is not commenting due to an ongoing investigation of the incident."

The man who scaled the White House fence and was able to run through the front doors made it farther into the building than was previously reported, CBS News has learned.

Secret Service Director Julia Pierson is scheduled to answer questions about the incident when she appears at a hearing of the House Oversight and Government Reform Committee Tuesday morning.

The man, 42-year-old Omar J. Gonzalez, ran unobstructed for 70 yards across the front lawn of the White House before entering through the North Portico. On the way, he brushed by a Secret Service officer with a drawn gun, sources tell CBS News' Bill Plante.

Gonzalez then proceeded to run through the entrance hall to the cross hall of the White House, past the staircase that leads up to the first family's residence. He was confronted by a female Secret Service agent, who he overpowered, and made it all the way to the East Room, Rep. Jason Chaffetz, R-Utah, told CBS News, citing whistleblowers. Gonzalez was brought down by a door leading to the Green Room, a parlor adjacent to the East Room, which is used for formal events including bill signings, press conferences, receptions and ceremonies.

White House fence jumper has previous weapons violations on record

Previously, it was reported that Gonzalez only made it through the north doors of the White House - which were apparently unlocked - before being apprehended by the Secret Service.

The agency declined to comment, citing an ongoing investigation into the incident. The White House says the results of the review will ""further enhance"" security.

""He had just gotten inside the door [of the North Portico] . . . And was then wrestled to the ground by one of the Secret Service personnel . . . in the foyer,"" former Secret Service Director W. Ralph Basham, told CBS News, explaining his understanding of the apprehension. Basham spoke with current director, Pierson, as recently as this weekend.

Basham said that he believed ""as soon as the individual got in the door . . . he was apprehended by one person.""

The major security breach occurred Sept. 19, just minutes after President Obama, his daughters and one of their friends boarded the presidential helicopter for a weekend getaway to Camp David, the presidential retreat in Maryland. The first lady had traveled there separately. It prompted the Secret Service to erect a second fence about 12 feet further away from the White House than the permanent fence, creating second barrier that would-be fence jumpers would have to climb.

Obama lauds Secret Service despite string of security breaches

Officials originally argued the reason agents didn't shoot the suspect, Omar Gonzalez, as he sprinted across the lawn or release guard dogs to detain him was because he appeared unarmed. In fact, he was found carrying a two-and-a-half inch folding knife with a serrated blade and his car reportedly contained 800 rounds of ammunition.

The revelations will only heighten concerns about an agency that has had several high-profile security failures in recent years. On Sunday, the Washington Post reported that it took agents four days to realize a man had fired bullets that struck the White House in 2011.

Members of the House Oversight and Government Reform Committee are set to grill Secret Service Director Julia Pierson Tuesday during a hearing that was first called after Gonzalez jumped the fence and entered the building.

Secret Service takes heat after intruder enters White House

""I don't see people being held accountable and I don't see changes that make the security situation better, so part of [the hearing] is to discuss the perimeter at the White House but I think the problems are much deeper seated than that,"" Chaffetz, a member of the committee, told CBS News Sunday.

Ever since the self-proclaimed Islamic State started beheading American captives on camera two months ago, senior U.S. officials from President Barack Obama on down have insisted that the United States will never grant concessions to terrorists or pay ransoms for Americans’ release, even though the militant group has freed European hostages whose governments were willing to pay millions of dollars in cash.

But the Obama administration’s absolutist position is at odds with what has actually happened when Americans have been kidnapped abroad in the past. The U.S. government has, in fact, arranged ransom payments for Americans held by foreign terrorist groups. Officials are also aware of ransom being paid recently for an American journalist held in Syria. And it’s been the United States’ long-standing policy to keep lines of communications open with terrorists who hold Americans and to find ways of negotiating for their freedom. Under certain circumstances, that can include paying terrorist groups and using money to lure them into the open, where they might be tracked, captured, or killed.

Multiple individuals who have been directly involved in the official and private efforts to free the American hostages held by the Islamic State — including two American journalists, James Foley and Steven Sotloff, who were killed over the summer — say the process has been stymied by a malfunctioning government bureaucracy that cannot agree on what the United States’ hostage negotiations policies actually are, including on such thorny issues as ransom payments. Based on long-standing practice and presidential orders, when an American is taken abroad, a network of experienced officials from law enforcement and intelligence agencies, the military, the State Department, and the White House is supposed to snap into place and marshal all the resources of U.S. power to free the person.

But that isn’t happening now. And in the absence of a coherent strategy about how to win the Americans’ release, the process has languished — and so have the final two American hostages: Peter Kassig, a 26-year-old humanitarian aid worker from Indiana, and a female aid worker, who, like Kassig, was kidnapped in Syria. (Foreign Policy isn’t revealing her name, at the request of her family and U.S. officials.)

""No one’s really in charge,"" said one individual who’s been deeply involved in negotiations for one of the hostages and asked not to be identified because efforts are still underway to free the other two Americans held by the Islamic State. This person, summing up a general frustration shared by many others, said the different government agencies working on the hostages’ cases don’t appear to be on the same page or even to have the same reading of what U.S. law allows.

Privately, U.S. officials acknowledge that their own lines of communication have become crossed and that family members aren’t always receiving a clear message or frequent enough updates on what the government is doing to free their loved ones. In part to remedy that, Obama met personally in recent weeks with the families of the two Americans still held by the Islamic State, according to an individual with knowledge of the meeting.

Even if the United States wanted to negotiate with the Islamic State, it appears to have no viable back channels to the group, which lately seems to be far more interested in butchering Americans than in taking money to set them free. Former officials who criticized the Obama administration’s handling of the hostage cases acknowledged that the efforts were hamstrung by a lack of good intelligence inside Syria, where the hostages are believed to be held amid the rubble and chaos of a three-year-long civil war. No one doubts that U.S. officials want to see the Americans freed, and those close to the efforts don’t blame the government for the Americans’ deaths. But efforts to win the hostages’ release have fallen short, and time is running out.

This account is based on interviews with more than a dozen people, including current and former senior U.S. officials with many years of experience in hostage negotiation, as well as others who have worked on the cases of the Americans known to be held by the Islamic State.

The debate among government officials and the hostages’ family members has broken out largely over the question of how to negotiate with the Islamic State, and the risky proposition of whether to pay ransoms or make other concessions to the militant group, which has at various times demanded money as well as the release of accused or convicted terrorists held by the United States.

On one side are the White House, the National Security Council, and the State Department, which oppose ransom payments and believe that they encourage militants to kidnap Americans. The fact that more European citizens, whose countries will pay for their freedom, are taken suggests that a no-ransom policy protects U.S. citizens abroad, these officials say.

""I think the U.S. government remains absolutely committed to the notion that we will not provide funding for terrorist organizations — that we believe that only creates perverse incentives for those terrorist organizations going forward, and a source of funding,"" Ben Rhodes, the deputy national security adviser, told reporters after the Islamic State released a video showing Foley’s murder.

The White House is so forcefully opposed to ransom payments that when Foley and Sotloff’s families raised the issue, a senior member of the NSC staff who handles counterterrorism issues felt obliged to tell them that they could be prosecuted if they attempted to pay a ransom for their children.

""The law is clear that ransom payments to designated individuals or entities, such as ISIL, are prohibited,"" said Caitlin Hayden, the spokeswoman for the NSC. ""It is also a matter of long-standing policy that the U.S. does not grant concessions to hostage takers. Doing so would only put more Americans at risk of being taken captive. That is what we convey publicly and what we convey privately.""

On the other side of the argument, sources say, are the Justice Department and the FBI, which is the lead investigative agency when Americans are kidnapped abroad. Current and former officials stressed that no American has ever been prosecuted for paying a ransom and never would be. Several former law enforcement officials described the warning from the NSC staffer as ""out of bounds,"" and said it could undermine the trust that the families place in the FBI agents assigned to handle their family members’ cases.

""The Department of Justice [which decides whom to prosecute] would just as soon this guy keep his mouth shut,"" said a former law enforcement official who maintains ties to people working on the cases. The families of Foley and Sotloff have said that they were shocked and offended by the official’s remarks, and some U.S. officials share their sentiment. A spokesperson for the FBI didn’t respond to a request for comment.

Contrary to the currently stated policy, the FBI has long taken a more nuanced approach to ransom payments. ""They will engage with a family if the family chooses to move forward and use the payment of ransom to free their loves ones. The FBI will assist them,"" said a former government official who has worked extensively on hostage negotiations.

And that has happened at least once. In 2002, the FBI helped to raise $300,000 that was paid for the release of Martin and Gracia Burnham, Christian missionaries who were kidnapped by Abu Sayyaf, an al Qaeda-linked terrorist group, while celebrating their 18th wedding anniversary at a resort in the Philippines, according to two individuals with knowledge of the case. At the time, the FBI, U.S. intelligence agencies, and the military were trying to find the Burnhams in the Philippines’ dense jungle, and the ransom payment was seen as one way to gain some insights into how Abu Sayyaf moved its money and to potentially locate the hostages.

A former U.S. official said that the FBI took steps to obscure its role, and that Abu Sayyaf never knew the U.S. government was involved in the ransom effort. The Burnham family has acknowledged paying a ransom, but they accused Abu Sayyaf of reneging on the deal. Gracia Burnham was ultimately rescued by Filipino commandos who’d been trained by the United States. A shootout with Abu Sayyaf ensued, and Burnham’s husband and another hostage were killed.

The U.S. government’s decision to facilitate a ransom payment, and not to stand in the families’ way, was strikingly at odds with the Obama administration’s current stance. And it illustrates how hostage negotiation policy has shifted since the administration of George W. Bush.

Not all Bush-era officials thought paying a ransom to Abu Sayyaf was a wise idea. ABC News reported that then-Secretary of Defense Donald Rumsfeld opposed the move. But the FBI, the White House, and the State Department thought it was worth taking the risk if a ransom meant the Burnhams could go free. And with good reason: Abu Sayyaf had a history of releasing captives from other countries when their families or governments paid.

But officials were also emboldened by a new U.S. policy on hostage negotiations, which Bush had signed just a few months earlier, in February 2002, and that remains in effect today. That document, known as the National Security Presidential Directive 12, represented a subtle but important change in the official position, from making no deals with terrorists whatsoever to taking each hostage’s case on its own merits. The document is classified, but people who’ve read it said that it allows ransom payments under particular circumstances.

The government can help pay ransoms to a terror group if it thinks the transaction will yield some intelligence about the kidnappers, such as their identity, their location, or how they move their money. Such information could be used to locate and kill the terrorists, capture them and bring them to justice, or cut off their financial networks. Any of those actions could help prevent the terrorists from kidnapping more Americans.

But a ransom cannot be paid in a one-time deal with the sole purpose of freeing an American. There has to be some larger strategic purpose in mind, which apparently is often hard to find. The Burnhams’ case is the only known example of the U.S. government directly helping to pay a ransom.

The presidential directive is also the government’s playbook for how to respond when Americans are taken hostage abroad. It spells out the roles and responsibilities of each agency, from the CIA to the FBI to the State Department and White House, as well as the military. It also directs how sensitive intelligence, such as tips from spies or intercepted phone calls and emails, is to be shared across the various agencies, so that all parties to the cases are kept fully informed.

The document gave rise to a so-called ""hostage working group"" at the White House that was first chaired by William McRaven, then a Navy captain assigned to handle counterterrorism matters on the NSC staff — the same position now occupied by the man who offended the Foleys and the Sotloffs. McRaven went on to lead the Joint Special Operations Command and oversaw the successful operation to kill Osama bin Laden in Pakistan. He retired this year, with the rank of admiral, and was selected as the next chancellor of the University of Texas System.

The White House group led to the creation of a parallel effort in Iraq, which focused on Americans kidnapped by insurgents and terrorists there. Former officials who worked on hostage issues both in Washington and Iraq said that the presidential directive let them share classified intelligence with each other, which was essential when kidnappings and murders of Americans became a more common occurrence in Iraq in the spring of 2004. ""That was when the shit hit the fan in Iraq,"" said a former U.S. official who worked on cases of captive Americans.

The crisis began in March of that year with the killing of four U.S. contractors from the private security firm Blackwater, who were beaten, burned, and hanged from a bridge in Fallujah. Then, in May, a video surfaced showing American contractor Nicholas Berg being beheaded while wearing an orange jumpsuit, similar to the ones worn by detainees at Guantánamo Bay, Cuba, and that are now donned by Islamic State captives before they’re killed on camera.

Back in Washington, the White House hostage working group went into overdrive, meeting at least once a week, according to Dane Egli, who ran the group from 2004 to 2006. ""It was a dynamic process,"" Egli said. Officials from the intelligence agencies, the State Department, the FBI, and the military were involved. Cases ranged from Americans held by insurgents and terrorists to contractors who’d gone missing to soldiers who’d been captured or had disappeared.

Egli said that the working group helped to coordinate the 2005 rescue of Marcus Luttrell, a Navy SEAL who was the lone survivor of a U.S. attack on Taliban militants in Afghanistan. The same year, the group also worked on a Delta Force rescue of American contractor Roy Hallums, who’d been taken hostage in Iraq. Neither case involved a ransom payment, but the missions showed that the working group was able to work across agency lines to share intelligence, coordinate rescues, and bring Americans home, Egli said.

After 2006, the rash of kidnappings in Iraq slowed, and so did the work of the hostage working group. Abu Musab al-Zarqawi, the leader of al Qaeda in Iraq and Berg’s suspected murderer, was killed by U.S. forces. Al Qaeda central turned its attention away from the ""kidnapping-and-murder business,"" as one former official put it, and concentrated on kidnapping for ransom, particularly in North Africa. That remains a lucrative source of revenue for the group.

Today, the hostage working group meets less frequently. And former members who handled cases during the Iraq crisis have moved on to new jobs. That’s one reason, former officials say, why the bureaucratic process today has become so bogged down. ""There just isn’t a deep bench of people who know how to work these issues,"" a former official said.

The group continues to meet and has ""broad interagency participation,"" according to a senior administration official. ""While the [group] generally convenes in person on a monthly basis, there is a continuous collaboration and discussion among [group] members on a daily basis. There are also periodic phone conferences and video teleconferences to address specific issues as they arise.""

But the U.S. government doesn’t need to manage hostage cases on its own. Officials can stand aside or turn a blind eye when other parties intervene on behalf of American hostages. That may have happened when American journalist Peter Theo Curtis was set free in August by al-Nusra Front, al Qaeda’s branch in Syria.

According to one government official, as well as another source who has direct knowledge of Curtis’s case, a ransom was paid for his release. And though it’s unclear by whom, suspicion has focused on the government of Qatar, which has strong ties to Nusra.

Two other individuals with direct knowledge of Curtis’s case said the Qatari government was involved in negotiations with Nusra for Curtis’s release. Neither person had any knowledge of a ransom payment, and though they said they couldn’t rule it out, they doubted it had been paid. A spokesperson for the State Department denied that the United States paid a ransom, and administration officials told the Qataris they shouldn’t pay one either.

But Qatar has been a ransom broker for European hostages, including those held by al Qaeda’s Yemeni branch. An official involved in Curtis’s case said the negotiations weren’t handled by the Qataris directly, but through yet another militant group in Syria, which acted as a kind of cutout.

Curtis’s relatives said in an interview with the New York Times that they’d been told no ransom was paid, but that they weren’t privy to all of the details surrounding Curtis’s release. And it was only after the government of Qatar became involved that negotiations noticeably picked up speed.

""Our family wants to thank the country of Qatar in a big way,"" Amy Rosen, a cousin, told the Times. ""Every person that our family dealt with in Qatar said that under no circumstances would a ransom be paid — and that this was something the U.S. government had requested, and they had agreed to,"" she said. ""But at the same time, we don’t pretend to know everything that happened."" The Curtis family, through a spokesperson, declined a request for an interview.

The United States also has some history of letting other countries pay for an American hostage’s release while preserving the official line that this doesn’t amount to ransom. In 2011, just before the government of Iran released two American hikers imprisoned there, it fined them $500,000 each, a sum that was reportedly paid by the government of Oman. A third hiker had been freed in 2010 after a $500,000 ""bail"" was paid, also reportedly by Oman. After all the hostages were released, Obama publicly thanked the Sultan of Oman for the work he’d done to get the hikers freed, along with the governments of Iraq and Switzerland, the United States’ primary diplomatic conduit to Tehran. Obama made no mention of any payments by Oman, and officials haven’t confirmed that the country paid for the Americans’ release.

Administration officials have not been deaf to the plight of the Islamic State’s hostages. ""I would characterize my own contact with the government as always very supportive and concerned and with a genuine desire to be helpful,"" said Philip Balboni, the president and chief executive officer of GlobalPost, where Foley worked as a freelancer. Balboni was deeply involved in efforts to secure Foley’s release, including sharing leads on Foley’s possible whereabouts with the government, and helping to raise money for a possible ransom payment.

Another individual who has worked on one of the hostage cases also said that senior government officials in the White House and the State Department had sat down with family members and assured them that the administration was working on their loved ones’ cases. But those meetings didn’t result in any new urgency or noticeable change in strategy. ""They were very generous with their time, but it didn’t help,"" this person said.

The White House did start giving family members more attention after the video showing Foley’s beheading was posted online, several individuals said. Since then, the White House has been more responsive to family members’ phone calls and inquiries. The administration has also been noticeably more attentive since the Foley and Sotloff families went public about the NSC staff official, who, answering a direct question from the families, said that the government could prosecute anyone who paid a ransom.

For its part, the White House is in an awkward position. It’s not the official point of contact for hostage families — that job is performed by the FBI and the State Department. But frustrated by the lack of progress, families have sought out an audience wherever they can find it, including at 1600 Pennsylvania Avenue.

""Our hearts go out to these families. We understand the grief and the frustration families feel when we are not able to bring their family members home,"" said Hayden, the NSC spokeswoman. ""We do not discuss the details of our conversations with families of those held hostage, but I can say that the administration’s goal has always been to do whatever we can within our capabilities and within the bounds of the law to assist families to bring their loved ones home.""

Appearing before the Senate Armed Services Committee alongside Joint Chiefs of Staff Chairman Martin Dempsey, Hagel was questioned by Sen. Jeanne Shaheen on U.S. policies regarding Americans kidnapped overseas. The New Hampshire senator’s line of questioning referenced media reports published last week which revealed the parents of two American journalists recently beheaded by the Islamic State in Syria — James Foley and Steven Sotloff — were told they could face prosecution in U.S. courts if they attempted to pay the fundamentalists’ ransom demands to free their sons.

“We must all be mindful of the humanity involved,” Hagel said, acknowledging the pain parents of kidnapped children feel. “We could and should maybe re-visit some of these practices,” the Secretary of Defense said. While he declined to go into detail and indicated support for current U.S. prohibitions against paying ransoms to terrorist groups, Hagel acknowledged there are “some areas that we could do a little better with.”

Bolstered by public comments from the slain journalists’ family members, U.S. efforts to free Foley and Sotloff have been heavily criticized in recent weeks, with the White House’s treatment of the families criticized as callous and devoid of compassion. A former official who advised the Foley family described their treatment by at least one member of the administration’s staff, an unnamed military officer who threatened the family with prosecution, as “utterly idiotic.”

Defenders of the White House have pointed to a failed U.S. special operations mission launched in early July to rescue the journalists and other captives held by the fundamentalist group as an example of the extreme lengths the U.S. went to save the hostages. The operation saw dozens of American commandos inserted into the heart of Islamic State territory, despite a dearth of intelligence in the region. There was a firefight that left some Islamic State fighters dead and one U.S. service member wounded. American officials believe the hostages were moved shortly before the special operations troops touched down. Addressing the Senate committee Tuesday, Chairman Dempsey called the failed rescue the “most complex, highest risk mission we have ever taken.”

The decapitation of Foley and Sotloff, rolled out in Islamic State video propaganda, captured the attention of the American public and the world. The killings have highlighted profound differences in U.S. and European policies for securing the release of kidnapped citizens. The United States and Britain are among the few countries on the planet that strictly prohibit the payment of ransoms to terrorist organizations holding their citizens captive, arguing that doing so incentives kidnappings. Other European nations sign declarations avowing to do the same but use intermediaries to pay off militant groups behind the scenes. A New York Times investigation published in July found that al Qaeda and its affiliates have raised at least $125 million through kidnapping since 2008, with most of the revenue drawn from European governments paying through intermediaries.

In November the Foleys were one of 23 families to receive an email from the Islamic State informing them that their son was being held captive. According to a New York Times article published Monday, the European home countries of several of the hostages — including France, Spain, Switzerland and Italy — quickly moved to secure the release of their citizens, while four American families–including the Foleys and the Sotloffs–were largely left to fend for themselves.

Reports published last week by ABC News and Yahoo News revealed the families of both Foley and Sotloff were informed by a senior Obama administration counterterrorism official that efforts to raise money for their sons’ release could expose them to criminal prosecution for providing material support to the Islamic State. Foley’s mother, Diane, told ABC she “had to beg” the U.S. government for information about her son. “We were told we could do nothing,” she said. “Meanwhile our son was being beaten and tortured every day.” According to Yahoo, Sotloff’s father walked out of a meeting with a meeting with a National Security Council official “shaking.”

The New York Times Monday night reported that “[a]lthough American officials initially advised the family that they could be prosecuted for paying a ransom, the bureau later privately told the Foleys that it was unlikely they would face charges and they could pursue their own course of action, independently of what the United States was attempting.”

Hagel’s brief comments on U.S. hostage policies on Tuesday appeared limited to the government’s interactions with the family members of kidnapped Americans. The broader and ongoing debate over ransom payment and the consequences that stem from differing policies held by various western governments remains unresolved.

Many American and British journalists–and their families–understand what covering conflict zones can mean if they find themselves kidnapped. As James Foley knelt in the sand somewhere in Eastern Syria earlier this summer, moments before a masked man dressed in black pressed a knife to his throat, he said, “I wish I could have the hope of freedom and seeing my family once again, but that ship has sailed.” Foley added, “I guess, all in all, I wish I wasn’t American.”

Responding to Foley’s killing in August, investigative journalist and author David Rohde published an opinion piece laying out the consequences that stem from the diverging hostage negotiation policies held by the U.S. and Britain and other European countries. Rohde, a two-time Pulitzer prize winner, was kidnapped while reporting in Afghanistan in November 2008. With the help of an Afghan journalist, he escaped seven months later.

Addressing Foley’s words, Rohde wrote, “Foley clearly spoke under duress. But his regret at being an American captive, real or not, reflected grim fact.”

On Tuesday, Rohde told The Intercept that in the absence of a consistent response to hostage situations — one adopted by both the U.S. and European nations — terrorist groups will continue to snatch westerners abroad.

“I’ve seen no clear evidence that groups are grabbing more Europeans and fewer Americans,” Rohde said in an email. “They take any foreigners they can get and use the Europeans for ransom and the Americans for publicity.”

“My captors were absolutely convinced that the US government secretly paid ransoms–and then publicly denied it–because that’s what European governments regularly do,” he added. “As long as there isn’t a unified position between the US and Europe on paying ransom, there is no deterrent.”

According to Foley, a military official issued forbade the family from going to the media and threatened to prosecute them for supporting terrorism if they attempted to raise the $132 million dollar ransom demanded by ISIS.

""Three times he intimidated us with that message. We were horrified he would say that. He just told us we would be prosecuted. We knew we had to save our son, we had to try,"" Foley told Cooper.

But according to Foley, the family was intimidated into inaction by the threats.

""[We were asked] to just trust that it would be taken care of . . . we were just told to trust that he would be freed somehow miraculously . . . and he wasn't was he?""

According to ABC, NSC spokeswoman Caitlin Hayden acknowledged the Foley family was informed of U.S. laws prohibiting financing terrorism but denied the family was threatened with criminal charges if they paid the ransom.

""Without getting into the details of our private discussions with families, the law is clear that ransom payments to designated individuals or entities, such as ISIL, are prohibited. It is also a matter of longstanding policy that the U.S. does not grant concessions to hostage takers. Doing so would only put more Americans at risk of being taken captive. That is what we convey publicly and what we convey privately,"" Hayden said in a statement Thursday.

""Jim was killed in the most horrific way. He was sacrificed because of just a lack of coordination, lack of communication, lack of prioritization,"" Diane Foley said in light of the revelation that the US government had actionable intel on Foley's son's location, but were slow in organizing a rescue effort and wound up missing their opportunity to rescue Foley before he was moved to a different location.

""As a family, we had to find our way through this on our own,"" she added.

Wednesday night, President Barack Obama announced an expanding military operation in the Middle East in response to IS.

""They enslave, rape, and force women into marriage. They threatened a religious minority with genocide. In acts of barbarism, they took the lives of two American journalists -- Jim Foley and Steven Sotloff,"" Obama said in the televised address.

Foley shared her thoughts on the President's announcement with Cooper:

""This whole strategy to eliminate ISIS and the terror threat is important, obviously, so perhaps part of the strategic way of doing that is to bomb them, and to engage in force. But that only caused Jim's death. I guess all I'm trying to say is that our government needs to be shrewder, smarter, willing to negotiate with these people who hate us, so that we can find better ways to rid ourselves of terror. I pray that our government will be willing to learn from the mistakes that were made and to acknowledge that there are better ways for American citizens to be treated. There should be international dialogue about how to handle hostages of terrorist groups,"" she said.

The mother of James Foley -- an American journalist beheaded by ISIS militants -- said she is ""embarrassed and appalled"" by how the U.S. government dealt with her son's case, telling CNN that officials even suggested family members could be charged if they raised ransom to free him.

Officials told Foley family members ""not go to the media,"" and that the ""government would not exchange prisoners,"" or carry out ""military action"" to try to rescue her son, according to Diane Foley.

""We were just told to trust that he would be freed somehow, miraculously,"" Foley's mother told CNN. ""And he wasn't, was he?""

In fact, video posted online on August 19 showed James Foley kneeling next to a man dressed in black, with Foley reading a presumably scripted message that his ""real killer"" is America, then being summarily executed.

ISIS -- the Islamist extremist group that's taken over large swaths of Syria and Iraq in its quest to create a far-reaching caliphate under its strict version of Sharia law -- took credit for Foley's beheading, saying it was in response to U.S. airstrikes in Iraq and threatening more killings.

'Our government needs to be ... willing to negotiate'

""They enslave, rape, and force women into marriage. They threatened a religious minority with genocide. In acts of barbarism, they took the lives of two American journalists -- Jim Foley and Steven Sotloff,"" Obama said in a televised address Wednesday night.

As she watched the speech, Diane Foley said one thing was going through her mind.

""This whole strategy to eliminate ISIS and the terror threat is important, obviously, so perhaps part of the strategic way of doing that is to bomb them, and to engage in force. But that only caused Jim's death,"" she said.

'He was compelled to bear witness'

After her son's death, Diane Foley wrote on the Free James Foley Facebook page that ""we have never been prouder of our son Jim. He gave his life trying to expose the world to the suffering of the Syrian people.""

Sometimes, she said Thursday, it was tough for his family to deal with his decisions to report in dangerous parts of the world.

American journalist James Foley -- who disappeared in 2012 in Syria -- was executed by a hooded ISIS militant.

""At times, even his siblings were angered that he would return after his captivity in Libya. I mean, it was hard as a family to understand, because Jim was so loved ... and we were selfish. We wanted him with us. We wanted him safe,"" she said. ""But Jim was not. Jim was selfless, and he had the courage and the compassion. ... He was compelled to bear witness.""

To this end, his family launched a foundation -- the James W. Foley Legacy Fund -- aimed at helping families of American hostages, supporting U.S. journalists in war zones and helping urban youth in educational endeavors.

The organization is one way the Foley family is trying to honor James' past and do something positive in the future. But none of it takes away Diane Foley's disappointment that more wasn't done -- especially by the U.S. government -- to secure his release, somehow, since his November 22, 2012, disappearance in northwest Syria . At the time he was working for U.S.-based online news outlet GlobalPost.

""Jim would have been saddened"" by the U.S. government's efforts in the years after his abduction, his mother told CNN. ""Jim believed, till the end, that his country would come to (his) aid.""

A failed rescue operation

Upon hearing these comments, U.S. National Security Adviser Susan Rice -- after praising the Foley family for doing ""an amazing job ... to try to bring Jim home safely"" -- said she ""and others in the U.S. government worked very hard with Diane Foley and her family to try to be supportive, to try to provide what information we could.""

Rice also pointed out ""hundreds of American personnel"" were involved in a ""very daring and very well-executed rescue operation"" to free Foley and other captives, after getting what they hoped was ""actionable intelligence"" about the location of the hostages. Pentagon spokesman Rear Adm. John Kirby has said elite U.S. commandos undertook this mission this summer inside Syria.

""Unfortunately, they were no longer there,"" Rice, a former U.S. ambassador to the United Nations, told CNN. ""But I think that effort ... underscores the importance that we attach to doing everything that we possibly can to bring Americans in captivity back home.""

Diane Foley, though, said the rescue operation came ""very late.""

""Their location was known for more than a year,"" she said.

During her son's time in captivity, she said, it often seemed the family knew more about his whereabouts than the authorities.

""I did all I could,"" she said. ""I was unable to do enough.""

Lessons for the future

Now, Diane Foley says she thinks Washington should change its approach to cases like that of her son and Steven Sotloff, another American journalist beheaded by ISIS weeks after James Foley.

""I pray that our government will be willing to learn from the mistakes that were made,"" she told CNN, ""and to acknowledge that there are better ways for American citizens to be treated.""

There should be international dialogue about how to handle hostages of terrorist groups, she said.

'They were actually an impedance,' Foley told Fox News, referring to the government's role in rescuing his older brother, a photojournalist who was kidnapped by ISIS militants in Northern Syria in 2012. 'They got in our way... That's what really bothers me to the core.'

The U.S. follows a strict policy of never negotiating with terrorist organizations or paying ransom for Americans kidnapped by them, arguing doing so only leads to more abductions.

James Foley's parents John and Diane Foley and his brother, Michael, speak to reporters about James' murder outside of their home in Rochester, New Hampshire, last month. Michael has become particularly outspoken about the failures of the Obama administration to rescue his brother and for threatening the family for trying to raise funds to secure his release

Captured and executed: James Foley was taken hostage on Thanksgiving, 2012, while working for GlobalPost in northern Syria and executed - video of the brutal act was released online on August 19

'We have found that terrorist organizations use hostage taking and ransoms as a critical source of financing for their organization and that paying ransoms only puts other Americans in a position where they're at even greater risk,' White House spokesman John Earnest said.

Foley, however, said the government made it difficult for the family to privately raise funds to secure his brother's freedom.

'I was specifically threatened by the Department of State about raising funds towards ransom demands for my brother,' he said. 'We were smart enough to look past it but it slowed us down. We lost a lot of time.'

US freelance reporter James Foley was kidnapped in war-torn Syria in November, 2012 and executed by his ISIS captors in a video posted online on August 19 of this year

Michael Foley, at right, and other members of his family tried desperately to raise funds to secure James' release from the hands of his captors

In a separate interview with ABC News, his mother, Diane Foley, said a military officer working for the National Security Council told them several times that her family could face criminal charges if they paid a ransom.

'We took it as a threat and it was appalling,' she said. 'Three times he intimidated us with that message. We were horrified he would say that. He just told us we would be prosecuted. We knew we had to save our son, we had to try,'

A spokeswoman for the National Security Council said that the Foley family was informed of U.S. laws banning terrorism financing but denied members were told they could face charges if they made a ransom payment, according to ABC.

Michael Foley also said in the interview the new military campaign the U.S. is pursuing to stop ISIS 'came too late for Jim.'

Devastated: Diane and John Foley talk to reporters, on Wednesday August 20, 2014 outside their home in Rochester, New Hampshire. The day before shocking footage of their son's execution was posted online

Strategy: President Barack Obama addresses the nation from the Cross Hall in the White House in Washington on Wednesday and said he had authorized U.S. airstrikes inside Syria for the first time, along with expanded strikes in Iraq, as part of 'a steady, relentless effort' to root out Islamic State extremists

'I just hope it's not too late for others,' he said.

ISIS is still holding several hostages from Western and other countries.

Diane Foley earlier spoke of her deep disappointment she felt towards the Obama administration for its handling of his time as a prisoner of the terror group, saying, 'I really feel our country let Jim down.'

On the 13th anniversary of 9/11 and the day after President Obama addressed the nation and finally offered a strategy to defeat ISIS, Foley told CNN that 'as an American', she was 'embarrassed and appalled' at the efforts to rescue her son from captivity.

Articulate and thoughtful throughout her interview, she made the startling claim that US officials threatened her family with prosecution if they tried to raise a ransom for Foley, 40, and said 'Jim was sacrificed because of a lack of communication and prioritization.'

And in a thinly veiled attack on Obama's new strategy to 'degrade and destroy' ISIS she said that meeting violence with more violence may not be the answer and said, 'bombing caused Jim's death.'

'Jim was killed in the most horrific way. He was sacrificed because of just a lack of coordination, lack of communication, lack of prioritization,' Foley said. 'As a family, we had to find our way through this on our own.'



Still grieving, Diane Foley also said US officials told her they would not exchange prisoners or carry out any military action to try and rescue her son.

At times withering in her assessment of the Obama administration's co-ordination with her family, Mrs. Foley poured scorn on the Pentagon's claim they tried to rescue Foley on July 4, only to raid the wrong base.

Speaking to CNN's Anderson Cooper, Foley said her family knew where James Foley was being held on two separate occasions in Syria, and that each time he was there for months following his capture on Thanksgiving, 2012.

On August 19, ISIS released a gruesome video online which showed the beheading of Foley by a masked ISIS militant, who told the camera in a British accent, that his 'real killer' was the United States.

Exactly two weeks later, another American journalist, Stephen Sotloff, was beheaded, apparently by the same man, who tells the camera, 'I'm back Obama'.

During the efforts to get James home, Mrs. Foley said she met good people, people who wanted to help, but was adamant that she didn't want to single anyone out and lay 'blame'.

Mrs. Foley said it was important to remember that ISIS is the enemy and not the United States.

However, ultimately, she 'didn't feel that Jim was a priority.'

'We were just told to trust that he would be freed somehow, miraculously,' said Foley's mother to CNN. 'And he wasn't, was he?'

NY Times via YouTube The families of murdered American journalists Jim Foley and Steven Sotloff are speaking out against the US government for making their efforts to free their loved ones a ""helpless"" endeavor.

The parents of Steven Sotloff, a freelance journalist who was kidnapped by militants in Syria, told Yahoo News on Friday that a member of the president's National Security Council threatened them with criminal prosecution if they attempted to pay a ransom to get their son freed.

""The family felt completely and utterly helpless when they heard this,"" Barak Barfi, a friend of Sotloff who is serving as a spokesman for his family, told Yahoo News. ""The Sotloffs felt there was nothing they could do to get Steve out.""

Sotloff's mother, Shirley, recorded an emotional video directly addressing ISIS leader Abu Bakr al-Baghdadi in late August. Despite her plea for mercy, the group murdered her son one week later.

The claim that the government would bring charges against the Sotloff family echoes similar points made in a CNN interview with Jim Foley's mother Diane, in which she said she was ""embarrassed and appalled"" by the US government's handling of her son's case.

In the interview, Diane Foley listed things the US government advised the family not to do, including not going to the media and not to raise a ransom since it would be illegal — ""we might be prosecuted,"" Foley said she was told. She also says the government told her it would not exchange prisoners or conduct a military action to go after him.

""We were just told to trust that he would be freed somehow, miraculously,"" she said. ""And he wasn't, was he?""

Jim Foley, a freelance journalist who was working for GlobalPost in Syria, was brutally murdered in mid-August soon after the US began airstrikes against ISIS militants in Iraq.

""It just made me realize that these people talking to us had no idea what it was like to be the family of someone abducted ... "" Diane Foley told ABC News. ""I’m sure [the US official] didn’t mean it the way he said it, but we were between a rock and a hard place. We were told we could do nothing … meanwhile our son was being beaten and tortured every day.”

The US military attempted a rescue operation in July to find Foley, Sotloff, and other hostages believed to be held near ISIS' de facto capital of Raqqa, Syria, although the special operations troops were unable to locate any of them. The Wall Street Journal reported the hostages were likely moved as little as 72 hours prior to the raid."

The individual who made the recording has remained anonymous but handed tape over to the FBI

Video messaging firm confirmed today the tape where shots appear to ring out in the background was filmed at 12:02:14 PM (CDT) on August 9

A video texting service confirmed today that an audio recording - which appears to contain the sound of shots fired by Officer Darren Wilson when he killed unarmed Michael Brown - is authentic.

Chaim Haas, head of communications at Glide, verified the tape recorded by an unnamed individual in Ferguson, Missouri on August 9.

An estimated 11 shots are heard to ring out in the background of the recording with a brief but significant pause between the first seven shots and the last volley of four.

Glide released a lengthy statement on their website today which said the user had been live video-messaging with a friend when the gunshots that killed Michael Brown were caught in the background audio.

Glide, an app which provides a real-time video texting service, said on Thursday that the audiotape was genuine and that it was now in the hands of the FBI

The statement continued: 'Because Glide is the only messaging application using streaming video technology, each message is simultaneously recorded and transmitted, so the exact time can be verified to the second. In this case, the video in question was created at 12:02:14 PM (CDT) on Saturday, August 9th.'

Officer Darren Wilson shot dead Michael Brown on August 9. On a new audio at least ten shots can be heard

Glide confirmed to MailOnline today that the FBI had been in touch with them regarding the audio recording.

The start-up business also said in the statement that it was proud of their app user for turning over the video message to the FBI investigation.

Experts who have listened to the audio have said it could prove damning for Officer Wilson.

In the audio, the unidentified man is heard telling someone, 'You’re so pretty' then 11 gunshots crack in the background - seven in one volley, followed a pause and then a final burst of four.

Lopa Blumenthal, the attorney for the unidentified man who recorded the alleged gunfire nearby said that she believed the audio shows that Officer Wilson had a clear 'point of contemplation' while pulling the trigger and aiming at Brown.

'He was in his apartment, talking to a friend on a video chat,' said Ms Blumenthal.

'He heard loud noises, and at the time he didn't even realize the import of what he was hearing until afterwards, and it just happened to have captured 12 seconds of what transpired outside of his building.'

A police expert also said that the recording could cause problems for Officer Wilson who is on leave from the force while a federal investigation is carried out.

'There sounds like a pause in it (the audio). And when you hear that pause it brings some concern,' said retired Chief Deputy U.S. Marshall Matthew Fog after listening on CNN.

'It is very significant, because if you have a pause there it means somebody had time to think and then fire again.'

If the audio is genuine it calls into question the version of events that Officer Wilson and the Ferguson police force have claimed occurred on August 9.

The medical examiner of behalf of the Brown family released this autopsy drawing which revealed Brown had been shot six times including once in the head

At least two autopsies performed on Michael Brown have concluded he died after being shot six times by Wilson after being pulled over by the officer, including a fatal 'kill shot' to the top of his head.

Numerous witnesses, including Brown's friend Dorian Johnson, claim that Wilson opened fire after bungling the opening of his squad car door, causing the teen to run before turning back to face the officer with his hands raised saying 'don't shoot'.

Johnson then alleged that Wilson continued to fire on the 18-year-old.

Photographs surround the casket of Michael Brown before the start of his funeral at the Friendly Temple Missionary Baptist Church in St Louis on Monday. The unarmed teen was killed on August 9

Ferguson police and friends of Officer Wilson contend that Brown engaged in a scuffle with Wilson when the officer pulled him and Johnson over, tried to grab his weapon and then run towards him, leaving him no choice but to fire.

Indeed in recent days reports had emerged stating that Wilson, 28, was badly beaten and left with serious facial injuries following the fatal shooting in the St Louis suburb, including an eye socket fracture.

But CNN reported last Thursday that although the officer was taken to a hospital with a badly swollen face following the shooting on August 9, x-rays came back negative for any serious injury.

Earlier reports had claimed that the officer was almost knocked unconscious by Brown's blows, according to the source.

Last week, Ferguson Police Chief Thomas Jackson said Wilson had suffered swelling to the side of his face but gave few details of the injuries.

Wilson, a six-year veteran of the Ferguson force with a clean record, has not been arrested or charged with any crime.

He is on paid leave pending the outcome of the investigation and is under 24-hour guard after death threats were aimed at him.

Wilson is 'traumatized, scared for his life and his family' along with being deeply concerned that a grand jury, which met for the first time on Wednesday, will make an example out of him, the source told Fox.

Michael Brown's funeral was held on Monday at a St Louis church in front of thousands of mourners.

A resident living in the apartment complex where Brown was killed was using a video messaging app called Glide at the time of the shooting and unwittingly captured the sound of gunfire, according to a lawyer representing the resident, whose identity has not been released.

The recording suggests nearly a dozen shots were fired in an altercation between Brown, who was unarmed at the time, and Ferguson police officer Darren Wilson.

According to Glide the recording was created at 12:02 p.m. CT on Saturday Aug. 9, precisely the time police say Brown was shot.

“A Glide user living nearby (whose identity is being protected) was simply using the Glide app on their smartphone exactly as it was designed – to instantly communicate with a friend through our real-time video texting service. Simultaneously, they also captured audio in the background of the gunshots allegedly fired at Michael Brown,” Glide said in a statement released on Thursday. “Because Glide is the only messaging application using streaming video technology, each message is simultaneously recorded and transmitted, so the exact time can be verified to the second.”

The lawyer, Lopa Blumenthal, said she has shared the recording with the FBI. Federal officials won’t confirm they have this specific recording, but do confirm they are collecting any audio and video of the incident.

The audio could prove to be critical piece of evidence in the ongoing investigation into Brown’s death. It also seems to confirm what some witnesses to the shooting say happened during the incident.

They said Brown, who was black, and Wilson, who is white, were seen struggling through the driver’s side window of Wilson’s police car. They said Wilson fired a single shot from inside his car and then fired several more as Brown attempted to flee. Some witnesses, viewing the incident from different vantage points, have said Wilson fired several shots at Brown and that at some point the boy turned around with his hands up, at which point Wilson fired several more gunshots.

The audio does not capture what happened just moments before or after the shooting. And law enforcement officials say that at this stage it’s impossible to know what the significance of this tape may be.

Days before the release of the audio earlier this week, Tommy Chatman-Bey, who lives in the Canefield Green Apartment complex near where Brown was killed, told msnbc that he was outside at the time of the shooting and was an ear-witness.

“I was right out there when I heard it,” Chatman-Bey said. “I heard Boom, Boom, Boom, pause, Boom, Boom, Boom, Boom and then some more.”

The police have not provided many details about the shooting and have not released a detailed police incident report. What Ferguson police have released is a report with little more than the date, time and location of the incident. But more curious are the time stamps on the document. Typically an incident report following a homicide would give a detailed account.

The report, released only after the American Civil Liberties Union of Missouri sued under open records law, suggests a supervisor had not reviewed it until Aug. 19, 10 days after the fatal shooting. Final sign-off wasn’t given until Aug. 20, the report appears to indicate.

Glide in their statement said, “While tragedy is never good news, and our hearts go out to the family of Michael Brown, this incident underscores how technology is changing the landscape of not only journalism, but also criminology. We commend this Glide user for turning their Glide video message over to FBI investigators as possible evidence in this ongoing investigation.”

A key question could be why Wilson paused in the midst of the barrage.

Brown was struck with at least six bullets including two that hit his skull, according to an autopsy performed at the behest of Brown’s family. Lawyers for Brown’s family have been critical of what forensic examiners identified as the two head shots that actually killed Brown. At least one of the shots struck Brown at the top of his head. Witnesses claim that as Brown fell to his knees and attempted to surrender to Wilson that the officer continued to walk toward him, firing several more shots.

St. Louis County Prosecutor Bob McCulloch began presenting evidence in the case to a grand jury last week and said a decision on whether or not Wilson will be charged may not come until October."

Man's lawyer: He inadvertently recorded sounds of Michael Brown shooting

FBI obtained the video, lawyer says

The sounds could be a piece in the larger puzzle of what happened during the shooting

A company whose video chat service apparently captured audio of Michael Brown's shooting said Thursday the recording was created at the time the Missouri teenager was killed this month.

The revelation from Glide appears to bolster a man's claim that he inadvertently recorded audio of gunfire at the time a police officer shot and killed the 18-year-old Brown in the St. Louis suburb of Ferguson on August 9.

The video was created at 12:02:14 p.m. that day, Glide said. Brown, who was unarmed, was shot by Ferguson police officer Darren Wilson shortly after noon.

""A Glide user living nearby was simply using the Glide app on their smartphone exactly as it was designed -- to instantly communicate with a friend through our real-time video texting service. Simultaneously, they also captured audio in the background of the gunshots allegedly fired at Michael Brown,"" the company said.

The sounds could be a piece in the larger puzzle of what happened during the shooting, which spurred days of protests in the city of 21,000.

Police have said Brown was trying to grab the officer's gun. Witnesses say the teen was holding his hands in the air when he was fatally shot. Investigators are determining whether to accuse the officer of wrongdoing; no charges have been filed.

The FBI obtained the audio and interviewed the man who made the recording, said Lopa Blumenthal, a lawyer for that individual.

The man, who asked that his identity not be revealed, lives near the site of the Brown shooting and happened to be using the application at the same time Brown was shot, Blumenthal said.

In the recording, a quick series of shots can be heard, followed by a pause and then another quick succession of shots.

Forensic audio expert Paul Ginsberg analyzed the recording and said he detected at least 10 gunshots -- a cluster of six, followed by four.

The significance of the pause

Witnesses and a friend of Wilson have given conflicting accounts of what led to Brown's death , and the pause could be key in the investigation. But it's difficult to prove from the audio why the pause took place or whose narrative it supports.

Ferguson police have alleged that Brown robbed a convenience store shortly before the shooting, and that he and a friend, Dorian Johnson, were walking down a street when Wilson approached them in a police car.

Police say Wilson stopped Brown not because of the theft, but because Brown and a friend were blocking traffic. Wilson tried to exit his vehicle but Brown pushed him back into the car, according to a preliminary investigation, St. Louis County Police Chief Jon Belmar said.

Brown assaulted the officer while Wilson was in the car, and a shot was fired inside the police car during a struggle over the officer's gun, Belmar said.

Johnson disputes that, saying Wilson -- while sitting in the car -- started the scuffle by grabbing Brown by the neck, and that Brown tried to pull away. Johnson also said that there was no struggle for the gun, but rather that Wilson drew the weapon and shot Brown once at the car.

Johnson said Wilson shot Brown again as the teen ran away. According to Johnson, Brown was struck in the back and then turned around and put his arms up as the officer kept shooting.

The caller, who identified herself only as ""Josie,"" said Brown -- after going away from the vehicle following the first shot -- turned around, taunted the officer and charged at him. Her account matches what Wilson has told investigators, a source with detailed knowledge of the investigation told CNN.

An autopsy showed Brown had six gunshot wounds.

Attorney Chris Chestnut told CNN this week he was surprised by the gap in shots.

""It's the pause that gives most concern in a police shooting, especially with an unarmed victim, because at this point Mr. Brown is defenseless -- he has no weapon,"" said Chestnut, who represented the family of Jonathan Ferrell.

Like Brown, Ferrell was an unarmed African-American man who was shot and killed by a white police officer. That incident occurred in North Carolina.

But if the gunfire heard on the audio is from the Brown incident, the pause doesn't automatically suggest wrongful intent by the officer.

""To be fair, there could be other explanations for that pause,"" said attorney Van Jones, co-host of CNN's ""Crossfire."" ""Maybe the officer will say, 'Well, I fired and he kept advancing, so I fired again.'

He was speaking to a friend on a video chat service and happened to be recording the conversation at the same time Brown was shot, Blumenthal said.

The attorney said she learned of the man's recording late last week from a mutual friend.

""I had to get his consent before I could reach out to the FBI,"" Blumenthal said.

CNN cannot independently verify the authenticity of the tape and has asked the FBI for confirmation of their interview with the man who made the recording.

The meaning of the pause

It's difficult to prove from the audio why the pause took place or whose narrative it supports.

Attorney Chris Chestnut said he was surprised by the gap in shots.

""It's the pause that gives most concern in a police shooting, especially with an unarmed victim, because at this point Mr. Brown is defenseless -- he has no weapon,"" said Chestnut, who represented the family of Jonathan Ferrell

Like Brown, Ferrell was an unarmed African-American man who was shot and killed by a white police officer.

But if the gunfire heard on the audio is indeed from the Brown incident, the pause doesn't automatically suggest wrongful intent by the officer.

""To be fair, there could be other explanations for that pause,"" said attorney Van Jones, co-host of CNN's ""Crossfire."" ""Maybe the officer will say, 'Well, I fired and he kept advancing, so I fired again.' ""

Witnesses and a friend of Officer Darren Wilson have given conflicting accounts of what led up to Brown's death.

Dorian Johnson, a friend of Brown's who was walking with him at the time of the shooting, said the officer shot Brown once by the police car and again as he ran away.

According to Johnson, Brown was struck in the back and then turned around and put his arms up as the officer kept shooting.

But a woman who identified herself as a friend of Wilson called into a St. Louis radio show last week with what she said was the officer's version of events. The caller, who identified herself only as ""Josie,"" said Brown taunted the officer and charged at him. Her account accurately matches what Wilson has told investigators, a source with detailed knowledge of the investigation told CNN.

An autopsy showed that all the entry wounds were in the front of Brown's body.

Key witness speaks out

Ferguson police said Brown allegedly robbed a convenience store shortly before the shooting.

And reports that his friend Johnson had a criminal record that includes lying to police has put Johnson's credibility in question.

In 2011, Johnson was arrested and accused of theft and lying to police about his first name, age and address.

Johnson said Monday night he doesn't understand why some are questioning his credibility.

""I see they bring up my past, my history, but it's not like it's a long rap sheet,"" Johnson told Lemon. ""This one incident shouldn't make me a bad person."""
