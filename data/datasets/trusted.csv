It is about attacking civil society, instilling fear and disrupting our great cities. With that being the case, as we indicated last night, our tactics again, is to try and reduce loss of life. To do what we can to restore order. I spoke early this morning with the Secretary of Defense, Esper, and with the Chairman of the Joint Chiefs of Staff, Milley, extensively to update on the situation, receive their situation report as theyre seeing it across the country, and to suggest courses of action. So in consultation as a group, and as we said this morning, Im authorizing and talking to General Jensen to fully mobilize the Minnesota National Guard, an action that has never been taken in the 164-year history of the Minnesota National Guard. By this afternoon, our hope is to exponentially have that force out there, to use all other resources in the state and our partnerships of sister cities across there and counties to help us. It will be a dangerous situation on the streets tonight. We will do everything in our power to restore that order that Minnesotans expect, that Minnesotans demand.'	b'Live Updates on George Floyd Protests: Trump Urges Minnesota to Get Tougher'	2020-05-30	[]	['minnesota', 'action', 'trump', 'cities', 'updates', 'minnesotans', 'urges', 'restore', 'order', 'tougher', 'situation', 'live', 'george', 'floyd', 'morning', 'national', 'guard', 'protests']	b'Lets be very clear: The situation in Minneapolis is no longer in any way about the murder of George Floyd.\nWith that being the case, as we indicated last night, our tactics again, is to try and reduce loss of life.\nTo do what we can to restore order.\nSo in consultation as a group, and as we said this morning, Im authorizing and talking to General Jensen to fully mobilize the Minnesota National Guard, an action that has never been taken in the 164-year history of the Minnesota National Guard.\nWe will do everything in our power to restore that order that Minnesotans expect, that Minnesotans demand.'

This is The Daily.\n\narchived recording 1 Michigan has been one of the most aggressive states when it comes to taking steps to combat the coronavirus. archived recording 2 Bans on all gatherings outside a single household, travel to in-state vacation homes, and the use of motorboats \n\nmichael barbaro\n\nMichigans restrictions on its citizens movements have been at the center of a national debate about public health versus economic survival.\n\narchived recording Protests in Michigan are growing because the governor, Democrat Gretchen Whitmer, has told us citizens they cant leave the city and stay in their summer homes. archived recording (donald trump) Dont buy paint, dont buy roses, dont buy  I mean, shes got all these crazy things.\n\nmichael barbaro\n\nToday: A conversation with the governor who ordered those restrictions and a demonstrator who is protesting them. Its Wednesday, April 29. So I just want to start by asking you to introduce yourself. Your name and where youre talking to us from.\n\nphil campbell\n\nMy name is Phillip Campbell and Im coming to you from Jackson County, Michigan, which is about an hour west of Detroit and about an hour away from the capital of Lansing.\n\nmichael barbaro\n\nAnd how long have you lived there?\n\nphil campbell\n\nIve been here in this particular location for five years, but Im a born and raised Michigander my whole life.\n\nmichael barbaro\n\nAnd did you say how old you are?\n\nphil campbell\n\nYeah, 39. Im turning 40 in June. I had a massive party planned. I was inviting everyone I know and now I just dont know whats happening with that, so.\n\nmichael barbaro\n\nWhen you say massive, how massive?\n\nphil campbell\n\nI invited 1,000 people so, we were going to be \n\nmichael barbaro\n\n[LAUGHS]\n\nphil campbell\n\nI have five acres and I was going to rent Port-a-Johns. And we were going to camp. And it was going to be a multi-day bash, you know?\n\nmichael barbaro\n\nIt turns out youre very popular, too.\n\nphil campbell\n\n[LAUGHS] Well, Ive made a lot of friends over the years.\n\nmichael barbaro\n\nSo tell me about what you do for a living.\n\nphil campbell\n\nIm the vice president of a pest and wildlife control company. We are the ones you call if you wake up at 1:00 a.m. and theres a bat flying around your kids bedroom, and you need somebody to go get it. We will climb on your roof and pull down the hornets nest. We will take care of the mice in your basement. Well do this sort of work.\n\nmichael barbaro\n\nMm-hm.\n\nphil campbell\n\nWe have about 30 employees. Ive been with the company for about 10 years now. I think Im one of the most senior employees there. We started when we were in the basement of the owners house. And now we have a very large industrial building with a depot and a shop. So its been cool to see that grow over the years.\n\nmichael barbaro\n\nSo at this point, how would you describe the company and its success?\n\nphil campbell\n\nI mean, I think were on the threshold of breaking through to the next level of growth. Were grossing about $3 million a year.\n\nmichael barbaro\n\nWow.\n\nphil campbell\n\nJust this year were able to for the first time provide health benefits for our employees. So weve been working towards that for a long time, trying to get to where we have the sort of revenue and the growth that we could take on those costs, which are not insignificant, you know? We like to think that were one of the companies or industries that can still offer regular old Joes without a college education a very decent middle class livelihood with insurance benefits, things like that.\n\nmichael barbaro\n\nMm-hm.\n\nphil campbell\n\nThe majority of technicians are what I would just call blue-collar people, you know? They like to hunt, they fish. They go out on the lake on the weekends and drink beer on their pontoons and listen to music. And just regular old folks, you know?\n\nmichael barbaro\n\nMm-hm. And what kind of a living do the people generally make?\n\nphil campbell\n\nI mean, many of the people in our company, they provide for their families. You know, theyre the breadwinner. You know, a new technician like starting might make 35.\n\nmichael barbaro\n\nMm-hm.\n\nphil campbell\n\nAnd then a technician whos been with us for a while and knows what hes doing, he can make in the high 50s or 60s. So with the 30 employees we have, we feed about 100 mouths, with their children and families. So we feel responsible for about 100 peoples well-being.\n\nmichael barbaro\n\nAnd what did the first Michigan lockdown, the one ordered by Governor Whitmer  what did it mean for your pest control business?\n\nphil campbell\n\nHer order did not exempt us. The text of the order itself, it did not make an exemption for wildlife control, pest control. And we were preparing to shut down. And then I noticed that it said for its definition of essential services, for further clarification, see this document by the Department of Homeland Security. And we found that we were allowed to stay open.\n\nmichael barbaro\n\nGot it.\n\nphil campbell\n\nBut very quickly after that we had to furlough a couple people after that, because even though we were allowed to stay open, our customer base, many of them arent working. So if your customers arent working, theyre not spending money. And it doesnt really matter if youre open if all the people you serve arent working, you know what I mean?\n\nmichael barbaro\n\nRight. I dont want to pry too much, but if you were bringing in  I think you said almost $3 million a year in revenue  before this, what did it start to look like once the lockdown was in place and the calls from customers began to taper off?\n\nphil campbell\n\nAt first, it was a 50 percent drop.\n\nmichael barbaro\n\nWow.\n\nphil campbell\n\nAgain, this is for a company that was allowed to stay open.\n\nmichael barbaro\n\nRight.\n\nphil campbell\n\nAnd then around this time, the second shutdown order came in, which was the one that everybody started protesting about.\n\nmichael barbaro\n\nTell me what you mean.\n\nphil campbell\n\nYeah, the second shutdown order just ramped down on the first. This was the one that went in and shut particular sections of stores that were still open. So like it said, you cant buy paint products, you cant buy gardening products. Because what was happening is people thinking, OK, I got to stay home, I might as well work on my house, you know? So a lot of those people were going to Home Depot, were going to whatever to get their supplies. And then the governor said, no, you cant get that stuff. So this was the order that said you cant go out on a lake by yourself in your boat in your private lake, if the boat has a motor. But if it doesnt have a motor, you can go. Things that seemed a lot more arbitrary. The one that said you cant have someone come mow your lawn, even though they pull up in a truck, they drive the lawnmower off, they dont touch you, they dont go into your house. Its just one guy mowing your lawn. You know, things that people started thinking, like, the economys already in freefall, is it really necessary to go this far with it? From my own experience, if the economy takes a dump and we cant get back to where we were, we have to cut their health insurance or were going to have to lay people off. Were going to take other measures to stay afloat. I dont know what were going to have to do. I dont want to hypothesize. I dont want my employees to listen to this and be like, what did you say is going to happen? I dont know, were going to have do something. We cant just suddenly take a 30 percent to 50 percent decline. Thats huge. What if you got a 50 percent pay cut? It would affect your life. And so Im thinking about the ripple effect. We take a 30 percent to 50 percent drop. Our employees take a dip. Maybe they cant afford to pay their debts. Maybe they cant afford to pay their own mortgages or whatever. I dont know. I havent assessed the financial situation of each of my employees. But I guess what I am frustrated about  and I dont want to minimize the risk of Covid-19 or the people whove had it  but as someone whos worked for 10 years in this business trying to build it up, get it to where it is, Im frustrated with the attitude of some people that we can just shut it off for a while, and then just turn it back on when everythings safe, and just pick up where we left off. Like, no, thats not how business works. Thats certainly not how small business works. If you take a big enough hit, its hard to recover from it, you know?\n\nmichael barbaro\n\nSo Im curious when you first hear about the possibility of a public demonstration, a protest, in Michigan of these lockdown rules?\n\nphil campbell\n\nI saw an event on social media, I think, or I saw people talking about it  like, hey, lets go down to Lansing and protest. So the owner and I  works been slow, so we said, hey, we got time. Lets drive down to Lansing on Thursday. The way I understood it, we were going to drive by the capitol and honk our horn, basically.\n\nmichael barbaro\n\nAnd what was that honked horn going to mean?\n\nphil campbell\n\nThe honked horn was going to mean like, we are workers, and we want the freedom for people to be able to work. Please consider opening things back up a little more. The capitol in Lansing, its on a loop, so you drive around in like a circle around the capitol. So I thought that all the traffic would come in, wed kind of loop around and wed honk, and then wed go back home, you know? But they were anticipating a certain amount of people  I think 10 times more than they anticipated showed up. So it took us two hours to get to Lansing. We got in Lansing, and then we were just  Michael, it was a traffic jam. Thats what it was. It was just a big traf  it was like an organized traffic jam.\n\nmichael barbaro\n\nBut what did it feel like to be in that traffic jam? Because its a particular kind of traffic jam with like-minded people there to protest something.\n\nphil campbell\n\nIt was really neat. It was nice to not feel so alone, because I was really sick of people on social media telling me Im selfish because I dont want the company I helped build for 10 years to just collapse.\n\nmichael barbaro\n\nWhos calling you selfish, do you feel like?\n\nphil campbell\n\nOh, just people on social media, my friends. People in my broader circle. You know, not people Im necessarily close to, but Id say I lost some friends over this, honestly. When the governor shut the economy down, I said this is going to be very hard on businesses and this is going to be very hard on us. And a lot of peoples response seemed to be like, what, do you want people to die or something, you know? And it kind of degenerated into, like, either you want people to die or you hate my business and stuff like that. And I was really glad, because I was starting to feel kind of isolated, to see a solidarity of so many other Michiganders who were similarly frustrated at the situation. Afterwards, when I got home, I saw there was a lot of people with a lot of Trump stuff, and I was kind of thinking, like, no, this isnt political. Dont make it into a political thing because this isnt about the governor happens to be a Democrat or a woman or something. Because I would have gone down there if it was a Republican, you know? It wasnt about her party affiliation. So I was frustrated \n\nmichael barbaro\n\nWhat did you make of the flavor of the protest? It seems like you didnt see this yourself in your car, but as youve hinted, there were strong strains of libertarianism and conservatism, and pro-Trump posters, as well as people with guns, as well as some, you know, some more vulgar and extreme sentiments. Some people compared Governor Whitmer to Hitler.\n\nphil campbell\n\nOh, like Governor Whitler? [LAUGHS] Oh, I dont know, I think thats just juvenile. I mean, I think its pretty juvenile in public discourse when the only thing you go to is compare your opponent to Hitler. I wish it wouldnt have been so much anti-Whitmer, because this isnt about like Governor Whitmer, the person, you know? I wish that it would have been more on point and focused about let me work, you know?\n\nmichael barbaro\n\nI wonder where you fall in the political spectrum. Did you vote for Trump? Did you vote for Whitmer? And how did your political views apply to this event?\n\nphil campbell\n\nMy political views didnt apply to this event really at all. You know, like, I wouldve been there if this was a Republican. I did vote for Trump. I dont particularly think hes doing that great of a job. So Im not a gung-ho Trump supporter. I didnt vote for Whitmer, but I didnt like the guy running against her, either. So.\n\nmichael barbaro\n\nYoure saying youre not seeing this crisis or the lockdowns through a political lens?\n\nphil campbell\n\nNo, no, not at all. Not at all. The little match between President Trump and Governor Whitmer is making it more political. When Trump tweets, Liberate Michigan, when he refers to her as that woman from Michigan, obviously, that sets Governor Whitmer up as a foil against President Trump, which politicizes it. When rumors start coming out that Biden wants to consider her as V.P. material, that politicizes it. I really liked when I was there that it simply seemed like a spontaneous expression of working class frustration.\n\nmichael barbaro\n\nPhil, I want to tick through what your governor said when she began this process of locking down the state and basically enforcing social distancing. And heres what she said: The only tool we have to fight the virus at this moment and to support our health care system is to give them the opportunity by buying some time.\n\nphil campbell\n\nYeah.\n\nmichael barbaro\n\nAnd she went on to say, Without aggressive measures, more people will get sick, more people will die, and our economy will suffer longer. And in her telling, the disease spreads if people are out there. If people arent out there, the disease doesnt spread. So she is making the case in the beginning that these sacrifices are required to prevent a system overload. What do you think of that?\n\nphil campbell\n\nWell, we were willing to go along with that, because we were all expecting this huge crunch on all our hospitals. We were worried about not enough beds, not enough ventilators. But the fact is the curve is flattened now. We now have hospitals, theyre not overwhelmed anymore. So what were saying is that was all well and good, but now, we can start to open up again because we flattened the curve. Even if infections go back up at this point, as I grant they could if we start being more economically active, it seems highly unlikely, given all the empty hospitals, that were going to get to another crush where we dont have enough beds or something like that.\n\nmichael barbaro\n\nSo I want to make sure I understand what youre saying when you talk about where things are in Michigan. The Times has maps about where the virus is in each state. And just pulling this up, Michigan has about 38,000 infections, and theres been about 3,300 deaths.\n\nphil campbell\n\nYeah, were the third highest state, I think.\n\nmichael barbaro\n\nSo when you talk about your frustrations with the different phases of this lockdown, how do you square it with those numbers?\n\nphil campbell\n\nWell, I square it because my understanding is that the lockdown wasnt supposed to be like, were going to lockdown until this goes away. What we were told was that this lockdown was to distribute those amount of cases over a longer period of time, so that the health system doesnt get overwhelmed. So I look at the total number of deaths and infections and say, OK, this thing is here to stay whether we like it or not. The hospitals do have the ability to take people in. So it seems like to me that the goal has been met. The goal is not to \n\nmichael barbaro\n\nIt sounds like youre saying that if we assume that the measures taken so far have flattened the curve to some degree in Michigan, that youre willing to accept the risks of restarting the economy, even if that means that the curve might go up a little bit. That you think that so far the measures taken have done enough to merit that kind of experimentation with, essentially, taking the risk of reopening.\n\nphil campbell\n\nI think so. And again, Im not saying just a full, like  the economy isnt a switch, you just turn it on, everybody comes back out, you know? But I think people who want to work and can work in a way that is maintaining safe protocols, I think they should be able to. Because the thing is, what I would like people to understand is that its not like either we stay home and stay safe, or we all get the coronavirus and die. Its like staying home and nobody working has its own inherent risks and dangers and devastation thats going to come. When I talk about the economy, Im not saying Im worried about the stock market or the financial sector. Im talking about the ability of the average person to provide sustenance for himself and ones family. So we could have negative outcomes because of the shutdown, not because of Covid  negative outcomes that dwarf Covid.\n\nmichael barbaro\n\nMm-hm. So were now talking on Monday, April 27. And that protest was about two weeks ago.\n\nphil campbell\n\nYeah.\n\nmichael barbaro\n\nAnd Im curious if you think that protest, which was one of the very first protests, had any kind of impact?\n\nphil campbell\n\nYeah, I think it did. I mean, this is just me kind of blue skying this, but I think it let her see that she only had a limited amount of political capital that she could keep carrying this out indefinitely. She started to say, well let lawn service in again, well let various things start.\n\nmichael barbaro\n\nShe rolled back some of the more, in your mind, problematic restrictions.\n\nphil campbell\n\nYeah. She rolled back some of the more problematic restrictions and she started talking about an end game, you know? So in that respect, I think it was helpful. I think it got the message across.\n\nmichael barbaro\n\nWe plan to talk to Governor Whitmer and I wonder what you most want to communicate to her about what you think she may not understand, what she might not be getting in this moment?\n\nphil campbell\n\nWell, first, I would say to her, Americans are responsible people. Were creative people. Tell us what social distancing guidelines you think we should be maintaining when were out there, and let us find a way to do it. If you think we need to be six or seven feet apart, if you think we shouldnt have more than six people in a room, give us a safe paradigm of personal behavior and let us work within it. Dont lock us down and say that we cant provide for ourselves. Thats the most basic human right  is to provide for your own well-being. Just let us find some way to work.\n\n[music]\n\nmichael barbaro\n\nWell, Phil, thank you very much. We really appreciate your time.\n\nphil campbell\n\nYeah, thank you. I was very happy to be with you today.\n\nmichael barbaro\n\nWell be right back. Hi, there.\n\ngretchen whitmer\n\nHi.\n\nmichael barbaro\n\nGovernor Whitmer, its Michael Barbaro. How are you?\n\ngretchen whitmer\n\nIm doing all right. How are you doing?\n\nmichael barbaro\n\nIm doing great. Where are you right now? That looks like it might be home.\n\ngretchen whitmer\n\nYes. Yes, Im at the governors residence in one of the rooms.\n\nmichael barbaro\n\nIs that a sign of you that says, The Gov?\n\ngretchen whitmer\n\nIts a beer that was named after me. So yes, thats the poster.\n\nmichael barbaro\n\nAnd the beer is called The Gov?\n\ngretchen whitmer\n\nYep.\n\nmichael barbaro\n\nIs that any good?\n\ngretchen whitmer\n\nIt is pretty good. Its an Indian pale ale.\n\nmichael barbaro\n\n[LAUGHS] So governor, over the past few weeks, it feels like a lot of people have learned your name. But I sense a lot of Americans, a lot of our listeners dont know all that much about you, and how it is you became the governor of Michigan. So in brief, what is that story?\n\ngretchen whitmer\n\nYou know, Im a lifelong Michigander. Ive lived here my whole life. I was brought up in a household with a father who was kind of a Republican, a mother who was kind of a Democrat. I decided to run for governor after spending some time practicing law and teaching, and I did a stint as a prosecutor in my hometown. But I think that part of my nature is when I see a problem, and I dont see the right people there to fix it, I just kind of want to jump in and do it. The tagline of the campaign was fix the damn roads. And it wasnt because it was poll-tested. Its how everyone in the state talks about their frustration with infrastructure that hasnt been attended to properly for a long period of time. And it is the most visceral daily reminder of government thats not getting the fundamentals right.\n\nmichael barbaro\n\nMm-hm.\n\ngretchen whitmer\n\nThat was kind of the call to action. And I won by almost 10 points after Donald Trump had won my state by less than 11,000 votes just two years before, I think, because we really were trying to rally around getting the fundamentals right.\n\nmichael barbaro\n\nRight. So its fair to say that you did not run in that race for governor as somebody who would become a polarizing and partisan figure in a national debate over the future of the American economy.\n\ngretchen whitmer\n\nCorrect. [LAUGHS] To the contrary, I went out of my way to not go down that path. And so to be right here in this moment, in the midst of a global pandemic, to be trying to pull people together  where things have gotten so polarized in ways that I think many people would say they couldnt have ever predicted, if they were being honest  is kind of surreal.\n\nmichael barbaro\n\nSo lets talk about how that happened, how you have gotten to this point where theres so much polarization over your decision-making. As the pandemic unfolds, soon enough, you begin imposing restrictions on the movement of Michigan residents and what feels like a pretty standard version of a lockdown.\n\ngretchen whitmer\n\nYes.\n\nmichael barbaro\n\nBut then at a certain point, you introduce a second wave of restrictions that are a little bit different, right? Banning travel to second homes, banning motor-boating, limiting what kind of non-essential goods stores can sell. And governor, what was your thinking there with that second wave of restrictions?\n\ngretchen whitmer\n\nSo what we knew at the time was that Covid-19 was ravaging southeast Michigan.\n\nmichael barbaro\n\nMm-hm\n\ngretchen whitmer\n\nWe also know that we have an incredibly high death count compared to our population  10th largest population, but the third highest number of positive cases and number of deaths. We also know that Covid-19 doesnt recognize boundaries of a county. That this is a disease that is highly communicable. There are studies that will tell you Covid-19 can stay active and communicable for 72 hours on a stainless steel surface. And so as the weather starts to warm up here in Michigan, we know people want to head north and go to the lake.\n\nmichael barbaro\n\nMm-hm.\n\ngretchen whitmer\n\nOne of the lakes  we got lots of beautiful freshwater lakes. And the more people that are on the road, the more likely Covid-19 will be spread at a gas station. I often would invoke the visual of that gas pump. So you think about all the nurses and doctors and people that have to touch that gas pump because theyre going out to get groceries, or theyre going out to pick up medication. The more people that are on the road, the more likely Covid-19 spreads to other parts of the state, too. And thats why these restrictions made sense.\n\nmichael barbaro\n\nSo your thinking was, lets shut down anything that might contribute to the spread, and lets make sure that people in the most populous parts of Michigan dont end up basically exporting it to less populous parts of the state, where outdoor activities are concentrated. And lets do this even if it might seem a little bit extreme.\n\ngretchen whitmer\n\nLets shut down whats not life-sustaining activity. That was the thought process of why we went more aggressive than some other states.\n\nmichael barbaro\n\nSo you think those second wave measures were the right call?\n\ngretchen whitmer\n\nI do.\n\nmichael barbaro\n\nGovernor, the protests that broke out in your state, Im sure you were aware of them because youre in Lansing. Protesters very much by design came to you. Did you sympathize at all with the protesters, who said that they found these restrictions to be too onerous, to be unfair, to be  in their minds  undemocratic?\n\ngretchen whitmer\n\nIll say this. I respect peoples right to disagree with me. I do. And I will defend anyones right to say what they want to say. Their ability and right to do that is absolutely something that I have a great deal of respect for.\n\nmichael barbaro\n\nHm.\n\ngretchen whitmer\n\nThe fact of the matter is, congregation is the biggest threat to containing Covid-19. Because when people come from all different parts of the state, congregate, dont observe C.D.C. best practices, and then go back to all parts of the state, thats precisely what were hoping to avoid in terms of continuous transmission and growth in other parts of Michigan.\n\nmichael barbaro\n\nMm-hm.\n\ngretchen whitmer\n\nBut when you look at these protests, there were a variety of different political groups that came together. It had a rally feel to it. It was right outside the office. I saw, I watched a bit of it. People were open carrying automatic rifles. There were demonstrations, anti-choice demonstrations. Theyre displaying Confederate flags and Nazi symbolism, and I think very partisan rhetoric. Was more about a political statement rather than a statement of the sacrifices that Ive asked people to make.\n\nmichael barbaro\n\nWell, yesterday, Governor, I spoke with a man who was at that protest. He stayed in his car. His name was Phil Campbell. He manages a kind of moderate-sized business that he says is suffering right now under these restrictions. And he said that he didnt arrive as a partisan. That he would have gone to Lansing and protested whether you were a Democrat or a Republican. And in his mind, the shutdown is creating its own health and safety costs, right? He says his employees may soon lose their health insurance because business is suffering so much they cant afford to provide it much longer. I mean, what do you say to someone like that  who says this is not about politics, this is not about you being a Democrat, this is not about the Tea Party? This is about a view that this is just not right?\n\ngretchen whitmer\n\nThe reality is, unrestrained activity would have made what was a hard time a catastrophe that would have taken a lot longer to start to re-engage from.\n\nmichael barbaro\n\nMm-hm.\n\ngretchen whitmer\n\nWhat our modeling told us, we would have 220,000 people who would need to be hospitalized this week. We have 3,000 people who are hospitalized. Its worked. And the vast majority of people are doing their part and doing the right thing. It hasnt been easy, but theyve stepped up to do it. And weve saved lives in the process.\n\nmichael barbaro\n\nThis gentleman I spoke with, Phil, the protester, his ultimate message  and it was directed very much at you as governor  is, trust us. Let us start to go back to work not like a band-aid being ripped off, but gradually. And trust us to be able to work and follow social distancing guidelines. And I think his question to you would be, do you trust Michiganders to do that?\n\ngretchen whitmer\n\nI am so inspired by what the people of this state have done in this crisis. Theyve stepped up. Theyve made sacrifices. I have incredible faith and confidence in the people of the state. But we have a duty to make sure that we get this right.\n\nmichael barbaro\n\nMm-hm.\n\ngretchen whitmer\n\nAnd its got to be guided by the best medical experts as well as business leaders. And thats what were working to do. I have a council of business leaders and medical leaders who are helping us determine how do we start to re-engage our economy in a way that avoids a second wave. Because whether Phil and I agree on how quickly that should be done or not, I think we can both agree  I hope so  that none of us ever wants to do this again. You know, in states that are moving, some would say too fast, one of the issues that small business is confronting is that the public is not confident that its safe to re-engage. And so theyve lifted the protections for small business while youre in a crisis. And yet, the publics not coming out to patronize. And that could be even worse for small business. So what we want to do is get it right. And that means working with the business community and public health. And turning up the dial together so we dont have to turn it back.\n\nmichael barbaro\n\nWell, lets talk about how it is that you get it right when it comes to reopening and how youre thinking about that. I mean, is there a data set youre looking at? Is there a set of measurements youre monitoring? And Im curious  and Im sure lots of people Michigan are, too  whats the thing or things that trigger the reopening?\n\ngretchen whitmer\n\nSo weve started to reengage. We are looking, of course, at rolling averages on hospitalizations. We are looking at our ability to ramp up testing. We need to build out when it comes to tracing, so that if someone does test positive for Covid-19, that were able to trace all their contacts and keep it from spreading. I would also add that we in Michigan are assessing different sectors of our economy for risk, asking questions like, is the work done in a region of our state thats been devastated by Covid-19, or a region that has been untouched by Covid-19?\n\nmichael barbaro\n\nRight.\n\ngretchen whitmer\n\nDoes the type of work require that multiple people use the same instruments or machinery? Is the work done indoors or outdoors? That makes a difference.\n\nmichael barbaro\n\nMm-hm. Right, one of the examples that I think Phil gave was around this idea of, is there a work that can be done  that just feels fundamentally safer by nature  that those might come back soon?\n\ngretchen whitmer\n\nSo you use the word feels. Feels safer.\n\nmichael barbaro\n\n[LAUGHS]\n\ngretchen whitmer\n\nAnd I think thats interesting, because what I want to make sure we do is go with data, and make sure that as we are reengaging, were continually measuring. I know Phil doesnt want to be back in a stay home order in August and neither do I.\n\nmichael barbaro\n\nMm-hm.\n\ngretchen whitmer\n\nAnd so I want to get this right for him, for his employees  lawnscaping, lawn care, that is already permitted. That was in our first wave that I announced on Friday. In this next one, we could have construction  that is often in big spaces outdoors with P.P.E. and the protocols necessary. That could be a lower risk one that we can mitigate the risk further through protocols around face masks, or separators between workers who cant be six feet apart but can have plexiglass separators, for instance. And so all of these are pieces to starting to turn the dial up and what it looks like in waves.\n\nmichael barbaro\n\nYou know, we started by talking to you about the fact that when you first ran for governor, it was as somebody literally talking about fixing the roads and fixing infrastructure in Michigan. And through these actions that youve taken in response to the pandemic, you have become a national figure, a national Democratic figure, right? Youre, whether you wanted to or not, sparring with the president. And whether its fairly or unfairly, youre now seen through a partisan lens, as a partisan figure. Are you comfortable now in that role?\n\ngretchen whitmer\n\nNo! [LAUGHS] Im not. I mean, you know, I was thrown into the national spotlight being criticized or attacked by the President of the United States. I didnt ask for that. I did not like it. I didnt sleep \n\nmichael barbaro\n\nReally?\n\ngretchen whitmer\n\n frankly, because I was worried that this would preclude my ability to get the help that I need for Michigan.\n\nmichael barbaro\n\nHm. You fear that you might actually suffer some kind of retribution that might make it harder to get through this pandemic?\n\ngretchen whitmer\n\nYeah. And I think that that was a legitimate fear with some of the statements that have been made.\n\nmichael barbaro\n\nBy the president?\n\ngretchen whitmer\n\nYeah. That if youre not nice, you might not get the help you need. And so Ive bent over backwards to try to smooth that over, not throwing a punch back. I would hate for anyone in Michigan to not have the help they need because Im not popular with the president for some reason.\n\nmichael barbaro\n\nDo you worry that with the divided state of this country, some of your constituents will come away from this pandemic seeing your actions as partisan no matter what happens and no matter what your intentions?\n\ngretchen whitmer\n\nI think thats the unfortunate reality that we live with. I do think, though, that when we have gotten through this when we look back on it, that were going to be comfortable in the fact that the decisions that were made save lives.\n\nmichael barbaro\n\nMm-hm.\n\ngretchen whitmer\n\nThe hard thing about public health is when you do it well, you never know how many lives would have been lost otherwise.\n\nmichael barbaro\n\nMm-hm.\n\ngretchen whitmer\n\nBut we can see it when you look at the curves where we were headed, and where we are today, that theres no question lives were saved. Theres no question that these actions made a difference. And thats what centered everything that weve done.\n\nmichael barbaro\n\nHm.\n\ngretchen whitmer\n\nNot the partisan stuff, not the fear of that, but the determination to do everything in our power to save lives and to keep our health care system working so that its there when we all need it.\n\nmichael barbaro\n\nWell, Governor Whitmer, I want to thank you very much for your time. And I hope youre getting a little more sleep now.\n\ngretchen whitmer\n\n[LAUGHS] No, but Ill sleep sometime. Thank you.\n\nmichael barbaro\n\nThank you. We appreciate it. Well be right back. Heres what else you need to know today. On Tuesday, the number of confirmed cases of the coronavirus in the United States reached 1 million, meaning that roughly one in every 330 Americans has tested positive for the virus. But The Times reports that the actual number of infections is even higher since thousands of Americans have never been tested because of a shortage of testing supplies. And \n\narchived recording (nancy pelosi) We had intended to come back next week. It has been previously scheduled. But once the Capitol physician told us that it was not a proper for us to do that in the interest of not only members and staff, but the custodians, the people who maintain the Capitol, the press who cover us, the staff of the actual legislative chamber, there was no choice for us but to say we will put this off.\n\nmichael barbaro\n\nThe House of Representatives has canceled plans to call lawmakers back into session after members complained that returning to Washington would pose an unnecessary health risk and set a bad example for the country. The Senate, however, is expected to reconvene in Washington on Monday. Finally.\n\narchived recording [JETS FLYING]\n\nmichael barbaro\n\nIn New York, jets from the Air Force Thunderbirds and the Navy Blue Angels flew over the city on Tuesday in a tribute to medical workers and first responders involved in fighting the pandemic.\n\narchived recording [JETS FLYING]\n\nmichael barbaro'	b'Trump Encourages Protest Against Governors Who Have Imposed Virus Restrictions'	2020-04-17	['Michael D.

This map shows where the number of new cases is rising and where it is falling in the last 14 days.\n\nHot spots in the United States Hot spots Total cases Deaths Per capita How the number of new cases has changed in the last two weeks Falling About the same Rising Few or no cases Share of population with a reported case No cases reported Double-click to zoom into the map. Use two fingers to pan and zoom. Tap for details. Note: The map shows the known locations of coronavirus cases by county. For total cases and deaths: Circles are sized by the number of people there who have tested positive or have a probable case of the virus, which may differ from where they contracted the illness. For per capita: Parts of a county with a population density lower than 10 people per square mile are not shaded. For hot spots: The map shows where the average number of reported cases over the past two weeks is increasing, decreasing or about the same. Counties with an increasing number of cases are shaded darker for larger increases when adjusted for population. Counties with fewer than 20 cases over the past two weeks are not shown. Sources: State and local health agencies and hospitals.\n\nThough the number of new deaths has been curving downward, the virus continues to circulate widely within the United States. As states move to partly reopen their economies, thousands of new cases are still being identified each day and true normalcy remains a distant vision. Every day, more beloved events are scrubbed from the calendar. There will be no Columbus Scottish Festival in Indiana, no Maine Authors Book Festival, no Western Minnesota Steam Threshers Reunion.\n\nWhere new cases are increasing\n\nMar. 1 May 29 7-day average California 107,473\n\ntotal cases Virginia 43,611\n\nNorth Carolina 27,726\n\nWisconsin 17,973\n\nAlabama 17,203\n\nMississippi 15,229\n\nMissouri 12,949\n\nSouth Carolina 11,131\n\n\n\nThese states have had recent growth in newly reported cases over the last 14 days, in part because some have recently ramped up their testing capacity. The White House released criteria for states to reopen based on a downward trajectory of cases over the last 14 days, though it did not define how to measure the trajectory. Scales are adjusted for each state to make the curve more readable.\n\nWhere new cases are mostly the same\n\nMar. 1 May 29 7-day average Texas 62,208\n\ntotal cases Florida 55,416\n\nMaryland 52,662\n\nGeorgia 44,279\n\nIndiana 35,064\n\nOhio 34,566\n\nColorado 25,602\n\nMinnesota 24,200\n\n\n\nWhere new cases are decreasing\n\nMar. 1 May 29 7-day average New York 374,471\n\ntotal cases New Jersey 159,608\n\nIllinois 117,796\n\nMassachusetts 95,512\n\nPennsylvania 75,789\n\nMichigan 56,589\n\nConnecticut 41,762\n\nLouisiana 39,682\n\nNote: States and territories are grouped according to how the seven-day average of new cases has changed from two weeks ago to today.\n\nIn late February, there were just a few dozen known cases in the United States, most of them linked to travel. But by late spring, the virus had torn through every state, infecting more people than the combined populations of Wyoming and Delaware, and killing more Americans than can fit in an N.F.L. stadium. Despite some progress, new hotspots continue to emerge and hundreds more people are dying each day.\n\nSee our live coverage of the coronavirus outbreak for the latest news.\n\nAmerican life has been fundamentally reordered because of the virus. Concerts, parades and baseball games have been called off. Unemployment claims have spiked. Some governors have imposed quarantine requirements on Americans who cross state lines. And even as states begin to reopen, officials have warned that the virus was likely to remain a persistent threat.\n\nNew reported cases by day in the United States 0 10,000 20,000 30,000 cases March April May 7-day average New cases Note: The seven-day average is the average of a day and the previous six days of data.\n\nNew reported deaths by day in the United States 0 1,000 2,000 deaths March April May 7-day average New deaths\n\nThe New York Times has found that official tallies in the United States and in more than a dozen other countries have undercounted deaths during the coronavirus outbreak because of limited testing availability.\n\nThe New York Times is engaged in a comprehensive effort to track the details of every coronavirus case in the United States, collecting information from federal, state and local officials around the clock. The numbers in this article are being updated several times a day based on the latest information our journalists are gathering from around the country. The Times has made that data public in hopes of helping researchers and policymakers as they seek to slow the pandemic and prevent future ones.\n\nSee our maps tracking the coronavirus outbreak around the world.\n\nBusinesses are reopening\n\nAll 50 states have started to reopen their economies in some capacity. But the number of businesses that are back open varies widely from state to state and even county to county.\n\nYou have 50 different governors doing 50 different things, said Andrew Noymer, an associate professor of public health at the University of California, Irvine. There will be states that open too soon or states that are too conservative. It is hard to thread the needle.\n\nIn New Jersey, which has the second-most cases per capita, residents remained largely on lockdown, with only certain industries allowed to resume operations. In Connecticut, offices were allowed to open, with masks required and layouts adjusted to ensure social distancing. And in Alaska, where relatively few cases have been identified, but where several visiting workers have tested positive in recent days, restaurants, gyms and other businesses were preparing to return to full capacity.\n\nIt will all be open, Gov. Mike Dunleavy of Alaska said, just like it was prior to the virus.\n\nMany states began to reopen despite not meeting White House guidelines for progress against the virus. And some, like Texas and Minnesota, relaxed restrictions even as case numbers rose.\n\nBut governors in more restrictive states have faced increasing pressure, including in Illinois, where some Republican legislators sued the Democratic governor, in Michigan, where a man in Detroit was accused of threatening to kill the Democratic governor and attorney general, and in North Carolina, where President Trump pressed the Democratic governor for assurances that the Republican National Convention in Charlotte could proceed as planned.\n\nCase numbers in North Carolina have risen rapidly in recent days, with many of the new cases concentrated in rural counties.\n\nPlans are being made by many thousands of enthusiastic Republicans, and others, to head to beautiful North Carolina in August, Mr. Trump said Monday in a series of Twitter posts. They must be immediately given an answer by the Governor as to whether or not the space will be allowed to be fully occupied. If not, we will be reluctantly forced to find, with all of the jobs and economic development it brings, another Republican National Convention site.\n\nDespite troubling trend lines in places like Arizona and Arkansas, and persistently high case numbers in Chicago and Los Angeles, the news in much of the country is encouraging. Reports of new cases have been steady or declining in most states, even as testing becomes more widely available. Around Detroit and New Orleans, where explosive growth stretched hospitals early in the pandemic, the situation has improved dramatically in recent weeks. In Hawaii and Vermont, few new cases are being spotted. And in Massachusetts and Rhode Island, which have some of the highest per-capita infection rates, cases have been trending downward.\n\nCase numbers spike in meatpacking cities\n\nAcross the country, production at meatpacking plants and other food processing centers has slowed or stopped because of large outbreaks, including one at a Smithfield facility in South Dakota that sickened more than 1,000 people and three at Tyson facilities in Iowa that sickened hundreds of people.\n\nThe Times has identified more than 100 food processing facilities across the country with coronavirus outbreaks. The federal Centers for Disease Control and Prevention said at least 4,900 meat and poultry processing workers had been infected across 19 states, and at least 20 had died. Though outbreaks have been reported in every region of the country, the rural Midwest and South have been especially hard hit.\n\nSome companies, including Smithfield, have refused to answer even basic questions about the size of their outbreaks. And in some places, state and local health officials have also been silent. In Kansas, state officials said there were more than 2,300 meatpacking-related cases and seven deaths spread across 10 clusters, but they refused to name those facilities. In Nebraska, where the National Guard has helped with the mass-testing of meatpacking workers, state and local officials have often refused to provide details. Officials in Virginia, Maryland and North Carolina, among other places, have also not provided that information.\n\nHot spots: Counties with the highest number of cases per resident County Cases Per 100,000 TWO-WEEK CHANGE IN CASES FALLING FLAT RISING Trousdale, Tenn. 1,393 14,551 Mar. 1 May 29 Dakota, Neb. 1,654 8,141 Lincoln, Ark. 975 7,119 Nobles, Minn. 1,512 6,923 Colfax, Neb. 612 5,688 Lake, Tenn. 413 5,488 Ford, Kan. 1,738 5,040 Texas, Okla. 917 4,342 Cass, Ind. 1,589 4,172 Bledsoe, Tenn. 606 4,150 Show all\n\nSmall counties with large meatpacking industries have reported some of the countrys highest numbers of cases per capita. In Nobles County, Minn., 631 workers at a pork processing plant have tested positive. In Cass County, Ind., where at least 900 Tyson workers tested positive, the number of known cases surged from roughly 50 to more than 1,400 over three weeks. And in Dakota County, Neb., which has the second-highest per capita infection rate of any American county, roughly one of every 13 residents has tested positive.\n\nThe outbreaks have proved devastating to the immigrant communities that often supply much of the labor at those plants, as well as to the farmers who depend on the facilities for their livelihoods.\n\nMr. Trump recently declared the meatpacking plants to be critical infrastructure, part of an effort to keep the facilities open. But restaurants have already reported meat shortages, many grocery stores have imposed quotas on meat purchases and some farmers have euthanized animals they could not take to market. In central Nebraska, the mayor of Grand Island called for federal help testing employees of his citys hard-hit JBS USA beef processing plant. And in Illinois, where there have been multiple meatpacking outbreaks, Attorney General Kwame Raoul called for federal action to keep workers safe.\n\nThis executive order lacks meaningful safety measures and puts workers at processing plants at risk, said Mr. Raoul, a Democrat.\n\nNew York: 374,400 cases have been identified\n\nCase numbers in New York and New Jersey, by far the countrys hardest-hit states, have trended steeply downward in recent days. Officials have started implementing plans for a slow, cautious reopening of the economy.\n\nAnyone who tells you they know the script doesnt know what theyre talking about, Gov. Andrew M. Cuomo said recently. We all wish we did but we dont.\n\nThe continuing toll of this spring has been immense. People with the virus have died in more than 40 New York counties, including more than 1,400 victims each in Nassau, Suffolk and Westchester Counties. New York City has fared the worst, with thousands of known cases and hundreds of deaths in each borough. Mayor Bill de Blasio compared the pandemic to many Katrinas.\n\nEven as the number of new cases has dropped, the city continues to report more than almost anyplace else in the United States. And about 100 children in the state have been treated for a mysterious illness that causes life-threatening inflammation in critical organs and which appears to be connected to the coronavirus.\n\nThis is a truly disturbing situation, Mr. Cuomo said. And I know parents around the state and around the country are very concerned about this, and they should be.\n\nNearby, New Jersey has also suffered. More than 154,000 people in the state have tested positive for the virus, and more than 11,000 have died. But that state was also seeing signs of progress and beginning to slowly ease restrictions.\n\nWe want to make sure we do it right, responsibly, and that we dont kill anybody by doing it too fast, Gov. Philip D. Murphy said Sunday during an interview on CNNs State of the Union.\n\nThough New York and New Jersey have by far had the most cases, other Northeastern states have also seen severe outbreaks. Despite recent improvement, Massachusetts continues to report more than 800 new cases most days. Rhode Island has one of the countrys highest per capita infection rates. And in Connecticut, where 85 deaths had been linked to the virus at the start of April, the death total has now passed 3,600.\n\nSee how the rate of deaths has changed over time in different states and countries.\n\nIn Americas nursing homes, outbreaks surge\n\nAcross the country, a pattern has played out with tragic consistency: Someone gets sick in a nursing home. Soon, several residents and employees have the coronavirus. The New York Times has identified more than 9,000 nursing homes and other long-term care facilities across the United States with coronavirus cases. More than 197,000 residents and staff members at those facilities have contracted the virus, and more than 37,000 have died. That means one third of the deaths in the pandemic have been linked to long-term care facilities.\n\nOlder people and those with underlying health problems are most vulnerable to Covid-19, making the consequences of a nursing home outbreak especially devastating. More than 50 deaths have been linked to the virus at a dozen facilities. In California, Florida, Pennsylvania, New York and New Jersey, the virus has been identified in more than 400 long-term care facilities.\n\nThe New York Times is tracking the coronavirus at nursing homes and long-term care centers. Do you or a family member live or work in one of these facilities? If so, wed like to hear from you.\n\nThis disease creates the potential for a perfect storm in a long-term care facility  large groups of vulnerable people living together and a highly transmissible virus that may not cause symptoms in those who care for them, said Dr. Daniel Rusyniak, the chief medical officer for Indianas state social services agency.\n\nThough all sorts of nursing homes have suffered, those with a higher percentage of black and Latino residents have been likelier to be hit with the virus.\n\nFollowing critical media reports and public pressure, the Trump administration told the operators of the nations nursing homes to let patients and their families know if there are cases of the coronavirus within their facilities. The order will require the facilities to report such cases to the Centers for Disease Control and Prevention within about 12 hours or face fines.\n\nThough many of the first coronavirus cases in the United States were tied to overseas travel, localized outbreaks have become increasingly common. New clusters in nursing homes and other settings, including a psychiatric hospital in Nevada and a date-packing facility in California, are emerging each day.\n\nTimes journalists have for weeks tracked clusters of cases and deaths across the country. The largest such outbreaks include state prisons in Ohio and Tennessee, a federal prison complex in California, meatpacking plants in the Midwest and an aircraft carrier that was docked in Guam. The deadliest outbreaks have been in nursing homes and other long-term care facilities.\n\nCases Connected To Cases Marion Correctional Institution  Marion, Ohio 2,439 Pickaway Correctional Institution  Scioto Township, Ohio 1,791 Trousdale Turner Correctional Center  Hartsville, Tenn. 1,315 Lompoc Prison Complex  Lompoc, Calif. 1,110 Smithfield Foods pork processing facility  Sioux Falls, S.D. 1,098 Cook County jail  Chicago, Ill. 1,040 Tyson Foods meatpacking plant  Waterloo, Iowa 1,031 Cummins Unit prison  Grady, Ark. 1,016 U.S.S. Theodore Roosevelt  Guam 969 Harris County jail  Houston, Texas 947 Show all\n\nSome agencies and facilities have refused to release the numbers of cases or deaths. More than 1,500 inmates and guards have tested positive across New York Citys 10 jails, and 13 deaths have been tied to those facilities, but officials have refused to provide a breakdown for each jail.\n\nPrisons have been overwhelmed by the virus\n\nThe Times has counted more than 47,000 coronavirus infections and 485 deaths in inmates and staff at state prisons, federal prisons and local jails. The countrys three largest known coronavirus clusters are in prisons that have more than 1,300 cases each.\n\nNearly every state prison system has at least one infection among either inmates or staff. Many of the infections have been asymptomatic, suggesting that the problem is more common than is understood. Fear and pessimism has settled in among inmates. Riots in Kansas and Washington State were led by inmates worried about contracting the coronavirus, prison officials said.\n\nInmates say that they have not been kept informed by prison administrators about correctional officers who have tested positive. That has left prisoners saying they feel especially vulnerable and also concerned that they might be infected and unwittingly passing the virus on to other inmates.\n\nYou cant really track it and know who had contact with who, said Dennis McKeithan, a prison inmate in Pennsylvania. The secrecy is making things more unsafe because people wont be able to realize, Oh, I had contact with that guy myself, and then go ahead and get tested.\n\nDuring interviews with more than two dozen inmates across the nation, prisoners say that correctional facilities are responding to the crisis far too slowly. At Wyoming Correctional Facility in Attica, N.Y., Tracy White, 30, said that only workers on the serving line in the prisons mess hall are required to wear masks covering their nose and mouth.\n\nA lot of people are nervous, tense, scared, Mr. White said.\n\nSocial distancing, he said, is impossible. Beds are placed three feet apart. As Mr. White spoke over a prison telephone, he said another inmate was on another phone less than two feet away. He said he had cleaned the phone as best as he could, but that he was also wearing a sock on his hand to protect himself from germs.\n\nElijah McDowell, an inmate in Connecticut, said the sweep of coronavirus through his prison -- including the death of several inmates -- had made a bleak existence even more grim.\n\nEvery day is nerve-racking, he said. I already have to fight things every day, but fighting the coronavirus, its not a fair fight because they keep us in the dark about a lot of things.\n\nAt Cook County Jail in Chicago, where nearly 1,000 inmates and staff have been infected, Antonio House said he washed his hands regularly and tried to be as sanitary as possible in order to stay healthy. But he said the strain of being unable to maintain six feet of distance from guards and other inmates who do not always wear masks was at times overwhelming.\n\nMentally, its rough, said Mr. House, 45. Its scary. Im fearful because I dont know how my body will respond if I catch it.\n\nSeveral days after the interview, LaSheda Brooks -- who is Mr. Houses daughter -- said her father had contracted the coronavirus. He is currently recovering, she said.\n\nCases, deaths continue to mount around Chicago\n\nAs some major cities have seen their cases decline, new infections have remained stubbornly high around Chicago. More than 40,000 people in the city have been infected and more than 1,800 have died. Add in the suburbs, and those numbers more than double.\n\nChicagos mayor, Lori Lightfoot, said recently that many in her city had defied orders to stay home and hosted large house parties that the police have had to break up. After watching the plight of New York City, Ms. Lightfoot was taking a cautious approach to eventually reopening her city.\n\nI feel the burden of having to say to people, Stay inside for your own safety, said Ms. Lightfoot, who said she hoped the city could start slowly reopening in early June. But that is the right thing to do.\n\nAs in much of the country, black and Hispanic people have suffered disproportionately in the Midwest. In Michigan, where less than 15 percent of residents are black, about 40 percent of those who died from the virus have been. In South Dakota, where about 7 percent of residents are black or Hispanic, 36 percent of coronavirus patients are members of those groups. And in Illinois, officials said recently that about 60 percent of Hispanic people who were tested for the virus were positive, three times the average for other Illinoisans.\n\nWhile we cant fix generations of disparities in the span of a few months, we must advance equity in our public health response, said Gov. J.B. Pritzker of Illinois, who said longstanding obstacles for members of our Latino communities are now amplified in this pandemic.'	b'Coronavirus in the U.S.: Latest Map and Case Count'		['The New York Times']	['map', 'facilities', 'york', 'times', 'coronavirus', 'states', 'count', 'case', 'virus', 'latest', 'deaths', 'united', 'cases', 'state']	b'Note: The map shows the known locations of coronavirus cases by county.\nIn late February, there were just a few dozen known cases in the United States, most of them linked to travel.\nThe New York Times has identified more than 9,000 nursing homes and other long-term care facilities across the United States with coronavirus cases.\nThough many of the first coronavirus cases in the United States were tied to overseas travel, localized outbreaks have become increasingly common.\nCases, deaths continue to mount around ChicagoAs some major cities have seen their cases decline, new infections have remained stubbornly high around Chicago.'

Offices, factories and schools have shut down for extended periods of time. Hospitals have scrambled for equipment and beds. Millions have lost their jobs.\n\nGovernments around the world are reacting in varying ways to the crisis. In the United States, the federal government has enacted recovery plans, one of which is the largest economic stimulus measure in modern history. Countries and regions are beginning to reopen, but what is to come is very much unknown.\n\nWe know you have questions about staying healthy, preventing the spread of this disease, what to do if youve lost your job, and more about restarting this new normal.\n\nThree Big Questions\n\nReopening\n\nWe are providing free access to the most important news and useful guidance on the coronavirus outbreak to help you understand the pandemic. Get the latest news and more information here.\n\nMoney\n\nHealth\n\nStaying In\n\nMental Health\n\nTravel\n\nCan I travel? Is it safe? + Yes, depending on where you want to go, and not easily, as where it is possible to travel and whether it is wise to do so are increasingly complicated questions. In March, as more and more governments around the world hoped to slow the spread of the coronavirus, they imposed travel restrictions and many closed their borders. Now some states and countries are opening up, but it's a complicated patchwork of what is open and whether self-isolation or quarantines are required for entry. And if you do have to travel, remember to practice social distancing: Stay away from groups and keep at least six feet of distance between you and other people. Many destinations, from Spain to Massachusetts, continue to urge visitors to self-isolate for two weeks after entry. Read More Here are more answers to questions about travel. How can I protect myself while flying? + If air travel is unavoidable, there are some steps you can take to protect yourself. Most important: Wash your hands often, and stop touching your face. If possible, choose a window seat. A study from Emory University found that during flu season, the safest place to sit on a plane is by a window, as people sitting in window seats had less contact with potentially sick people. Disinfect hard surfaces. When you get to your seat and your hands are clean, use disinfecting wipes to clean the hard surfaces at your seat like the head and arm rest, the seatbelt buckle, the remote, screen, seat back pocket and the tray table. If the seat is hard and nonporous or leather or pleather, you can wipe that down, too. (Using wipes on upholstered seats could lead to a wet seat and spreading of germs rather than killing them.) Read More How to Disinfect Your Space on an Airplane I don't mind being alone, but I'd like to do it somewhere else. Is it possible to road trip responsibly? + If you decide to travel, follow a general rule: Dont go far, stay in your car, said Robert Sinclair Jr., a Northeast regional spokesman for AAA. Mr. Sinclair offered other advice. When pumping gas, sanitize your hands after replacing the pump and before you touch the car door handle, steering wheel and any other part of the vehicle. If an attendant pumped the gas for you, sanitize your credit card after it is handed back to you. Minimize bathroom breaks as much as possible. While this advice goes against AAAs general advice to take a break every 100 miles, Mr. Sinclair said drivers could rest in vehicles at scenic overlooks or in parking lots of rest stops. Otherwise, wash your hands after using a public restroom and before touching your car. And remember: With guidelines on travel changing rapidly state by state, the rules at your starting point may be different than the rules at your destination. Read More Heres what else to consider if youre traveling by car. What about a national park? Can I go off into the wilderness and be alone? + Its a tempting idea, isnt it? To explore a national park and be away from other people. These parks are slowly reopening in limited, staggered fashion in the hopes that they can limit visitors and control the number of people coming in. Check their websites to see their hours and what part of each park is opened. My plans got derailed. Can I get a refund? + With airlines cutting trans-Atlantic flights and cruise lines canceling sailings, travel conditions and refund policies are changing daily. But it depends, some operators, facing dire straits themselves, are issuing credits for future travel instead of refunds. Keep an eye on social media and official communications from your airline, hotel, cruise or wherever you booked to stay up to date with any changes to refund policies. And expect long wait times if you do need to contact a company. Read More Here are more answers to questions about travel. If I cancel my flight, will I get my money back? + Airlines are required to issue cash refunds when they cancel (or significantly delay) flights because of the coronavirus pandemic. That applies to domestic airlines as well as international airlines for canceled flights to, within or from the United States. Read More Here are more answers to questions about travel refunds. What about travel insurance? + Typically, insurance companies will cover disrupted or canceled trips only under very specific circumstances. But if you purchased cancel-for-any-reason insurance for your trip, theres a good chance you will get a good share of your money back. Be sure to read the fine print on your coverage before speaking with a representative. Read More Here are more answers to questions about travel. I cant get my airline on the phone. What should I do? + Obviously, the 800 numbers are overwhelmed, said Michael Holtz, the founder and chief executive of SmartFlyer, a luxury travel agency. Many airlines in the United States have informed travelers that they could expect longer wait times to speak to a customer service agent. Some have redirected callers to their websites and their apps, or asked travelers to leave their contact information for an agent. Contacting an airline via social media platforms like Twitter and Facebook may be your best option right now. My advice is to use technology, he said. Read More Here are more answers to questions about travel. Are there any restrictions in place for people immigrating to the United States? + In April, President Trump ordered a temporary halt in issuing green cards. This order is in effect for 60 days, but might be extended based on economic conditions at the time, he said. Mr. Trump said that this order will not apply to those entering on a temporary basis, a reference to the worker visas, though he hinted that could change. We want to protect our U.S. workers, he said, and I think as we move forward, we will become more and more protective of them. Read More Trumps temporary green card ban.\n\nPolitics and Government\n\nJust for Parents\n\nMy kids are scared. What can I tell them? + Before you talk to your children, its important to understand your own anxiety and keep it in check. If your child is worried about the coronavirus, listen to him or her, rather than respond with comments like, Itll be fine. Dismissive reactions can make children feel like theyre not being heard, said Abi Gewirtz, a clinical psychologist and professor at the University of Minnesota. Emphasize the importance of washing hands after using the bathroom and before or after meals. Children (and adults) should sing Happy Birthday twice to make sure theyve been washing their hands for at least 20 seconds. You should also frame school cancellation as positive  more time to have more fun at home!  and encourage your children to get exercise. Read More Have more questions? We asked experts. Im worried about my childrens mental health. What can I do? + In some cases, exposure to stressful events  which right now might include the absence of routines, a parents job loss and economic hardship, or the serious illness or death of someone a child cares about  can leave children feeling traumatized. When we see a child acting in a manner that we think is inappropriate, we need to consider that the child is outside her window of tolerance for stress. Monitor their behavior closely, and consider seeking counseling if you arent sure whether the stress response youre seeing is normal. Talking about the pandemic and its impact may help avoid the harmful effects of stress. Help your kids understand that there are things they can do to help others  like staying home whenever possible and wearing a mask when they go out. Kids feel good when they know they are helping solve a problem. Also, avoid making assumptions. While we may be struggling with schools being closed, kids could be rejoicing in it. We might assume our kids miss their friends, but they may appreciate having more time with us. And some who were dealing with bullying or social challenges at school may be relieved not to have to see other kids. Read More How to Keep Childrens Stress From Turning Into Trauma Can children get the coronavirus? Can they transmit it? + Fewer children seem to get infected by the coronavirus than adults. Their symptoms tend to be mild. However, a very small number of children with the virus have shown symptoms associated with toxic shock or Kawasaki disease. This is a rare illness in children, according to the New York City Health Department, that involves inflammation of the blood vessels, including coronary arteries. Two studies conducted in recent weeks offer compelling evidence that children can transmit the virus. While neither proved it, many epidemiologists who were not involved in the research said that the evidence was strong enough to suggest that schools should be kept closed for now. Read More Evidence that children may transmit the coronavirus. My child has mild cold or flu symptoms. Should I take him to the hospital? + No. Coronavirus symptoms can include fever, dry cough or shortness of breath. If your child has other symptoms, like mild fever, runny nose or sore throat, you should call your pediatrician first before going anywhere. We want people who are not critically ill to stay out of the hospital, said Dr. Rebecca Pellett Madan, M.D., a pediatric infectious disease specialist at N.Y.U. Langones Hassenfeld Childrens Hospital. If your child develops more severe symptoms, such as trouble breathing, an inability to eat or drink or a change in behavior, you should visit a doctor, Dr. Madan said. Read More Have more questions? We asked experts. When can the grandparents come over? + A life in seemingly endless lockdown and isolation from grandchildren is not how grandparents want to spend their golden years. To start, families need their own reality check about the actual level of vigilance by every member of the household. So as a first step, think about human contacts, big and small, by every member of the household. How many times did someone go to a store? Did you meet up with a friend for a walk? When you jog, how close are you to other runners? And so on. Next, try to seal the leaks in your quarantine bubble. While it may be impossible to get your contact risk to zero, you can eliminate the biggest risks (like outside visitors), reduce shopping trips to once a week or less, improve hand hygiene and wear a mask. The biggest worry is being in an enclosed space with someone who has the virus but doesnt know it, so keep everyone outside, if possible. But if a child must enter a grandparents house, monitor them and allow it only when the grandparent is outside. Everyone should wear a mask, and sanitize the bathroom after use. If the grandparent is visiting you, designate one disinfected bathroom just for them and keep children outdoors. Read More When Can I See My Grandkids? Should I take my child to her scheduled well visit? + If you have a newborn, toddler or young child who is still receiving immunizations, it is important to take her to her well visit, as long as you can do it safely, according to guidance released from the American Academy of Pediatrics on March 18. If your child is older and has received all of her immunizations, the A.A.P. recommends that you consider postponing your well visit for the near term. The organization also has tips for doctors to help keep their patients, parents and staff safe during their visits, including keeping well visits in the morning and restricting visits for kids who are sick to the afternoon. It also urges doctors to see kids who are sick in different facilities, rooms or floors, and to increase the use of telemedicine. Read More Have more questions? We asked experts. Can we see other families at all? + Were really encouraging zero play dates at this point, said Dr. Sean OLeary, M.D., an executive member of the American Academy of Pediatrics Committee on Infectious Diseases. Theoretically, he said, it might be feasible for your child to play outside with one other child if they can keep six feet apart, but the reality is that keeping younger kids from touching their friends is nearly impossible. If you have an older child who you know can absolutely stay six feet apart from his pals in a wide open space, its fine for them to play, but monitor them closely. Always make sure they are washing hands vigorously when they come inside. Read More Have more questions? We asked experts. My kids cant figure out how to play by themselves. + In this time of anxiety and uncertainty, its really natural for children to regress, which means their dependency needs  for comfort, physical closeness, affection and communication  are going to be paramount, said Lawrence J.

If theyre really not used to playing alone, they might only last for five or 10 minutes the first few times. It also helps creating prompts for play time around your home, arranging dolls at a tea party or putting together a half-built structure. Read More How to teach your kids to play on their own.

This is The Daily.\n\narchived recording 1 Michigan has been one of the most aggressive states when it comes to taking steps to combat the coronavirus. archived recording 2 Bans on all gatherings outside a single household, travel to in-state vacation homes, and the use of motorboats \n\nmichael barbaro\n\nMichigans restrictions on its citizens movements have been at the center of a national debate about public health versus economic survival.\n\narchived recording Protests in Michigan are growing because the governor, Democrat Gretchen Whitmer, has told us citizens they cant leave the city and stay in their summer homes. archived recording (donald trump) Dont buy paint, dont buy roses, dont buy  I mean, shes got all these crazy things.\n\nmichael barbaro\n\nToday: A conversation with the governor who ordered those restrictions and a demonstrator who is protesting them. Its Wednesday, April 29. So I just want to start by asking you to introduce yourself. Your name and where youre talking to us from.\n\nphil campbell\n\nMy name is Phillip Campbell and Im coming to you from Jackson County, Michigan, which is about an hour west of Detroit and about an hour away from the capital of Lansing.\n\nmichael barbaro\n\nAnd how long have you lived there?\n\nphil campbell\n\nIve been here in this particular location for five years, but Im a born and raised Michigander my whole life.\n\nmichael barbaro\n\nAnd did you say how old you are?\n\nphil campbell\n\nYeah, 39. Im turning 40 in June. I had a massive party planned. I was inviting everyone I know and now I just dont know whats happening with that, so.\n\nmichael barbaro\n\nWhen you say massive, how massive?\n\nphil campbell\n\nI invited 1,000 people so, we were going to be \n\nmichael barbaro\n\n[LAUGHS]\n\nphil campbell\n\nI have five acres and I was going to rent Port-a-Johns. And we were going to camp. And it was going to be a multi-day bash, you know?\n\nmichael barbaro\n\nIt turns out youre very popular, too.\n\nphil campbell\n\n[LAUGHS] Well, Ive made a lot of friends over the years.\n\nmichael barbaro\n\nSo tell me about what you do for a living.\n\nphil campbell\n\nIm the vice president of a pest and wildlife control company. We are the ones you call if you wake up at 1:00 a.m. and theres a bat flying around your kids bedroom, and you need somebody to go get it. We will climb on your roof and pull down the hornets nest. We will take care of the mice in your basement. Well do this sort of work.\n\nmichael barbaro\n\nMm-hm.\n\nphil campbell\n\nWe have about 30 employees. Ive been with the company for about 10 years now. I think Im one of the most senior employees there. We started when we were in the basement of the owners house. And now we have a very large industrial building with a depot and a shop. So its been cool to see that grow over the years.\n\nmichael barbaro\n\nSo at this point, how would you describe the company and its success?\n\nphil campbell\n\nI mean, I think were on the threshold of breaking through to the next level of growth. Were grossing about $3 million a year.\n\nmichael barbaro\n\nWow.\n\nphil campbell\n\nJust this year were able to for the first time provide health benefits for our employees. So weve been working towards that for a long time, trying to get to where we have the sort of revenue and the growth that we could take on those costs, which are not insignificant, you know? We like to think that were one of the companies or industries that can still offer regular old Joes without a college education a very decent middle class livelihood with insurance benefits, things like that.\n\nmichael barbaro\n\nMm-hm.\n\nphil campbell\n\nThe majority of technicians are what I would just call blue-collar people, you know? They like to hunt, they fish. They go out on the lake on the weekends and drink beer on their pontoons and listen to music. And just regular old folks, you know?\n\nmichael barbaro\n\nMm-hm. And what kind of a living do the people generally make?\n\nphil campbell\n\nI mean, many of the people in our company, they provide for their families. You know, theyre the breadwinner. You know, a new technician like starting might make 35.\n\nmichael barbaro\n\nMm-hm.\n\nphil campbell\n\nAnd then a technician whos been with us for a while and knows what hes doing, he can make in the high 50s or 60s. So with the 30 employees we have, we feed about 100 mouths, with their children and families. So we feel responsible for about 100 peoples well-being.\n\nmichael barbaro\n\nAnd what did the first Michigan lockdown, the one ordered by Governor Whitmer  what did it mean for your pest control business?\n\nphil campbell\n\nHer order did not exempt us. The text of the order itself, it did not make an exemption for wildlife control, pest control. And we were preparing to shut down. And then I noticed that it said for its definition of essential services, for further clarification, see this document by the Department of Homeland Security. And we found that we were allowed to stay open.\n\nmichael barbaro\n\nGot it.\n\nphil campbell\n\nBut very quickly after that we had to furlough a couple people after that, because even though we were allowed to stay open, our customer base, many of them arent working. So if your customers arent working, theyre not spending money. And it doesnt really matter if youre open if all the people you serve arent working, you know what I mean?\n\nmichael barbaro\n\nRight. I dont want to pry too much, but if you were bringing in  I think you said almost $3 million a year in revenue  before this, what did it start to look like once the lockdown was in place and the calls from customers began to taper off?\n\nphil campbell\n\nAt first, it was a 50 percent drop.\n\nmichael barbaro\n\nWow.\n\nphil campbell\n\nAgain, this is for a company that was allowed to stay open.\n\nmichael barbaro\n\nRight.\n\nphil campbell\n\nAnd then around this time, the second shutdown order came in, which was the one that everybody started protesting about.\n\nmichael barbaro\n\nTell me what you mean.\n\nphil campbell\n\nYeah, the second shutdown order just ramped down on the first. This was the one that went in and shut particular sections of stores that were still open. So like it said, you cant buy paint products, you cant buy gardening products. Because what was happening is people thinking, OK, I got to stay home, I might as well work on my house, you know? So a lot of those people were going to Home Depot, were going to whatever to get their supplies. And then the governor said, no, you cant get that stuff. So this was the order that said you cant go out on a lake by yourself in your boat in your private lake, if the boat has a motor. But if it doesnt have a motor, you can go. Things that seemed a lot more arbitrary. The one that said you cant have someone come mow your lawn, even though they pull up in a truck, they drive the lawnmower off, they dont touch you, they dont go into your house. Its just one guy mowing your lawn. You know, things that people started thinking, like, the economys already in freefall, is it really necessary to go this far with it? From my own experience, if the economy takes a dump and we cant get back to where we were, we have to cut their health insurance or were going to have to lay people off. Were going to take other measures to stay afloat. I dont know what were going to have to do. I dont want to hypothesize. I dont want my employees to listen to this and be like, what did you say is going to happen? I dont know, were going to have do something. We cant just suddenly take a 30 percent to 50 percent decline. Thats huge. What if you got a 50 percent pay cut? It would affect your life. And so Im thinking about the ripple effect. We take a 30 percent to 50 percent drop. Our employees take a dip. Maybe they cant afford to pay their debts. Maybe they cant afford to pay their own mortgages or whatever. I dont know. I havent assessed the financial situation of each of my employees. But I guess what I am frustrated about  and I dont want to minimize the risk of Covid-19 or the people whove had it  but as someone whos worked for 10 years in this business trying to build it up, get it to where it is, Im frustrated with the attitude of some people that we can just shut it off for a while, and then just turn it back on when everythings safe, and just pick up where we left off. Like, no, thats not how business works. Thats certainly not how small business works. If you take a big enough hit, its hard to recover from it, you know?\n\nmichael barbaro\n\nSo Im curious when you first hear about the possibility of a public demonstration, a protest, in Michigan of these lockdown rules?\n\nphil campbell\n\nI saw an event on social media, I think, or I saw people talking about it  like, hey, lets go down to Lansing and protest. So the owner and I  works been slow, so we said, hey, we got time. Lets drive down to Lansing on Thursday. The way I understood it, we were going to drive by the capitol and honk our horn, basically.\n\nmichael barbaro\n\nAnd what was that honked horn going to mean?\n\nphil campbell\n\nThe honked horn was going to mean like, we are workers, and we want the freedom for people to be able to work. Please consider opening things back up a little more. The capitol in Lansing, its on a loop, so you drive around in like a circle around the capitol. So I thought that all the traffic would come in, wed kind of loop around and wed honk, and then wed go back home, you know? But they were anticipating a certain amount of people  I think 10 times more than they anticipated showed up. So it took us two hours to get to Lansing. We got in Lansing, and then we were just  Michael, it was a traffic jam. Thats what it was. It was just a big traf  it was like an organized traffic jam.\n\nmichael barbaro\n\nBut what did it feel like to be in that traffic jam? Because its a particular kind of traffic jam with like-minded people there to protest something.\n\nphil campbell\n\nIt was really neat. It was nice to not feel so alone, because I was really sick of people on social media telling me Im selfish because I dont want the company I helped build for 10 years to just collapse.\n\nmichael barbaro\n\nWhos calling you selfish, do you feel like?\n\nphil campbell\n\nOh, just people on social media, my friends. People in my broader circle. You know, not people Im necessarily close to, but Id say I lost some friends over this, honestly. When the governor shut the economy down, I said this is going to be very hard on businesses and this is going to be very hard on us. And a lot of peoples response seemed to be like, what, do you want people to die or something, you know? And it kind of degenerated into, like, either you want people to die or you hate my business and stuff like that. And I was really glad, because I was starting to feel kind of isolated, to see a solidarity of so many other Michiganders who were similarly frustrated at the situation. Afterwards, when I got home, I saw there was a lot of people with a lot of Trump stuff, and I was kind of thinking, like, no, this isnt political. Dont make it into a political thing because this isnt about the governor happens to be a Democrat or a woman or something. Because I would have gone down there if it was a Republican, you know? It wasnt about her party affiliation. So I was frustrated \n\nmichael barbaro\n\nWhat did you make of the flavor of the protest? It seems like you didnt see this yourself in your car, but as youve hinted, there were strong strains of libertarianism and conservatism, and pro-Trump posters, as well as people with guns, as well as some, you know, some more vulgar and extreme sentiments. Some people compared Governor Whitmer to Hitler.\n\nphil campbell\n\nOh, like Governor Whitler? [LAUGHS] Oh, I dont know, I think thats just juvenile. I mean, I think its pretty juvenile in public discourse when the only thing you go to is compare your opponent to Hitler. I wish it wouldnt have been so much anti-Whitmer, because this isnt about like Governor Whitmer, the person, you know? I wish that it would have been more on point and focused about let me work, you know?\n\nmichael barbaro\n\nI wonder where you fall in the political spectrum. Did you vote for Trump? Did you vote for Whitmer? And how did your political views apply to this event?\n\nphil campbell\n\nMy political views didnt apply to this event really at all. You know, like, I wouldve been there if this was a Republican. I did vote for Trump. I dont particularly think hes doing that great of a job. So Im not a gung-ho Trump supporter. I didnt vote for Whitmer, but I didnt like the guy running against her, either. So.\n\nmichael barbaro\n\nYoure saying youre not seeing this crisis or the lockdowns through a political lens?\n\nphil campbell\n\nNo, no, not at all. Not at all. The little match between President Trump and Governor Whitmer is making it more political. When Trump tweets, Liberate Michigan, when he refers to her as that woman from Michigan, obviously, that sets Governor Whitmer up as a foil against President Trump, which politicizes it. When rumors start coming out that Biden wants to consider her as V.P. material, that politicizes it. I really liked when I was there that it simply seemed like a spontaneous expression of working class frustration.\n\nmichael barbaro\n\nPhil, I want to tick through what your governor said when she began this process of locking down the state and basically enforcing social distancing. And heres what she said: The only tool we have to fight the virus at this moment and to support our health care system is to give them the opportunity by buying some time.\n\nphil campbell\n\nYeah.\n\nmichael barbaro\n\nAnd she went on to say, Without aggressive measures, more people will get sick, more people will die, and our economy will suffer longer. And in her telling, the disease spreads if people are out there. If people arent out there, the disease doesnt spread. So she is making the case in the beginning that these sacrifices are required to prevent a system overload. What do you think of that?\n\nphil campbell\n\nWell, we were willing to go along with that, because we were all expecting this huge crunch on all our hospitals. We were worried about not enough beds, not enough ventilators. But the fact is the curve is flattened now. We now have hospitals, theyre not overwhelmed anymore. So what were saying is that was all well and good, but now, we can start to open up again because we flattened the curve. Even if infections go back up at this point, as I grant they could if we start being more economically active, it seems highly unlikely, given all the empty hospitals, that were going to get to another crush where we dont have enough beds or something like that.\n\nmichael barbaro\n\nSo I want to make sure I understand what youre saying when you talk about where things are in Michigan. The Times has maps about where the virus is in each state. And just pulling this up, Michigan has about 38,000 infections, and theres been about 3,300 deaths.\n\nphil campbell\n\nYeah, were the third highest state, I think.\n\nmichael barbaro\n\nSo when you talk about your frustrations with the different phases of this lockdown, how do you square it with those numbers?\n\nphil campbell\n\nWell, I square it because my understanding is that the lockdown wasnt supposed to be like, were going to lockdown until this goes away. What we were told was that this lockdown was to distribute those amount of cases over a longer period of time, so that the health system doesnt get overwhelmed. So I look at the total number of deaths and infections and say, OK, this thing is here to stay whether we like it or not. The hospitals do have the ability to take people in. So it seems like to me that the goal has been met. The goal is not to \n\nmichael barbaro\n\nIt sounds like youre saying that if we assume that the measures taken so far have flattened the curve to some degree in Michigan, that youre willing to accept the risks of restarting the economy, even if that means that the curve might go up a little bit. That you think that so far the measures taken have done enough to merit that kind of experimentation with, essentially, taking the risk of reopening.\n\nphil campbell\n\nI think so. And again, Im not saying just a full, like  the economy isnt a switch, you just turn it on, everybody comes back out, you know? But I think people who want to work and can work in a way that is maintaining safe protocols, I think they should be able to. Because the thing is, what I would like people to understand is that its not like either we stay home and stay safe, or we all get the coronavirus and die. Its like staying home and nobody working has its own inherent risks and dangers and devastation thats going to come. When I talk about the economy, Im not saying Im worried about the stock market or the financial sector. Im talking about the ability of the average person to provide sustenance for himself and ones family. So we could have negative outcomes because of the shutdown, not because of Covid  negative outcomes that dwarf Covid.\n\nmichael barbaro\n\nMm-hm. So were now talking on Monday, April 27. And that protest was about two weeks ago.\n\nphil campbell\n\nYeah.\n\nmichael barbaro\n\nAnd Im curious if you think that protest, which was one of the very first protests, had any kind of impact?\n\nphil campbell\n\nYeah, I think it did. I mean, this is just me kind of blue skying this, but I think it let her see that she only had a limited amount of political capital that she could keep carrying this out indefinitely. She started to say, well let lawn service in again, well let various things start.\n\nmichael barbaro\n\nShe rolled back some of the more, in your mind, problematic restrictions.\n\nphil campbell\n\nYeah. She rolled back some of the more problematic restrictions and she started talking about an end game, you know? So in that respect, I think it was helpful. I think it got the message across.\n\nmichael barbaro\n\nWe plan to talk to Governor Whitmer and I wonder what you most want to communicate to her about what you think she may not understand, what she might not be getting in this moment?\n\nphil campbell\n\nWell, first, I would say to her, Americans are responsible people. Were creative people. Tell us what social distancing guidelines you think we should be maintaining when were out there, and let us find a way to do it. If you think we need to be six or seven feet apart, if you think we shouldnt have more than six people in a room, give us a safe paradigm of personal behavior and let us work within it. Dont lock us down and say that we cant provide for ourselves. Thats the most basic human right  is to provide for your own well-being. Just let us find some way to work.\n\n[music]\n\nmichael barbaro\n\nWell, Phil, thank you very much. We really appreciate your time.\n\nphil campbell\n\nYeah, thank you. I was very happy to be with you today.\n\nmichael barbaro\n\nWell be right back. Hi, there.\n\ngretchen whitmer\n\nHi.\n\nmichael barbaro\n\nGovernor Whitmer, its Michael Barbaro. How are you?\n\ngretchen whitmer\n\nIm doing all right. How are you doing?\n\nmichael barbaro\n\nIm doing great. Where are you right now? That looks like it might be home.\n\ngretchen whitmer\n\nYes. Yes, Im at the governors residence in one of the rooms.\n\nmichael barbaro\n\nIs that a sign of you that says, The Gov?\n\ngretchen whitmer\n\nIts a beer that was named after me. So yes, thats the poster.\n\nmichael barbaro\n\nAnd the beer is called The Gov?\n\ngretchen whitmer\n\nYep.\n\nmichael barbaro\n\nIs that any good?\n\ngretchen whitmer\n\nIt is pretty good. Its an Indian pale ale.\n\nmichael barbaro\n\n[LAUGHS] So governor, over the past few weeks, it feels like a lot of people have learned your name. But I sense a lot of Americans, a lot of our listeners dont know all that much about you, and how it is you became the governor of Michigan. So in brief, what is that story?\n\ngretchen whitmer\n\nYou know, Im a lifelong Michigander. Ive lived here my whole life. I was brought up in a household with a father who was kind of a Republican, a mother who was kind of a Democrat. I decided to run for governor after spending some time practicing law and teaching, and I did a stint as a prosecutor in my hometown. But I think that part of my nature is when I see a problem, and I dont see the right people there to fix it, I just kind of want to jump in and do it. The tagline of the campaign was fix the damn roads. And it wasnt because it was poll-tested. Its how everyone in the state talks about their frustration with infrastructure that hasnt been attended to properly for a long period of time. And it is the most visceral daily reminder of government thats not getting the fundamentals right.\n\nmichael barbaro\n\nMm-hm.\n\ngretchen whitmer\n\nThat was kind of the call to action. And I won by almost 10 points after Donald Trump had won my state by less than 11,000 votes just two years before, I think, because we really were trying to rally around getting the fundamentals right.\n\nmichael barbaro\n\nRight. So its fair to say that you did not run in that race for governor as somebody who would become a polarizing and partisan figure in a national debate over the future of the American economy.\n\ngretchen whitmer\n\nCorrect. [LAUGHS] To the contrary, I went out of my way to not go down that path. And so to be right here in this moment, in the midst of a global pandemic, to be trying to pull people together  where things have gotten so polarized in ways that I think many people would say they couldnt have ever predicted, if they were being honest  is kind of surreal.\n\nmichael barbaro\n\nSo lets talk about how that happened, how you have gotten to this point where theres so much polarization over your decision-making. As the pandemic unfolds, soon enough, you begin imposing restrictions on the movement of Michigan residents and what feels like a pretty standard version of a lockdown.\n\ngretchen whitmer\n\nYes.\n\nmichael barbaro\n\nBut then at a certain point, you introduce a second wave of restrictions that are a little bit different, right? Banning travel to second homes, banning motor-boating, limiting what kind of non-essential goods stores can sell. And governor, what was your thinking there with that second wave of restrictions?\n\ngretchen whitmer\n\nSo what we knew at the time was that Covid-19 was ravaging southeast Michigan.\n\nmichael barbaro\n\nMm-hm\n\ngretchen whitmer\n\nWe also know that we have an incredibly high death count compared to our population  10th largest population, but the third highest number of positive cases and number of deaths. We also know that Covid-19 doesnt recognize boundaries of a county. That this is a disease that is highly communicable. There are studies that will tell you Covid-19 can stay active and communicable for 72 hours on a stainless steel surface. And so as the weather starts to warm up here in Michigan, we know people want to head north and go to the lake.\n\nmichael barbaro\n\nMm-hm.\n\ngretchen whitmer\n\nOne of the lakes  we got lots of beautiful freshwater lakes. And the more people that are on the road, the more likely Covid-19 will be spread at a gas station. I often would invoke the visual of that gas pump. So you think about all the nurses and doctors and people that have to touch that gas pump because theyre going out to get groceries, or theyre going out to pick up medication. The more people that are on the road, the more likely Covid-19 spreads to other parts of the state, too. And thats why these restrictions made sense.\n\nmichael barbaro\n\nSo your thinking was, lets shut down anything that might contribute to the spread, and lets make sure that people in the most populous parts of Michigan dont end up basically exporting it to less populous parts of the state, where outdoor activities are concentrated. And lets do this even if it might seem a little bit extreme.\n\ngretchen whitmer\n\nLets shut down whats not life-sustaining activity. That was the thought process of why we went more aggressive than some other states.\n\nmichael barbaro\n\nSo you think those second wave measures were the right call?\n\ngretchen whitmer\n\nI do.\n\nmichael barbaro\n\nGovernor, the protests that broke out in your state, Im sure you were aware of them because youre in Lansing. Protesters very much by design came to you. Did you sympathize at all with the protesters, who said that they found these restrictions to be too onerous, to be unfair, to be  in their minds  undemocratic?\n\ngretchen whitmer\n\nIll say this. I respect peoples right to disagree with me. I do. And I will defend anyones right to say what they want to say. Their ability and right to do that is absolutely something that I have a great deal of respect for.\n\nmichael barbaro\n\nHm.\n\ngretchen whitmer\n\nThe fact of the matter is, congregation is the biggest threat to containing Covid-19. Because when people come from all different parts of the state, congregate, dont observe C.D.C. best practices, and then go back to all parts of the state, thats precisely what were hoping to avoid in terms of continuous transmission and growth in other parts of Michigan.\n\nmichael barbaro\n\nMm-hm.\n\ngretchen whitmer\n\nBut when you look at these protests, there were a variety of different political groups that came together. It had a rally feel to it. It was right outside the office. I saw, I watched a bit of it. People were open carrying automatic rifles. There were demonstrations, anti-choice demonstrations. Theyre displaying Confederate flags and Nazi symbolism, and I think very partisan rhetoric. Was more about a political statement rather than a statement of the sacrifices that Ive asked people to make.\n\nmichael barbaro\n\nWell, yesterday, Governor, I spoke with a man who was at that protest. He stayed in his car. His name was Phil Campbell. He manages a kind of moderate-sized business that he says is suffering right now under these restrictions. And he said that he didnt arrive as a partisan. That he would have gone to Lansing and protested whether you were a Democrat or a Republican. And in his mind, the shutdown is creating its own health and safety costs, right? He says his employees may soon lose their health insurance because business is suffering so much they cant afford to provide it much longer. I mean, what do you say to someone like that  who says this is not about politics, this is not about you being a Democrat, this is not about the Tea Party? This is about a view that this is just not right?\n\ngretchen whitmer\n\nThe reality is, unrestrained activity would have made what was a hard time a catastrophe that would have taken a lot longer to start to re-engage from.\n\nmichael barbaro\n\nMm-hm.\n\ngretchen whitmer\n\nWhat our modeling told us, we would have 220,000 people who would need to be hospitalized this week. We have 3,000 people who are hospitalized. Its worked. And the vast majority of people are doing their part and doing the right thing. It hasnt been easy, but theyve stepped up to do it. And weve saved lives in the process.\n\nmichael barbaro\n\nThis gentleman I spoke with, Phil, the protester, his ultimate message  and it was directed very much at you as governor  is, trust us. Let us start to go back to work not like a band-aid being ripped off, but gradually. And trust us to be able to work and follow social distancing guidelines. And I think his question to you would be, do you trust Michiganders to do that?\n\ngretchen whitmer\n\nI am so inspired by what the people of this state have done in this crisis. Theyve stepped up. Theyve made sacrifices. I have incredible faith and confidence in the people of the state. But we have a duty to make sure that we get this right.\n\nmichael barbaro\n\nMm-hm.\n\ngretchen whitmer\n\nAnd its got to be guided by the best medical experts as well as business leaders. And thats what were working to do. I have a council of business leaders and medical leaders who are helping us determine how do we start to re-engage our economy in a way that avoids a second wave. Because whether Phil and I agree on how quickly that should be done or not, I think we can both agree  I hope so  that none of us ever wants to do this again. You know, in states that are moving, some would say too fast, one of the issues that small business is confronting is that the public is not confident that its safe to re-engage. And so theyve lifted the protections for small business while youre in a crisis. And yet, the publics not coming out to patronize. And that could be even worse for small business. So what we want to do is get it right. And that means working with the business community and public health. And turning up the dial together so we dont have to turn it back.\n\nmichael barbaro\n\nWell, lets talk about how it is that you get it right when it comes to reopening and how youre thinking about that. I mean, is there a data set youre looking at? Is there a set of measurements youre monitoring? And Im curious  and Im sure lots of people Michigan are, too  whats the thing or things that trigger the reopening?\n\ngretchen whitmer\n\nSo weve started to reengage. We are looking, of course, at rolling averages on hospitalizations. We are looking at our ability to ramp up testing. We need to build out when it comes to tracing, so that if someone does test positive for Covid-19, that were able to trace all their contacts and keep it from spreading. I would also add that we in Michigan are assessing different sectors of our economy for risk, asking questions like, is the work done in a region of our state thats been devastated by Covid-19, or a region that has been untouched by Covid-19?\n\nmichael barbaro\n\nRight.\n\ngretchen whitmer\n\nDoes the type of work require that multiple people use the same instruments or machinery? Is the work done indoors or outdoors? That makes a difference.\n\nmichael barbaro\n\nMm-hm. Right, one of the examples that I think Phil gave was around this idea of, is there a work that can be done  that just feels fundamentally safer by nature  that those might come back soon?\n\ngretchen whitmer\n\nSo you use the word feels. Feels safer.\n\nmichael barbaro\n\n[LAUGHS]\n\ngretchen whitmer\n\nAnd I think thats interesting, because what I want to make sure we do is go with data, and make sure that as we are reengaging, were continually measuring. I know Phil doesnt want to be back in a stay home order in August and neither do I.\n\nmichael barbaro\n\nMm-hm.\n\ngretchen whitmer\n\nAnd so I want to get this right for him, for his employees  lawnscaping, lawn care, that is already permitted. That was in our first wave that I announced on Friday. In this next one, we could have construction  that is often in big spaces outdoors with P.P.E. and the protocols necessary. That could be a lower risk one that we can mitigate the risk further through protocols around face masks, or separators between workers who cant be six feet apart but can have plexiglass separators, for instance. And so all of these are pieces to starting to turn the dial up and what it looks like in waves.\n\nmichael barbaro\n\nYou know, we started by talking to you about the fact that when you first ran for governor, it was as somebody literally talking about fixing the roads and fixing infrastructure in Michigan. And through these actions that youve taken in response to the pandemic, you have become a national figure, a national Democratic figure, right? Youre, whether you wanted to or not, sparring with the president. And whether its fairly or unfairly, youre now seen through a partisan lens, as a partisan figure. Are you comfortable now in that role?\n\ngretchen whitmer\n\nNo! [LAUGHS] Im not. I mean, you know, I was thrown into the national spotlight being criticized or attacked by the President of the United States. I didnt ask for that. I did not like it. I didnt sleep \n\nmichael barbaro\n\nReally?\n\ngretchen whitmer\n\n frankly, because I was worried that this would preclude my ability to get the help that I need for Michigan.\n\nmichael barbaro\n\nHm. You fear that you might actually suffer some kind of retribution that might make it harder to get through this pandemic?\n\ngretchen whitmer\n\nYeah. And I think that that was a legitimate fear with some of the statements that have been made.\n\nmichael barbaro\n\nBy the president?\n\ngretchen whitmer\n\nYeah. That if youre not nice, you might not get the help you need. And so Ive bent over backwards to try to smooth that over, not throwing a punch back. I would hate for anyone in Michigan to not have the help they need because Im not popular with the president for some reason.\n\nmichael barbaro\n\nDo you worry that with the divided state of this country, some of your constituents will come away from this pandemic seeing your actions as partisan no matter what happens and no matter what your intentions?\n\ngretchen whitmer\n\nI think thats the unfortunate reality that we live with. I do think, though, that when we have gotten through this when we look back on it, that were going to be comfortable in the fact that the decisions that were made save lives.\n\nmichael barbaro\n\nMm-hm.\n\ngretchen whitmer\n\nThe hard thing about public health is when you do it well, you never know how many lives would have been lost otherwise.\n\nmichael barbaro\n\nMm-hm.\n\ngretchen whitmer\n\nBut we can see it when you look at the curves where we were headed, and where we are today, that theres no question lives were saved. Theres no question that these actions made a difference. And thats what centered everything that weve done.\n\nmichael barbaro\n\nHm.\n\ngretchen whitmer\n\nNot the partisan stuff, not the fear of that, but the determination to do everything in our power to save lives and to keep our health care system working so that its there when we all need it.\n\nmichael barbaro\n\nWell, Governor Whitmer, I want to thank you very much for your time. And I hope youre getting a little more sleep now.\n\ngretchen whitmer\n\n[LAUGHS] No, but Ill sleep sometime. Thank you.\n\nmichael barbaro\n\nThank you. We appreciate it. Well be right back. Heres what else you need to know today. On Tuesday, the number of confirmed cases of the coronavirus in the United States reached 1 million, meaning that roughly one in every 330 Americans has tested positive for the virus. But The Times reports that the actual number of infections is even higher since thousands of Americans have never been tested because of a shortage of testing supplies. And \n\narchived recording (nancy pelosi) We had intended to come back next week. It has been previously scheduled. But once the Capitol physician told us that it was not a proper for us to do that in the interest of not only members and staff, but the custodians, the people who maintain the Capitol, the press who cover us, the staff of the actual legislative chamber, there was no choice for us but to say we will put this off.\n\nmichael barbaro\n\nThe House of Representatives has canceled plans to call lawmakers back into session after members complained that returning to Washington would pose an unnecessary health risk and set a bad example for the country. The Senate, however, is expected to reconvene in Washington on Monday.

Were  what do you have, a very small number of people in the country right now with it? Its like around 12. Many of them are getting better. Some are fully recovered already.

We all together have done a very good job. The flu in our country kills from 25,000 people to 69,000 people a year. That was shocking to me. But thats a little bit like the flu. Its a little like the regular flu that we have flu shots for. And well essentially have a flu shot for this in a fairly quick manner. View this the same as the flu. This is not the flu. Its vicious. It is so contagious. Flu has never been like that, and there is  flu is contagious, but nothing like weve ever seen here. Anybody that wants a test can get a test. Thats what  the bottom line.

Hey, guys.\n\nmichael schmidt\n\nHey.\n\nmark mazzetti\n\nHey.\n\nmichael barbaro\n\nAll right. Mike Schmidt, Mark Mazzetti, its 9:15 on Thursday night. Youve both now spent about 10 hours reading the Mueller report. Tell me about this thing.\n\nmichael schmidt\n\nIts a breathtaking document. Its over 400 pages of detailed insights and accounts of enormous issues weve been focused on over the past two years. Its divided into, essentially, two halves  one for Russia, one for the presidents actions in office.\n\nmichael barbaro\n\nIn other words, collusion and obstruction. Those are the two buckets.\n\nmark mazzetti\n\nRight. The first half detailing the contact between Russians and Trump advisers isnt enormously revealing, in the sense that we had already heard some weeks ago that there had not been a, quote, criminal conspiracy found by Mueller. At the same time, theres an enormous amount of detail concluding that in the midst of this really historic effort by the Russians to sabotage the election  hacking and leaking of emails, social media manipulation, fake news  it says that the Trump campaign welcomed this. They saw a real benefit of what the Russians were doing, even if at the end of the day there wasnt an active conspiracy.\n\nmichael schmidt\n\nHes essentially saying that they were interested, they sought out information about emails, they wanted to know more about how they could get their hands on these messages. They welcomed all this, but they never crossed the line into breaking the law. Just because they sought out the fruits of the Russian hack doesnt mean that they were part of the crime.\n\nmichael barbaro\n\nAnd just to be very clear, how is what youre describing, collectively, not collusion?\n\nmark mazzetti\n\nWell, I think we need to be careful, because the attorney general said that there was no collusion. And the president said there was no collusion. But the Mueller report is more nuanced. And the Mueller report says, you know, this collusion word doesnt really mean anything to us. Theres no legal standard of collusion. So what were going to look at is what is a crime, and that is conspiracy. And thats what we have to judge all of this voluminous evidence against. And they said that a conspiracy is two parties acting together in concert to break the law. And what Mueller is very clear about is that there is, quote, insufficient evidence of a conspiracy. He is not saying there was nothing. He is not saying full exoneration. But hes saying there is insufficient evidence to meet the standard that he had established of a criminal conspiracy breaking the law.\n\nmichael barbaro\n\nAnd what would Mueller have needed to see for this to add up to conspiracy?\n\nmichael schmidt\n\nThat would have looked like a conversation between the Trump campaign and the Russians where the Trump campaign was saying, hey guys, can you go break into the D.N.C. and steal some emails so we can then get them out and embarrass the Democrats and help us politically during the campaign? That would have gotten you down the conspiracy path. And they did not find that.\n\nmichael barbaro\n\nO.K. So lets talk about obstruction. Mike, last time we talked, a couple weeks back, Mueller had sent his report to Barr. And Barr had sent a summary of that report to Congress in advance of this full report. And the most confusing thing about that summary was that Mueller had not made a call on whether the evidence added up to obstruction of justice.\n\nmichael schmidt\n\nAnd today, we get to see what Muellers explanation is for why he didnt make a determination on whether the president broke the law. And its not clear-cut. What it essentially is is that the president, under Justice Department policy, cannot be indicted. And because the president cannot be indicted, its unfair to accuse him while hes in office of breaking the law, because theres no way for him to go to court to defend himself. So, dear American public, Mueller essentially says, I am not going to make a determination on that issue. That could be made after the president leaves office. But for now, that would be unfair. So what I will do is I will lay out for you what I found, what the potential obstruction was, why it may be illegal. And after the president leaves office, the Justice Department could make a determination that he indeed broke the law and bring a case. And at the end of explaining why a determination was not made, Mueller says, if we had confidence after a thorough investigation of the facts that the president clearly did not commit obstruction of justice, we would so state. Based on the facts and the applicable legal standards, however, we are unable to reach that judgment. So Mueller is basically saying, if we felt comfortable that the president had done nothing wrong, we would tell you. And we are not telling you that.\n\nmichael barbaro\n\nWell, Mike, you mentioned the incidents that he was not going to use as a basis for charging the president, because he felt he couldnt charge the president. What were those that he laid out in the report?\n\nmichael schmidt\n\nWell, theres about a dozen. And they follow in chronological order how Trump misled the public about his relationship with Russia, misled the public about his knowledge that Russia was behind the hacks. And as the presidency goes on and Mueller is appointed in May of 2017, right after he takes office, the president starts to sort of lose his grip as he tries to maintain control of the investigation. He was intent on using his power as the head of the executive branch to protect himself and use the tools at his disposal  the people running the Justice Department, the F.B.I., the intelligence community  to help protect him from this investigation.\n\nmichael barbaro\n\nAnd what are some examples of that  specifics?\n\nmichael schmidt\n\nWell, a lot of them are ones that we know well. The firing of James Comey. His efforts to get his attorney general, Jeff Sessions, to un-recuse himself from the Russia investigation, essentially reassert his control over something that he has stepped aside from because he has a conflict of interest. And when the president cant get that done, he basically tries to get rid of Sessions and install a loyalist atop the Justice Department. These are things that had been reported in the press. We get a fuller, richer picture of them. And we really see what the president was saying behind closed doors and the immense pressure he was putting on people to try and use the system to protect himself from the system. But then we learn about incidents that we knew little about, like how the president went completely outside of his administration in government to Corey Lewandowski, his first campaign manager.\n\nmichael barbaro\n\nMm-hmm.\n\nmichael schmidt\n\nAnd he leaned on Corey in the summer of 2017 to try and pressure Sessions, his attorney general. So heres the president of the United States using someone who doesnt even work for him to get to Sessions and try and get Sessions out there publicly to help clear Trumps name. Its just a remarkable way of using presidential power.\n\nmichael barbaro\n\nWhich suggests that the president was meeting resistance within his own administration, and therefore reached out to somebody who didnt even work for the government to try to get him to achieve this end.\n\nmichael schmidt\n\nI dont think many in the public will want to hold up the presidents aides as heroes, and a lot of them are probably not. But there is a picture here of folks that stopped the president time and time again and thwarted him from doing things that may have actually gotten him into trouble, that may have crossed that line, that may have made a stronger argument for Mueller about why the president did obstruct justice. One of the most detailed ones is on Trumps efforts to get rid of Mueller and how his White House counsel would not do that. He would not call the Justice Department on the presidents behalf and say Mueller has to be removed for what the White House counsel, Don McGahn, thought were some bogus reasons Trump had cooked up about why he didnt like Mueller. And in the document, as Mueller is recounting what happened in this incident, there are Nixonian echoes. It says, on June 17, 2017, the president called McGahn at home and directed him to call the acting attorney general and say that the special counsel had conflicts of interest and must be removed. McGahn did not carry out the direction, however, deciding that he would resign rather than trigger what he regarded as a potential Saturday Night Massacre  a reference to when Richard Nixon fired the special counsel who was investigating him.\n\nmichael barbaro\n\nI recognize that this question is a little bit meta, but if getting rid of Mueller had meant that the report was never completed, wouldnt that have finally been obstruction of justice? Because, literally, an investigation was obstructed.\n\nmark mazzetti\n\nThere does seem to be a determination here about the success of the presidents efforts, or lack of success  that the fact that the Mueller investigation continued and finished means there is less of a case that the president obstructed justice. If there had been more of a Nixonian moment, where there was an 18-minute gap in tapes that were deliberately erased, that there was some tangible thing that had happened that had meant that prosecutors couldnt get to the truth, there might possibly have been a different judgment and a different outcome.\n\nmichael barbaro\n\nRight. I keep thinking of that 18-minute deletion when I think about Don McGahn. Its as if nobody had ever said to Nixon what Don McGahn had said to President Trump  no, Im not going to delete that tape. Sorry. But thats what Don McGahn did to the president. Thats what happened with Trump over and over again.\n\nmark mazzetti\n\nBecause everyone has seen All the Presidents Men, and they know what happens. And, you know, you dont want to be the guy who carries out the Saturday Night Massacre.\n\nmichael barbaro\n\nSo the president really has these people around him to thank, in a lot of ways.\n\nmichael schmidt\n\nAt the end of the day, there were these folks that were not going to go that extra inch and go over the line for him. And it looks like those measures probably saved him.\n\nmark mazzetti\n\nI mean, Mueller lays this point out explicitly. This is a quote from the report. The presidents efforts to influence the investigation were mostly unsuccessful. But that is largely because the persons who surrounded the president declined to carry out orders or cede to his requests. Comey did not end the investigation of Flynn, which ultimately resulted in Flynns prosecution and conviction for lying to the F.B.I. McGahn did not tell the acting attorney general that the special counsel must be removed, but was instead prepared to resign over the presidents order. Lewandowski and Dearborn did not deliver the presidents message to Sessions that he should confine the Russian investigation to future election meddling only. And McGahn refused to recede from his recollections about events surrounding the presidents direction to have the special counsel removed, despite the presidents multiple demands to do so.\n\nmichael barbaro\n\nHmm. And Mike, before seeing this report, our understanding of why Mueller may not have reached a conclusion on obstruction of justice was that obstruction has a lot to do with intent. Why did the president take the actions that he took? What did we learn from the report about how Mueller might have been thinking about that?\n\nmichael schmidt\n\nWe learn that the president was intent on ending the investigation into himself, but its less clear about what was truly motivating him.\n\nmichael barbaro\n\nI guess I dont quite understand that. If his intent is to end the investigation, how is that not obstruction of justice?\n\nmark mazzetti\n\nThis is the heart of this dispute right now.\n\nmichael schmidt\n\nYeah.\n\nmark mazzetti\n\nIts a clash of two theories. I mean, Muellers team clearly indicated that the actions come up to the line of obstruction of justice  that the intent to end the investigation to preserve his presidency does, in fact, approach something that is criminal obstruction of justice, even if they did not make that determination. The rub here is that it is at odds with the theory of Robert Muellers boss, Attorney General Barr. He got the job of attorney general, some say, based on his theory that the president cant really obstruct justice. Barr says, today, in his press conference \n\narchived recording (william barr) President Trump faced an unprecedented situation. As he entered into office and sought to perform his responsibilities as president, federal agents and prosecutors were scrutinizing his conduct before and after taking office.\n\nmark mazzetti\n\nAt the heart of a obstruction of justice investigation is whether that person has corrupt intent. And his determination is that the president didnt. And in a way, this big debate over the intent of the president  Barr kind of goes out of his way today to fill in the blanks, to sort of say, well, lets look at the presidents intent.\n\narchived recording (william barr) At the same time, there was relentless speculation in the news media about the presidents personal culpability. Yet, as he said from the beginning, there was, in fact, no collusion.\n\nmark mazzetti\n\nThe president felt that this was consuming his presidency.\n\narchived recording (william barr) There is substantial evidence to show that the president was frustrated and angered by his sincere belief that the investigation was undermining his presidency, propelled by his political opponents, and fueled by illegal leaks. Nonetheless, the White House fully cooperated with the special counsels investigation.\n\nmark mazzetti\n\nYeah. He wanted this thing over. So in a way, what was one of the things that was so extraordinary about Barrs press conference was that he explains the presidents reasoning in a way that the president hasnt himself.\n\nmichael barbaro\n\nSo Barr would say that trying to end the investigation to protect the presidency is not corrupt motive. In fact, in his telling, its arguably even important, maybe even a little bit noble. Its in the best interest of the American people.\n\nmichael schmidt\n\nPerhaps patriotic.\n\nmichael barbaro\n\nHmm.\n\nmark mazzetti\n\nSo theres this totally compelling moment in the middle of the report that paints a scene of the president being told that a special counsel had just been appointed. And Ill quote directly from the report. The president slumped back in his chair and said, Oh, my God. This is terrible. This is the end of my presidency. Im fucked. The president became angry and lambasted the attorney general for his decision to recuse from the investigation, stating, How could you let this happen, Jeff? The president said the position of attorney general was his most important appointment, and that Sessions had, quote, let him down, contrasting him with Eric Holder and Robert Kennedy. Sessions recalled that the president said to him, You were supposed to protect me, or words to that effect. The president returned to the consequences of the appointment and said, Everyone tells me if you get one of these independent counsels, it ruins your presidency. It takes years and years, and I wont be able to do anything. This is the worst thing that ever happened to me. The way this passage reads is the presidents anger about the appointment of a special counsel comes mostly from the recognition that its going to imperil his presidency. It means nothing will get done. It means that hes going to spend the rest of his term fighting it. Its not because hes worried that Robert Mueller might find something that will one day land Donald Trump in jail. Thats one reading of this passage that would bolster the argument made by the attorney general that the president faced this extraordinary situation.\n\nmichael schmidt\n\nI dont think that makes any sense. Or at least I dont understand it. I dont understand how the attorney general can say theres no issue of an underlying crime here when Donald Trump is sitting there acknowledging the potential threat from the depth and breadth of a special counsels investigation. He knew at that point, in May of 2017, that he had had his personal lawyer, Michael Cohen, make hush money payments to women. Donald Trump was smart enough to know that a special counsel  like in Bill Clinton or any other presidency  rummages around on one issue and ends up on another. And what happens? Mueller finds these weird transactions. He refers it to another U.S. attorneys office. And the president is ultimately in a completely separate investigation, named as an unindicted co-conspirator.\n\nmichael barbaro\n\nHmm.\n\nmichael schmidt\n\nHow is there not an underlying crime that Donald Trump was afraid about? In July of 2017, myself and two colleagues go into the Oval Office to interview the president. He says, if Mueller looks at my finances, its crossing a red line. So what were Trumps motivations for getting rid of Mueller? Was he really worried about Russia? Or was he worried that, hey, if this guy rummages around on Russia, hes going to find something else? Indeed, he did.\n\nmichael barbaro\n\nSo Mike, youre saying that Barrs argument  that the president is just protecting the presidency  doesnt really hold up. Because we know for a fact that the president understood, at this point, that when he says, Im effed, that he has these payments made in coordination with Michael Cohen to these women as hush money, which have nothing to do with the Russia investigation, but which obviously could be incredibly damaging to him, and maybe even criminal.\n\nmichael schmidt\n\nLook, no one has questioned the president about this in a law enforcement setting. I dont know exactly what the presidents intentions were, but the idea that there was no underlying criminality in Donald Trumps life in May of 2017, when Mueller got appointed, is bogus. Because there was. Further, in December of 2017, there is a report out there that Mueller has subpoenaed the presidents bank records.\n\nmichael barbaro\n\nMm-hmm.\n\nmichael schmidt\n\nBefore the presidents lawyers are able to get the message to him that the report is wrong, he starts telling White House aides that Mueller has to go.\n\nmichael barbaro\n\nHmm.\n\nmichael schmidt\n\nI do think theres a decent case to be made that there were underlying issues of criminality within his life. The Justice Department has said that itself.\n\nmichael barbaro\n\nO.K. So regardless of the presidents intent, is it important whether or not he was successful in impeding this investigation, in thinking about the question of obstruction of justice?\n\nmichael schmidt\n\nWell, I think for the folks at the Justice Department who had to make the call about whether the president broke the law, one of the factors that played into their declination decision was the fact that when you looked at the investigation, the efforts that the president took did not significantly damage the inquiry.\n\nmichael barbaro\n\nRight.\n\nmichael schmidt\n\nDespite the presidents best efforts, he was not very good at obstructing justice.\n\nmichael barbaro\n\nRight. The existence of the Mueller report today suggests that the investigation did not get obstructed.\n\nmichael schmidt\n\nDespite all of Donald Trumps huffing and puffing and trying to get this person to do this and this person to do that, Bob Mueller moved ahead unimpeded for two years, finished his investigation, and the entire country got to see the fruits of it. Show us where the obstruction is, is what the presidents defenders would say.\n\n[music]\n\nmichael barbaro\n\nWell be right back. So finally, I want to talk about Bill Barrs role in all this. Because the position of many Democrats today was that Barr  in reaching a decision on obstruction of justice where Mueller did not, in holding a press conference ahead of the reports release seeming to defend the president, all taken together  has undermined any credibility that he had, and that Democrats and the country need to see for themselves what Mueller had found. How are you thinking about Barr in this moment, having now spent time with the Mueller report?\n\nmark mazzetti\n\nI mean, the one thing is clear is that this has been a lot of red meat for Democrats in Congress to keep investigating. And one of the things that theyre going to keep investigating is Barrs role in this entire process. They are going to try to get him up to testify. They are going to try to get more underlying documents in the Mueller investigation. They now see Barr as a clear target for them. I think a lot of people, because of all these actions, have a much different picture of the attorney general than they did a month or two ago.\n\nmichael barbaro\n\nAnd theyre going to try to understand the differences between what Bob Mueller thinks about all this  the supposedly nonpartisan figure  and what Bill Barr thinks about this  the presidential appointee whose allegiances are clearly closer to the president.\n\nmichael schmidt\n\nTheres one answer to this. And that is that after this entire investigation in which Bob Mueller has said nothing publicly, including today, when there was a press conference held to talk about his report, we need to hear from Bob Mueller. We need for him to explain to us more how they came to this determination that they couldnt say whether the president violated the law or not. Does Mueller think that Barr has misrepresented some of his findings? What was his relationship with the Justice Department? Did he believe that Congress should deal with this issue and that Barr shouldnt have made a call on whether the president violated the law? We need to hear from Mueller. We have never heard his voice in the past two years.\n\nmichael barbaro\n\nSo inadvertently, in seeming to protect the president and not be representing Mueller, Bill Barr may be extending Democrats interest in this investigation and the trouble for the president.\n\nmark mazzetti\n\nAbsolutely. If you look back at what Barr has done in the last month, this could have turned out differently for him  if he had put out the report immediately after the letter or as soon after the letter as he could have, if he had characterized the report differently in that four-page letter, and if he hadnt had a press conference on the day of the release before anyone had seen the report that had this appearance of trying to spin it for the president and protect the president. That seems to have created more problems both for Barr and the president than if they had just released the report.\n\nmichael barbaro\n\nMark, thank you very much. Mike, thank you very much.\n\nmark mazzetti\n\nThank you.\n\nmichael schmidt\n\nThanks for having us.\n\n[music]\n\nmichael barbaro'	b'Mueller Reveals Trumps Efforts to Thwart Russian Inquiry in Highly Anticipated Report'	2019-04-18	['Mark Mazzetti']	['mueller', 'anticipated', 'trump', 'reveals', 'efforts', 'barr', 'report', 'inquiry', 'justice', 'obstruction', 'presidents', 'trumps', 'going', 'investigation', 'highly', 'russian', 'thwart', 'president']	b'michael barbaroWhat we learned from the Mueller report.\nYouve both now spent about 10 hours reading the Mueller report.\nBut the Mueller report is more nuanced.\nAnd the Mueller report says, you know, this collusion word doesnt really mean anything to us.\nBarr says, today, in his press conference archived recording (william barr) President Trump faced an unprecedented situation.'

This is The Daily.\n\n[music]\n\nToday: Federal prosecutors are asking a court to throw out their own criminal case against former national security adviser Michael Flynn. Mark Mazzetti on what led to that decision. Its Thursday, May 14. Mark, remind us where the Michael Flynn story starts.\n\nmark mazzetti\n\nWell, Michael Flynn was a three-star Army general who had a quite distinguished career, became the head of the Defense Intelligence Agency under the Obama administration. And then he gradually sort of moves into the Trump orbit in 2016 when Trump was running for president. During the Republican convention \n\narchived recording (michael flynn) We do not need a reckless president who believes she is above the law.\n\nmark mazzetti\n\n he famously leads a chant \n\narchived recording (crowd) Lock her up! archived recording (michael flynn) Yes, thats right, lock her up!\n\nmark mazzetti\n\nOf lock her up, meaning to Hillary Clinton.\n\nmichael barbaro\n\nRight.\n\narchived recording (michael flynn) If I did a tenth of what she did, I would be in jail today.\n\nmark mazzetti\n\nAnd after Trump is elected, he announces that hes going to make Flynn his national security adviser. So its during this time when theres a series of events that get Michael Flynn into trouble.\n\n[music]\n\nIts shortly after Christmas in 2016 when the Obama administration announces a number of sanctions against Russia for its efforts to sabotage the 2016 campaign. It was soon after that \n\narchived recording The Washington Post reports that Trumps incoming national security adviser, Michael Flynn, repeatedly called the Russian ambassador to the U.S. \n\nmark mazzetti\n\n that The Washington Post reported that Flynn had been on a number of phone calls with the Russian ambassador \n\narchived recording  on the exact same day \n\nmark mazzetti\n\n on the same day the Obama sanctions were announced, which raised questions about whether the incoming Trump administration was trying to meddle with the Obama administrations foreign policy.\n\narchived recording (mike pence) I talked to General Flynn about that conversation. Actually, it was \n\nmark mazzetti\n\nVice President-elect Mike Pence goes on Face the Nation.\n\narchived recording (mike pence) They did not discuss anything having to do with the United States decision to impose a censure against Russia.\n\nmark mazzetti\n\nPence says that Flynn had told him the sanctions never came up on the call. But the Justice Department had transcripts of the calls in which Flynn had actually urged the ambassador not to overreact to the Obama administrations sanctions.\n\narchived recording F.B.I. agents interviewed Michael Flynn about whether he discussed U.S. sanctions with Russian \n\nmark mazzetti\n\nSo F.B.I. agents are sent to the White House to interview Flynn.\n\narchived recording What has he told investigators?\n\nmark mazzetti\n\nHe tells them that the sanctions never came up on the call.\n\nmichael barbaro\n\nRight, hes lying to the F.B.I.\n\nmark mazzetti\n\nRight. This all becomes public, and in February 2017 \n\narchived recording General Michael Flynn suddenly resigned late last night.\n\nmark mazzetti\n\n Flynn is forced to resign.\n\narchived recording He is the shortest serving national security adviser now in modern history.\n\n[music]\n\nmichael barbaro\n\nAnd what happens to Flynn once hes pushed out of the White House?\n\nmark mazzetti\n\nThe F.B.I. continues to investigate Flynn, but very little is heard from him for a number of months. And during this time, President Trump starts leaning on James Comey, the F.B.I. director, in essence, to drop the Flynn investigation.\n\nmichael barbaro\n\nRight.\n\nmark mazzetti\n\nAnd that raised this idea that the President of the United States was trying to obstruct justice. And thats this kind of cataclysmic moment that ultimately sets off a chain of events that leads to not only Comey being fired, but also the appointment of Mueller as the special counsel.\n\nmichael barbaro\n\nRight. In many ways, the Flynn saga is the beginning of the Mueller saga, and the beginning of a very dark chapter for the Trump administration.\n\nmark mazzetti\n\nThats correct.\n\nmichael barbaro\n\nWhat ends up happening to Michael Flynn?\n\nmark mazzetti\n\nWell \n\narchived recording Flynn pled guilty to repeatedly lying to the F.B.I.\n\nmark mazzetti\n\nFlynn ends up pleading guilty to lying to the F.B.I.\n\narchived recording  says that he is cooperating \n\nmark mazzetti\n\nBecomes a cooperating witness in the Mueller investigation. Hes awaiting sentence.\n\narchived recording Court documents make clear that Flynn was not acting alone.\n\nmark mazzetti\n\nAnd the significance was that he was the first top White House official to plead guilty as part of the Mueller investigation.\n\narchived recording Court papers say Flynn could get up to six months behind bars, but he was under \n\nmichael barbaro\n\nMark, I feel like, for many people, that is where the Michael Flynn story pretty much ends, right? I mean, you have this three-star general, national security adviser who just totally falls from grace after lying to his bosses and the F.B.I., and now hes headed to prison.\n\nmark mazzetti\n\nThats right. And the Mueller investigation marches on, and the next significant point is the end of 2018 into 2019 when Flynn is set to be sentenced by a federal judge. And the Mueller team weighs in \n\narchived recording Breaking news right now. Bob Muellers office is recommending to the judge that Michael Flynn actually not receive any prison time.\n\nmark mazzetti\n\n and says Flynns been a good witness.\n\narchived recording Michael Flynn cooperated plenty with the special counsel.\n\nmark mazzetti\n\nThey recommend very little, if any, jail time.\n\narchived recording The defendant provided firsthand information about the content and context of interactions between the transition team and Russian government officials.\n\nmark mazzetti\n\nAnd something curious happens then, where Flynns legal team, which had been very cooperative towards the Mueller investigation, clearly  they cut what seemed to be a pretty good deal with the Mueller team  decide to take a more combative stance. They enter into the public record this idea that maybe Flynn had been railroaded, that the F.B.I. may have set him up. So this angers the judge. He really reads Flynn and his team the riot act, saying, are you now saying youre not remorseful? And why are you now accusing the F.B.I. of misconduct? And basically says, lets take a pause. Were going to put this off for a few months and come back to me when youve found some remorse. In the intervening time, the ground starts to shift.\n\n[music]\n\narchived recording William Barr has just been sworn in as the new attorney general, gaining broad control of the special counsel, Robert Muellers, Russia investigation.\n\nmark mazzetti\n\nWilliam Barr takes over as attorney general.\n\narchived recording (william barr) I believe it is vitally important that the special counsel be allowed to complete his investigation.\n\nmark mazzetti\n\nHe, during his confirmation hearing, pledges that hes not going to interfere with the Mueller investigation. So Mueller famously then delivers his report to Barr in March of 2019.\n\narchived recording (william barr) The deputy attorney general and I concluded that the evidence developed by the special counsel is not sufficient to establish that the president committed an obstruction of justice offense.\n\nmark mazzetti\n\nAnd Barr writes a very short summary of sorts that he says summarizes Muellers findings, which we now know misinterprets the Mueller report. Its quite clear starting at that point that Barr has great issues with not only the Mueller investigation, but how this all began  how the Russia investigation began at the F.B.I. and whether there was real misconduct.\n\narchived recording (william barr) Ive been trying to get answers to questions, and I found that a lot of the answers have been inadequate, and I also \n\nmark mazzetti\n\nSo he makes no secret of the fact that hes going to start investigating the investigation. He is going to launch a campaign to get to the bottom of what happened and whether there really was a political effort to go after Donald J. Trump and his advisers.\n\nmichael barbaro\n\nAnd what does that mean for Michael Flynn awaiting sentencing for lying to the F.B.I.?\n\nmark mazzetti\n\nAs the ground shifts, and as its clear that Barr is going to look at the predicate for the entire investigation, Flynn decides to get a new lawyer.\n\narchived recording (sidney powell) Nothing about this case was done right. They violated every rule, every protocol.\n\nmark mazzetti\n\nWho is not only a lawyer, but also a pundit of sorts.\n\narchived recording (sidney powell) The entire prosecution was false. It must be dismissed.\n\nmark mazzetti\n\nThis is a Texas lawyer named Sidney Powell who has made no secret of the fact that she thinks the entire thing is a witch hunt.\n\narchived recording (sidney powell) Their prosecution of General Flynn was needed to keep the obstruction hoax going against the president, because they already knew the Russia hoax had fallen apart.\n\nmark mazzetti\n\nVery much in line with what the President of the United States has said.\n\narchived recording (sidney powell) So the whole thing was orchestrated and set up within the F.B.I.\n\nmark mazzetti\n\nAnd days before she takes over as Flynns lawyer, she writes a secret letter to Attorney General Barr where she writes, quote, It is increasingly apparent that General Flynn was targeted and taken out of the Trump administration for concocted and political purposes.\n\nmichael barbaro\n\nWow. So youre saying Flynn recognizes the winds are changing, recognizing that theres literally a new sheriff, attorney general in town, whos skeptical of the entire Russia investigation, and so Flynn hires a lawyer who fits quite nicely into that dynamic.\n\nmark mazzetti\n\nYes. And during that period of time, Attorney General Barr decides to appoint another prosecutor whos going to examine the case and see whether there had been any misconduct that had taken place.\n\nmichael barbaro\n\nSo just to be clear, in addition to examining the roots of the Russia investigation broadly, Barr appoints a specific prosecutor inside the Department of Justice just to examine the Flynn case?\n\nmark mazzetti\n\nThats right.\n\n[music]\n\nAnd that leads to the release of a number of documents to the public in recent weeks that have led both Flynns lawyers and the president to make the case that Michael Flynn was indeed railroaded and set up by the F.B.I.\n\nmichael barbaro\n\nWell be right back. Mark, tell us whats inside these documents.\n\nmark mazzetti\n\nIn essence, the documents are internal F.B.I. and Justice Department communications around the time that Flynn was interviewed by the F.B.I. And what they show, kind of broadly, are that there was concern about the decision to interview Flynn. One of the documents that got a lot of attention was written by Bill Priestap, who at the time was the head of the F.B.I.s Counterintelligence Division, which was running the whole Russia investigation. And this is January 24, four days after the Trump administration takes over, and right before there is this decision to go send F.B.I. agents to interview the national security adviser. And Priestap writes, quote, Whats our goal, truth/admission or to get him to lie so we can prosecute him or get him fired?\n\nmichael barbaro\n\nWow.\n\nmark mazzetti\n\nIn another document, he seems to understand the risks of conducting this interview, and he says, Protect our institution by not playing games. And if we are seen playing games, the White House will be furious.\n\nmichael barbaro\n\nSome of that language is quite potentially inflammatory, the idea that the person running the investigation is wondering if their goal might be to get the national security adviser fired  essentially, to get him in trouble.\n\nmark mazzetti\n\nIt raises this question of whether Sidney Powell, Flynns lawyers, had a point, that they were trying to set him up, right? And finally, theres also interesting divide that is revealed between the F.B.I. and the Justice Department, and what some of the documents show is that there was some concern of Justice Department about what the F.B.I. was up to.\n\nmichael barbaro\n\nSo theres some concern about whether or not interviewing Flynn is at all a good idea.\n\nmark mazzetti\n\nRight. And we find out that the F.B.I. only tells the Justice Department theyre going to go do this while the agents are on their way to the White House.\n\nmichael barbaro\n\nHuh. Mark, what happens once these internal F.B.I. documents are released? Whats the reaction?\n\nmark mazzetti\n\nThis unleashes a torrent of criticism.\n\narchived recording (sidney powell) He should dismiss the case for egregious government misconduct without a doubt.\n\nmark mazzetti\n\nBy Flynns lawyer, Sidney Powell \n\narchived recording (sidney powell)  that the government has been hiding this evidence that shows their own crimes while they were accusing Mr. Flynn falsely of any crimes because they made it all up.\n\nmark mazzetti\n\n by other commentators on the right \n\narchived recording 1 A lot of people close to this feel like Michael Flynn was setup, never lied. archived recording 2 Admitting that they got things completely wrong, and actively worked to defame  archived recording 3 Instead, it looks like two systems of justice in terms of how the F.B.I. handled Hillary Clinton and how they handled Donald Trump.\n\nmark mazzetti\n\n by President Trump \n\narchived recording (donald trump) When I looked at what they did to him, they tormented him. Dirty cops tormented General Flynn.\n\nmark mazzetti\n\n making the case that Flynn should never have been interviewed, and the case should now be dropped.\n\n[music]\n\nmichael barbaro\n\nAnd what would be the legal basis for that argument? What in the documents do Flynns lawyers seize on and say makes his prosecution illegitimate?\n\nmark mazzetti\n\nWell, theyre saying that these documents reveal that there was real concern in the F.B.I. about whether the interview should have taken place in the first place.\n\nmichael barbaro\n\nMm-hmm.\n\nmark mazzetti\n\nAnd if the interview doesnt take place, then theres no lies to worry about. And if theres no lies, then theres nothing to prosecute Flynn on. And therefore, there is no case period, and Michael Flynn should walk free. You have no predicate to be there in the beginning, then whatever you find is immaterial to the investigation. And this is what Barr seizes on when he makes this incredibly dramatic decision last week.\n\narchived recording Just in this afternoon, the Justice Department is dropping its criminal case against President Trumps former national security adviser, retired General Michael Flynn.\n\nmark mazzetti\n\nTo drop the charges against Michael Flynn.\n\narchived recording The Justice Department today is holding that there was not a legitimate basis to do an investigation of Flynn.\n\nmark mazzetti\n\nBarr said there was never any good reason to interview Michael Flynn in the first place, and so whatever Flynn said during the interview was irrelevant. And Barr even goes further than that.\n\narchived recording (catherine herridge) Attorney General Barr, thank you for speaking first to CBS news. archived recording (william barr) Hi, Catherine.\n\nmark mazzetti\n\nIn an interview last week, he not only criticizes the decisions that were made at the time to interview Flynn \n\narchived recording (william barr) There was not, in our view, a legitimate investigation \n\nmark mazzetti\n\n but he also goes to bat for Flynn going all the way back to Flynns phone calls with the Russian ambassador.\n\narchived recording (william barr) And it is very typical and very common for the national security team of the incoming president to communicate with foreign leaders. And that call, there was nothing wrong with it whatever. In fact, it was laudable. And it was nothing inconsistent with the Obama administrations policies, and it was in U.S. interest. He was saying to the Russians, dont escalate.\n\nmark mazzetti\n\nHe actually says that the phone calls were laudable, and that it was perfectly understandable that Flynn would talk to the Russian ambassador to try to lower tensions in a very tense environment.\n\narchived recording When history looks back on this decision, how do you think it will be written? archived recording (william barr) Well, history is written by the winners, so it largely depends on whos writing the history.\n\nmichael barbaro\n\nI mean, whats fascinating about what Barr is doing is that it does not feel like every day when the Department of Justice sides with a defendant in a criminal prosecution over its own prosecutors who have successfully gone after that defendant.\n\nmark mazzetti\n\nAnd its in keeping with what William Barr has done for a year. From the time that Robert Mueller presented his report to barr, Barr has questioned the legitimacy of the investigation and any fruits of that investigation. He has questioned whether those prosecuted were done so fairly, or whether the F.B.I. overreached. He has also backed decisions to lower sentences of others.\n\nmichael barbaro\n\nMark, is Barrs legal analysis in the Flynn case sound? Is it in dispute?\n\nmark mazzetti\n\nBarrs decision has been widely criticized. Plenty of legal experts say that prosecutors in general have wide discretion to decide which aspects of the investigation they want to pursue, what is germane to the case, and in this specific instance, the fact that there was an ongoing investigation into contact between Trump aides and the Russians would make Flynns calls germane to this particular investigation. That is not to say that now looking back, there havent been instances of F.B.I. abuse over the course of the Russia investigation.\n\nmichael barbaro\n\nMark, given everything youve just said, and reading these documents that have been released from the Department of Justice about the debate that went on inside the F.B.I.  these notes from an agent about how to conduct this interview, whether they might, basically, trap Flynn in a lie and get him fired  I mean, is there a version of this where what Bill Barr has done is exactly what any justice system should do when there are serious questions about the legitimacy of a prosecution, which is kind of give the benefit of the doubt to the defendant?\n\nmark mazzetti\n\nYou always want greater transparency when it comes to how an investigation was conducted. Thats true if the target is Michael Flynn, or if the target is someone far less famous. The concern, of course, is whether there is abuse going on in the other direction.\n\nmichael barbaro\n\nWhat do you mean?\n\nmark mazzetti\n\nThat what the attorney general is doing is, in effect, launching a campaign to discredit the investigation, to discredit the Mueller probe, to discredit its results in a way that will ultimately benefit his boss, President Trump. Remember, President Trump, whos been railing against the quote unquote witch hunt for years, will be using this for his re-election campaign. So the concern, of course, is that Bill Barr is kind of acting as a proxy warrior for the president.\n\nmichael barbaro\n\nBut Mark, is it possible that both things can be true  that the Attorney General Bill Barr may be trying to discredit the entire Russia investigation, and in the process, very much oversimplify things, and that the prosecution of Michael Flynn might be flawed?\n\nmark mazzetti\n\nYes, both of those things can be true.\n\n[music]\n\nAnd this is why the passions are so intense on this issue, because both sides want to control the narrative, and because of that, cant allow, necessarily, any gray area in this argument. Either Michael Flynn is a hero or hes a traitor. Either the Mueller investigation was a just pursuit, or it was a witch hunt. And of course, there is a lot of space between those characterizations and nuance that gets lost because the political debate is black and white.\n\nmichael barbaro\n\nSo Mark, whats going to happen to Michael Flynn now?\n\nmark mazzetti\n\nWell, of course, given what William Barr decided, there is a very likely scenario that Michael Flynn soon is a free man and he is brought back into the fold, and in the coming months, we see him once again campaigning for Donald Trump.\n\nmichael barbaro\n\nThank you, Mark.\n\nmark mazzetti\n\nThanks, Michael.\n\n[music]\n\nmichael barbaro\n\nOn Wednesday night, The Times reported that before the Department of Justice sought to throw out the case against Michael Flynn, it had interviewed the F.B.I. official whose notes have been interpreted as potentially seeking to entrap Flynn. In that interview, the official, Bill Priestap, said that his notes had been misconstrued and that there was no effort to set Flynn up.\n\n[music]\n\nWell be right back. Heres what else you need to know today.\n\narchived recording (jerome powell) The scope and speed of this downturn are without modern precedent, significantly worse than any recession since World War II. We are seeing a severe decline in economic activity \n\nmichael barbaro\n\nIn a speech on Wednesday, the chairman of the Federal Reserve warned that the pandemic could permanently damage the American economy if Congress does not act to prevent a wave of bankruptcies and prolonged unemployment.\n\narchived recording (jerome powell) Long stretches of unemployment can damage or end workers careers as their skills lose value and professional networks dry up and leave families in greater debt.\n\nmichael barbaro\n\nThe message from Jerome Powell suggested that the trillions of dollars that Congress has already pumped into the economy may not be enough.\n\narchived recording (jerome powell) Additional fiscal support could be costly, but worth it if it helps avoid long-term damage and leaves us with a stronger recovery.\n\nmichael barbaro\n\nAnd the House of Representatives is poised to temporarily change its rules to allow lawmakers to vote and hold committee hearings remotely, so that they can avoid traveling to Washington during the pandemic. The rules, expected to pass tomorrow, would mark a major change for a body long defined by the tradition of meeting and voting in person.\n\n[music]'	b'Judge Hesitates to Accept Justice Dept.

Officer'	true	[]		trusted	[]	https://www.nytimes.com/2019/07/16/nyregion/eric-garner-case-death-daniel-pantaleo.html	https://www.nytimes.com/	b'michael barbaro\n\nFrom The New York Times, Im Michael Barbaro. This is The Daily. Today: The Justice Department will not bring federal charges against the officer involved in the death of Eric Garner. Ashley Southall on why that decision was reached five years after I cant breathe became a national rallying cry. Its Wednesday, July 17. Ashley, tell me what happened on Tuesday.\n\narchived recording (richard donoghue) Good morning. Thank you for coming today.\n\nashley southall\n\nSo the United States attorney for the Eastern District of New York, Richard Donoghue, whose office is based in Brooklyn, but also oversees Staten Island, came out and said \n\narchived recording (richard donoghue) Before I continue, let me say, as clearly and unequivocally as I can, that Mr. Garners death was a tragedy. For anyone to die under circumstances like these is a tremendous loss.\n\nashley southall\n\nTheyve done an exhaustive review. Theyve looked at every piece of evidence, but \n\narchived recording (richard donoghue) But these unassailable facts are separate and distinct from whether a federal crime has been committed. And the evidence here does not support charging police officer Daniel Pantaleo or any other officer with a federal criminal civil rights violation.\n\nashley southall\n\n that they would not bring charges against any of the officers involved in Eric Garners death on July 17, 2014.\n\narchived recording (richard donoghue) We know and understand that some will be disappointed by this decision, but it is the conclusion that is compelled by the evidence and the law.\n\nashley southall\n\nHes making this announcement one day before the fifth anniversary of Eric Garners death, which is important, because for the charge that they thought was appropriate in this case, they only had five years to decide whether to bring it.\n\nmichael barbaro\n\nSo this is basically the last possible moment to bring this charge.\n\nashley southall\n\nExactly. And at the end of the day, the prevailing consensus was that they could not do that in this case.\n\narchived recording (richard donoghue) Consequently, the investigation into this incident has been closed.\n\nmichael barbaro\n\nAnd remind us of the details of this case, of what happened to Eric Garner, where this case begins.\n\nashley southall\n\nThe case starts on July 17, 2014 on a hot summer day in Staten Island. The police say that a man by the name of Eric Garner has died during an attempt to arrest him. Theres no mention of any kind of use of force, no mention of a chokehold. And then the next morning, the police and the public wake up to this video.\n\narchived recording (eric garner) Every time you see me, you want to mess with me. Im tired of it. This stops today. archived recording This guy right here is forcibly trying to lock somebody up for breaking up a fight.\n\nashley southall\n\nIt shows two officers, Justin Damico and Daniel Pantaleo, approach Eric Garner on a street in Tompkinsville. And they accuse him of selling cigarettes. And he says, no, man, Im not selling anything. Im just minding my business. Leave me alone.\n\narchived recording (eric garner) Everybody standing here. Theyll tell you I didnt do nothing. I did not sell nothing.\n\nashley southall\n\nThis goes on for about 10 minutes.\n\narchived recording (eric garner) You want to harass me? You want to stop me?\n\nashley southall\n\nOfficer Damico moves in to try to handcuff Eric Garner, and he flails his hands away. Then you have Officer Pantaleo attempt a takedown. They fall back into plate glass.\n\narchived recording Hold on, hold on.\n\nashley southall\n\nMr. Garners 400 pounds. Officer Pantaleo is probably another 190, 200. The glass is going to buckle. So then they fall forward onto the sidewalk, and thats where they get Mr. Garner prone and handcuff him. And other officers have arrived at the scene by then. There are about seven seconds when you see Officer Pantaleos arm around Eric Garners neck. At some point, he releases, and Mr. Garner is saying \n\narchived recording (eric garner) I cant breathe. I cant breathe.\n\nashley southall\n\nI cant breathe, I cant breathe, I cant breathe. He ultimately says it 11 times.\n\narchived recording Once again, police beating up on people.\n\nashley southall\n\nE.M.S. eventually arrives. They dont have any oxygen.\n\narchived recording (speaker 1) Look, now, man, they gave this man a seizure. archived recording (speaker 2) No, move out the way. No. archived recording (speaker 3) Its my brother. We live here.\n\nashley southall\n\nAnd he was later pronounced dead at the hospital.\n\nmichael barbaro\n\nWhat happens in the aftermath of this video being released?\n\nashley southall\n\nSo pretty much right away, there are calls for Officer Pantaleo to be fired and for him and other officers to be criminally charged, both for Eric Garners death, but also for the omissions of the use of force from official reports.\n\nmichael barbaro\n\nBecause until this video is released, the officers involved in the encounter, they havent mentioned any of the tactics that theyve used.\n\nashley southall\n\nCorrect. And then three things happen simultaneously. The police Internal Affairs Bureau begins looking into the incident to see if any protocols were violated. At the same time, the Staten Island district attorney is looking at whether a crime was committed and then begins to present evidence to a grand jury. And at the same time, the feds are also looking in on these investigations, trying to see what evidence there is. But at that moment, theyre not yet investigating, because theres a local process that has to play out.\n\nmichael barbaro\n\nAnd when you say the feds, you mean the Department of Justice.\n\nashley southall\n\nThe Department of Justice.\n\nmichael barbaro\n\nSo my sense is that this is all moving as would be expected in a case like this. But whats different is that a month after this happens, Michael Brown is shot in Ferguson and the issue of how police treat unarmed black Americans becomes a major national issue.\n\nashley southall\n\nCorrect. But its an issue thats been bubbling up for some time. If you will reverse back to 2012, when Ramarley Graham was shot and killed by a New York City police officer, he was unarmed.\n\narchived recording Officer Richard Haste was indicted for manslaughter, but a judge reluctantly threw out the indictment in May on procedural grounds.\n\nashley southall\n\nThen, a few weeks later, you have Trayvon Martin, who was killed by a vigilante in Florida.\n\narchived recording We have just learned that the jury has determined that Zimmerman is not guilty of any crime.\n\nashley southall\n\nAnd then you have Eric Garner in July 2014, followed by Michael Brown that August.\n\narchived recording The conclusion? That police officer Darren Wilson was not guilty of a crime when he shot Michael Brown to death on August 9.\n\nashley southall\n\nAnd then you have Akai Gurley and Tamir Rice within days of each other.\n\narchived recording A grand jury decided not to indict Timothy Loehmann, who shot and killed 12-year-old Tamir Rice.\n\nashley southall\n\nSo people are seeing this pattern of unarmed black men and boys, and even some women, being killed by the police and no one being held responsible or accountable for their deaths. And that is the backdrop for the decision by the grand jury in Staten Island in December 2014 that there isnt enough evidence to prove that Officer Pantaleo committed a crime.\n\nmichael barbaro\n\nSo like the D.O.J. this week, the investigation by the Staten Island district attorney all the way back in 2014 finds that theres not sufficient evidence.\n\nashley southall\n\nYes. And to the public, thats infuriating. Because keep in mind that in the months between Eric Garners death in July and the grand jurys decision in December, the public has learned that the medical examiner, who is a pathologist, deemed this a homicide. And they also learned that, for at least 20 years, chokeholds have been explicitly banned by the police department. And what people saw on that video was an officer using a banned chokehold and Mr. Garner dying.\n\narchived recording (CHANTING) I cant breathe. I cant breathe. I cant breathe. I cant breathe. I cant breathe.\n\nmichael barbaro\n\nWell be right back. And what do we know about how this grand jury decided not to press charges in what seemed to so many, from the video, like a clear-cut case?\n\nashley southall\n\nOne thing that the grand jury also heard that the public did not was testimony from Officer Pantaleo about what he intended to do. And he got up there in front of them and said that it was not his intent to use a chokehold. It was not his intent to harm Mr. Garner or to kill him. It was his intent to bring him down and affect an arrest as he had been ordered to do\n\nmichael barbaro\n\nAnd that testimony, it sounds like, becomes important, the question of intent.\n\nashley southall\n\nYes, because the standard of proof in a criminal case is that the prosecutor needs to prove beyond a reasonable doubt that the officer willfully acted in violation of the law, that it was an officers intent and his will to violate the law. And for that grand jury, the decision not to press charges indicates that the evidence didnt meet that standard.\n\nmichael barbaro\n\nAnd what about the fact that the use of a chokehold had been banned by police, regardless of intent? Didnt he use an illegal practice? And wasnt that weighed by the grand jury?\n\nashley southall\n\nWhat Officer Pantaleo told the Internal Affairs Bureau, and later the grand jury, was that he wasnt intending to use a chokehold. He said he was trying to use a seat-belt technique, which is a tactic approved by the N.Y.P.D. and taught at the Police Academy.\n\nmichael barbaro\n\nIts another kind of restraint?\n\nashley southall\n\nYes. And what his lawyers have also pointed out is that, whether it was a seat belt or a chokehold, once theyre on the ground and Mr. Garner begins to grunt and say, I cant breathe, he releases him.\n\nmichael barbaro\n\nSo after the district attorney decides not to press charges, what happens to the case of Eric Garner?\n\nashley southall\n\nSo youll remember that this whole time, the Department of Justice has been watching the investigation play out. And once the local investigation is done, its now in their territory.\n\narchived recording (eric holder) Good evening. I want to provide an update regarding the case involving Eric Garner.\n\nmichael barbaro\n\nAnd when the Department of Justice steps in, Ashley, what are they looking at? Is it a new question or are they basically investigating the same things as the city?\n\nashley southall\n\nSo what the grand jury in Staten Island was looking at was whether Officer Pantaleo committed a crime.\n\narchived recording (eric holder) Now that the local investigation has concluded, Im here to announce that the Justice Department will proceed with a federal civil rights investigation into Mr. Garners death.\n\nashley southall\n\nHere, the federal government is looking at whether his crime was violating Eric Garners civil rights.\n\narchived recording (eric holder) This afternoon, I spoke with the widow of Eric Garner to inform her and her family of our decision to investigate potential federal civil rights violations.\n\nashley southall\n\nAnd in this case, there were two key things that they wanted to establish, or that theyd felt they needed to establish. One, that the force Officer Pantaleo used to subdue Mr. Garner was objectively unreasonable, that a police officer acting in those circumstances could have recognized what he did as just too much. And then the second thing that they wanted to establish was that his conduct was a willful violation of the law, that he knew the law and that he acted in a way that disregarded it.\n\nmichael barbaro\n\nAnd by those measures, did the Department of Justice feel that it had a strong case to bring against this officer?\n\nashley southall\n\nSo this is the question that they were asking themselves over the more than four years that they were investigating this incident. And there was a lot of disagreement between mostly civil rights prosecutors in Washington, who thought that they should bring charges and thought that there was enough evidence there, and then the prosecutors in Brooklyn, who were going to be the ones who had to prosecute the case, who thought that it was not winnable.\n\nmichael barbaro\n\nAnd whats your understanding of why those two sides disagreed? What was Washington thinking? And what was New York thinking?\n\nashley southall\n\nFrom what we know, it really came down to the willfulness. On the video, some prosecutors thought that the fact that Officer Pantaleo kept his arm around Eric Garners neck even after they were on the ground showed that he willfully disregarded the law. In Brooklyn, they were not so sure. And part of that, you can imagine, is from Officer Pantaleos testimony that his intent was not to hurt him. His intent was to arrest him. So all the while that prosecutors are conducting their investigation and dealing with these questions about whether they have a case and whether they can win it, the White House changes hands from President Obama to President Trump. We go through a series of attorneys general  Eric Holder, Loretta Lynch, Jeff Sessions, who are all overseeing this case from Washington. And then you end up with Bill Barr, our current attorney general.\n\nmichael barbaro\n\nAnd the decision ultimately \n\nashley southall\n\nWho ultimately makes the decision himself.\n\narchived recording (richard donoghue) In order for a federal criminal civil rights charge to be brought, the government must prove beyond a reasonable doubt that an officer willfully used more force than he reasonably could have believed was necessary under the circumstances. And the law recognizes that police are often forced to make split-second judgments in circumstances that are tense, uncertain and rapidly evolving.\n\nashley southall\n\nSo one of the main questions of this case is whether or not Officer Pantaleo actually used a chokehold.\n\narchived recording (richard donoghue) As Mr. Garner and Officer Pantaleo struggled, Officer Pantaleo held onto Mr. Garner and both men fell backward. In the process, Officer Pantaleos body slammed against a store window, causing the window to buckle.\n\nashley southall\n\nAnd in this explanation, Mr. Donoghue said, yes, he did.\n\narchived recording (richard donoghue) It appears that in response to that collision and to maintain a hold on Mr. Garner, Officer Pantaleo wrapped his left arm around Mr. Garners neck, resulting in what was, in effect, a chokehold.\n\nashley southall\n\nBut heres how prosecutors dealt with that question.\n\narchived recording (richard donoghue) Like many of you, I have watched that video many times. And each time Ive watched it, Im left with the same reaction.\n\nashley southall\n\nThere is an emotional side that looks at that tape and says \n\narchived recording (richard donoghue) That the death of Eric Garner was a tragedy.\n\nashley southall\n\nThats a tragedy.\n\narchived recording (richard donoghue) The job of a federal prosecutor, however \n\nashley southall\n\nBut then \n\narchived recording (richard donoghue)  is not to let our emotions dictate our decisions. Our job is to review the evidence gathered during the investigation, like the video, to assess whether we can prove that a federal crime was committed. At the end of the day, however, the video and the other evidence gathered in the investigation does not establish beyond a reasonable doubt that Officer Pantaleo acted willfully in violation of federal law.\n\nashley southall\n\nWhat you see on video is very clearly an escalation by the officers to make this arrest for this very minor offense. And it ends with Mr. Garner dying. And so the net effect is that Mr. Garners punishment for allegedly selling cigarettes that day is death. That, in many peoples eyes, is too much. But in the eyes of the law, the prosecutors here, based not just on the video, but on the testimony of witnesses and the testimony of the officers, thought there just wasnt enough.\n\nmichael barbaro\n\nSo Ashley, its been five years to the day that Eric Garner died during this interaction with the N.Y.P.D. And it now seems like prosecutors seem to have closed the book on this case. What, if anything, happens now? Is this case over?\n\nashley southall\n\nThroughout these five years, Officer Pantaleo has been in a desk job without his gun or his badge. He hasnt been out on patrol. And \n\nmichael barbaro\n\nHe remains on the force.\n\nashley southall\n\nYes. Theres this process underway in the N.Y.P.D. that will ultimately end with the police commissioner, James ONeill, deciding whether or not he gets to stay on the force as a police officer or if he has to leave. And he could allow him to resign. He could fire him. Or he could just dock him some vacation days. That decision could take weeks, it could take months, or it could happen tomorrow. We dont know. But its not over for him.\n\nmichael barbaro\n\nSo what happens to him may end up being the accountability. Its not going to happen in a courtroom, it seems. Its not going to happen at the federal court level or the district attorney level, but it might happen inside the N.Y.P.D.\n\nashley southall\n\nThe Garner family has demanded for the last five years that Officer Pantaleo be fired. They have also asked for the other officers who were involved in his death and those who filed official reports that didnt mention the chokehold, that didnt mention any uses of force, should also be fired and held accountable.\n\narchived recording (emerald snipes) Im going to stand outside and Im going to scream it. Pantaleo needs to be fired! He needs to be fired! Dont apologize to me. Fire the officer. Dont give me your condolences. I heard that five years ago. We want justice, and we want it today.\n\nashley southall\n\nIf thats what the family wants, they have quite the mountain to climb. Officer Pantaleo is still on the force. Half of the officers names the family doesnt know, because the city has withheld them. But the message from the family of Eric Garner today was loud and clear.\n\narchived recording (gwen carr) This is what we have to live every day. And you know what? Were not going to take this sitting down. archived recording Thats right. archived recording (gwen carr) This is not going down like this, because if it was one of their loved ones, it would have never went this far. So my sons death is not going in vain. Were going to fight this to the last straw if Im the only one out on the street. And Ive got all of these supporters behind me.\n\n[music]\n\nmichael barbaro\n\nAshley, thank you very much.\n\nashley southall\n\nThanks for having me on.\n\nmichael barbaro\n\nWell be right back. Heres what else you need to know today.\n\narchived recording But youve stopped short of calling these comments racist. archived recording (mitch mcconnell) Well, the presidents not a racist. The presidents not a racist.\n\nmichael barbaro\n\nOn Tuesday, top Republicans in Congress rallied to the defense of President Trump, denying that his tweet calling on four Democratic congresswomen to return to the countries from which they came were bigoted and racist.\n\narchived recording Mr. Leader, were the presidents tweets that said go back racist? Yes or no? archived recording (kevin mccarthy) No. And I do not \n\nmichael barbaro\n\nOn Twitter, the president himself confronted the allegation, writing that, quote, I dont have a racist bone in my body.\n\narchived recording (nancy pelosi) Every single member of this institution, Democratic and Republican, should join us in condemning the presidents racist tweets.\n\nmichael barbaro\n\nHours later, on the House floor, speaker Nancy Pelosi introduced a resolution condemning Trumps attacks on Representatives Ayanna Pressley, Rashida Tlaib, Ilhan Omar and Alexandria Ocasio-Cortez.\n\narchived recording (nancy pelosi) To do anything less would be a shocking rejection of our values and a shameful abdication of our oath of office to protect the American people.

And on April 2, my colleague Kim Severson, a food writer for The Times here in Atlanta, and a dear friend of mine, sent me a very brief note. And it said, Look, you are busy. But this ones looking pretty troubling. She included a link to a story in The Brunswick News down in Brunswick, Georgia. And it looked to be a story of two armed white men, who were chasing an unarmed black man by the name of a Ahmaud Arbery through their neighborhood, and that that chase ended with a confrontation and with the black man being killed. The local coverage also showed that one of the men who was involved in this chase was a former police officer on the county police force, who had also spent years as an investigator in the district attorneys office. And although the shooting had occurred on February 23, here we are in April, and no one had been arrested for it. It was very disturbing. And it seemed like there were a lot of unanswered questions. And I really didnt know if I could answer them. But I had to set it aside for a while, just because we had this avalanche of news rolling in. So 10 or 11 days after getting this initial email from Kim, I started filing a flurry of open records requests. And I had a sense of what I was pretty sure I could get from this from covering previous controversial shootings in Georgia. I knew that I should be able to get a copy of the incident report, which is this brief summary that police file of what they saw when they arrived at the scene. I was pretty sure I could get the 911 call recordings, which I dont think anybody had asked for yet. And then there was this other really just last-minute request that I filed. And I filed it with the county. And it was really just kind of a fishing expedition that I filed that turned out to be the most important public records request. And in that request, I asked for all of the emails to and from public officials from the day of the shooting up to mid-April.\n\nmichael barbaro\n\nSo essentially, you were trying to figure out if people in power in this community in the hours after this shooting are doing what you might expect them to do, which is saying oh, my god. Did you hear about this? What do we do? What do you think? That kind of thing.\n\nrichard fausset\n\nYeah. I thought maybe there would just be some chatter. They might have just been gossiping. You know, there just might have been a kind of, oh, my god kinds of emails. I didnt quite know what to expect. But I think that was my first thought. So under Georgia law, all of those entities have three days to respond to my request. And of course, in an ongoing homicide investigation, there are a lot of things they can say that theyre not going to give me. So I talked to my editor, and we decided that I would wake up super early, drive down to Glynn County, Georgia  which is about four and a half or five hours from my home base in Atlanta  to a neighborhood called Satilla Shores, and do some social-distancing reporting. Satilla Shores is a middle-class neighborhood  you know, ranch houses and a few nicer homes that look like retirement homes. Its kind of out of the way. Theres moss hanging from the oaks. I mean, its dramatically beautiful. And it kind of evokes Faulkner  I mean, Faulkner with ranch houses. And Satilla Shores is in the unincorporated part of Glynn County. Glynn County is a majority white place. Its about 27 percent black. And like almost every part of the south, it has a very tragic and awful racial history, a history of lynchings of black men in the late 19th century. So I pulled up and parked my car near the McMichaels home. This is the home of the two men who chased Ahmaud. And almost as soon as I parked, a woman came out. And she started asking me what I was doing there. And I told her. She told me shed called the police on me. And she told me she was armed.\n\nmichael barbaro\n\nWow.\n\nrichard fausset\n\nYou know, I think there was just a lot of tension in the neighborhood. And people were suspicious of my presence there. One very angry woman drove up to me as I was just walking the street and asked me repeatedly what I was doing there in a pretty hostile way. I came across another couple, and they had already made up their mind that Ahmaud Arbery deserved what he had gotten.\n\nmichael barbaro\n\nWow.\n\nrichard fausset\n\nSo on Thursday night, I drove back to Atlanta. And on Friday morning, I received the response to this last public records request that I had filed. And Michael, as you know, a lot of times, those kinds of public records requests just bring back just a bunch of dross, you know, just garbage.\n\nmichael barbaro\n\nYeah.\n\nrichard fausset\n\nBut in this case, when I opened this fat email attachment, I knew immediately that I had found something pretty explosive.\n\nmichael barbaro\n\nWhat was that?\n\nrichard fausset\n\nSo the first document in this file was a three-page memo written by a district attorney in Waycross, Georgia named George Barnhill, who at the time was the prosecutor in the case. And the prosecutor in a case like this often advises the local police as to whether or not theres sufficient probable cause to go to a judge and ask for an arrest warrant. Mr. Barnhill, in this letter, laid out an extensive justification  legal justification  for why he believed there was not sufficient probable cause to issue any arrest warrants for anyone. And his argument was that Mr. Arbery had committed a burglary, and that the men who pursued him were justified in pursuing him under Georgias Citizen Arrest law. It said that the man who shot Ahmaud Arbery, Travis McMichael, was justified in doing so because Mr. Arbery had grabbed the shotgun. He had initiated the fight. And Travis McMichael was allowed to use deadly force to protect himself under Georgias Use-of-Force statute. And it said, of course, that the men were legally armed under Georgias open-carry law. But there were a lot of pieces of this that I knew a lot of lawyers and even other prosecutors were very likely going to take issue with.\n\nmichael barbaro\n\nSo in this prosecutors telling, everything that these two men did in this interaction that resulted in Arberys death, despite the fact that he was unarmed, was completely legal. They were allowed to carry the guns. They were allowed to make a citizens arrest. They were allowed, in his telling, to defend themselves from this unarmed man.\n\nrichard fausset\n\nIn Mr. Barnhills words, it was his conclusion there was insufficient probable cause to issue arrest warrants at the time.\n\nmichael barbaro\n\nAnd in your mind, what makes this so explosive?\n\nrichard fausset\n\nI mean, whats explosive here is that you have this well-detailed legal justification for an action that I knew many people would see as one that just violates their basic sense of whats right. You had two armed white men in a truck chasing after an unarmed black man in a suburb in the deep south. Theres a confrontation. The black man is shot and killed. And no one has been arrested. And theres an argument now, a legal argument, that no one should be arrested.\n\nmichael barbaro\n\nSo what happens next?\n\nrichard fausset\n\nSo I reported my story about this case. And I included this information about this district attorney, who gave this legal justification for why no one should be arrested. It also included the fact that, by that point, that district attorney had recused himself for a conflict of interest. It turns out that his son worked in the local district attorneys office with Greg McMichael, one of the men who had pursued Ahmaud Arbery. And the reaction to this story was pretty strong. But we were also in the midst of a pandemic. And we were social distancing. And the country was locked down. And so the kinds of protests that weve seen crop up in big cities and in other places when issues like this come to light were not materializing.\n\nmichael barbaro\n\nRight.\n\nrichard fausset\n\nAnd so it was sort of unclear, really, where this whole drama was headed. But then on Tuesday, a video emerged online. It was a 36-second video. And it showed the last violent moments of Ahmaud Arberys life. And that started to change everything.\n\n[music]\n\nmichael barbaro\n\nWell be right back. Richard, what exactly does this video show?\n\nrichard fausset\n\nThe video appears to be shot from a moving car. And it shows a man running, presumably Ahmaud Arbery. Hes approaching a white pickup truck. Theres a man in the bed of the truck  Greg McMichael. And theres a man standing outside the truck with a shotgun  his son Travis. Mr. Arbery jogs to the right, presumably in an effort to just get away from Travis McMichael. But they tangle, and its violent. And you can see the shotgun between them. Theres a shotgun blast and more fighting. They go offscreen for a moment. Theres a second shotgun blast and more fighting. And then theres a third shot. And you can see Mr. Arbery turn as if to run further. But then you see him crumple and fall to the pavement.\n\nmichael barbaro\n\nRichard, what do we know about where this video came from and who shot it?\n\nrichard fausset\n\nThe video was shot by a third man who was also engaged in the pursuit of Ahmaud Arbery.\n\nmichael barbaro\n\nSo another man in the neighborhood, who was essentially chasing him?\n\nrichard fausset\n\nRight.\n\nmichael barbaro\n\nAnd how does this video and all those details you just described change our understanding of this event?\n\nrichard fausset\n\nWell, it appears theres some contradiction in the initial story that Greg McMichael laid out in the initial police report. In it, Mr. McMichael said that he and his son pulled up beside Ahmaud Arbery. And they shouted stop, and theyd been shouting it before. And it was at that moment that Travis McMichael gets out of the truck with his shotgun. But the video shows that they were actually waiting for him in the truck. He was being blocked in because you had a third man, the man with the cell phone video, who was chasing him.\n\nmichael barbaro\n\nSo it very much shows him being trapped by these pursuers.\n\nrichard fausset\n\nYeah, it looks like hes trapped.\n\narchived recording The shooting took place back in February. And at the time, it remained a largely local story. But all that changed yesterday. Some video of the shooting went viral on the internet.\n\nrichard fausset\n\nI mean, its one thing to read about a man struggling for his life and being shot and killed. And I think, just emotionally, its just a totally different story when you see it.\n\narchived recording (stacey abrams) I believe that there should be immediate investigation of charges. It looks like murder.\n\nrichard fausset\n\nStacey Abrams, the former gubernatorial Democratic candidate in Georgia, spoke out about it in an interview. LeBron James, the basketball star, tweeted about it.\n\narchived recording Were literally hunted every day, every time we step foot outside the comfort of our homes, he said.\n\nrichard fausset\n\nJoe Biden spoke about it in an interview.\n\narchived recording (joe biden) Well, it sure looks like murder to me. At a minimum, it needs a thorough investigation. archived recording (brian kemp) Earlier this week, I watched a video depicting Mr. Arberys last moments alive.\n\nrichard fausset\n\nGeorgia Governor Brian Kemp, a Republican who has created a lot of ill will among people of color, particularly in Georgia, for a very divisive campaign, talked about the need for Georgians to find justice in this case.\n\narchived recording (brian kemp) I can tell you its absolutely horrific. And Georgians deserve answers.\n\nmichael barbaro\n\nSo just looking at this video, it seems pretty uncomplicated whats going on here.\n\nrichard fausset\n\nIts not entirely uncomplicated. Theres another video thats emerged. And this one appears to be a surveillance video from a house on the block. And it shows a man who appears to be Mr. Arbery going inside of a house thats under construction near the McMichaels house. Its sort of unclear what hes doing there. And his familys lawyer has said that, yes, he stopped by a house, by a property that was under construction while he was jogging. But still, the idea of an unarmed man out for a jog being chased down and killed by armed civilians, no matter what he was doing in the midst of the jog, is really whats resonated so widely. And in fact, its become very much a rallying cry.\n\narchived recording Im running for Ahmaud today. Hes the young man that was gunned down in Georgia while jogging.\n\nrichard fausset\n\nPeople were going out and jogging in solidarity with Ahmaud. They were using the hashtag, I run with Ahmaud.\n\narchived recording 1 This mornings run, 2.23 miles. I run with Ahmaud, baby. archived recording 2 I run with Ahmaud. archived recording 3 2.23  we with you, young king. archived recording 4 2.23 for Ahmaud. Lets go. I havent run in 10 years, but Im doing it.\n\nrichard fausset\n\nTheyre running 2.23 miles as a way of noting the day that he was killed: February 23.\n\narchived recording (protestors) No justice, no peace. No justice! No peace!\n\nrichard fausset\n\nAnd then late last week \n\narchived recording (protestors) No justice! No peace!\n\nrichard fausset\n\n hundreds of protesters gathered in the streets of Glynn County, Georgia in masks and gloves.\n\narchived recording This is about corruption and cover-up by the Glynn County Police Department.\n\nrichard fausset\n\nIt felt like the ball was rolling downhill and gathering force every moment.\n\narchived recording (protestors) This is not a murder. This was an assassination.\n\nmichael barbaro\n\nAt this point, Richard, how are people thinking about this case? And how is that differing from the way that it was first described in that memo that you unearthed with your public records request?\n\nrichard fausset\n\nSo I think what you saw from this mass protest was a fundamental disagreement with the legal analysis in this document that I dug up. People were calling this a lynching. They were evoking the context of the southern past and the American present. They just thought it was wrong.\n\nmichael barbaro\n\nAnd at this point, as these protests are mounting, what is the status of the legal case?\n\nrichard fausset\n\nWell, a lot starts happening. In my original reporting on this case, I noted that the D.A., George Barnhill, had recused himself. And there was a new prosecutor. As just the interest in this case exploded last week, he announced that he thought that the case should be presented to a grand jury in Glynn County for consideration of criminal charges being brought against the men involved in Mr. Arberys death.\n\nmichael barbaro\n\nSo thats a very big change from the last prosecutor on the case.\n\nrichard fausset\n\nRight. This is a total 180. He also invited the Georgia Bureau of Investigation to get involved. And the bureau launched its own independent investigation. And by Thursday night, Greg McMichael and his son had been arrested and charged with murder.\n\n[music]\n\nmichael barbaro\n\nWhats fascinating about that is that the video seems to describe what had been laid out in your reporting and in these legal documents beforehand. Right? Theres not a giant gap between them.\n\nrichard fausset\n\nYeah. I think what this video did is it really moved this case from the local stage to a global stage. And although we cant know, for now at least, what the reasoning of this new district attorney was for saying the case needs to go before a grand jury, for indeed arresting these men, theres no question that hes now making decisions in a universe where many more people are paying very close attention.\n\nmichael barbaro\n\nRight. It was no longer a local prosecutor writing a memo explaining why no one should be prosecuted, knowing that no one was paying all that much attention.\n\nrichard fausset\n\nRight. For me, it was just a very surreal moment because Im thinking back to that moment, which is a very private one. Im in my house. The country is locked down. This email comes. And it has this very controversial legal opinion from a very obscure prosecutor.\n\nmichael barbaro\n\nRight.\n\nrichard fausset\n\nAnd I felt like one person in on a conversation in a very closed and constrained system. And now, it seems like this whole story has just been blown out into the open.\n\nmichael barbaro\n\nSo Richard, where does this case stand right now?\n\nrichard fausset\n\nSo the McMichaels are currently in a jail in Glynn County. They havent had a chance to enter a plea of guilty or not guilty. But the pandemic is still playing a role here. The Georgia court system has declared that a grand jury cant be impaneled due to the coronavirus until after June 12, and that that stay could be extended at the discretion of the chief justice of the State Supreme Court if the pandemic continues to linger.\n\nmichael barbaro\n\nWhat has been the response from Ahmaud Arberys family?\n\nrichard fausset\n\nAhmauds mother, Wanda Cooper, has maintained from the beginning that she believes her son, who was known to stay in good shape, was simply out for a jog. And I think there is some sense of relief that arrests have finally been made in this case after so many weeks of waiting. But I think they know that theyre only at the beginning of a new stage in this case and it could take a very long time to see it to its end.\n\n[music]\n\nmichael barbaro\n\nRichard, what do you make of this case that you have now been working on for about a month or more?\n\nrichard fausset\n\nWell, its hard not to talk about this case without talking about the historical context of extrajudicial killings of people of color in the south and in the whole country. And I think a lot of people were shocked and dismayed by the details of this case. But they werent necessarily shocked that it happened. And I think one of the things that were starting to sketch out here are the systems in place, things like Georgias citizens arrest law, that might allow for the perpetuation of these kinds of problems. And I think even though were all looking closely at these systems, no ones sure whether this story, as tragic as it is, may in the end serve to change them.\n\nmichael barbaro\n\nRichard, thank you very much.\n\nrichard fausset\n\nThanks, Michael.\n\nmichael barbaro\n\nOn Friday, a lawyer representing Ahmaud Arberys family called for a civil rights investigation, focused not only on the men who pursued and shot him, but the broader justice system that took weeks to prosecute them. On Sunday night, Georgias attorney general asked the federal government to conduct a similar investigation.\n\n[music]\n\nWell be right back. Heres what else you need to know today.\n\narchived recording (mike pence) The president and I not only will be tested every day, but I think everyone that comes into contact with the president will be tested every day. And so \n\nmichael barbaro\n\nThe Trump Administration is trying to contain an outbreak of the coronavirus inside the White House after an aide to Vice President Mike Pence and a valet to President Trump tested positive. That has prompted at least three top officials leading the governments response to the pandemic, including Dr. Anthony Fauci, to begin two weeks of self-quarantine.\n\narchived recording Do you wear a mask? Are you going to continue to show up for work at the White House? archived recording (kevin hassett) You know, Ive got a mask right here. And the fact is that I practice aggressive social distancing. Ill wear a mask when I feel its necessary.\n\nmichael barbaro\n\nIn an interview with CBSs Face the Nation on Sunday, Kevin Hassett, a top economic advisor to the president, acknowledged that a sense of fear has crept into the White House.\n\narchived recording (kevin hassett) It is scary to go to work. I think that Id be a lot safer if I was sitting at home than I would be going to the West Wing. But its a time when people have to step up and serve their country.\n\nmichael barbaro\n\nAs of Sunday night, the death toll in the U.S. reached nearly 80,000. And infections around the world surpassed four million.\n\n[music]'	b'What We Know About the Shooting Death of Ahmaud Arbery'		['Richard Fausset']	['think', 'video', 'shooting', 'ahmaud', 'death', 'theres', 'man', 'arbery', 'case', 'recording', 'men', 'mcmichael', 'know']	b'michael barbaroToday, the death of 25-year-old Ahmaud Arbery and my colleague Richard Faussets investigation into it.\nI came across another couple, and they had already made up their mind that Ahmaud Arbery deserved what he had gotten.\nIt said that the man who shot Ahmaud Arbery, Travis McMichael, was justified in doing so because Mr. Arbery had grabbed the shotgun.\nIt turns out that his son worked in the local district attorneys office with Greg McMichael, one of the men who had pursued Ahmaud Arbery.\nrichard faussetThe video was shot by a third man who was also engaged in the pursuit of Ahmaud Arbery.'

Jermaine Darden, 34, who was obese and had asthma, was handled roughly and stunned with a Taser. When medics arrived, he was unresponsive. The medical examiner ruled he died of cardiac-related natural causes.\n\nCORNELIA, Ga.  This town on the edge of the Appalachians has fewer than 5,000 residents, but the SWAT team was outfitted for war.\n\nAt 2:15 a.m. on a moonless night in May 2014, 10 officers rolled up a driveway in an armored Humvee, three of them poised to leap off the running boards. They carried Colt submachine guns, light-mounted AR-15 rifles and Glock .40-caliber sidearms. Many wore green body armor and Kevlar helmets. They had a door-breaching shotgun, a battering ram, sledgehammers, Halligan bars for smashing windows, a ballistic shield and a potent flash-bang grenade.\n\nThe target was a single-story ranch-style house about 50 yards off Lakeview Heights Circle. Not even four hours earlier, three informants had bought $50 worth of methamphetamine in the front yard. That was enough to persuade the countys chief magistrate to approve a no-knock search warrant authorizing the SWAT operators to storm the house without warning.\n\nThe point man on the entry team found the side door locked, and nodded to Deputy Jason Stribling, who took two swings with the metal battering ram. As the door splintered near the deadbolt, he yelled, Sheriffs department, search warrant! Another deputy, Charles Long, had already pulled the pin on the flash-bang. He placed his left hand on Deputy Striblings back for stability, peered quickly into the dark and tossed the armed explosive about three feet inside the door.\n\nIt landed in a portable playpen.\n\nAs policing has militarized to fight a faltering war on drugs, few tactics have proved as dangerous as the use of forcible-entry raids to serve narcotics search warrants, which regularly introduce staggering levels of violence into missions that might be accomplished through patient stakeouts or simple knocks at the door.\n\nThousands of times a year, these dynamic entry raids exploit the element of surprise to effect seizures and arrests of neighborhood drug dealers. But they have also led time and again to avoidable deaths, gruesome injuries, demolished property, enduring trauma, blackened reputations and multimillion-dollar legal settlements at taxpayer expense, an investigation by The New York Times found.\n\nFor the most part, governments at all levels have chosen not to quantify the toll by requiring reporting on SWAT operations. But The Timess investigation, which relied on dozens of open-record requests and thousands of pages from police and court files, found that at least 81 civilians and 13 law enforcement officers died in such raids from 2010 through 2016. Scores of others were maimed or wounded.\n\nThe casualties have occurred in the execution of no-knock warrants, which give the police prior judicial authority to force entry without notice, as well as warrants that require the police to knock and announce themselves before breaking down doors. Often, there is little difference.\n\nShow of Force\n\nInnocents have died in attacks on wrong addresses, including a 7-year-old girl in Detroit, and collaterally as the police pursued other residents, among them a 68-year-old grandfather in Framingham, Mass. Stray bullets have whizzed through neighboring homes, and in dozens of instances the victims of police gunfire have included the family dog.\n\nSearch warrant raids account for a small share of the nearly 1,000 fatalities each year in officer-involved shootings. But what distinguishes them from other risky interactions between the police and citizens, like domestic disputes, hostage-takings and confrontations with mentally ill people, is that they are initiated by law enforcement.\n\nIn a country where four in 10 adults have guns in their homes, the raids incite predictable collisions between forces that hurtle toward each other like speeding cars in a passing lane  officers with a license to invade private homes and residents convinced of their right to self-defense.\n\nAfter being awakened by the shattering of doors and the detonation of stun grenades, bleary suspects reach for nearby weapons  at times realizing it is the police, at others mistaking them for intruders  and the shooting begins. In some cases, victims like Todd Blair, a Utah man who grabbed a golf club on the way out of his bedroom, have been slain by officers who perceived a greater threat than existed.\n\nTo be sure, police officers and judges must find probable cause of criminal activity to justify a search warrant. Absent resources for endless stakeouts, police tacticians argue that dynamic entry provides the safest means to clear out heavily fortified drug houses and to catch suspects with the contraband needed for felony prosecutions.\n\nBut critics of the forcible-entry raids question whether the benefits outweigh the risks. The drug crimes used to justify so many raids, they point out, are not capital offenses. And even if they were, that would not rationalize the killing or wounding of suspects without due process. Nor would it forgive the propensity of the police to err in the planning or execution of raids that are inherently chaotic and place bystanders in harms way.\n\nForcible-entry methods have become common practice over the last quarter century through a confluence of the war on drugs, the rise of special weapons and tactics squads, and Supreme Court rulings that have eroded Fourth Amendment protections against unreasonable searches. Support for their continued use has been bolstered by an epidemic of opioid abuse and the threat of domestic terrorism.\n\nBecause many raids occur in low-income neighborhoods, shooting deaths like one in November of a 22-year-old black man in Salisbury, N.C., have exacerbated racial tensions already raw from a spate of high-profile police killings. The American Civil Liberties Union concluded in a recent study of 20 cities that 42 percent of those subjected to SWAT search warrant raids were black and 12 percent Hispanic. Of the 81 civilian deaths tallied by The Times, half were members of minority groups.\n\nAbout the Data A full list of fatalities resulting from forcible-entry search warrant raids from 2010 to 2016, tallied by The Times, along with demographic details.\n\nThe no-knock process often begins with unreliable informants and cursory investigations that produce affidavits signed by unquestioning low-level judges. It is not uncommon for the searches to yield only misdemeanor-level stashes, or to come up empty.\n\nIn some instances when officers have been killed, suspects with no history of violence, found with small quantities of drugs, have wound up facing capital murder charges, and possible death sentences.\n\nIn December, a jury in Corpus Christi, Tex., acquitted a 48-year-old man who spent 664 days in jail after being charged with attempted capital murder for wounding three SWAT officers during a no-knock raid that targeted his nephew. The jury concluded that the man, Ray Rosas, did not know whom he was firing at through a blinded window.\n\nWhile the officers are typically seeking narcotics, there also have been deaths and serious injuries when warrants were served on people suspected of running illegal poker games, brewing moonshine and neglecting pets. In 2011, officers in Marine City, Mich., conducted a dynamic-entry raid to serve a search warrant for any and all evidence pertaining to graffiti including but not limited to, spray paint containers, markers, notebooks, and photographs. After forcing residents to the floor at gunpoint, they found nothing, according to depositions by the residents.\n\nThe Times found that from 2010 to 2015, an average of least 30 federal civil rights lawsuits were filed a year to protest residential search warrants executed with dynamic entries. Many of the complaints depict terrifying scenes in which children, elderly residents and people with disabilities are manhandled at gunpoint, unclothed adults are rousted from bed and houses are ransacked without recompense or apology. Louise Milan, 68, of Evansville, Ind., alleged in her filing that she and her 18-year-old daughter were handcuffed in front of neighbors during a door-busting 2012 raid prompted by threats against the police made by someone who had pirated her wireless connection.\n\nTheres a real misimpression by the public that aggressive police actions are only used against hardened criminals, said Cary J. Hansel, a Baltimore lawyer who has represented plaintiffs in such lawsuits. But there are dozens and dozens of cases where a no-knock warrant is used against somebody whos totally innocent.\n\nAt least seven of the federal lawsuits have been settled for more than $1 million in the last five years. They include a $3.75 million payment in 2016 to the family of Eurie Stamps, the unarmed Framingham grandfather who was accidentally shot while compliant and on his stomach; and $3.4 million in 2013 to the family of Jose Guerea, a 26-year-old former Marine shot more than 20 times as agents broke into his house in Tucson. No drugs were found.\n\nIn each of those cases, as in almost all botched raids, prosecutors declined to press charges against the officers involved.\n\nPlanned in Haste\n\nPerhaps no fiasco illustrates the perils of no-knock searches as graphically as the 2014 raid here in Georgias northeast corner. On May 22, an eager young Habersham County sheriffs deputy named Nikki Autry, who was attached to a narcotics task force, turned a small-time methamphetamine user into a confidential informant. Intent on avoiding jail, the informant, James Alton Fry Jr., set about the task of baiting bigger fish.\n\nAccording to trial testimony and investigative documents, the agents sent Mr. Fry out on the night of May 27 to make drug buys. He scored two Lortab pain pills on his first approach, struck out with a second source and then was connected to a meth dealer named Wanis Thonetheva. At around 10:30 p.m., Mr. Fry, his wife, Devon, and their housemate, Larry Wood  all persistent meth users  drove to the address provided by the dealer.\n\nIt didnt look like a drug house, Ms. Fry later testified. This was a nice house. Its usually a shack or trailer. The police did not follow them to provide protection or surveil the property.\n\nMr. Wood conducted his business out front with Mr. Thonetheva, a 30-year-old American-born son of Laotian immigrants, as the Frys waited in their red pickup. All three appeared shaken when they met up with their handlers in a church parking lot. They had spotted two men at the house whom they took to be guards for the drug operation, and a third who might have been a supplier.\n\nThe agents sent the informants home, but about half an hour later Deputy Autry texted Ms. Fry with an afterthought. Did yall see any signs of kids at wanis house, she asked.\n\nNothing except a mini van, came the response.\n\nThinking she was on to a big score, Deputy Autry, who was 28, did not wait for daylight or further investigation. She returned to the Sheriffs Office, where she pulled Mr. Thonethevas criminal history and mug shot. With the approval of the sheriff, Joey Terrell, she alerted the countys Special Response Team to prepare for a raid. She and her drug unit commander, Murray J. Kogod, began drafting the application for the no-knock warrant.\n\nThe affidavit included inaccuracies and hyperbole. It asserted incorrectly that Mr. Fry  the only informant formally certified by the police  had bought the drugs, rather than Mr. Wood. Deputy Autry described Mr. Fry as a true and reliable informant, even though he had not made a buy before that night. Despite the lack of surveillance, she wrote that she had confirmed that there is heavy traffic in and out of the residence.\n\nShortly after midnight, Deputy Autry and another agent awakened the county magistrate, James N. Butterworth, with a house call. He read the affidavit and placed her under oath.\n\nShe told him that Mr. Thonetheva had been arrested several times for drug possession, that there might be armed lookouts at the house and that an assault involving an AK-47 had been reported there the previous year. The judge, who had never denied Deputy Autry a warrant, found no reason to dispute probable cause and signed at 12:15 a.m.\n\nIf you had drugs and you had weapons, that was constitutional purpose to go on in there, not to knock on the door, he later testified.\n\nThe Special Response Team, formed three years earlier, consisted of a dozen men plucked from the Sheriffs Office and the Cornelia Police Department. They trained on their own time for four hours each Thursday. The Humvee had been procured through a Pentagon program that made surplus military equipment available to even the most rural departments.\n\nThere had been few chances to quell riots and subdue active shooters in the hamlets of Habersham County, population 43,000. Instead, the unit had been used primarily to serve narcotics search warrants, 32 times in all.\n\nDuring their pre-raid briefing, team members circulated a photograph of Mr. Thonetheva, a Google Earth image of the brick house with dark shutters and a sketch of the three-bedroom interior. Deputy Autry mistakenly told the teams commander that the drug deal had gone down near a side door to an enclosed garage, so he plotted his entry from there. She told him there were no signs of children or animals, failing to mention the minivan.\n\nWhen the flash-bang detonated with a concussive boom, a blinding white light filled the room. The entry team rumbled in, screaming for the occupants to get to the ground. Deputy Stribling peered into the playpen with a flashlight and found 19-month-old Bounkham Phonesavanh.\n\nDeputy Stribling waved off Deputy Long, who had lobbed the grenade. Charlie, go away, you dont need to see this, he said.\n\nThe child, known affectionately as Bou Bou, had a long laceration and burns across his chest, exposing his ribs, and another gash between his upper lip and nose. His round, cherubic face was bloodied and blistered, spackled with shrapnel and soot. The heat had singed away much of his pillow and dissolved the mesh side of the playpen.\n\nAt first the child was silent. But as Deputy Stribling picked him up, rubbed his feet and shook his arms, he began to wail. Even the drug agents stationed outside the other end of the house could hear the screams.\n\nYou dont think that baby got hurt, do you? one asked another.\n\nA Secret World\n\nSWAT was pioneered in Los Angeles and other big cities in the late 1960s and early 1970s in response to civil unrest and raging firefights. Today, almost every police agency with at least 100 officers, and about a third of all smaller ones, either has its own full-time unit or participates in a part-time or multijurisdictional team, according to the Bureau of Justice Statistics.\n\nOnce the teams were formed, their existence had to be justified. Drug searches became the answer. Dr. Peter B. Kraska, a criminologist at Eastern Kentucky University, estimates that SWAT deployments increased roughly fifteenfold between 1980 and 2000 as the war on drugs escalated.\n\nThere is no way to know the true number of forcible entries because there is no federal mandate that police agencies report on SWAT operations. Only two states have required it, and efforts by news and watchdog groups to compile national figures have been frustrated by police stonewalling.\n\nThis is kind of a secret world within a secret world, said Dr. Tom Nolan, a criminologist at Merrimack College and a SWAT veteran of the Boston Police Department. They dont open up.\n\nUtah is currently the only exception. In 2014, after a marijuana raid resulted in the death of one officer and the wounding of five (as well as of the suspect, who hanged himself in jail), the state enacted a law requiring annual disclosures about tactical raids.\n\nThe initial results show that many departments use dynamic entry almost by default. SWAT units in Utah did so in 61 percent of 1,016 deployments reported in 2014 and 2015. About 40 percent of the warrants they served were no-knocks, usually for drugs, mostly at night.\n\nMaryland had a similar reporting requirement from 2010 to 2014, inspired by a botched raid that resulted in the shooting of two dogs at the home of the mayor of Berwyn Heights. More than 90 percent of 8,249 SWAT deployments during those years were to serve search warrants, and more than two-thirds involved forcible entry. Firearms were discharged in 99 operations, civilians were killed in nine and injured in 95, officers were injured in at least 30 and animals were killed in 14.\n\nC. Anthony Muse, a state senator who sponsored the measure, said he found the numbers alarming. He also found it disturbing that the General Assembly allowed the reporting requirement to sunset, amid heavy lobbying from law-enforcement groups. They dont want to be held accountable, he said.\n\nAmong the cities examined in the recent ACLU study was Little Rock, Ark., where the SWAT team broke down doors and detonated flash-bangs in more than 90 percent of 147 narcotics search warrant raids between January 2011 and March 2013, according to data shared with The Times.\n\nDeadly outcomes did not slow them down. In 2010, two team members were shot, neither fatally, and a suspect was killed, in a no-knock raid that uncovered half an ounce each of marijuana and crack. Less than two years later, a SWAT officer killed an armed 31-year-old man during an early morning raid that turned up three marijuana plants. The unit then conducted five more raids in the ensuing two weeks.\n\nThe shootings prompted a new policy that the team must withdraw if it encounters an armed suspect, but they did not prompt broader reconsideration.\n\nIts not foolproof, not always going to happen just right, said the SWAT commander, Lt. Tim Calhoun. But it winds up being the most safe for us. These are dangerous people were dealing with.\n\nSummoning armed criminals outside, he said, is no less risky than startling them inside. Long stakeouts exhaust manpower and can lead to dangerous vehicle pursuits, street confrontations and traffic stops that do not yield as much contraband.\n\nIt matters little, Lieutenant Calhoun said, that drug crimes may not always pose an immediate mortal threat. If you have a dope house next door, he said, theres probably nothing the police can do that would be overreacting.\n\nShifting Definitions\n\nThe mission creep for the heavily militarized teams has coincided with a stark shift toward law enforcement in the Supreme Courts search for the proper balance between public safety and individual rights.\n\nThe quest for that sweet spot dates from the early 17th century and the castle doctrine of English common law, which protected residents from unannounced government intrusions. That ethos was enshrined in the United States Constitution in 1791 with the ratification of the Fourth Amendment, which prohibits unreasonable searches and seizures and requires that warrants be backed by probable cause.\n\nMore than a century ago, those rights seemed so sacrosanct that the Supreme Court, in its early iterations of the exclusionary rule, asserted that evidence obtained through an improper search could not be used at trial. But after a series of rulings in the 1990s, officers became able to obtain a warrant to forcibly enter a house with merely a reasonable suspicion that announcing would be dangerous or allow the destruction of evidence. Paradoxically, that standard allowed the use of the most extreme force in pursuit of the smallest amounts of drugs, since a few grams are more quickly flushed than a few bales.\n\nIf its a small quantity, youre probably not going to find too many police investigators that are going to knock, Chief William P. McManus of the San Antonio Police Department said in a 2010 deposition.\n\nIn 2003, the Supreme Court affirmed the right of officers to break into a residence with a standard warrant after knocking and waiting only 15 to 20 seconds. Three years later, it undercut even that requirement by concluding that evidence remains admissible even when the police barge in more quickly.\n\nThat has helped blur the distinction between no-knock and knock-and-announce entries. Either the door comes in and people are yelling Sheriffs office or people yell Sheriffs office and the door comes in, said Judge Brian M. Rickman of the Georgia Court of Appeals, who was district attorney in Habersham County during the Cornelia raid.\n\nIn The Timess inventory, 47 civilians and five officers died as a result of the execution of knock-and-announce searches, while 31 civilians and eight officers died in the execution of no-knock warrants. The type of warrant could not be determined in three civilian fatalities.\n\nWith so little restraint exerted by the federal courts, few states have offered greater protections. A survey by The Times found that 13 states have enacted laws authorizing no-knock warrants. Another 13 have blessed them through rulings by appellate courts. In seven states, no-knock warrants are routinely granted in the absence of explicit authority by statute or the courts. In 16 states and the District of Columbia, no-knock warrants are not customary but the police can nonetheless make unannounced entries with standard warrants.\n\nMost States Allow No-Knock Searches The legal status of no-knock search warrants differs from state to state. In some, they are authorized by law or judicial precedent. In others, they are granted by judges in the absence of statute or case law when exigent circumstances exist, like a risk of danger or destruction of evidence. Oregon is the only state with a law requiring the police to always announce themselves before serving a search warrant. Ore. Wash. Iowa Del. Mich. Va. Alaska W.Va. Idaho N.M. Ala. Conn. Pa. Fla. Ky. Nev. Hawaii N.C. Okla. Tenn. Wis. Ark. Calif. N.D. Ga. Me. Ill. La. S.D. Minn. Mo. Neb. Kan. Ariz. Utah Colo. N.H. S.C. Ind. Miss. Mont. N.J. N.Y. Md. Mass. Ohio Tex. Wyo. Vt. No-knock warrants are routinely granted Not granted, but forcible entries allowed under exigent circumstances Police must announce themselves OR WA IA MI VA AK WV ID NM AL CT PA FL KY NV HI NC OK TN WI AR CA ND GA ME IL LA SD MN MO NE KS AZ UT CO NH SC IN MS MT NJ NY MD MA OH TX WY VT No-knock warrants are routinely granted Not routinely granted, but forcible entry allowed under exigent circumstances Police must announce\n\nOnly in Oregon does state law prohibit no-knock entries, and only in Florida has a state Supreme Court disallowed no-knock warrants. That 1994 opinion recognized a staggering potential for violence to both occupants and police. In 2015, the Utah Legislature banned forcible entry if the only suspected offense is drug possession.\n\nElsewhere, even when prompted by sensational headlines, legislative efforts to curb the raids have encountered resistance. Several proposals withered in Georgias General Assembly the year after the Baby Bou Bou episode, including prohibiting no-knock raids between 10 p.m. and 6 a.m.\n\nThose failures only deepened mistrust in minority neighborhoods, said State Senator Vincent Fort, a Democrat who sponsored the bills in the Republican-controlled legislature. It makes some community members see the police as occupying forces as opposed to community partners against crime, he said.\n\nWhy It Can Go Wrong\n\nAnd so the raids continue. When successful, they can temporarily disrupt the supply chain. But too often, the show of force is disproportionate, the errors disastrous. There are a variety of contributing factors.\n\nInadequate Judicial Scrutiny\n\nIn August 2015, an assistant clerk-magistrate in Worcester, Mass., reviewed an application for a no-knock warrant aimed at finding two illegal guns in a drug dealers apartment. The affidavit by a state trooper relied solely on a single confidential informant. There had been no surveillance, and the affidavit itself acknowledged that motor vehicle and utility records indicated that the suspect did not live there anymore.\n\nNonetheless, the magistrate, Brenda D. Seaver, signed the warrant and at about 5 a.m. on Aug. 19 the citys SWAT team broke through the door. The new tenants  a man and woman who were engaged, their male roommate and two children  were detained at gunpoint as their belongings were ransacked. Both men were handcuffed; the woman, who had been sleeping nude, reported being berated profanely in front of her children.\n\nNo contraband was found, and the police eventually became convinced that the residents did not know the suspect, who had moved out more than three months earlier.\n\nThe tenants have filed a federal lawsuit against the city, the police and the informant. But their lawyer, Hctor E. Pieiro, also blames the judiciary.\n\nIf youre a magistrate, he said, you should be asking are there children there, what steps have been taken to find out, what kind of surveillance has been done, how reliable is this confidential informant, are there other ways you can arrest this person. It never gets done.\n\nMs. Seaver did not respond to a request for comment.\n\nWrong Addresses\n\nThe mistakes might be laughable were they not so consequential.\n\nIn May 2010, the police in Hempstead, N.Y., shot and wounded 22-year-old Iyanna Davis during a no-knock raid at a two-family residence where she lived in an upstairs unit with a separate entrance. The warrant was for downstairs.\n\nMs. Davis was awakened at about 7 a.m. by the sound of a doors being smashed and hid in a closet, she recounted in a deposition. A Nassau County police officer, armed with an assault rifle, opened the door, found her crouching and screamed at her to raise her hands.\n\nThats when I heard the shot, she recounted. The force actually knocked me back on my backside. The bullet had entered her right breast and exited her abdomen.\n\nIn his own deposition, the officer, Michael Capobianco, said that he tripped and didnt mean to fire. He was cleared of any policy violations; Ms. Davis, who spent a week in the hospital and another three months recuperating, won $650,000 in a legal settlement from the county.\n\nFailure to Knock\n\nThe warrant to search Julian Bettons apartment did not authorize the police in Myrtle Beach, S.C., to break in without warning, and the officers insist that they knocked and announced.\n\nBut video from Mr. Bettons front porch surveillance camera on the afternoon of April 16, 2015, shows no sign of warning before drug agents rammed through his door. The recording does not include audio, but a neighbor who watched from steps away told state investigators he was 100 percent sure there was no prior notice.\n\nSuspected of small-scale marijuana dealing, Mr. Betton said in a deposition late last year that he emerged from a bathroom, saw moving shadows, assumed he was being robbed and reached for the handgun in his waistband. Three officers responded by spraying the room with dozens of rounds, hitting Mr. Betton nine times.\n\nI just seen stuff coming at me and I went to reach for it and went down, Mr. Betton, who was 30 at the time, said in a deposition for the lawsuit he later filed.\n\nMr. Betton awoke from a coma six weeks later, partially paralyzed, having lost portions of his gallbladder, colon, bowel and rectum. On Thursday, he pleaded guilty to drug charges, including possession of nearly eight ounces of marijuana found in the raid. Counts of pointing and presenting a weapon were dismissed and he was sentenced to the time he served in the hospital.\n\nMembers of the police team initially claimed that Mr. Betton fired first, but the state crime lab found no evidence that his gun had been discharged. A prosecutor cleared the officers, concluding that the shooting was justified.\n\nLack of Monitoring\n\nBecause fewer than a third of tactical teams use body cameras, the police version of events like the killing of Eric John Senegal is often the only one.\n\nMembers of the Beauregard Parish sheriffs special operations team told investigators that when they broke into Mr. Senegals house trailer in rural Ragley, La., on Jan. 4, 2016, they found the slightly-built, 27-year-old man just inside the entrance, pointing a handgun their way. It was not cocked, but two deputies fired, hitting Mr. Senegal three times, according to investigative reports. Another killed his charging pit bull.\n\nSeveral team members told investigators there were shouts of Sheriffs Office as they detonated two flash-bangs and breached the door. A grand jury declined to indict them, said District Attorney James R. Lestage.\n\nBut since the deputies were not equipped with cameras, there is no way to really know what happened, and the uncertainty has bred suspicion and litigation. Crime scene photographs show Mr. Senegal splayed out on the floor, blood pooling near his head, the gun about three feet from his sneakers. Derrick Kee, a lawyer who has filed a lawsuit on behalf of Mr. Senegals widow, suggests that it could have been planted.\n\nThe drug seizure was not insubstantial: 22 ounces of marijuana, about 20 grams of methamphetamine, a gram of cocaine, 34 prescription pills and $38.42 found in a Nesquik jar, according to a crime lab report.\n\nMr. Kee does not acknowledge that Mr. Senegal was dealing, but said it still would not justify his death. These warrants introduce volatile circumstances into nonvolatile situations, he said. They should be issued only under the most unique circumstances.\n\nOfficers Are Divided\n\nSome SWAT veterans find it confounding that many police agencies remain so devoted to dynamic entry. The tactic is far from universally embraced, and a number of departments have retired or restricted its use over the years, often after a bad experience.\n\nThe National Tactical Officers Association, which might be expected to mount the most ardent defense, has long called for using dynamic entry sparingly. Robert Chabali, the groups chairman from 2012 to 2015, goes so far as to recommend that it never be used to serve narcotics warrants.\n\nIt just makes no sense, said Mr. Chabali, a SWAT veteran who retired as assistant chief of the Dayton, Ohio, Police Department in 2015. Why would you run into a gunfight? If we are going to risk our lives, we risk them for a hostage, for a citizen, for a fellow officer. You definitely dont go in and risk your life for drugs.\n\nAnother former chairman of the association, Phil Hansen, said SWAT teams tended to use dynamic entry as a one-size-fits-all solution to tactical problems. As commander of the Police Department in Santa Maria, Calif., and before that a longtime SWAT leader for the Los Angeles County Sheriffs Department, he said it seemed foolhardy to move so aggressively in a state that voted in November to legalize recreational marijuana.\n\nWhy am I risking peoples lives to save an ounce of something that theyre bringing in by the freighter every year? he asked.\n\nBut officials with other law enforcement groups reject such absolutist approaches.\n\nIf you want to take the position that narcotics laws in this country should not be enforced, then O.K., yeah, said Sheriff Greg Champagne of St. Charles Parish in Louisiana, the president of the National Sheriffs Association. Thats not the position of the law enforcement people around the country that I know. If youre going to make narcotics cases you need to have evidence, and search warrants are how you get it.\n\nSheriff Champagne said his deputies looked for opportunities to detain suspects on the street or in cars. Even so, he said, there are times we just have to go in.\n\nTheres an argument that no-knock warrants can actually be safer for residents and officers because a well-trained SWAT team can neutralize a situation in seconds and minimize the chance for hostage-takings and standoffs, he added. You can always point to the one bad case, but look at the thousands of cases where a no-knock warrant was executed without injury and heroin is seized. How many lives are saved because we got it off the street?\n\nNo-knock warrants, said Bob Bushman, president of the National Narcotic Officers Associations Coalition, are a tool that should stay in the toolbox.\n\nThere are some times, he said, that if youre going to bring an investigation to a head the way to do it is with a no-knock.\n\nClearly there are other factors that contribute to the tactics staying power. Some of it, according to long-term observers, derives from the adrenalized, hypermasculine, militaristic ethos of SWAT.\n\nListen to Your Daily Audio Report This is how the news should sound. Twenty minutes a day, five days a week, hosted by Michael Barbaro and powered by New York Times journalism.\n\nIts culturally intoxicating, a rush, said Dr. Kraska, the criminologist. It involves dressing up in body armor and provocative face coverings and enhanced-hearing sets, a cyborg 21st-century kind of appeal. And instead of sitting around and waiting for something to happen twice or three times a year, you can go out and generate it.\n\nThat culture is reinforced by a cottage industry of tactical training contractors, many of them veterans of the Iraq or Afghanistan wars, who are hired by police departments to keep SWAT teams up to date.\n\nFor them, collateral damage is something you try to avoid but its not a deal breaker, Commander Hansen said. That doesnt translate well for police work. If youre in the military and told to clear a block of houses in a half-hour, youre going to do it quickly by kicking in doors and throwing grenades. Its a whole different theater of operations.\n\nAnother potential factor is the incentive sometimes provided by asset forfeiture laws when contraband or drug proceeds are found in a residence. Revenue generated by those seizures typically reverts back to law enforcement agencies.\n\nConnor Boyack, president of the Libertas Institute in Utah, said that was one of the rationales behind his states recent ban on forcible entry in drug possession cases. In 2015 when the new law passed, search warrant executions accounted for 29 percent of all forfeitures, according to a state report.\n\nWe feel strongly that a lot of this is financial motive, not to keep the community safe, said Mr. Boyack, whose libertarian-leaning group advocated for the restriction.\n\nFurther inducement has come from the Defense Departments excess property program, which has distributed more than $6 billion in military vehicles, weapons and other equipment to law enforcement agencies since 1997. Until last May, the Pentagon required that any transferred equipment be placed into use within one year of receipt.\n\nThe Obama administration ended that requirement after a larger review of the so-called 1033 program, which was prompted by the police response to the 2014 civil unrest in Ferguson, Mo. President Trump has yet to act on a campaign pledge to rescind an executive order signed by President Barack Obama in 2015 that limited the kinds of equipment offered by the government. It is unclear whether he would reinstate the one-year rule.\n\nWhy Didnt You Knock?\n\nAs SWAT officers administered first aid to Bou Bou Phonesavanh, other agents detained his parents  Bounkham and Alecia Phonesavanh  and their three other children, ages 3 to 7.\n\nYou know why were here, an officer barked at Mr. Phonesavanh.\n\nHe didnt. Why didnt you knock on the door? he asked.\n\nElsewhere in the house, the agents came upon Mr. Phonesavanhs sister, Amanda Thonetheva, who owned the place, as well as her boyfriend, her grandson and one of her sons. They did not find her other son, 30-year-old Wanis, who no longer lived there but dropped by at times. Nor did they find guns or drugs beyond some meth residue in a glass pipe. Later that night, deputies arrested Wanis at another address.\n\nThe Phonesavanhs had already suffered their share of misfortune. Earlier that year, the familys house in Janesville, Wis., had burned down. They stayed in a motel as long as they could afford it, then lived for two weeks in their 11-year-old Chrysler Town & Country minivan.\n\nThey drove to Georgia when Mr. Phonesavanhs sister offered the room in her garage. Seven weeks later, after struggling to find work, they were preparing to drive back to Wisconsin.\n\nRemarkably, Bou Bou survived the explosion after being sped to a hospital in Atlanta. Now 4, he underwent his 15th surgery late last year, with more to come, his mother said. The nightmares are still there, she said, several times a week. When he wakes up hes usually sweating and holding his face. She said all of her children became scared when they saw a police officer or security guard.\n\nGot a confidential news tip?\n\nThe Phonesavanhs, who have returned to Janesville, received $3.6 million in settlements to the federal lawsuit they filed against the traumatized members of the drug and SWAT teams. The payments were made through government insurance policies purchased with taxpayer funds. All but $200,000, Ms. Phonesavanh said, has been spent on medical and legal bills.\n\nThings are still quite the struggle, she said. They didnt mean to hurt my son, but they couldve done a lot more to prevent this.\n\nA Habersham County grand jury issued a stinging report, but found no criminal negligence and declined to indict any of the participants. Federal prosecutors then won an indictment of Deputy Autry for violating Bou Bous civil rights, but she was acquitted after a weeklong trial. The jury accepted the defenses assertion that the mistakes made by the former deputy, who had resigned, were unintentional.\n\nIn their closing arguments, opposing lawyers found common ground in their criticism of no-knock searches.\n\nThe prosecutor, Assistant United States Attorney William L. McKinnon Jr., called the tactic probably the most intrusive contact that any citizen could have with the government. He got no dispute from one of Deputy Autrys lawyers, Michael J. Trost. Theres a pattern of excess in the ways search warrants are executed, he told the jury. Thats what led to the injuries to this child.\n\nRead the second installment in this series.'	b'Door-Busting Drug Raids Leave a Trail of Blood'	2017-03-18	['Kevin Sack']	['doorbusting', 'noknock', 'trail', 'leave', 'drug', 'officers', 'warrants', 'search', 'times', 'blood', 'mr', 'swat', 'warrant', 'raids']	b'Search warrant raids account for a small share of the nearly 1,000 fatalities each year in officer-involved shootings.\nThe American Civil Liberties Union concluded in a recent study of 20 cities that 42 percent of those subjected to SWAT search warrant raids were black and 12 percent Hispanic.\nAbout the Data A full list of fatalities resulting from forcible-entry search warrant raids from 2010 to 2016, tallied by The Times, along with demographic details.\nMost States Allow No-Knock Searches The legal status of no-knock search warrants differs from state to state.\nOregon is the only state with a law requiring the police to always announce themselves before serving a search warrant.'

This year, an off-duty Dallas officer fatally shot Botham Shem Jean when she mistook his apartment for her own, and Stephon Clark was shot dead in his grandmothers backyard by the police in Sacramento.\n\nTo see how the cases were processed and moved through the judicial system, we tracked the outcomes of 15 high-profile deaths from 2014 to 2016. In some of the cases, the police offered an explanation for their actions, but many viewers of raw footage concluded that their actions were unjustified.\n\nOfficers were indicted or charged in eight of the cases. Three cases resulted in convictions, one of which came with a prison sentence after a guilty plea.\n\nOn Friday, Officer Jason Van Dyke was convicted of second-degree murder and 16 counts of aggravated battery with a firearm in the fatal shooting of Laquan McDonald in 2014.\n\nAfter a mistrial for murder or voluntary manslaughter charges in December 2016, Michael T. Slager, the North Charleston, S.C., officer who fatally shot Walter L. Scott in the back as Mr. Scott was running away, pleaded guilty to civil rights charges in May. He was later sentenced to 20 years in prison.\n\nPeter Liang was convicted of manslaughter after Akai Gurley was killed by a ricocheting bullet in a dark stairwell of a Brooklyn housing project.

Biden Jr. make their decision in November.\n\nBefore the coronavirus crisis consumed his White House, his 2016 rallying cry of build the wall still echoed in his re-election campaign. Construction of a wall along the countrys southern border, intended to halt the flow of undocumented immigrants into the country, has been slow going, but an immigration crackdown has remained one of the policy issues that enlivens his base. Mr. Trump has even tried to use immigration as a way to change the subject from criticism of his administrations handling of the pandemic.\n\nMr. Trump has also made eliminating federal regulations a priority, with a focus on dismantling Obama-era environmental regulations. So far, he has failed to achieve his top legislative priority when he came into office: repealing the Affordable Care Act. But he has pleased Republicans, in particular, with his commitment to appointing conservative judges to the federal bench at a record-setting pace.\n\nMr. Trump touts two trade deals as his signature policies, even as they mark a break from Republican free-trade orthodoxy in favor of a populist approach: an initial trade agreement with China, and his revised accord with Mexico and Canada.

trusted	b'Michael Browns Shooting and Its Immediate Aftermath in Ferguson'	true	[]		trusted	[]	https://www.nytimes.com/interactive/2014/08/12/us/13police-shooting-of-black-teenager-michael-brown.html	https://www.nytimes.com/	"b'Michael Brown Is Shot An 18-year-old teenager, Michael Brown, is shot and killed on Saturday by a police officer in Ferguson, Mo. The circumstances surrounding the shooting are in dispute. The police say Mr. Brown was shot during a skirmish with the officer. A friend who was walking with Mr. Brown, Dorian Johnson, says the officer opened fire when the young men refused to move from the middle of the street to the sidewalk. He says Mr. Browns hands were over his head when the officer fired. All agree that Mr. Brown was unarmed. Protests Amid Calls for Patience After a candlelight vigil on Sunday evening, protesters flood into the streets near the scene of the shooting, some chanting, No justice, no peace. They are met by police officers in riot gear, carrying rifles and shields. A Peaceful Protest Turns Violent Images and videos captured on cellphones begin to flood social media sites, and accounts of looting in Ferguson spread quickly on Twitter. The QuikTrip in the second tweet, below, is among the first- and hardest-hit businesses. F.B.I. Opens Civil Rights Investigation The Federal Bureau of Investigation opens a civil rights inquiry into the shooting of Mr. Brown on Monday as protests in Ferguson continues. The N.A.A.C.P. issues a statement of support for Mr. Brown\'s family, adding, ""Even as we call for accountability by those charged with protecting the community, we call on the community to act  collectively and calmly."" Jon Belmar, chief of the St. Louis County Police, asks for patience while his department completes an investigation that could take some time. That night, protesters again square off with the police, who use tear gas to disperse the crowd. Police Decline to Identify Officer The police chief in Ferguson on Tuesday reconsiders his decision to release the name of the officer involved in the shooting, citing concerns for the officer\'s safety. The department says threats were made against the officer and the citys Police Department on social media. The value of releasing the name is far outweighed by the risk of harm to the officer and his family, the police chief, Thomas Jackson, says. The decision draws criticism from a lawyer for the Brown family. Anger Mounts Over Anonymity of Police Officer The selective release of information about the shooting, especially the anonymity granted to the officer, fuels a fourth day and night of protests in Ferguson that escalates after the police seeks to disperse people using rubber bullets and tear gas. Thomas Jackson, Ferguson\'s chief of police, reveals earlier in the day that the officer who shot Mr. Brown had been struck in the face during the encounter and treated at a hospital. The friend who was with Mr. Brown at the time of the shooting has disputed the Police Department\'s claim that there was a struggle. Among those arrested in the evening are Wesley Lowery of The Washington Post and Ryan J. Reilly of The Huffington Post, who are apprehended at a McDonalds on suspicion of trespassing. They are later released without charges or an explanation. Both news organizations criticize the arrests. Also arrested is Antonio French , a St. Louis alderman who was documenting the protests on social media. Mr. French is released the next morning. A witness tweets this image of a street filling with clouds of tear gas, illuminated by what look like small explosions. Later, the police confirm that Molotov cocktails were thrown during the night. Shift in Oversight of Crowd Control President Obama says that Attorney General Eric H. Holder Jr. should do what is necessary to help determine exactly what happened and to see that justice is done. Mr. Obama  who speaks from Martha\'s Vineyard, Mass., where he is vacationing  also criticizes law enforcement officers in Ferguson for what he describes as excessive force during the protests. He adds that he had spoken to Gov. Jay Nixon of Missouri. I expressed my concern over the violent turn of events, the president says. Earlier in the day, Mr. Nixon speaks in Ferguson and promises ""operational shifts,"" saying that St. Louis County police officers would be relieved of duty in Ferguson. Later, he confirms that the Missouri State Highway Patrol would begin overseeing security and crowd control during the protests. Dueling Police Statements as Anger Rises One day after roiling tensions over the police shooting of a black teenager began to subside, emotions flare anew on Friday as the police identify the officer involved but also release evidence that the victim was a suspect in a convenience store robbery moments before being shot. The manner in which the police here release the information, which include a 19-page police report on the robbery but no new details about the shooting, leads to the spectacle of dueling police news conferences, one led by a white officer who seems ill at ease and defensive, and the other dominated by a charismatic black officer who expresses solidarity with the crowd even as he pleads for peace. Governor Declares Curfew in Ferguson On Saturday, Gov. Jay Nixon cites looting when he declares a state of emergency and imposes a midnight-to-5 a.m. curfew on the St. Louis suburb. The announcement prompts cries of protest and anguish from some members of the public, with many of them arguing that a curfew would lead only to new and fierce confrontations. But Capt. Ronald S. Johnson, the state Highway Patrol commander whose officers have overseen public security in Ferguson since Thursday, says: We wont enforce it with trucks, we wont enforce it with tear gas, we will enforce it with communication. We will be telling people, Its time to go home.  Clashes Erupt as Some Protesters Ignore Curfew As the midnight curfew in Ferguson takes effect amid heavy rain, crowds that had filled some streets begin to disperse. But some clusters of people confront police officers lining the streets or riding in armored vehicles. The demonstrators chant: We are Mike Brown! We have the right to assemble peacefully! invoking the name of the 18-year-old fatally shot by the officer. Protesters toss at least one bottle rocket, according to the police, and at the apparent sound of gunshots, demonstrators scramble to safety. The police fire smoke canisters and tear gas at the crowds, and officials later say it was in response to the shooting, in which one man is critically wounded, apparently by another protester. Seven people are arrested and accused of failing to disperse. The governor of Missouri later says that the curfew was effective in helping to maintain a relative peace. Preachers, Passion and a Private Autopsy Despite the official pronunciation of a successful curfew, passions in Ferguson are hardly tamped down as the day wears on. First, word comes that officials have extended the curfew for at least one more night. Then, Attorney General Eric H. Holder Jr. announces that the Justice Department would conduct its own autopsy of Mr. Brown because of the extraordinary circumstances in the case. (A state autopsy has already been completed.) Later, the police, pastors and civil rights figures gather at churches, delivering passionate speeches and calls for change. Then, late in the evening, the preliminary results of a private autopsy performed on Sunday by Dr. Michael M. Baden at the request of Mr. Brown\'s family are revealed. (Prof. Shawn L. Parcells assists Dr. Baden.) The 18-year-old was shot at least six times, including twice in the head, the report says. All the bullets were fired into his front. One bullet entered the top of his skull, suggesting his head was bent forward when it struck him, and caused a fatal injury. ""This information could have been released on Day 1, Dr. Baden says in an interview after the autopsy. Amid appeals for calm, and as the second midnight curfew approaches, street violence flares again. Governor Deploys National Guard President Obama dispatched Attorney General Eric H. Holder Jr. to Missouri after the governor deployed the National Guard to help the police quell unrest. The governor, Jay Nixon, also lifted a curfew that had been imposed on Friday night. Mr. Holder will travel to Ferguson on Wednesday, Mr. Obama said, and Ronald Davis, the director of the Justice Department\'s Office of Community Oriented Policing Services, will arrive Tuesday to work with police officials. President Obama told reporters at the White House that he had talked to Mr. Nixon and expressed an interest in making sure that if in fact the National Guard is used, it is used in a limited and appropriate way. Ill be watching over the next several days, to assess whether, in fact, its helping rather than hindering progress in Ferguson, Mr. Obama said. The role of the National Guard will be limited to protecting the police command center here, which the authorities said came under a coordinated attack on Sunday night, Mr. Nixon said. Unrest Escalates Despite Presence of National Guard The protests in Ferguson reached new levels of violence, even as the Missouri National Guard arrived, the latest in a series of quickly shifting attempts to quell the chaos. The authorities had banned stationary protests, even during the day, ordering demonstrators to continue walking  particularly in an area near where the shooting occurred. Reports of tear gas, rubber bullets and the exchange of live gunfire began to flood Twitter. In the morning Ferguson\'s streets were relatively quiet, but officials revealed that during the protests of the previous evening, two men were shot in the crowd, and 31 people  some from New York and California  were arrested. Six journalists were among those who were detained. Fires were reported in two places. The police were shot at, the authorities said, but did not fire their weapons. Focus Turns to Investigation as Holder Arrives Attorney General Eric H. Holder Jr. arrived in St. Louis to meet with community leaders and federal investigators as local law enforcement officials said they were hopeful that they had turned a corner in calming the restive community of Ferguson after 12 days of protests and unrest. A grand jury has been convened and was scheduled to begin hearing evidence, said Edward Magee, a spokesman for Robert P. McCulloch, the prosecuting attorney for St. Louis County. National Guard Troops Ordered to Withdraw Gov. Jay Nixon ordered the Missouri National Guard to begin a withdrawal from Ferguson, signaling that the authorities believed that they had largely restored order after nearly two weeks of unrest. In a statement, Mr. Nixon said the situation had greatly improved with fewer incidents of outside agitators interfering with peaceful protesters and fewer acts of violence. In Washington, having returned from his trip to Ferguson, Attorney General Eric H. Holder Jr. indicated that the federal effort was moving forward. Its going to take time for us to develop all the facts, develop all the evidence and see where the case will ultimately go, he said. Its most important that we get it right. Ferguson Area Schools Prepare for Opening Day The school year in Ferguson was scheduled to begin on Aug. 14, but the opening was delayed because of the unrest that followed the killing of Michael Brown five days earlier. Public schools will open on Monday, and teachers and administrators in the Ferguson-Florissant School District are eager to establish some sense of normalcy. Mourning and Calls for Action at Michael Brown\'s Funeral Thousands paid their respects to Michael Brown, more than two weeks after he was shot and killed by a police officer in Ferguson, Mo. In a deeply religious service at the Friendly Temple Missionary Baptist Church, several speakers exhorted mourners to work for justice, not just for Mr. Brown but for others, long after the funeral was over. The crowd of mourners included his parents and extended family, as well as the Rev. Jesse Jackson; the film director Spike Lee; T. D. Jakes, the bishop of The Potters House, an African-American megachurch; several members of Congress; representatives from the White House; and two children of the Rev.

Sunday nights performance was the festivals last scheduled show.\n\nTwitter/EirikurH via Storyful\n\nBloodied victims were seen lying on the ground at the festival.\n\nDavid Becker/Getty Images\n\nConcertgoers described hearing round after round of gunfire. This shooting was going on for at least 10 minutes, said Jake Owen, a country singer who was on stage with Mr. Aldean when the shooting began.\n\nA Frantic Search for the Gunman\n\n[The account below is based primarily on recordings of police communications, captured by Broadcastify.com and some individuals.]\n\nAt 10:08 p.m., an officer on the scene sounds the alarm. We got shots fired, he says. Sounds like an automatic firearm.\n\nThere is confusion over the next few minutes as officers arrive to scenes of death and mayhem.\n\nIts coming from upstairs in the Mandalay Bay. Upstairs in the Mandalay Bay, halfway up I see the shots coming from Mandalay Bay, halfway up.\n\nWe have an active shooter  we have an active shooter inside the fairgrounds!\n\nAt 10:12 p.m., the scale of the attack becomes more clear as an officer, using law-enforcement shorthand for gunshot wounds, reports in an agitated voice: We have multiple casualties. G.S.W.s in the medical tent. Multiple casualties!\n\nBut the confusion over the source of the gunshots continues:\n\nShots are coming from Gate 7.\n\nWere in front of Mandalay Bay. Were trying to see where the shots are coming from. If anyone can advise if theyre coming from Mandalay.\n\nIt sounds like its either Mandalay or Luxor, we cannot tell.\n\nAt 10:13 p.m., the manhunt begins to focus.\n\nIts coming from like the 50th or 60th floor, north of the Mandalay Bay! Its coming out a window.\n\nWere seeing local flashes in the middle of Mandalay Bay on the north side, kind of on the west tower but towards the center of the casino, like one of the middle floors.\n\nThe gunman had smashed two windows that have a broad view of the festival ground, the sheriff said later at a news conference.\n\nJohn Locher/Associated Press\n\nEven with pandemonium on the streets, one officer has clearly identified where the shooting is coming from:\n\nIm inside the Mandalay Bay on the 31st floor, I can hear the automatic fire coming from one floor ahead, one floor above us.\n\nRepeating, just be advised it is automatic fire. Fully automatic fire from an elevated position. Take cover.\n\nThat is correct, its fully automatic fire. Im right below it.\n\nOutside, frustration grows.\n\nWere taking gunfire. Its going right over our heads. Theres debris coming over our heads. Were pinned down here with a bunch of civilians.\n\nWe cant worry about victims, we need to snuff the shooter before we have more victims! Anybody have eyes on him, on this shooter?\n\nHey officers, please stay calm, just relax, were trying to get this set up.\n\nBy 10:20 p.m., there are some indications the shooting has stopped, although it is not clear.\n\nIts been awhile since weve heard any shots. Does anybody have eyes on the shooter?\n\nA later transmission indicates that the shooting may have ended about 10:25.\n\nAt 10:24 p.m., officers report from the stairwell just outside the gunmans door.\n\nIm on the 32nd floor. The room is going to be 135.\n\nIts room 135 on the 32nd floor. I need the SWAT.\n\nAt 10:28 p.m., as SWAT teams gather on the 32nd floor and the 29th floor, where there have been erroneous reports of another gunman, an officer says that a hotel security officer has been shot.\n\nThe gunman was at one point in a large suite on the 32nd floor, with windows facing the concert grounds. The diagram below shows the typical floor plan.\n\nBy The New York Times\n\nOver the next 50 minutes, officers secure the floor and ready several SWAT teams.\n\nAt about 11:20 p.m., they explode a door-breaching device, and enter to find the suspect dead of a self-inflicted gunshot wound. The man, who was later identified as Stephen Paddock, 64, had an arsenal of firearms in the room, officials said.\n\nAbout the Hotel\n\nThe Mandalay Bay Resort and Casino anchors the southern tip of a row of luxury hotels on Las Vegas Boulevard known as the Strip.

trusted	b'Parkland Massacre Thrusts Guns Into the Midterm Spotlight'	true	[]		trusted	[]	https://www.nytimes.com/2018/02/27/us/politics/parkland-gun-control-politics-midterms.html	https://www.nytimes.com/	b'We want change, we want change ... I dont understand why I could still go in a store and buy a weapon of war. Theres no better time than now to talk about gun control. These are calls the American public has heard before. After Orlando  Democrats and Republicans we spoke with agree, suspected terrorists, like the Orlando shooter, should not be allowed to purchase firearms. After Sandy Hook  90 percent of Americans support universal background checks. After each mass shooting, theres a surge of public support for stricter gun control. A new poll from Quinnipiac University shows record high support for stricter gun laws. So why hasnt Washington put stricter gun laws on the books? There are several factors, ranging from partisan divides to gun owner activism to the N.R.A.s political clout. No. 1: Theres broad support, but also big divisions on gun control. The most comprehensive data is from 2017, and it shows that 60 percent of Americans say they want stricter gun laws. Support is even higher for things like a 30-day waiting period for gun sales and universal background checks. But dig deeper, and you find the devil is in the details  and the divides. Most Democratic voters want stricter gun laws. But less than 1 in 4 Republicans agree. Most Americans who dont own firearms say easy access to legal guns fuels gun violence. Fewer than half of gun owners agree. Non-owners want to ban assault-style weapons, while most gun owners dont. The person is the criminal, not the weapon. Gun owners may be a minority, but theyre a very focused and vocal minority. Only about 3 in 10 Americans own a gun. But to them, gun control is not merely a policy issue  its personal. Nearly 40 percent say they always have a loaded firearm at the ready in their home. 74 percent say the right to own a gun is essential to their freedom. Gun owners are much more likely to contact lawmakers about gun policy, compared to non-owners, and far more likely to donate to gun advocacy and policy groups. No. 3: The N.R.A. is a formidable force in politics. Less than 20 percent of gun owners in America say they belong to the N.R.A., but its big enough, and disciplined enough, to turn elections and to end political careers. Part of what makes the N.R.A. so formidable is the money it spends helping friendly politicians and attacking those deemed enemies. Ross voted against your gun rights. The N.R.A.s vast marketing efforts have helped turn gun ownership into a badge of cultural identity. It is not about politics. It is a way of life. I feel like we should be able to express that. And their catchphrases have become ubiquitous. You know, the guns dont kill people, people kill people. No. 4: The N.R.A.s leaders are more hard-line than its members. Polls show that N.R.A. members do support some gun control policies, like outlawing sales to the mentally ill and people on terror watch lists. Most also favor universal background checks. But time and time again, N.R.A. leaders in Washington work to kill these proposals. After Sandy Hook, N.R.A. leaders flipped the script on mass shootings. Instead of combating calls for new gun control, they actually demanded more gun rights. The only thing that stops a bad guy with a gun is a good guy with a gun. And finally, No. 5: Are Americans really clamoring for more gun control? Maybe not. We see spikes and public support for stricter laws in the wake of mass shootings like Columbine, Sandy Hook and Las Vegas. But in a matter of weeks, the bumps fade. In fact, overall Americans have actually grown less supportive of gun control over the past 25 years. The shootings, meanwhile, continue.'	b'Parkland Massacre Thrusts Guns Into the Midterm Spotlight'	2018-02-27	['Jonathan Martin', 'Alexander Burns']	['control', 'parkland', 'laws', 'thrusts', 'massacre', 'stricter', 'support', 'midterm', 'owners', 'say', 'nra', 'gun', 'spotlight', 'guns', 'americans', 'dont']	b'A new poll from Quinnipiac University shows record high support for stricter gun laws.

As France gradually exits from its months-long lockdown, the authorities fear a potential second wave of the epidemic.\n\nThe country has started to lift some restrictions, allowing people to leave their homes without release forms for the first time since mid-March, although there are still restrictions on trips further than 100 kilometers from ones home. Some schools and shops also reopened, but cafes, restaurants and bars will remain closed until at least the end of May, and all large gatherings are banned for the summer. Wearing masks on public transportation is now mandatory.\n\nThe government has warned that lockdown restrictions could be reimposed if the number of cases shoots up again. To prevent that from happening, it has promised that it could muster 700,000 tests per week to identify and isolate new infectious cases, at their home or in hotels, and trace their contacts.\n\nFrance has one of Europes more robust economies and a vaunted universal health care system, but the virus has put both under serious strain. Mr. Macron was in the middle of a hotly-contested pension reform when the outbreak started and has faced criticism, especially for the governments handling of mask shortages.\n\nHow Cases Are Growing\n\nHeres how the number of new cases and deaths are changing over time:\n\nNew reported cases by day in France 0 2,000 4,000 6,000 cases Feb.

But the data skewed higher in the early weeks of April when previously unrecorded deaths were suddenly added to the nationally tally.\n\nGenerally speaking, while France has increased its testing capacities, it has yet to massively test people like its neighbor, Germany.

On May 6, the country moved into its second phase of easing far-reaching restrictions on public life that took effect in mid-March. Citing a drop in the transmission rate since April 20, when restrictions were first eased, Chancellor Angela Merkel warned that a lockdown could be reinstated in a region if it were to develop more than 50 new cases per 100,000 residents.\n\nWidespread testing for the virus began early in the year as labs across the country were allowed to produce their own test kits, which epidemiologists have credited with keeping the number of deaths relatively low and preventing Germanys comprehensive health care system from becoming overwhelmed. In the country of 83 million, more than 140,000 tests are being carried out daily, and hundreds of people are being trained to help health authorities trace and break new chains of infection.\n\nThe German economy is predicted to shrink by 6.5 percent this year, and more than 2.6 million Germans are unemployed, with another 10 million furloughed. Business owners had pushed hard for the economy to reopen, as did leaders of the countrys professional soccer league, which will resume playing matches to empty stadiums in the coming weeks.

The lockdown, which went into effect on March 25 and was extended until at least May 17, led to the shutdown of businesses and transportation. State borders have been sealed, schools and religious sites were closed, and officials are urging people to stay inside as much as possible.\n\nIn early May, the government eased some restrictions to help revive the economy, including allowing construction and plantation work to resume and many shops to reopen, including salons, pet and home hardware shops and liquor vendors.\n\nBut the authorities have moved cautiously, fearing rapid viral spread in Indias dense urban neighborhoods. At many junctures over the past six weeks, officials have faced daunting challenges enforcing the restrictions.\n\nWhen Prime Minister Narendra Modi announced the lockdown, thousands of migrant workers were initially stranded in cities without a way to reach their home villages. Some started 100-mile journeys on foot. With supply chain disruptions across the country, others have relied on the government for food handouts.\n\nHow Cases Are Growing\n\nIndias lockdown has helped blunt the spread of the coronavirus, slowing the nations doubling rate from around four days in late March to about 10 days.\n\nNew reported cases by day in India 0 2,000 4,000 6,000 cases Feb.

Officials in West Bengal have been accused of sitting on high mortality figures.

After allowing factories and construction sites to reopen and eateries and bars to offer takeout in early May, on Monday, restaurants, bars, hairdressers and beauticians were given a green light  as long as they observed social distancing and strict hygiene protocols. Shops could also open their doors, though the many shuttered doors and For Rent signs on storefronts throughout Italy show the fallout of months of inactivity.\n\nAs of Monday, religious celebrations were also allowed, as long as the faithful remained apart. Some dioceses held masses shortly after midnight to celebrate. Italian Prime Minister Giuseppe Conte said Italy was facing a calculated risk, by loosening the lockdown, citing recent data suggesting that infection rates remained low, even after Italians picked up their pace. But the government was aware that the epidemiological curve could go back up.\n\nFor now, Italians can only freely travel within their own region.

In late April, children under 14 years old were permitted to go outside for the first time in six weeks, and Prime Minister Pedro Snchez announced a plan to return to normalcy by the end of June.\n\nSpain began lifting restrictions by region in mid-May, allowing small groups to gather and dine outdoors, and small shops to reopen. Hair salons are also open. But about half the population, including residents of the two largest cities, Madrid and Barcelona, have remained under tighter restrictions.\n\nDespite easing confinement measures, Prime Minister Snchez wants Parliament to extend the current state of emergency until July.\n\nStill, authorities have announced that Spain would welcome tourists starting on July 1, when foreign visitors wont have to self-isolate for 14 days anymore when entering the country. Authorities have described reopening the country to tourists as essential for its economy, as Spain is the second most-visited country in the world after France.\n\nThe coronavirus outbreak has severely damaged Spains image as one of the healthiest nations in the world, which has long boasted a robust universal health care system and the highest life expectancy in the European Union. The pandemic has knocked out thousands of the countrys health workers, who make up nearly 20 percent of its confirmed coronavirus cases, the highest reported share in the world.\n\nHow Cases Are Growing\n\nHeres how the number of new cases and deaths are changing over time:\n\nNew reported cases by day in Spain 0 5,000 cases Feb. March April May 7-day average New cases Note: The seven-day average is the average of a day and the previous six days of data.\n\nNew reported deaths by day in Spain 0 500 1,000 deaths Feb. March April May 7-day average New deaths Note: Scale for deaths chart is adjusted from cases chart to display trend.\n\nThe New York Times has found that official tallies in the United States and in more than a dozen other countries have undercounted deaths during the coronavirus outbreak because of limited testing availability.\n\nSpanish authorities have changed their data collection method several times since March, creating confusion over the actual number of confirmed cases in the country. On April 16, the health ministry started to include results from antibody tests in its daily tallies of confirmed cases, only to retract them a week later. Antibody tests, authorities said, dont reflect new infections, because they do not determine whether the person developed the disease, how long it has been since he or she has developed immunity.\n\nSince April 24, the tally of confirmed cases includes data obtained from PCR diagnostic tests only, which caused a drop in the number of known infections, from around 220,000 to just over 200,000.\n\nOn May 25, Spain announced yet another way of collecting data, by counting a death based on when it happened, instead of when authorities were notified about it.\n\nAs a result, the countrys death toll saw a 2,000 drop, and authorities have said that they would update the numbers weekly, warning that more changes might come, while still reporting daily numbers.\n\nConfused? Many people and news outlets have been so too. Although authorities have argued that the new data collection system provides a better picture of the pandemic, Spanish news media have run lengthy explainers trying to explain the incomprehensible figures and the thousands of casualties that suddenly disappeared from the series.\n\nSpain, like most countries, is only counting fatalities of those who have tested positive for coronavirus. The Madrid region and Catalonia, the countrys worst hit areas, have started to report confirmed or suspected coronavirus deaths provided by funeral homes in daily updates, but those updated numbers are not included in the daily death tolls published by Spains health ministry. The regional numbers there include deaths in nursing homes and suggest that the death toll is far higher than reported so far.\n\nSpain has also faced an acute shortage of test kits, and has not tested those who dont present symptoms. Over a million tests had been performed as of late April, including 40,000 a day in recent weeks, according to authorities. But Spanish news outlets have questioned such figures.\n\nWhere You Can Find More Information\n\nRead more about Spains overwhelmed nursing homes, and watch how unprotected health workers, who have called themselves health care kamikazes, have made their own equipment.

New cases in Britain continue to grow, but officials have expressed optimism that the rate of growth in cases and deaths is slowing. The nation continues to report around 4,000 new cases each day, the vast majority of which are in England.\n\nPrime Minister Boris Johnson has issued a conditional plan to ease Britain out of its seven-week lockdown. In a televised speech, he said those who cannot work from home may return to work, and that people can freely exercise and spend time outdoors. However, a mandatory quarantine on travelers who fly into the country was also put in place.\n\nBritain waited until March 23 to impose a national lockdown, later than other European countries, following a debate over how aggressively it should try to curb the spread of the virus. It also got a slow start in testing and contact tracing, with frontline doctors and nurses unable to get tested. As capacity increased, the British government extended testing eligibility to care home residents and staff, including those without symptoms. People over 65 and those who work outside the home with symptoms can also apply under new measures.\n\nBritains exit strategy hinges on low levels of infection throughout the country. A group of 100,000 randomly selected citizens will be asked to carry out at-home tests, providing data on how many people are infected and whether restrictions can be lifted. The British government will trial a new contact tracing app on the Isle of Wight, however concerns over potential privacy risks may discourage widespread use of the app.\n\nBritain will enforce local lockdowns to contain regional virus flare-ups after the country eases restrictions, and the National Health Service will begin use of remdesivir, an antiviral drug used to combat Ebola, that appears to improve coronavirus recovery time.\n\nHow Cases Are Growing\n\nOn April 29, the governments daily death toll included those who died of Covid-19 in hospitals as well as nursing homes for the first time, causing a large spike in the number of deaths reported that day.

Most important: Wash your hands often, and stop touching your face. If possible, choose a window seat. A study from Emory University found that during flu season, the safest place to sit on a plane is by a window, as people sitting in window seats had less contact with potentially sick people. Disinfect hard surfaces. When you get to your seat and your hands are clean, use disinfecting wipes to clean the hard surfaces at your seat like the head and arm rest, the seatbelt buckle, the remote, screen, seat back pocket and the tray table. If the seat is hard and nonporous or leather or pleather, you can wipe that down, too. (Using wipes on upholstered seats could lead to a wet seat and spreading of germs rather than killing them.)'	b'Coronavirus Cases Slow in U.S., but the Big Picture Remains Tenuous'	2020-05-16	['Julie Bosman', 'Amy Harmon', 'Mitch Smith']	['picture', 'wipe', 'slow', 'big', 'coronavirus', 'seats', 'clean', 'wipes', 'hands', 'remains', 'protect', 'seat', 'hard', 'surfaces', 'window', 'cases', 'tenuous']	b'If possible, choose a window seat.\nA study from Emory University found that during flu season, the safest place to sit on a plane is by a window, as people sitting in window seats had less contact with potentially sick people.\nDisinfect hard surfaces.\nIf the seat is hard and nonporous or leather or pleather, you can wipe that down, too.\n(Using wipes on upholstered seats could lead to a wet seat and spreading of germs rather than killing them.)'

But most fail to meet criteria recommended by the Trump administration to resume business and social activities.\n\nThe White Houses guidelines are nonbinding and ultimately leave states fates to governors. The criteria suggest that states should have a downward trajectory of either documented coronavirus cases or of the percentage of positive tests. Public health experts expressed criticism because downward trajectory was not defined and the metrics do not specify a threshold for case numbers or positive rates.\n\nStill, most states that are reopening fail to adhere to even those recommendations: In more than half of states easing restrictions, case counts are trending upward, positive test results are rising, or both, raising concerns among public health experts.\n\nStates that have begun to reopen or plan to soon AK AL AR AZ CA CO CT DE FL GA HI IA ID IL IN KS KY LA MA MD ME MI MN MO MS MT NC ND NE NH NJ NM NV NY OH OK OR PA RI SC SD TN TX UT VA VT WA WI WV WY After weeks of shutdowns, 30 states have started or will soon begin to return to work and some parts of public life. Most of these states are reopening with more new cases or a higher share of positive tests than two weeks ago. The White House said states should have a downward trajectory of cases over a 14-day period before reopening. But most of the states reopening have actually had an increase of daily average cases in the past two weeks. If a state has not had a decrease in cases, the White House said it could still reopen if its share of positive coronavirus tests was lower than it was 14 days before. These states have a higher average share of positive test results than two weeks prior. If testing decreases though, positive results can decrease along with it. To follow the White House guidance, a state with a decreasing number of positive results should also have steady or increased testing. In South Dakota and Utah, reported testing has declined.\n\nThe White Houses guidance also indicated that before reopening, states should see a decline in the number of patients with symptoms consistent with the coronavirus and resume normal hospital capacities, but the general guidelines lacked specifics on how to measure the recommendations.\n\nIn recent weeks, public health experts have released estimates on the number of tests needed before a state can reopen safely, as well as its rate of positive results. Many states fail to meet that criteria as well.\n\nWith so many places opening up before we see indicators of meaningful, sustained transmission declines, there is substantial risk of resurgence, said Kimberly Powers, an infectious disease epidemiologist at the University of North Carolina at Chapel Hill.'	b'Most States That Are Reopening Fail to Meet White House Guidelines'	2020-05-07	['Keith Collins', 'Lauren Leatherby']	['reopening', 'meet', 'positive', 'guidelines', 'cases', 'results', 'states', 'reopen', 'public', 'fail', 'white', 'tests', 'weeks', 'house']	b'The criteria suggest that states should have a downward trajectory of either documented coronavirus cases or of the percentage of positive tests.\nMost of these states are reopening with more new cases or a higher share of positive tests than two weeks ago.\nThe White House said states should have a downward trajectory of cases over a 14-day period before reopening.\nBut most of the states reopening have actually had an increase of daily average cases in the past two weeks.\nTo follow the White House guidance, a state with a decreasing number of positive results should also have steady or increased testing.'
trusted	b'U.S. Coronavirus Death Toll Is Far Higher Than Reported, C.D.C. Data Suggests'	true	[]		trusted	[]	https://www.nytimes.com/interactive/2020/04/28/us/coronavirus-death-toll-total.html	https://www.nytimes.com/	b'Note: The 2020 lines in the charts are provisional data through April 11. The end of the first week of each month is labeled.\n\nTotal deaths in seven states that have been hard hit by the coronavirus pandemic are nearly 50 percent higher than normal for the five weeks from March 8 through April 11, according to new death statistics from the Centers for Disease Control and Prevention. That is 9,000 more deaths than were reported as of April 11 in official counts of deaths from the coronavirus.\n\nThe new data is partial and most likely undercounts the recent death toll significantly. But it still illustrates how the coronavirus is causing a surge in deaths in the places it has struck, probably killing more people than the reported statistics capture. These increases belie arguments that the virus is only killing people who would have died anyway from other causes. Instead, the virus has brought a pattern of deaths unlike anything seen in recent years.\n\nIf you look at the provisional deaths from all causes, death counts in New York, New Jersey, Michigan, Massachusetts, Illinois, Maryland and Colorado have spiked far above their normal levels for the period. In New York City, the home of the biggest outbreak, the number of deaths over this period is more than three times the normal number. (Recent data suggests it could have reached six times higher than normal.)\n\nHow reported coronavirus deaths compare with deaths above normal Numbers are from March 8 to April 11, 2020. Area PCT. above normal Excess deaths  Reported Covid-19 deaths = Gap New York City N.Y.C. +225% 11,900  10,261 = 1,700 New Jersey N.J. +72% 5,200  2,183 = 3,000 New York (excluding N.Y.C.) N.Y. (excluding N.Y.C.) +42% 4,200  2,425 = 1,700 Michigan Mich. +21% 2,000  1,391 = 600 Illinois Ill. +13% 1,400  682 = 700 Massachusetts Mass. +20% 1,200  686 = 500 Maryland Md. +15% 700  207 = 500 Colorado Colo. +16% 600  274 = 300\n\nIn New Jersey, deaths have been 172 percent of the normal number so far  more than 5,000 additional deaths, compared with an average count from the past five years. In Michigan, the partial death count is 121 percent of the count in a normal year, the equivalent of nearly 2,000 more deaths.\n\nThese numbers are preliminary because death certificates take time to be processed and collected, and complete death tallies from the Centers for Disease Control and Prevention can take up to eight weeks to become final. The speed of that data reporting varies considerably by state. In Connecticut, for example, where reported coronavirus deaths are high, the C.D.C. statistics include zero reported deaths from any cause since Feb. 1, because of reporting lags.\n\nWe compared these provisional death counts with the average number of deaths each week over the past five years. Public health researchers use the term excess deaths to describe a gap between recent trends and a typical level of deaths.\n\nIts difficult to know whether the differences between excess deaths and the official counts of coronavirus deaths reflect an undercounting of coronavirus deaths or a surge in deaths from other causes. Its likely a mix of both.\n\nThere is evidence, in New York and other places, that the official coronavirus counts are probably too low. Tests for the illness can be hard to get, and not all who die now are being tested, particularly if they die outside a hospital. New York City recently revised its own statistics for the number of coronavirus-related fatalities, saying thousands of additional deaths were probably because of Covid-19, even though no tests had been conducted.\n\nThere is also increasing evidence that stresses on the health care system and fears about catching the disease have caused some Americans to die from ailments that are typically treatable. A recent draft paper found that hospital admissions for a major type of heart attack fell by 38 percent in nine major U.S. hospitals in March. In a normal year, cardiovascular disease is the countrys leading cause of death.\n\nSome causes of death may actually be going down. There appear to be fewer road fatalities in California, as more U.S. residents stay at home, for example. It is possible that those reductions could cancel out coronavirus deaths in places where the virus is not yet widespread. But, in many states, any such reductions have been clearly outweighed by increases in deaths directly and indirectly related to the virus.\n\nDemographers often use measures of total deaths, sometimes called all-cause mortality, to evaluate the effects of natural disasters, where it can be difficult to trace particular causes.\n\nIn Puerto Rico in 2017, only 64 deaths were initially attributed to Hurricane Maria. But an analysis of the additional deaths showed the way that the disaster had, directly and indirectly, led to nearly 3,000 deaths over six months. The total included the immediate deaths from mudslides and drownings, but also sepsis, diabetes and suicides that came later as the power failure stretched on for months.\n\nCoronavirus is clearly killing more U.S. residents directly than any hurricane has, but it is also changing lives in ways that may also contribute indirectly to increased deaths  by overloading the health care system and discouraging people from seeking care.\n\nMeasures of total deaths are also commonly used in countries without detailed accounting of causes of death. Right now, they are the most useful tool, several epidemiologists said, for measuring the impact of coronavirus in the United States, too.\n\nIt gives you an overall sense of how big things are, said Samuel Clark, a professor of sociology at Ohio State University, whose work is in demography and epidemiology. For now, you can basically attribute the excess mortality to Covid-19. But you also grab all the things that are not Covid at all, but are probably created by the situation.\n\nRead more: How Severe Are Coronavirus Outbreaks Across the U.S.?\n\nAround the world, the coronavirus is bringing large waves of mortality. In Spain, deaths over the last month are 66 percent higher than normal, according to New York Times reporting. In Ecuador, they are more than 80 percent higher than normal. In Paris, more than twice as many people are dying every day as normal  far more than during a typical bad flu season.\n\nEventually, we will get more clarity about all of the reasons that people died this year. While no mortality statistics are ever perfect, the Centers for Disease Control and Prevention uses detailed death certificates to code the causes of death for everyone who dies each year in the United States. But that process typically takes more than a year to complete.\n\nFor now, total deaths are our best glimpse into the ways the coronavirus is affecting the normal patterns of survival.'	b'U.S. Coronavirus Death Toll Is Far Higher Than Reported, C.D.C.

Note: Five cities in Brazil are So Paulo, Rio de Janeiro, Fortaleza, Manaus and Recife.\n\nAt least 87,000 more people have died during the coronavirus pandemic than the official Covid-19 death counts report, a review of mortality data in 25 countries shows  providing a clearer, if still incomplete, picture of the toll of the crisis.\n\nOver the last two months, far more people have died in most of these countries than in previous years, The New York Times found. The totals include deaths from Covid-19 as well as those from other causes, likely including people who could not be treated as hospitals became overwhelmed.\n\nWhere we found higher deaths than normal Area PCT. above normal Excess\n\ndeaths  Reported Covid-19 deaths = Difference Spain\n\nMar. 16 - May 10 72% 43,700  26,570 = 17,200 U.S.\n\nMar. 25 - Apr. 25 23% 63,700  47,430 = 16,300 U.K.\n\nMar. 14 - May 15 56% 59,200  45,226 = 14,000 Italy\n\nMarch 49% 24,600  13,710 = 10,900 Ecuador\n\nMarch - April 84% 10,100  1,561 = 8,500 Five cities in Brazil\n\nMar. 29 - May 2 47% 8,300  3,322 = 5,000 Netherlands\n\nMar. 16 - May 10 38% 8,800  5,416 = 3,400 Jakarta\n\nMarch - April 43% 2,600  381 = 2,200 Thailand\n\nMarch 4% 1,800  12 = 1,700 France\n\nMar. 16 - Apr. 26 34% 24,300  22,708 = 1,500 Istanbul\n\nMar. 9 - May 10 32% 3,700  2,272 = 1,400 Moscow\n\nApril 18% 1,800  642 = 1,100 Peru\n\nApril 22% 2,100  1,021 = 1,100 Sweden\n\nMar. 16 - May 10 32% 4,300  3,594 = 700 Portugal\n\nMar. 16 - May 10 11% 1,800  1,135 = 700 Austria\n\nMar. 16 - May 10 8% 900  607 = 300 Chile\n\nMarch - April 7% 500  227 = 300 Switzerland\n\nMar. 16 - May 3 18% 1,600  1,473 = 100 Finland\n\nMar. 16 - Apr. 26 4% 200  190 = <100 Israel\n\nMarch Normal <100  20 = <0 Norway\n\nMar. 23 - Apr. 19 4% 100  158 = <0 Belgium\n\nMar. 16 - May 10 51% 8,500  8,800 = <0 South Africa\n\nMar. 18 - May 19 Normal <100  312 = <0 Denmark\n\nMar. 29 - May 3 3% 100  421 = <0 Germany\n\nMar. 16 - Apr. 26 3% 3,000  5,737 = <0 Note: Excess deaths are estimates that include deaths from Covid-19 and other causes. Reported Covid-19 deaths reflect official coronavirus deaths during the period when all-cause mortality data is available, including figures that were later revised. Reported Covid-19 deaths in Istanbul are estimated based on the governments statement that 60 percent of the countrys cases are in the city.\n\nThese numbers undermine the notion that many people who have died from the virus may soon have died anyway. In Britain, which has recorded more Covid-19 deaths than any country except the United States, 59,000 more people than usual have died since mid-March  and about 14,000 more than have been captured by official death statistics.\n\nDeaths in the U.K. 59,300+ excess deaths from March 14 to May 15 0 10,000 20,000 weekly deaths Jan. March Dec. Deaths in 2020 Expected deaths in 2020 Note: Recent data is provisional and may increase as more deaths are counted. Sources: Office for National Statistics; National Records of Scotland; Northern Ireland Statistics and Research Agency.\n\nMortality data in the middle of a pandemic is not perfect. In most places, the disparities between the official death counts and the total rise in deaths reflect limited testing for the virus rather than intentional undercounting. Officially, about 355,000 people had died worldwide of the coronavirus as of Thursday.\n\nBut the total death numbers offer a more complete portrait of the pandemic, researchers say, especially because most countries report only those Covid-19 deaths that occur in hospitals.\n\nWhatever number is reported on a given day is going to be a gross underestimate, said Tim Riffe, a demographer at the Max Planck Institute for Demographic Research in Germany. In a lot of places the pandemic has been going on for long enough that there has been sufficient time for late death registrations to come in, giving us a more accurate picture of what the mortality really was.\n\nThe differences are particularly stark in countries that have been slow to acknowledge the scope of the problem. In March and April, the Indonesian government attributed 381 deaths to the coronavirus in Jakarta. But over 2,700 people more than normal were buried in Jakarta cemeteries during those months, according to data from the citys Department of Parks and Cemeteries.\n\nEcuador recorded about 10,000 more deaths than usual compared to the same period in the last three years  about six times higher than the reported number of Covid-19 deaths in the country during that time. And in Istanbul, the city recorded about 3,700 more deaths than expected from March 9 through May 10.\n\nEcuador 10,100+ excess deaths from March to April 14,000 monthly deaths 7,000 Jan. March Dec. 2020 Expected deaths in 2020 Istanbul, Turkey No data 3,700+ excess deaths from Mar. 9 to May 10 No data 2,000 weekly deaths 1,000 Jan.

March Dec. 2020 Expected deaths in 2020 Notes: Data from weeks 1, 52 and 53 are excluded, as they may represent partial weeks.\n\nThese estimates were made for each country by comparing the total number of people who died this year to the number of deaths that would be expected given local mortality trends, adjusted to account for changes over time. The Economist is also tracking these deaths, known as excess deaths, in a similar way.\n\nIt is unusual for mortality data to be released so quickly, demographers say, but many countries are working to provide more comprehensive and timely information because of the urgency of the coronavirus outbreak. The data is limited and, if anything, excess deaths are underestimated because not all deaths have been reported.\n\nAt this stage, its a partial snapshot, said Patrick Gerland, a demographer at the United Nations. Its one view of the problem that reflects that most acute side of the situation, primarily through the hospital-based system.\n\nThat is likely to change.\n\nIn the next couple of months, Mr. Gerland said, a much clearer picture will be possible.\n\nA surge in deaths across Europe\n\nDespite the early data, many European countries have reported clear deviations from normal patterns of deaths, according to data released by the European Mortality Monitoring Project, a research group that collects weekly mortality data from 24 European countries.\n\nIn Italy, almost 50 percent more people died in March than the average for that month in the last five years, about 25,000 deaths more than normal in a single month.\n\nSpain 43,700+ excess deaths from Mar. 16 to May 10 9,000 19,000 weekly deaths Jan. March Dec. 2020 Expected deaths in 2020 Germany 3,000+ excess deaths from Mar. 16 to Apr. 26 13,000 26,000 weekly deaths Jan.

March Dec. 2020 Expected deaths in 2020 Italy 24,600+ excess deaths in March No data 37,000 74,000 monthly deaths Jan. March Dec. 2020 Expected deaths in 2020 Notes: Data from weeks 1, 52 and 53 are excluded, as they may represent partial weeks.\n\nIn some countries, like Belgium and France, authorities are working to include Covid-19 deaths outside of hospitals in their daily reports, or adjusting the overall Covid-19 death totals once a death is confirmed in a place like a nursing or retirement home.\n\nOthers, like Britains Office for National Statistics, have started to release mortality data after death certificates have been processed, confirming those that mention Covid-19. This provides a more accurate, if delayed, account of mortality than the hospital figures released each day by Public Health England.\n\nNot all countries have seen excess deaths\n\nIn a handful of countries there has been no clear sign of increased mortality this year. The reasons for this are varied and will become more clear in the months ahead as countries process and certify deaths.\n\nIn Norway, Denmark and Finland, demographers say the low mortality is due in part to a less severe flu season this winter  but also because these countries implemented early, severe restrictions to slow the spread of the virus when their outbreaks were smaller and easier to contain.\n\nIsraels coronavirus outbreak has been comparatively small and well-contained, with only 245 Covid-19 deaths recorded. Preliminary mortality data is only available through March, however, and could look different in April.\n\nAnd in South Africa, weekly deaths are lower than normal due to a drop in deaths from non-natural causes like traffic accidents and homicides, according to the South African Medical Research Council. It is also likely that it is still too early in the countrys outbreak to pick up a notable spike in deaths.\n\nNorway 100+ excess deaths from Mar. 23 to Apr. 19 1,000 weekly deaths Jan. March Dec. 2020 Expected deaths in 2020 Denmark 100+ excess deaths from Mar. 29 to May 3 500 weekly deaths Jan. March Dec. 2020 Expected deaths in 2020 Finland 200+ excess deaths from Mar. 16 to Apr. 26 1,000 weekly deaths Jan. March Dec. 2020 Expected deaths in 2020 South Africa Fewer than 100 excess deaths from Mar. 18 to May 19 4,000 9,000 weekly deaths Jan. March Dec. 2020 Expected deaths in 2020 Israel No excess deaths 2,000 4,000 monthly deaths Jan. March Dec. 2020 Expected deaths in 2020 Notes: Data from weeks 1, 52 and 53 are excluded, as they may represent partial weeks.\n\nAge breakdowns in mortality data will provide an even clearer picture of the role of Covid-19 in excess deaths. In Sweden, for example, a high mortality rate among men aged 80 and older accounted for the largest increase in deaths, suggesting that the overall numbers understate the severity of the outbreak for older people in particular.\n\nEven taking into account the new numbers, experts say the death toll to date could have been much worse.\n\nTodays rise in all-cause mortality takes place under conditions of extraordinary measures, such as social distancing, lockdowns, closed borders and increased medical care, at least some which have positive impacts, said Vladimir Shkolnikov, a demographer at the Max Planck Institute for Demographic Research. It is likely that without these measures, the current death toll would be even higher.\n\nRead more about the methodology and download data for excess mortality from The New York Times on GitHub.\n\nTo estimate expected deaths, we fit a linear model to reported deaths in each country from 2015 to January 2020. The model has two components  a linear time trend to account for demographic changes and a smoothing spline to account for seasonal variation. For countries limited to monthly data, the model includes month as a fixed effect rather than using a smoothing spline.\n\nSome countries have less historical data available. For countries with three or fewer years of data, the model uses a simple average of deaths in the observed years. For the United Kingdom, the model accounts for the number of bank holidays in a given week, since deaths are not registered during bank holidays.'	b'87,000 Missing Deaths: Tracking the True Toll of the Coronavirus Outbreak'	2020-04-21	['Jin Wu', 'Allison Mccann', 'Josh Katz', 'Elian Peltier']	['monthly', '16', 'toll', 'jan', 'coronavirus', 'data', 'missing', 'outbreak', 'expected', 'tracking', 'deaths', 'dec', 'excess', '87000', 'weekly', 'true', '2020']	b'Deaths in 2020 Expected deaths in 2020 U.S. 65,000 weekly deaths Jan.

But what if this come to me? This virus is very dangerous. It caught everybody off guard, including myself. I was never prepared for it.\n\nmichael barbaro\n\nFrom The New York Times, Im Michael Barbaro. This is The Daily. Today: One of the largest outbreaks of the coronavirus in the U.S. has been inside a meat processing plant in South Dakota. My colleague, Caitlin Dickerson, speaks with one of its workers. Its Monday, May 4th.\n\ncaitlin dickerson\n\nAs an immigration reporter, as soon as I hear that Covid-19 is starting to spread across the country, I start thinking about who are the most vulnerable people in this pandemic. And right away, meat and poultry plants come to mind. Because these facilities tend to be staffed by immigrants. Theres going to be a lot of pressure on workers to show up for work, because theyve been deemed essential by the federal government. And because of the nature of the work  the facilities are massive, and often you have thousands of people working at a single time, and they literally stand shoulder to shoulder. Theyre touching all the time.\n\nachut deng Hello? caitlin dickerson Are you there? Oh, shoot. You just dropped out. Something happened.\n\ncaitlin dickerson\n\nSo Im put in touch with a woman named Achut Deng.\n\ncaitlin dickerson Woo! We did it. achut deng Yes, we did. [LAUGHS] caitlin dickerson Just to start out, Achut, can you just kind of introduce yourself and tell us what work you do? achut deng So my name is Achut Deng. I work with Smithfield. We produce pork.\n\ncaitlin dickerson\n\nAchut is a shift lead at the Smithfield pork plant in Sioux Falls, South Dakota.\n\nachut deng And I am a lead person for one department, 8th floor conversion.\n\ncaitlin dickerson\n\nShe works in the conversion department, deboning and processing all different cuts of pork. Shes 35. And shes a single mom of three boys \n\nachut deng Give  give me a second, OK? My son just come in. Give me a second.\n\ncaitlin dickerson\n\n who are trying to get their homework done while we talk.\n\nachut deng Sorry. Im back. caitlin dickerson Youre back. Youre back. OK. So how did you come to work at Smithfield? achut deng Do you want me to go from South Sudan to Ethiopia to Kenya and to America?\n\ncaitlin dickerson\n\nYeah.\n\nachut deng OK. So yes, I was born in South Sudan. But then, when I was six years old, we had a terrorist attack in the village.\n\ncaitlin dickerson\n\nAchut was born in Sudan. And she became an orphan when she was six years old during the countrys civil war.\n\nachut deng And we walked to Kenya. And that was in 1990  in 1991 still.\n\ncaitlin dickerson\n\nShe grew up in refugee camps in Ethiopia and Kenya, where life was really hard.\n\nachut deng They created the school. But pretty much, people go and sit under the tree. Because there was no building or classroom or anything like that in the beginning.\n\ncaitlin dickerson\n\nHer school was a shady spot beneath a large tree, where children wrote their English lessons with sticks in the dirt.\n\nachut deng Yeah. It seemed like it was normal at the time, because we didnt have no  any other choice.\n\ncaitlin dickerson\n\nShe often went days without having food or fresh water. A lot of her friends died. She didnt know if she was ever going to leave. So she took life one day at a time.\n\nachut deng I would say it was just surviving. Because you dont know what would happen tomorrow, you know?\n\ncaitlin dickerson\n\nAnd then in the year 2000, her life changed completely.\n\nachut deng I got the news that I was going to get a second chance on life. Im going to go to the United States.\n\ncaitlin dickerson\n\nShe was chosen for a program that relocated Sudanese orphans.\n\nachut deng Oh, my God. It was the happiest feeling for me. I could not believe. I didnt go to sleep. The next day I went to school. I told my friends. Yeah.\n\ncaitlin dickerson\n\nShe moved to Kansas City, started a life in America. She graduated high school and started community college. And then she starts working as a waitress. And then, in her late 20s, doing private security.\n\ncaitlin dickerson And then, how do you get to Sioux Falls, South Dakota? achut deng How? You know, I always tell people I moved to Sioux Falls for a very stupid reason, thinking that I find a man. So that was pretty much a reason  a reason right there. [LAUGHING] I moved  I moved in with my younger sons father. Then we broke up. caitlin dickerson OK. And how did you hear about the Smithfield factory for the first time? achut deng He actually told me about it. Because before I moved here, I told him I cannot go a month without a job because a lot of people are relying on me, and most importantly, my kids. So and thats when he told me, oh, yeah. There is a company here, Smithfield. caitlin dickerson And when you were hearing about it, what were people saying? achut deng There was good things. Your start wages with Smithfield was $12.95. That is a very good pay. They have health care, health insurance. So a lot of people came to Sioux Falls because of Smithfield and what it was offering to people. I know a lot of Sudanese families came here because of Smithfield. So when I went and put in my application, right in there they told me, OK, youll start tomorrow. caitlin dickerson Wow. achut deng And I started as a Whizard knife operator. caitlin dickerson And for someone whos never heard of Smithfield or been to the plant, can you just walk through what exactly it is that you guys do there? achut deng So Smithfield  we receive live hogs, slaughter them, cut them into pieces. What I mean by that, by cutting off hams, legs, we make bacon, ham, even hotdogs, cheese hotdogs. We have them. Those are the things we do at Smithfield. So its the entire pig that come alive, turn into so many things afterwards. caitlin dickerson And what is a Whizard knife? achut deng Its a circle knife that goes into this electric thing. And you turn it off and on. caitlin dickerson And what is it used for? achut deng They use Whizard knife to trim off fat, from the loin until theres pretty much all meat. Just meat without fat.\n\ncaitlin dickerson\n\nSo picture a massive factory floor with giant chunks of pork zooming by on a conveyor belt. And Achut and the other Whizard knife operators are responsible for shaving fat off of the meat as it zooms past them.\n\ncaitlin dickerson How many pigs are processed there every day? achut deng 10,000 or more pig. caitlin dickerson Thats huge. achut deng Yeah.\n\ncaitlin dickerson\n\nAnd theyre responsible for 4 to 5 percent of all the pork thats produced in the United States.\n\n[music]\n\ncaitlin dickerson So when you first started, what did you think of it? How did it go? achut deng What did I think of Smithfield? Hard work. Hard work is what I thought of it. But youre not really thinking of how hard it is. You are thinking of money. You know? And everything that  once you get the paycheck you are able to pay for the apartment. You are able to put foods on the table. These were the thing that I was thinking, you know? caitlin dickerson What was it like for you physically in the beginning, starting out? achut deng Once you start doing something for the first time, something that you never done, your muscle is going to reject it. Your body is going to reject it. So I was always sore. I was always  my wrists was sore. My arm, you know, went numb. So after work, I would come home and put ice, like, on my shoulder, or my wrist, and then take ibuprofen. And I did that every night. caitlin dickerson Wow. achut deng Until one day, I went to first aid. And I talked to the nurse. And the nurse was very, very nice, outgoing. And she said, you know what, Achut? Let me give you this advice. You know, this job is a hard work. Its a very hard work. Youve been doing this Whizard knife for a year now. And your wrist is hurting, your arm hurt, your shoulder hurt. I would do one job for about a year, but after that, find another job. That way you have a rotation in your body.\n\ncaitlin dickerson\n\nSo she takes this advice. And over the next couple years, she starts moving around in the factory to different jobs. She eventually becomes a shift lead. And she starts working a lot of overtime  usually 11 to 12 hours a day, six days a week. But it really pays off. She starts to feel comfortable financially.\n\nachut deng I get paid $18.70 an hour. caitlin dickerson What has that higher hourly wage meant for your life? achut deng My boys, all three of them  I can give them what I never have, which is a better life at a young age. caitlin dickerson Uh huh. achut deng Last year, I took them to Disney World. Thats just something that  when I went there, I cried. But it was a tears of happiness. Im bringing my kids. I am American by papers. I bring my kids here. And that was something I did. I was so proud of myself.\n\ncaitlin dickerson\n\nBetween the new salary shes making and the overtime that shes working, shes able to move into a bigger apartment with her sons. And shes also supporting five family members who are still living in Africa.\n\nachut deng So this job offer me to take care for everybody else, not just my boys, you know? caitlin dickerson So youre basically supporting nine people on your salary from Smithfield? achut deng Yes. caitlin dickerson Wow. achut deng So thats why I pick up overtime regardless of me being tired. Every morning when I go to work, I put everything that the company offered me in order to make sure this food that Im making doesnt have anything that can go and harm someone. Because you know, these food are going to families. Its going to children. Its going to mothers. Its going to fathers, uncles, aunts, everyone around the world. Working at the meat factory, Im making food for people around the world. I think of that every day. caitlin dickerson It sounds like you take a lot of pride in your job. achut deng Yes. I do.\n\n[music]\n\ncaitlin dickerson Do you remember the first time you heard about the coronavirus? achut deng Yeah. I would say it was sometime in January, February. We just talking about it. Its kind of, like, its something that happened in China, and its going to stay in China. Then, come the beginning of March, it was Seattle. And then, the next morning I went to work. And now everybody at work is talking about it. But still  most of us, as refugees, immigrants, its, like  its probably, you know, people are maybe just being extra about it right now. Maybe its not that bad. caitlin dickerson Why do you think you reacted that way? achut deng For me, personally, Im, like, OK. If it becomes to effect, Im like, Ive been through so much. If this is just like a virus, youre talking to someone who had malaria, you know? I survived that. So its like, OK, if its going to be like malaria, I can go through it. Its just going to be like any other thing that Ive been through. caitlin dickerson But then, on Saturday, March 21, things start to change at Smithfield. achut deng When I went to work that morning, I saw a lot of people cleaning up the handrails, doors, bathroom doors with wipes. And then, Im, like, whats going on? And one of the people told me, yeah, this thing is serious, Achut. This thing is serious. But you know, Im thinking now, OK, 150 to 160 people in one shift. Youre sitting in the break room to where tables are very small. You have six people in one table. caitlin dickerson And then, later that day, she gets an email. achut deng That time was when I receive an email, a video, from the C.E.O.s, Smithfield C.E.O. archived recording (ken sullivan) Hi. Im Ken Sullivan, president and C.E.O. of Smithfield Foods. Id like to talk to you today about Covid-19, or coronavirus. achut deng So I watched the video from the C.E.O. about this virus is not coming from food. archived recording (ken sullivan) According to the F.D.A. and C.D.C., theres no evidence that Covid-19 can be transmitted by food. achut deng And America need food. Every family need food. We dont want people to struggle from hunger, let alone a virus. archived recording (ken sullivan)  American families. We feed millions of people every day, every single day. Its a business with no shortcuts and no days off. Most of our team members work side-by-side on production lines in our facilities. We cant stay home. We cant telecommute. Food, after all, does not get made on the internet. achut deng So our company is not going to get shut down. archived recording (ken sullivan) Were here. Were always here. Were a food company. And despite Covid-19, indeed, because of it, were working around the clock to do what we do best. And thats deliver good food responsibly. caitlin dickerson How did it feel to you to have your job deemed essential in the middle of a pandemic, when people all over the country are panicking? You know? Your work is deemed fundamental to keeping the country going. achut deng At one point, I was negative about it. At one point, I was, like, wow. Do that mean my life dont matter? And here I am, putting my life at risk coming to work, because people around the world need food. caitlin dickerson Uh huh. achut deng But I said, OK. Im just going to have to stay positive. And if people need food and Im able to do that for them, then Im just going to put my life to God to protect me and not get sick. So Im  caitlin dickerson Did you also consider just staying home from work and not going in? achut deng To be honest, I did not. I was just thinking of, no, I need this job. I need to keep working so I can support my family. And thinking about it now, its, like  it hurts. caitlin dickerson It hurts that you didnt think about yourself? achut deng Yes. [SNIFFLES] Yeah.\n\n[music]\n\nmichael barbaro\n\nWell be right back.\n\ncaitlin dickerson\n\nBy the end of March, hospitals across the country are being overrun by Covid patients. Governors start shutting down businesses and ordering people to shelter in their homes. But in South Dakota, there are still only a few Covid cases. And Achut is still going to work until Saturday, March 28.\n\nachut deng Now Saturday, my superintendents came up around, I would say, at about 3:00. And he said, OK, I want us to have a meeting. caitlin dickerson Uh huh. achut deng They asked me if I have any fever, cough, any, you know, shortness of breath. And I say, no, Im doing good. And he said one of the machine operator tested positive. I say what? caitlin dickerson Wow. achut deng That person  I worked with her that morning for, like, I would say, about 15 minutes. They said, OK, well, you got to go home. Because you had close contact with her. And Im, like, really? I didnt say it out loud, but Im thinking, theyre being silly. And thats when they told me youre going to be under quarantine for the next 14 days. caitlin dickerson Uh huh. achut deng But Im still going to get paid 40 hours. Is that enough for me? Its not enough for me as a person who do overtime. Overtime is, like, $500 extra. $500. That, for me, it covered a lot of things. What do I do? I cant go and get another job. But at that time, I was told its just two weeks. So Im, like, OK. Two weeks? You know, Ill be OK. Its still going to drop me back, one step backward. But I will be OK. caitlin dickerson Uh huh. achut deng And then, Monday night was when I got sick. Monday night, I went to bed feeling OK. I woke up about 2:00 a.m. with this sharp pain on my body. It just feel like someone stabbed me. So you know, I went to the bathroom. And I said, OK, maybe if I take a shower, a cold shower, its going to be better. So I turned the water on. And it just  when the water hit my body, it feel like a bunch of rocks was getting thrown on my body. So I turned the water off. I took the towel to dry myself and my skin. I just couldnt use the towel, my skin hurt. So like, OK, Im freaking out. And then, Thursday night, my body at this point is so exhausted. Even walking is, like, Im pushing myself. I just feel like something heavy sit right on my chest. Now the fear really kicked in, because now Im having problem breathing. I said, OK, its going to be better for me, Im going to stay up. I dont want to sleep. Because if I go to sleep, chances are going to be Im not going to wake up. Thats when I left my room. I came to the living room and just sat there. Because I said, OK, if I stay in my room and I die, I dont want my kids to find me dead in the room. caitlin dickerson What was that like for you emotionally? achut deng [SNIFFLES] caitlin dickerson I mean, whats going through your mind? achut deng (CRYING) I went right back to my childhood, to everything that Ive been through in life. But now, my kids  if I die, my kids will go through the same thing Ive been through. The loneliness, you know, not having anybody to check into, like a parent. Im thinking, I bring these kids to this world, I survive through everything that I went through. I said, I havent even had a chance to tell them they dont know their mom. They dont know what their mom went through. All they know is that my mom is a workaholic. She would do anything to give us a better life. Thats all they know. Its not a perfect world. Id make it perfect for them. But if I die, this world is not perfect anymore. caitlin dickerson It sounds like a horrible, horrible night. achut deng Yeah. It was. It was one of the worst night ever.\n\ncaitlin dickerson\n\nSo while Achut is at home, sick with the coronavirus, the situation at Smithfield is evolving.\n\narchived recording This Smithfield pork processing plant is now a coronavirus hot spot.\n\ncaitlin dickerson\n\nMore and more of her colleagues are falling ill.\n\ncaitlin dickerson How many other cases do you hear about among your colleagues? achut deng Oh, a lot, a lot, a lot. I think within the South Sudanese community alone, I think we have, like, at least 40 people that I know. But in my department, I was told that it went up to 80. In one department, 80 people. caitlin dickerson And how big is your department? achut deng On a good day that people showed up, its 155. archived recording 1 The outbreak at that Sioux Falls plant is among the worst clusters of coronavirus in the country. About 250 workers there tested positive for coronavirus. archived recording 2 350 workers tested positive for Covid-19.\n\ncaitlin dickerson\n\nAnd as the days pass, it keeps getting worse. The number of cases skyrockets up to more than 400 Smithfield workers who are sick. And the governor calls on the head of the company to stop production.\n\narchived recording One of the nations largest food processors, Smithfield Foods, will close its pork processing plant in South Dakota for further cleaning.\n\ncaitlin dickerson\n\nSo on April 12, the president of Smithfield announces hes going to close the plant indefinitely. And all the workers are sent home.\n\narchived recording This morning there were fears the nations food supply chain is at a breaking point, after more than a dozen major meat processing plants have become Covid-19 hot spots.\n\ncaitlin dickerson\n\nMeanwhile, food processing plants across the country are getting hit hard with Covid. Other major companies, like Tyson, start raising the alarm that theyre having trouble producing and delivering food to the nations grocery stores because of the virus.\n\narchived recording Meanwhile, President Trump announced an executive order to compel meat processing plants to remain open.\n\ncaitlin dickerson\n\nAnd last week, President Trump signs an executive order declaring meat and poultry plants as part of the nations critical infrastructure, as a way to pressure the plants to keep producing food. In Sioux Falls, the plant is still closed. Smithfield says it will continue to pay workers for 40 hours a week until they go back to work. And its speeding up plans to reopen the plant as quickly as possible. But thats also raised questions about whether it can do so safely.\n\ncaitlin dickerson How are you feeling now, physically? achut deng Physically, I feel, I feel good. Im still having a little bit of headache. But you know, thats, like, almost an everyday thing when you are a mom. And you know? So Im not freaking out over it. But my fever this morning is still at 100, and I have no idea why. Im just trying to get it down to like, 99 at least, before I call my doctor to go for a check in. But I cannot afford to stay home for a long time. I would give myself a month. And if it goes after four weeks, no. It wouldnt be good for me at all. caitlin dickerson It sounds like as soon as you start feeling better, your focus goes from your health back to your finances. achut deng Yes. That is correct. So now my focus is to try to take care of myself as possible, to where when this company opens back up, then Im ready to go. So thats where my focus is. caitlin dickerson Achut, thank you so much for talking to us about your experience. achut deng Youre welcome. And thank you very much for at least giving me the voice. A lot of people dont understand the living of the refugee camp. I dont take anything for granted because of what Ive been through. And because of what I see happening to other kids that did not make it. But Im pretty sure they are looking over me. They are watching me. And Im going to make them proud.\n\nmichael barbaro\n\nOn Friday, federal officials said they were investigating the conditions at the South Dakota Smithfield plant that may have contributed to the outbreak. So far, more than 1,000 infections and two deaths have been linked to the plant. Nevertheless, it is scheduled to partially reopen later today. Well be right back. Heres what else you need to know today. On Friday, the Food and Drug Administration granted emergency approval to the antiviral drug Remdesivir, making it the first government-sanctioned treatment for those with Covid-19.\n\n^archived recording\n\nNow that your company has this emergency use authorization, how quickly will the drug get to those people who need it?\n\narchived recording (daniel o'day) We are grateful and really humbled that everything has moved so quickly. You know, its only been \n\nmichael barbaro\n\nIn an interview on Sunday with CBS, the C.E.O. of the drugs manufacturer, Gilead, said he was working with federal officials to ensure that the first shipments of the drug reach Americas hardest hit communities and hospitals.\n\narchived recording (daniel o'day) And Margaret, we intend to get that to patients in the early part of this next week. Were beginning to work with the government, which will determine which cities are most vulnerable and where the patients are that need this medicine.\n\nmichael barbaro\n\nAnd \n\narchived recording (andrew cuomo) Were going to form a consortium with our seven Northeast partner states, which buy about $5 billion worth of equipment and supplies. That will then increase our market power when were buying.\n\nmichael barbaro\n\nSeven states said they would begin jointly purchasing medical equipment, from gloves to ventilators, to avoid competing with one another. And because the federal stockpile of such equipment is running out.\n\narchived recording (andrew cuomo) So this consortium, I think, will help us get the equipment and get it at a better price.\n\nmichael barbaro"""	b'South Dakota Meat Plant Is Now Countrys Biggest Coronavirus Hot Spot'	2020-04-15	['Caitlin Dickerson', 'Miriam Jordan']	['dakota', 'achut', 'hot', 'plant', 'coronavirus', 'work', 'spot', 'south', 'dickerson', 'biggest', 'going', 'caitlin', 'deng', 'know', 'im', 'meat', 'countrys', 'ok', 'smithfield']	b'achut deng So my name is Achut Deng.\nachut deng Do you want me to go from South Sudan to Ethiopia to Kenya and to America?\nachut deng OK.\ncaitlin dickerson And then, how do you get to Sioux Falls, South Dakota?\nachut deng They use Whizard knife to trim off fat, from the loin until theres pretty much all meat.'

But, as John F. Kennedy said, Remember with your actions. And today were saying we honor that service and were going to make sure that every government in the state of New York provides death benefits to those public heroes who died from Covid-19 during this emergency. I also believe the federal government should be doing the same: honoring the frontline workers, showing Americans that we appreciate what you did. That you showed up when it was hard.

It uses whats called a logarithmic scale  exponential growth at different rates will appear as straight lines of different steepness. The steeper the line, the higher the growth rate and the faster the total number of coronavirus deaths is doubling.\n\nAnother way of looking at the same information is to plot the growth rates directly. With epidemics, these rates are often more important than the current totals. A reading of 40 percent on the chart below means that, on average, the number of deaths has been increasing by 40 percent each day. A reading of 100 percent would mean that cases were doubling daily.\n\nDaily growth rate of coronavirus deaths for selected countries Current doubling time, in days Notes: Growth rates are averaged over the previous week.

Testing rates for the virus differ so much that the number of positive results in a given country is not a precise barometer of how many people are afflicted. But deaths also lag infections substantially; evidence from China suggests that most patients who died from Covid-19 were infected for a month before their death.\n\nSee the spread of coronavirus on a map.\n\nThe data are drawn from The New York Timess aggregation of global coronavirus statistics. To make it easier to compare the trajectories of the epidemic by nation, the counts in the chart all begin with a countrys 25th death.

The virus so far has infected more than 153,000 at some 7,700 facilities.\n\nLong-term care facilities with at least one coronavirus case States that provide some facility data States that provide no facility data\n\nNursing home populations are at a high risk of being infected by  and dying from  the coronavirus, according to the Centers for Disease Control and Prevention. Covid-19, the disease caused by the coronavirus, is known to be particularly lethal to older adults with underlying health conditions, and can spread more easily through congregate facilities, where many people live in a confined environment and workers move from room to room.\n\nWhile just 11 percent of the countrys cases have occurred in long-term care facilities, deaths related to Covid-19 in these facilities account for more than a third of the countrys pandemic fatalities.\n\nA third of U.S. coronavirus deaths are linked to long-term care facilities. Cases in long-term care facilities All other U.S. cases 11% Deaths in long-term care facilities All other U.S. deaths 35%\n\nIn the absence of comprehensive data from some states and the federal government, The Times has been assembling its own database of coronavirus cases and deaths at long-term care facilities for older adults. These include nursing homes, assisted-living facilities, memory care facilities, retirement and senior communities and rehabilitation facilities.\n\nSome states, including Colorado, Illinois, Maryland, Nevada, New Jersey and South Carolina, regularly release cumulative data on cases and deaths at specific facilities. California, Massachusetts, Michigan and Ohio, among others, provide some details on the number of cases  but not on deaths. Others report aggregate totals for their state but provide no information on where the infections or deaths have occurred. About a dozen report very little or nothing at all.\n\nThe share of deaths tied to long-term care facilities for older adults is even more stark at the state level. In 14 states, the number of residents and workers who have died accounts for more than half of all deaths from the virus.\n\nThe Timess numbers are based on official confirmations from states, counties and the facilities themselves. They include residents and, in cases where reporting is available, employees of the facilities. Given the wide variability in the type of information available, the totals shown here almost certainly represent an undercount of the true toll.\n\nCases and deaths in long-term care facilities, by state State reporting comprehensive aggregate data Note: In New York, the case count is the same as the death count because the state only reports the number of people who have died but not the number of overall infections.\n\nBased on The Timess analysis, some 850 of the countrys 3,100 counties have at least one coronavirus case related to a long-term care facility for older adults.\n\nHover overTap on each county to see the number of coronavirus cases at long-term care facilities, as well as the total number of cases in that county.\n\nCases in long-term care facilities in each county No cases 50 100 500 Note: Not all states report facility-level data.\n\nThe New York Times is tracking the coronavirus at nursing homes and long-term care centers.

If so, wed like to hear from you.\n\nHere is a list of cases and deaths at long-term care facilities that have had at least 50 cases.

This page will be updated regularly.\n\n1. The Big Picture: New Cases and Deaths\n\nThe simplest way to track the progress of an outbreak is by seeing how many new cases and deaths are reported in a given area each day. For the United States as a whole, these counts appear to have peaked or are starting to flatten:\n\nNew cases per day United States 0 10,000 20,000 30,000 cases March April May 7-day average New cases New deaths per day United States 0 1,000 2,000 deaths March April May 7-day average New deaths\n\nUse the search box below to see this relationship for any metropolitan area in the U.S., here or in any of the tables below. (Weve set it to the New York City area by default.)\n\nx\n\nNew cases per day New York City area 0 5,000 10,000 15,000 cases March April May 7-day average New cases New deaths per day New York City area 0 500 1,000 1,500 deaths March April May 7-day average New deaths Metro and micropolitan areas are bigger than just the city limits of a given place  they often include the surrounding suburbs and exurbs.\n\n2. Where the Outbreak Is Worst Now\n\nThe metro areas with the most recent cases and deaths, relative to their population, in the last two weeks:\n\nNew cases, last two weeks Metro or micro area Growth in cases Recent cases Per 1,000 1 Gallup, N.M. flat or decreasing 561 7.76 2 Huntsville, Texas flat or decreasing 498 5.71 3 Show Low, Ariz. flattening 575 5.21 4 Sioux City, Iowa flat or decreasing 858 5.08 5 Vineland-Bridgeton, N.J. flat or decreasing 721 4.78 6 Yakima, Wash. flat or decreasing 1,194 4.75 7 El Centro, Calif. still growing 848 4.66 8 Racine, Wis. flat or decreasing 732 3.72 9 Laurel, Miss. flat or decreasing 314 3.70 10 Faribault-Northfield, Minn. flat or decreasing 241 3.62 11 Marion, Ohio flat or decreasing 221 3.39 12 Farmington, N.M. flat or decreasing 418 3.34 13 Salem, Ohio still growing 342 3.33 14 Fargo, N.D. flat or decreasing 770 3.14 15 Montgomery, Ala. still growing 1,162 3.11 79 New York City area flat or decreasing 27,242 1.36 0.5 1 2.5 5 10 20 New deaths, last two weeks Metro or micro area Growth in deaths Recent deaths Per 1,000 1 Milledgeville, Ga. flattening 32 0.60 2 Gallup, N.M. flat or decreasing 35 0.48 3 Farmington, N.M. flat or decreasing 31 0.25 4 Meridian, Miss. flat or decreasing 25 0.25 5 Reading, Pa. flat or decreasing 104 0.25 6 Laurel, Miss. still growing 19 0.22 7 Worcester, Mass. flat or decreasing 210 0.22 8 Trenton-Princeton, N.J. flat or decreasing 80 0.22 9 Sioux City, Iowa still growing 36 0.21 10 New Haven, Conn. flat or decreasing 174 0.20 11 Providence, R.I. flat or decreasing 328 0.20 12 Marion, Ohio still growing 13 0.20 13 Kokomo, Ind. still growing 16 0.19 14 Atlantic City, N.J. flat or decreasing 51 0.19 15 Hartford, Conn. flat or decreasing 225 0.19 31 New York City area flat or decreasing 2,497 0.12 0.025 0.05 0.1 0.2 0.3 0.4 Limited to areas with at least 50,000 people. Flattening means that the number of new cases is still increasing, but the rate of growth is slowing.\n\nHere, weve limited the window of cases to those within the last two weeks. Scaling those cases by the population of the area can help give a sense of the prevalence of the illness there and how strained a communitys health care system may be. Places with curves that are flattening or flat are likely to move down this list over time; those where new cases and deaths continue to increase are on track to move up. (Of course, case counts are subject to variable rates of testing  cases could fall in places simply because fewer tests are being done  so moderate changes in rankings on these tables may not always be meaningful.)\n\n3. Where Outbreaks Might Come Next\n\nThe virus has begun cropping up in new places as it spreads across the country. To identify places that could flare up next, its helpful to look not just at the number of cases but how fast they are rising.\n\nHighest avg. daily growth rate of cases Metro or micro area Recent cases Daily growth rate cases double every... 1 Huntsville, Texas 498 13% 5.6 days 2 Fayetteville-Springdale, Ark. 633 10% 7.1 days 3 Salem, Ohio 342 8% 9.1 days 4 Yuma, Ariz. 619 8% 9.4 days 5 Decatur, Ala. 154 7% 10.0 days 6 Chattanooga, Tenn. 751 7% 10.2 days 7 Abilene, Texas 180 7% 10.3 days 8 Tuscaloosa, Ala. 502 6% 11.7 days 9 Montgomery, Ala. 1,162 6% 12.9 days 10 Longview, Texas 115 5% 13.6 days 11 Valdosta, Ga. 201 5% 13.6 days 12 Winchester, Va. 249 5% 14.1 days 13 El Centro, Calif. 848 5% 14.8 days 14 Hickory-Lenoir, N.C. 363 5% 14.9 days 15 Omaha 2,288 5% 15.2 days 305 New York City area 27,242 0% 191.8 days 1 2 3 4 7 30 Highest avg. daily growth rate of deaths Metro or micro area Recent deaths Daily growth rate deaths double every... 1 Lumberton, N.C. 10 12% 6.2 days 2 Laurel, Miss. 19 11% 6.6 days 3 Fresno, Calif. 19 9% 7.9 days 4 Burlington, N.C. 12 9% 8.1 days 5 Racine, Wis. 17 9% 8.4 days 6 Kokomo, Ind. 16 8% 8.8 days 7 Sioux City, Iowa 36 7% 9.8 days 8 California-Lex.Park, Md. 11 6% 11.1 days 9 Providence, R.I. 328 6% 11.4 days 10 Tuscaloosa, Ala. 13 6% 11.7 days 11 Greenville, Ohio 5 6% 12.7 days 12 Lebanon, Pa. 14 5% 13.0 days 13 El Paso 32 5% 13.5 days 14 Utica-Rome, N.Y. 24 5% 14.5 days 15 Bowling Green, Ky. 16 5% 14.6 days 207 New York City area 2,497 0% 191.3 days 1 2 3 4 7 30 Growth rates are averaged over the previous week. Limited to areas with more than 250 cases and 50,000 people. The table showing the average daily growth of the death rate is limited to areas with more than 20 deaths.\n\nGrowth rates are useful measures in epidemics because they tell us whether things are getting better or worse. In places where the growth rate is high but the number of cases is relatively low, a community may still have time to flatten its curve before an outbreak becomes widespread.\n\nCommunities with a lot of cases and a high growth rate are on track to have a serious problem. A high growth rate on top of a large number of cases means that a still larger number of people are on track to become ill or die.\n\n4.

Figures are sorted by the difference between the number of cases or deaths in the two weeks ending seven days ago compared with the last two weeks.

This is The Daily.\n\n[music]\n\nToday: To contain the pandemic, the U.S. government has deliberately shut down much of the economy. My colleague Jim Tankersley on the result  the worst unemployment crisis in U.S. history. Its Monday, April 6.\n\narchived recording (dan rather) Good evening. This is the CBS Evening News. Dan Rather reporting. The newest government economic figures out today show that the recession has not found its bottom.\n\njim tankersley\n\nThe last time that the United States set a record for new unemployment claims was the fall of 1982.\n\narchived recording (dan rather) President Reagan persists in remaining optimistic.\n\njim tankersley\n\nRonald Reagan is president. The country is engaged in a battle against inflation  the rapid increase in prices that has just beset the economy for years. And the Federal Reserve, as part of that battle, has made the cost of borrowing money really high. And as a result \n\narchived recording (ronald reagan) My fellow Americans, in recent days, all of us have been swamped by a sea of economic statistics  some good, some bad and some just plain confusing. Tonight, in homes across this country, unemployment is the problem uppermost on many peoples minds.\n\njim tankersley\n\nAlmost 700,000 people lose their jobs in the span of one week and file for unemployment.\n\nmichael barbaro\n\nWow.\n\njim tankersley\n\nThat is a record.\n\narchived recording (ronald reagan) We can do it by slowly but surely working our way back to prosperity. That will mean jobs for all who are willing to work and fulfillment for all who still cherish the American dream.\n\njim tankersley\n\nAnd it stays a record for a long time. Stays through the next recession, even through the 2008 financial crisis. That remains the record  1982  until this March 2020.\n\narchived recording 1 The weekly unemployment numbers are in, and they are the biggest ever by far. archived recording 2 3,283,000 Americans filed for unemployment last week. archived recording 3 A health pandemic has become a financial pandemic.\n\njim tankersley\n\nThe third week of March of 2020, 3.3 million Americans file for unemployment in one week.\n\narchived recording And that is the equivalent of the entire city of Chicago.\n\njim tankersley\n\nThats a new record, and it lasts for exactly one week.\n\narchived recording The Labor Department is out with the jaw-dropping new numbers.\n\njim tankersley\n\nIn the following week, the fourth week of March, 6.6 million Americans file for unemployment. Which means in the span of two weeks, nearly 10 million workers in America file for unemployment benefits.\n\narchived recording In fact, the past two weeks all but eliminated the jobs created in the past five years.\n\njim tankersley\n\nWhat we hit in a single week in March this year was almost 10 times as bad as the worst week of 1982. 10 times.\n\nmichael barbaro\n\nJim, take us through the timeline of how we got to this staggering figure  10 million people losing their jobs and needing unemployment benefits.\n\njim tankersley\n\nSo back in late January, as the virus is spreading rapidly through China and starting to really play havoc with supply chains there, there start to be warnings that this could really hurt the United States economy. But policymakers, particularly inside the White House, are not raising huge alarm bells.\n\narchived recording 1 So you have one person on the line. So [INAUDIBLE] archived recording 2 OK. Welcome, everyone, and for those of you on the phone as well.\n\njim tankersley\n\nThe White House Council of Economic Advisers summoned a bunch of reporters for a briefing on February 18.\n\narchived recording Whats the biggest threat that you see out there?\n\njim tankersley\n\nAnd the acting chairman of the council, Tomas Philipson, who is a health economist by the way, told the reporters there, quote \n\narchived recording (tomas philipson) Lets talk about what I dont think. I dont think corona is a big a threat as people make it out to be yet.\n\njim tankersley\n\nI dont think corona is a big of threat as people make it out to be.\n\narchived recording (tomas philipson) So if you look at flu seasons in the U.S., its about 40,000 deaths every year on average. In 2018, it was 80,000 deaths.\n\njim tankersley\n\nIn that same interview at the White House, we asked, well, if youre not worried about the risk of the virus, what risks are you worried about?\n\narchived recording Whats the biggest concern that you have? archived recording (tomas philipson) I dont think  clearly, we dont have a lot of concerns.\n\njim tankersley\n\nAnd the White House economist basically said, nothing, we dont really think theres anything that could go wrong.\n\narchived recording (tomas philipson) OK. Thank you very much.\n\njim tankersley\n\nAnd White House advisers would keep that lineup for, I dont know, almost a month. I was having calls with White House officials who were saying, its not going to be that bad. Were not going to need government intervention. The big risk right now is the stock market is freaking out, but we think we can get it under control.\n\narchived recording Tonight, elected officials taking unprecedented measures to keep people safe.\n\nmichael barbaro\n\nAnd what happened once it became very clear that this couldnt be kept under control?\n\njim tankersley\n\nWhat happened is basically unprecedented in American history. Industries started shutting down one by one, sector by sector, county by county, and that led to all these layoffs.\n\narchived recording Life is about to look very different. So lets start with New York City, where nightlife is over.\n\njim tankersley\n\nThe first workers to lose their jobs are exactly the ones you could see being hit by the restrictions that governments are putting in place.\n\narchived recording Heres the full list of businesses being forced to close at 3 oclock this afternoon. Dine-in restaurants, cafes, coffeehouses, bars, taverns, brew pubs, distilleries, clubs.\n\njim tankersley\n\nRestaurants close, and bartenders and waitstaff lose their jobs. Governors order certain shops to close  most shops to close  and so retail workers lose their jobs.\n\narchived recording Movie theaters, indoor and outdoor performance venues, gymnasiums, fitness centers, recreation centers, indoor sports facilities, indoor exercise facilities, exercise studios, spas and casinos.\n\njim tankersley\n\nAlso, its things like tourism. No ones flying on airplanes anymore. So suddenly you see airline employees start to lose their jobs. If you work for a hotel in a destination, a resort, youre starting to lose your job. If you are someone who relies upon one of those workers whos lost their jobs  so say you are a house cleaner in Florida who works for someone whos an executive at a resort, and that executive loses their job. Suddenly they dont have money to pay a house cleaner anymore, and you lose your job. Its these ripple effects. And then they start getting into parts of the economy we might not necessarily expect: Day care workers, preschool teachers, law firms. Hospitals are serving coronavirus patients, but theyre not doing a lot of elective surgeries. So if you work in an elective surgery division, youre at risk or, in some cases, actually losing your job. All of these sectors are starting to lay people off. Even the places you might least think are vulnerable suddenly are.\n\nmichael barbaro\n\nSo this becomes a kind of wave, where people who are dependent on people who are dependent on people all end up getting squeezed and eventually are out of a job.\n\njim tankersley\n\nYeah, absolutely. And the wave is just going to keep going. Were going to see more and more people who can go to work, or at least work from home, who wont be able to because the revenue source that their business depends on is drying up. If youre a local newspaper and you depend on advertising from restaurants that cant be open, theyre not going to advertise. And so you are going to be stuck without any advertising, and youre probably going to start laying off people, which weve already started to see.\n\nmichael barbaro\n\nYou know, Jim, one of the most defining qualities of this whole moment is how fast everything has moved and changed, how quickly our whole reality has shifted. And the same is true here. I mean, has there ever been an example of peoples job security collapsing so quickly, not just the scale of it but the speed of it? I mean, one day, people own successful businesses. The next day, those businesses are closed. One day, I have a seemingly secure job, and the next day, I have been laid off.\n\njim tankersley\n\nYeah, weve never seen anything like this in modern America. Usually recessions spread kind of slowly. They take some time to work their way through various regions, or various parts of the financial system, or parts of the economy, to the point where economists often debate whether or not were in a recession well into the actual existence of the recession. But now, I mean, were a couple of weeks into this one, and no one disputes were in a recession. It is so fast. You go to bed one week thinking the economy works one way, and you wake up two weeks later, and not only does your industry not have a job for you, your industry doesnt really work anymore for the time being.\n\nmichael barbaro\n\nWow.\n\njim tankersley\n\nAnd then on top of how fast and severe that all is, you are left with this almost unimaginable before this thought, which is, were doing this on purpose. We are doing this because public health officials think the only way to survive a pandemic virus without losing hundreds of thousands or even millions of people to it, is to turn the economy off and then eventually try to turn it all back on again.\n\nmichael barbaro\n\nRight. This was the lesser of the awful possibilities that the U.S. had.\n\njim tankersley\n\nYes.\n\n[music]\n\nmichael barbaro\n\nWell be right back. Jim, now that we have explained that we have 10 million Americans applying for these unemployment benefits, can you walk us through what the typical process of applying for that looks like, and what someone would have gotten before this pandemic?\n\njim tankersley\n\nSo what happens is if you lose your job, you go to your state unemployment office and file a claim. You can often do that online. Sometimes you have to do it on a paper form, but you, depending on your state, get a benefit back that lasts about three months. Its meant to be a baseline, just something to tide you through. For example, if youre in California, it ranges between, like, $40 at a minimum per week to $450 at maximum. If youre in Pennsylvania, its about half your weekly wage that you were earning before, up to a maximum. And the way that the system is set up, you dont get as much as you would have made on your job, but you get something. Its supposed to be there as sort of an emergency safety net to keep you from getting evicted or going hungry before you find a new job.\n\nmichael barbaro\n\nGot it. And is that still the case during this crisis?\n\njim tankersley\n\nIts actually better during this crisis, thanks to the law that the president signed at the end of March  the CARES Act.\n\narchived recording (nancy pelosi) Last night, as you know, the Senate passed important legislation. Were very proud of the product.\n\njim tankersley\n\nWhat that includes  this was a big point of contention in the law, but that Democrats fought and got in.\n\narchived recording (nancy pelosi) We did jiu-jitsu on it, that it went from a corporate-first proposal that the Republicans put forth in the Senate, to a workers-first, democratic workers-first legislation.\n\njim tankersley\n\nIt includes enhanced unemployment benefits. That means that whatever you were going to get from the state, you get still, plus $600 a week.\n\nmichael barbaro\n\nWow.\n\njim tankersley\n\nYeah. Its a lot. Its a calculation meant to fill the gap between what you were earning before you were laid off and what you wouldve earned from unemployment.\n\narchived recording (chuck schumer) Every American worker who is laid off will have their salary remunerated by the federal government so they can pay their bills.\n\njim tankersley\n\nIt turned out to be too difficult for states to just calculate, OK, what was your wage, were just going to give that to you. So instead, the lawmakers just figured out the average gap for the average worker between what they would have gotten at their job and what they would have gotten in unemployment. That turns out to be about $600. So if you are, for example, a bartender and you earn about $15 an hour on average, which is a little more than $30,000 a year, youre going to end up getting more money out of your new enhanced unemployment check than you would have just regularly at your job. If you are, say, someone who works at a small manufacturer who is laid off because theres no demand now for your products, and you were earning a median salary in the country  a little more than $60,000 a year  then you are going to get about the same back in your enhanced unemployment check. And if youre like a manager of an office or a store thats had to close and lays everyone off and you earned, you know, $100,000 a year, youre not going to be getting really anything close to your full salary back, but you still are going to be getting back more than you would have under the unemployment system. The idea is, this does help you get by. Its just not going to fully fund the lifestyle you had before.\n\nmichael barbaro\n\nAnd how long do these enhanced benefits last?\n\njim tankersley\n\nRight now Congress has them set up for four months. I think theres going to be a lot of pressure to continue that if the crisis continues and this chill in the economy persists past four months.\n\nmichael barbaro\n\nJim, in your reporting, what has been the rationale for providing a level of unemployment benefit that is significantly greater than what states have traditionally offered in their unemployment benefits?\n\njim tankersley\n\nThe rationale is that this isnt a case where we are worried about dissuading people from looking for work. Usually, you dont want to give people, in the eyes of many economists, whats called a disincentive to work  too much money that will just keep them at home on the couch and not looking for a new job. But in this case, we dont actually want these people working. We want them to stay home. We want them to socially distance. We want them to be able to keep paying their rent and buying groceries and doing the things people need to do. But we have to make sure somehow that they get money to do that.\n\nmichael barbaro\n\nSo weve been talking about employees. How has the stimulus bill impacted or attempted to help employers?\n\njim tankersley\n\nWell, the government is trying to keep as many of those businesses still going and not bankrupt as possible.\n\narchived recording (chuck schumer) It will keep companies intact.\n\njim tankersley\n\nIts bailing out big corporations, and its offering loans to small businesses that can turn into grants if they use the money to keep employees on their payroll.\n\narchived recording (chuck schumer) But with our plan, since they stay on the payroll of their employer, as soon as the crisis is over, they all can come back together.\n\njim tankersley\n\nAnd this is actually an important point. Its probably almost certainly better for the government to subsidize employees staying on the payroll of their employer than to pay them unemployment benefits.\n\nmichael barbaro\n\nWhy?\n\njim tankersley\n\nWell, we worry about what happens once were through this crisis and we got to start the economy back up. What we dont want to see are a bunch of people left out of work and no easy way to get them back into jobs. One easy way to make sure they can get back to work is to keep them tethered to their employer in the first place. So you dont lose your job. Youre basically just getting paid by the government not to work for your employer who you still work for. Its a little confusing, but its really important.\n\nmichael barbaro\n\nSo its a little bit like unemployment benefits. But instead of giving money to someone who loses their job, it kind of goes through the front door in order to keep that person from losing their job.\n\njim tankersley\n\nYeah, it helps the employee not have to look for a new job. It helps the employer not to have to hire for that job again. And \n\narchived recording (chuck schumer) And because so many of them will be furloughed rather than fired, if they have benefits they continue.\n\njim tankersley\n\n if youre on the payroll of someone who offers health insurance, you keep that too. Which is something that, if you get laid off, you dont get to keep if you had employer health insurance. So there are a lot of benefits to it.\n\narchived recording (chuck schumer) And that means that company or small business can reassemble once this awful plague is over, and our economy can get going quickly.\n\nmichael barbaro\n\nJim, when it comes to these unemployment benefits and this stimulus package thats meant to enhance that benefit and keep people from needing it in the first place, how much money is there and how many unemployed people can this system absorb? I mean, when you see something like 6.6 million people applying for unemployment benefits in a single week, that makes me and Im sure many other people wonder how many people this system can handle?\n\njim tankersley\n\nIt may be a little crazy-sounding, but the money is probably not the issue for the next couple of months. The issue is how many people can actually get benefits when they need them. The system is just not built to handle this amount of demand for new benefits. Its like funneling all of the traffic of New York onto a country road and trying to figure out how to get every car through. So some states, weve already seen, are having to tell people to sign up for benefits on different days of the week based on the first letter of their last name. What were going to see, I think, going forward is a lot more of that. We know its a reason why some people who maybe would have signed up for benefits in the third week of March actually ended up signing up in the fourth week. And its a reason the first week in April is probably going to have even higher numbers of new unemployed than the last week in March. So new records, for a while maybe. And all of that adds up to tens of millions of people out of work, which will absolutely strain budgets  state budgets, federal budgets. But the issue is going to be how long do lawmakers have the time and the patience and the money, in particular from the federal government, to keep funding that while we wait for the suppression measures here to work and the virus to go away. That is the great risk here, is that we lose our nerve and lose the strategy and its all for naught.\n\nmichael barbaro\n\nJim, right now, everybody of course wants to know when this pandemic will be over and how we will know its over. But Im curious how we will know when this economic crisis is over.\n\njim tankersley\n\nI think were going to know the crisis is over when a critical mass of Americans feel safe going back to work, going out to eat, going back shopping. Every economist I talk to says this is a public health decision first and the economics will follow. Not just because we value human life so highly, which we do, but because if you dont have the confidence that if you leave the house youre not very likely to get a deadly illness, youre not going to keep going through the basic commerce that you did before. So once the infection rate drops or, I mean, quite possibly not until we actually have a workable vaccine, then we will start to see the real ramp up back to the economic activity we had before this pandemic hit. But the experts that I talked to say is that we were wrong to think about this as a trade off between human health and the economy.\n\nmichael barbaro\n\nHmm.\n\n[music]\n\njim tankersley\n\nThat they go hand in hand. That the more we are able to suppress the spread of the virus by suppressing the economy, the stronger the economy will emerge in the end. If we dont stick with this strategy, if we break out of it too early, if desperate people, the most vulnerable workers who need to eat, are forced to go back out and try to do their jobs to earn that living and they start infecting people again and infections and death rates spike some more, thats actually going to hurt the economy more than anything. Because it will undermine all of the confidence that people have left in the system for protecting them. So its really this very delicate, probably very slow process of building that confidence, figuring out exactly who has the virus and where its spreading and how its moving through the population.

The patient is a generally healthy 59-year-old man with high blood pressure. Just days before this image was created, he was asymptomatic. But now, those green areas show where the infection has damaged tissue in the lungs. For many, Covid-19 will be mild, but for others its deadly. This video is about the latter path: How the virus kills. Well start in China: 191 confirmed Covid-19 patients were in a hospital in Wuhan  54 died. Of those 54, 50 had a condition known as ARDS, Acute Respiratory Distress Syndrome. Its a condition that stops oxygen from reaching the organs. You have air hunger. It means that they cant breathe. Theres a very strong correlation between the people who develop ARDS and the people who die. ARDS is not unique to Covid-19. Its such a long list of causes: infection, people with H.I.V./AIDS. If you get into a big motor vehicle accident and sustain multiple injuries to multiple organs, that causes ARDS, SARS and MERS. Now, things that you inhale and that can be toxic can cause ARDS: household bleach, you know, war gases, mustard gas and phosgene. To the people who vaped THC that was contaminated with vitamin E acetate, and those patients were also developing ARDS. Heres whats actually happening when you get ARDS. When we breathe in air, oxygen goes down our windpipe and fills the lungs. Specifically, the small air sacs at the end of the lungs are the key to air exchange in the body. So thats why nature has created, or evolution has created, this very, very  the barrier is so thin. Its just a few micrometers in size. So the oxygen has to go through just a little bit of collagen, the cell that lines the alveolus, into the red blood cell. Once it gets into the red blood cell, then the blood takes it back into the heart and from there to the rest of the body. And this is the key to understanding why Covid-19 is killing people. That entire wall of the air sac gets damaged by the virus. Think of it like a thick layer of paint on the inside of the walls of a room or a thick layer of mold on the walls on the inside of the room. Thats what it looks like. As that wall becomes thicker, oxygen can no longer pass into the bloodstream, and your organs begin to suffocate. So if you are sick, you might be asking yourself: Am I on the mild path or the serious path? A good indication is whether you have severe shortness of breath and for how long. Those are indications the virus has progressed lower into the lungs. One small study of hospitalized patients in China found that zero to two days after development of symptoms, chest scans were coming back normal for more than half of patients. Keep in mind, these are patients that were sick enough to be in the hospital. But within three to five days after symptoms started, that flipped, and 91 percent of hospitalized patients had significant respiratory issues. As you progress beyond the seven to 10 days stage, thats when the ARDS seems to be developing. And once it develops, it develops rapidly fast compared to ARDS developing from lets say another cause. And these patients seem to be doing much worse over a relatively faster period of time. Many people have mild or even no symptoms with the virus. But the longer Covid-19 affects your lungs, the higher the risk of serious respiratory issues. And the longer youre on the ventilator, the less likelihood you will come off the ventilator. That is the blunt truth of this situation. When I saw this in our first patient, and you see the extent of the damage and how it affects both lungs and various parts of the lungs, and its much more striking even for somebody whos been in practice for almost 20 years. And thats what happened to this patient. Just about one week after being at our hospital, unfortunately he passed away. Really my goal of trying to get this out into the public is so that they understand the severity of the problem that were seeing, and why the social distancing and the flatten the curve, and every other hashtag thats come up in the past couple weeks, is just so, so important  is because this is a community-wide problem. Its a global problem, and its going to take a community solution. Right? Everybody has a role to play. And if youre not in the health care field right now, your role is to stay home. All right? Because again, the virus doesnt move on its own. People move. People transmit the virus. Gov. Cuomo: And the longer youre on the ventilator, the less likelihood you will come off the ventilator.'	b'Fever Checks and Quarantine Dorms: The Fall College Experience?'	2020-05-19	['Anemona Hartocollis']	['ventilator', 'checks', 'dorms', 'ards', 'covid19', 'fall', 'patients', 'youre', 'experience', 'air', 'patient', 'lungs', 'fever', 'virus', 'college', 'thats', 'quarantine']	b'Youre looking at a virtual reality image of a coronavirus patient at George Washington Hospital in Washington, D.C.\nWell start in China: 191 confirmed Covid-19 patients were in a hospital in Wuhan  54 died.\nSpecifically, the small air sacs at the end of the lungs are the key to air exchange in the body.\nAs you progress beyond the seven to 10 days stage, thats when the ARDS seems to be developing.\nCuomo: And the longer youre on the ventilator, the less likelihood you will come off the ventilator.'

The federal government has moved the tax filing deadline to July 15. You dont have to file your return or make payments until then. If you are owed a refund, youll still receive it as normal when you file your tax return, no matter when you submit it. Dont forget about your state income taxes: The American Institute of Certified Public Accountants is tracking state changes on its website. And there may not be any extension on your property taxes, according to an article by our colleague Ann Carrns; local governments are simply too hard up for money.\n\nHow to help. Well be adding more resources soon both for people who want to donate and those who may be in need of assistance from a nonprofit. Our colleagues have already written about ways to give away a stimulus check and online direct giving. The New York Timess Neediest Cases Fund has started its own relief campaign. Meanwhile, demand at food banks is overwhelming. You can find a local food pantry via Ample Harvests website, whether you are looking to give or seeking help for yourself.\n\nMany people with changed circumstances can get subsidized health insurance or change their current plan. Eleven states, including some hit hard by the coronavirus  like California, New York and Washington  have opened enrollment under the Affordable Care Act to allow laid-off workers to get subsidized health insurance. In May, the I.R.S. issued guidance for employers that want to allow employees to change health insurance coverage and flexible spending contributions without waiting until the usual open enrollment period. And here is a more general guide to getting or keeping insurance, with updates on very recent rule changes.\n\nShould you stop 401(k) contributions if you still have a job? Maybe not. Yes, market crashes are nauseating, especially if you have not experienced one. No one can say for sure when the market will stabilize, but time is in your favor: You have years  decades, even  to reap returns when the market rises again. Need another pep talk? Let Ann Carrns help here.\n\nConsumer lenders have offered to help. But some have been more generous than others. Heres a long list from the banking trade association, and heres Rons column on which lenders stepped up early to let people skip payments, with and without interest accruing. Since he wrote it, both Ally Bank and Bank of America have offered to allow borrowers to defer loan payments. Many credit unions, meanwhile, are offering assistance with loans, debt consolidation and other services.\n\nBuilding an emergency fund in an emergency. Its not easy, but even a cushion of $250 can help stave off disaster. Ann has some advice for how you can build up a little extra cash on hand.\n\nFinancial planners offer free advice to distressed individuals. Dozens of members of the XY Planning Network have offered to help people through phone consultations. The Financial Planning Association has its own list of volunteer certified financial planners, as does the National Association of Personal Financial Advisors.\n\nWhere to get Social Security help. The Social Security Administration is mostly closing its 1,200 offices for routine requests like help with benefit claims. Those requests should go through the agencys toll-free phone line, 1-800-772-1213, and its website. In-person assistance is still available for crucial services, like reinstatement of benefits and assistant for those with severe disabilities. Those seeking in-person help must call in advance. Mark Miller has details here.\n\nHow to prep for refinancing your mortgage. Mortgage rates are low right now, and refinancing is a good way to free up cash. But that means everyone else is trying to do it, too. Heres Rons guide to making sure you dont get kicked to the end of the line.'	b'Your Money: A Hub for Help During the Coronavirus Crisis'		['Ron Lieber', 'Tara Siegel Bernard']	['payments', 'hub', 'health', 'heres', 'offered', 'help', 'coronavirus', 'website', 'market', 'money', 'insurance', 'financial', 'crisis', 'taxes']	b'You can find a local food pantry via Ample Harvests website, whether you are looking to give or seeking help for yourself.\nMany people with changed circumstances can get subsidized health insurance or change their current plan.\nEleven states, including some hit hard by the coronavirus  like California, New York and Washington  have opened enrollment under the Affordable Care Act to allow laid-off workers to get subsidized health insurance.\nissued guidance for employers that want to allow employees to change health insurance coverage and flexible spending contributions without waiting until the usual open enrollment period.\nDozens of members of the XY Planning Network have offered to help people through phone consultations.'

trusted	b'How Bad Is Unemployment? Literally Off the Charts'	true	[]		trusted	[]	https://www.nytimes.com/interactive/2020/05/08/business/economy/april-jobs-report.html	https://www.nytimes.com/	b'The American economy plunged deeper into crisis last month, losing 20.5 million jobs as the unemployment rate jumped to 14.7 percent, the worst devastation since the Great Depression.\n\nThe Labor Departments monthly report on Friday provided the clearest picture yet of the breadth and depth of the economic damage  and how swiftly it spread  as the coronavirus pandemic swept the country.\n\nJob losses have encompassed the entire economy, affecting every major industry. Areas like leisure and hospitality had the biggest losses in April, but even health care shed more than a million jobs. Low-wage workers, including many women and members of racial and ethnic minorities, have been hit especially hard.\n\nIts literally off the charts, said Michelle Meyer, head of U.S. economics at Bank of America. What would typically take months or quarters to play out in a recession happened in a matter of weeks this time.\n\nUnemployment rate Source: Department of Labor\n\nFrom almost any vantage point, it was a bleak report. The share of the adult population with a job, at 51.3 percent, was the lowest on record. Nearly 11 million people reported working part time because they couldnt find full-time work, up from about four million before the pandemic.\n\nIf anything, the numbers probably understate the economic distress.\n\nMillions more Americans have filed unemployment claims since the data was collected in mid-April. Whats more, because of issues with the way workers are classified, the Labor Department said the actual unemployment rate last month might have been closer to 20 percent.\n\nIt remains possible that the recovery, too, will be swift, and that as the pandemic retreats, businesses that were fundamentally healthy before the virus will reopen, rehire and return more or less to normal. The one bright spot in Fridays report was that nearly 80 percent of the unemployed said they had been temporarily laid off and expected to return to their jobs in the coming months.\n\nShare of unemployed on temporary layoffs Source: Department of Labor\n\nPresident Trump endorsed this view in an interview Friday morning on Fox News. Those jobs will all be back, and theyll be back very soon, Mr. Trump said, and next year were going to have a phenomenal year.\n\nBut Diane Swonk, chief economist at Grant Thornton, said that such optimism was misplaced, and that many of the jobs could not be recovered.\n\nThis is going to be a hard reality, Ms. Swonk said. These furloughs are permanent, not temporary.\n\nMany businesses have indicated that employees can work from home throughout the summer, hurting sales at downtown restaurants. Meetings and conferences have been put off as well, reducing demand at hotels and other gathering places. And the longer the pandemic lasts, the more businesses will fail, deepening the downturn.\n\nThe broad nature of the job cuts, too, means it will take longer for the labor market to recover than if the losses were confined to one or two areas.\n\nThere is no safe place in the labor market right now, said Martha Gimbel, an economist and labor market expert at Schmidt Futures, a philanthropic initiative. Once people are unemployed, once theyve lost their jobs, once their spending has been sucked out of the economy, it takes so long to come back from that.\n\nShare of the population that is employed Source: Department of Labor\n\nCarrie Hines, a managing director at an advertising firm in Austin, Texas, had the kind of professional job  adaptable to working from home  that seemed insulated from the pandemics effects. But her firm worked closely with companies in the airline, hotel and amusement park industries. When their business evaporated as a result of the outbreak, it was only a matter of time before Ms. Hiness firm felt the impact. She was laid off April 20.\n\nI was shocked, she said. Ive never had a gap in work since college.\n\nMs. Hines and her husband are cutting back where they can, and they have canceled plans to send their three children to summer camp. I never imagined this kind of job market where the entire advertising industry has been crushed, she said.\n\nThe scale of the job losses last month alone far exceed the 8.7 million lost in the last recession, when unemployment peaked at 10 percent in October 2009.\n\nI thought the Great Recession was once in a lifetime, but this is much worse, said Beth Ann Bovino, chief U.S. economist at S&P Global.\n\nThe only comparable period is when unemployment reached about 25 percent in 1933, before the government began publishing official statistics. Then as now, workers from a variety of backgrounds found themselves with few prospects for quickly landing a new job.\n\nThe governments official definition of unemployment typically requires people to be actively looking for work, making the measure ill suited to a crisis in which the government is encouraging people to stay home. Some 6.4 million people left the labor force entirely in April, meaning they were neither working nor looking for work.\n\nJoblessness  by any measure  could be even higher in the report for May, which will reflect conditions next week. Some economists say the unemployment rate should fall over the summer as people begin to return to work. Several states have begun to reopen their economies, and others are expected to do so in coming weeks.\n\nMonthly change in jobs by industry\n\nBut with the virus untamed, its not clear how quickly customers will return to businesses. And epidemiologists and economists warn that if states move too quickly, they could risk a second wave of infections, imperiling public health and the economy.\n\nThat would stop people from shopping and cause austerity, Ms. Bovino said.\n\nFor businesses, the uncertainty about the path of the pandemic and about consumers response to it is making planning difficult.\n\nWhen Austin Ramirez heard about the new coronavirus earlier this year, his initial concern was for his supply chain. Mr. Ramirez runs Husco International, a manufacturer of hydraulic and electromechanical components for cars and other equipment. The company has a factory in China and receives parts from suppliers there and around the world.\n\nBy April, virtually the entire U.S. auto industry was shut down, Husco included. (The companys nonautomotive production continued at a reduced rate.) Mr. Ramirez said he didnt know when business would bounce back. His goal is to weather the storm.\n\nTheres no visibility or certainty on what the future demand is going to look like, he said. We cant build a business model that relies on there being a big recovery six months from now.\n\nWhile most of Huscos roughly 750 North American workers have been furloughed during the crisis, the company has mostly avoided large-scale, permanent job cuts. Mr. Ramirez said he expected that most of his workers would come back when he needs them.\n\nBut particularly in industries like retail and hospitality, layoffs that were initially temporary might not remain so as bankruptcies mount and business owners confront shifts in consumer behavior.\n\nMost forecasters expect the unemployment rate to remain elevated at least through 2021, and probably longer. That means that it will be years before workers enjoy the bargaining power that was beginning to bring them faster wage gains and better benefits before the crisis.\n\nJob seekers are going to have less leverage, said Julia Pollak, a labor economist at the employment marketplace ZipRecruiter. Were no longer going to see mostly employed job seekers browsing and looking for better matches and higher pay. Youre going to see job seekers desperate to pay the bills.\n\nResearch this week from economists at the ADP Research Institute, the University of Chicago and the Federal Reserve found that low-wage workers have suffered a disproportionate share of job losses in the crisis so far.\n\nRecessions always tend to affect employment for low-wage, low-skilled workers, but the magnitude of the difference between low-wage and high-wage workers, thats remarkable, said Ahu Yildirmaz, an economist at the ADP Research Institute and an author of the study.\n\nIbelis Gonzalez worked as a server for Ruths Chris Steak House in Jersey City, N.J., until she was let go in March. She is hoping her job will return when the chain reopens, but she knows there are no guarantees, as patrons may be hesitant to dine out at first.\n\nWe dont know if they will have a skeleton staff, said Ms. Gonzalez, who earned $600 to $800 a week, nearly all of it from tips. People may not have the money to go out and have a $100 steak.\n\nShe has been trying to file for unemployment insurance but hasnt been able to reach the states Department of Labor and Workforce Development. Im not looking for a handout; Im just looking for these benefits, she said. I dont have a dollar to my name.'	b'How Bad Is Unemployment? Literally Off the Charts'	2020-05-08	['Nelson D.

Like we knew  we knew it was coming. Today is kind of getting worse and worse. We had to get a refrigerated truck to store the bodies of patients who are dying. We are, right now, scrambling to try to get a few additional ventilators or even CPAP machines. If we could get CPAP machines, we could free up ventilators for patients who need them. You know, we now have these five vents. We probably  unless people die, I suspect well be back to needing to beg for ventilators again in another day or two. Theres a mythical 100 vents out there which we havent seen. Leaders in various offices, from the president to the head of Health and Hospitals, saying things like, Were going to be fine. Everythings fine. And from our perspective, everything is not fine. I dont have the support that I need, and even just the materials that I need, physically, to take care of my patients. And its America, and were supposed to be a first-world country. On a regular day, my emergency departments volume is pretty high. Its about 200 people a day. Now were seeing 400 or more people a day. At first, we were trying to isolate patients with cough and fever and be more careful around them, but we werent necessarily being extra careful around all the other patients. And then we started to realize that patients who were coming in with no fever but abdominal pain actually had findings on their X-rays and chest CTs that were consistent with this coronavirus, Covid-19. So someone in a car accident gets brought in and we get a CT scan of them, and their lungs look like they have coronavirus. We were seeing a lot of patients who probably had Covid, but we didnt realize. Ten residents and also many, many of our nurses and a few of the attending physicians got sick. The anxiety of this situation is really overwhelming. All of the doctors, its hard for us to get tested even if we want to, even if we have symptoms. Were exposed over and over again. We dont have the protective equipment that we should have. I put on one N95 mask in the morning. I need to have that N95 mask on for every patient I see. I dont take it off all day. The N95 mask I wore today is also the N95 mask I wore on Friday. Were always worried that well be out of N95 masks. Whats a little bit scary now is the patients that were getting are much sicker. Many of the young people who are getting sick dont smoke, theyre healthy, they have no co-morbidities. Theyre just young, regular people between the ages of 30 and 50 who you would not expect to get this sick. So many people are saying its going to be OK, everythings fine, we have what we need. And if this goes on for a month or two or three or five like it did in China, and were already this strained, we dont have what we need. I dont really care if I get in trouble for speaking to the media. I want people to know that this is bad. People are dying. We dont have the tools that we need in the emergency department and in the hospital to take care of them, and  and its really hard.'	b'Senate Passes Aid Package'	2020-03-25	[]	['n95', 'day', 'fine', 'patients', 'need', 'senate', 'sick', 'passes', 'aid', 'package', 'really', 'mask', 'dont', 'ventilators']	b'I put on one N95 mask in the morning.\nI need to have that N95 mask on for every patient I see.\nThe N95 mask I wore today is also the N95 mask I wore on Friday.\nMany of the young people who are getting sick dont smoke, theyre healthy, they have no co-morbidities.\nI dont really care if I get in trouble for speaking to the media.'

trusted	b'The Coronavirus in America: The Year Ahead'	true	[]		trusted	[]	https://www.nytimes.com/2020/04/18/health/coronavirus-america-future.html	https://www.nytimes.com/	b'michael barbaro\n\nFrom The New York Times, Im Michael Barbaro. This is The Daily. Today: As President Trump urges states to begin reopening their economies, a debate begins over when and how to end the lockdowns. Science reporter Donald G. McNeil Jr. on what that might look like. Its Monday, April 20. So Donald, we have come to you at just about every turn in this pandemic to understand whats next, and the portraits of the future that you have painted for us each time we talk have been strikingly accurate. You told us all the way back in February to prepare for lockdowns. Those happened. You told us to prepare for high death rates. You said that people we know would die, and that, sadly, has happened. You warned us of shortages of medical supplies. That too has happened. Just about everything you said would happen has more or less happened. So I want to turn to the next installment of this rolling conversation weve been having with you.\n\ndonald g. mcneil jr.\n\nOK.\n\nmichael barbaro\n\nAnd start with a question that I think is on everyones mind right now, which is when and how we start to reopen our society and what that would look like.\n\ndonald g. mcneil jr.\n\nOK. Well, look, Im not some dark angel whos simply looking into the future.\n\nmichael barbaro\n\nUnderstood.\n\ndonald g. mcneil jr.\n\nIm talking to experts. Im looking at the other pandemics Ive covered. Im talking to medical historians and making predictions based on data. And so I think a lot of people think that by May or June or August, were going to return to something like normalcy. But all the experts I talk to say, no, thats a fantasy.\n\nmichael barbaro\n\nWhy is it a fantasy?\n\ndonald g. mcneil jr.\n\nWell, because if we all tried to come out at once, everything would look cool for about three weeks. And a week or two after that the emergency rooms would start to fill again, and people would start to die again. Flattening the curve is a notion that people love, but when we say were flattening the curve, no, were plateauing at a very high level of the curve. That means a steady rate of deaths. So what we want is to see the lockdown last until we get back down to close to what the normal baseline rate of deaths is. And its going to be piece by piece. We might be able to let a certain number of people ride the subway each day. People still staying apart from each other. Were not going to be able to let people sit next to each other in football stadiums. Maybe the team will play on the field, and there will be some cameramen in the stands, but its not going to be the way it was before.\n\nmichael barbaro\n\nOK. So if theres not going to be any kind of single moment where the curtain goes up and life resumes, what does a lifting of these lockdowns start to look like?\n\ndonald g. mcneil jr.\n\nWell, the best description I heard of it was in an article. It was on March 19, by Tomas Pueyo, a writer in San Francisco. And it was called The Hammer and the Dance. And the hammer is the lockdown. There was no question of social distancing light. It was more like, bam, everybody has to go into their houses. But then, once you get the deaths down to a minimum, then you begin the dance. And the dance is dancing a little bit out, and opening up some of the restrictions and seeing, you know, how far can you let people go. And then you see what that does to death rates. And once the death rates go up, you have to go back and leave the dance floor and go into lockdown again. And it repeats again and again. And its dance in, dance out, dance in, dance out. And basically thats what the epidemiological models show we have to do.\n\nmichael barbaro\n\nSo in this scenario, tiptoeing back to normal happens, and if there is a resurgence in infections, then the hammer comes back down.\n\ndonald g. mcneil jr.\n\nExactly.\n\nmichael barbaro\n\nSo lets talk about what the opening starts to look like. Describe the dance.\n\ndonald g. mcneil jr.\n\nOK. So the dance is you have this whole list of things you can ask people to do. One of them being wear masks. Another one is sit six feet apart from your dining companions at a restaurant. So a restaurant that had 100 customers before now has about 10 customers in it. You have to cut down travel between cities, because people from a hot zone, like New York recently, could go to a cool zone and start infections. International travelers will have to be quarantined for 14 days so that were sure theyre not infected when they come in. So we will have to find restrictions on peoples movements that keeps them from getting too close and letting the virus spread again. Because when the virus spreads, deaths follow.\n\nmichael barbaro\n\nOK. Lets get a little more specific here. What does the dance mean for, lets say, schools?\n\ndonald g. mcneil jr.\n\nWell, schools is a big mystery, because we dont know much about the virus in children. Very, very few children get hospitalized and die. It happens, but its very uncommon. But the question is, how much do the kids get the virus and transmit the virus? Because if you open schools, the children may be fine, but the teachers wont necessarily be, and the childrens parents and grandparents wont be. So mayors and governors are going to have to decide, maybe were going to open school for two weeks and see what happens? Or maybe were going to let half the kids go to school this week but have them sitting six feet apart, and then next week the other half of the kids get to come to school.\n\nmichael barbaro\n\nAnd Donald, what about the typical workplace. From the way youre describing schools, it sounds like, at the very least, people at an office or a factory would need to be six feet apart. What else?\n\ndonald g. mcneil jr.\n\nWell, it depends on what you mean by the average workplace. Are you a construction crew? Are you an office, like The New York Times? Are you a factory? Are you a food processing plant? Everyone is different. And for those of us who work most of the day on computers, theres not a whole lot of reason to go back to the workplace. It may be more of a source of danger than any advantage you get from being there. Whereas if you work in a chicken processing plant, youve got to be near the chickens. So somehow theyre going to have to stretch out those chicken disassembly lines, so that people can do it safely without infecting each other. And theyll have to wear masks, and maybe therell be plexiglass between the workers. Theres lots of measures you can take, and theyre going to be different for every single workplace.\n\nmichael barbaro\n\nI want to talk for just a moment about geography, because I wonder if the scenarios youre describing would apply as rigorously in one part of, for example, the United States as another, based on issues like density or the cycle of this virus. There are many places in the United States that have been largely untouched by this virus. Or there are places like Washington state, where it seems the virus has turned a corner. So would this hammer and dance scenario apply in the same way to every corner of the country? Or could it be applied more lightly or more severely, based on density, based on number of infections?\n\ndonald g. mcneil jr.\n\nYes and no. Its a fantasy to believe that there are any parts of the country that are untouched by this virus. It is much more intense in some places, like New York and New Orleans and Detroit, but its everywhere. If you look at any map of cases, its certainly in every state. Its in multiple counties in every state. So its going to have to be different techniques developed, not just for every state in every county, but for every work situation, so that you are not transmitting virus to each other.\n\nmichael barbaro\n\nDonald, is the point of the hammer and the dance to avoid having the rest of the country get infected, or does it simply slow a inevitable version of mass infection but not prevent it?\n\ndonald g. mcneil jr.\n\nIt slows it down. A certain amount of infection is inevitable, because emergency workers are going to have to be at their jobs. Medical workers are going to get infected. Theres going to be a certain level of infection at all times, but you want to damp it down to the minimum. But all the models say that maybe 3 percent of America is infected by now. The other epidemiologists think maybe its 10 percent. That 10 percent is a pretty high guess. So that still leaves 300 million Americans uninfected. So were a country thats somewhere north of 90 percent susceptible. And each time we do the dance out and dance in, we chop a few more people off that susceptible list. A few of them are dead. A bunch of them become immune. But it only proceeds in fits and starts. Maybe we go three million at a time, three million at a time, three million at a time. Its not a fast process.\n\nmichael barbaro\n\nAnd how long do the experts you talked to say that this dance will need to occur? At some point, do we stop dancing and we just get to go back to normal?\n\ndonald g. mcneil jr.\n\nThe dance will end when we have a vaccine that we can all take, or if we have a prophylactic pill that will protect us all, like PrEP protects you from HIV. Or when so many of us would become infected  70-plus percent have become infected, and the virus dies out or slows down just because it cant find any new victims to infect.\n\nmichael barbaro\n\nMm-hmm.\n\ndonald g. mcneil jr.\n\nBut making a vaccine within 18 months is extremely optimistic. The record weve ever had for producing a vaccine is four years. That was a mumps vaccine produced back in the 50s. Weve got new techniques that speed it up, but some things cant be sped up. And then after we design the vaccine, we have to think about producing the vaccine. If we need 300 million doses of vaccine, or if we need two shots  if we need 600 million doses of vaccine  thats a gigantic undertaking. I talked to some vaccine production experts, and they said, the average vaccine plant in America makes 5 to 10 million doses. So weve got to find some way to make 300 to 600 million doses of vaccine, and we have to start planning now, even before the vaccine exists.\n\nmichael barbaro\n\nDonald, you just said that the record for making a vaccine is four years. Are you saying that there is a version of this where this dance, in the hammer and dance metaphor, goes on not for one year but something like four years?\n\ndonald g. mcneil jr.\n\nThats a kind of worst case scenario, as far as timing is concerned. Everything may get lowered in this. We may test vaccines in a way that we would think of as ethically unthinkable in normal times. We may go with somewhat lower safety standards for vaccines, because were facing a situation where life is dangerous. But yeah, the fastest human vaccine ever made was mumps. Four years, from start to finish.\n\nmichael barbaro\n\nSo I just want to be clear. Is there a world, according to the experts youre talking to, who say the world of tiptoeing out and coming back and realizing that theres a resurgence, and then tiptoeing back out again, that that could last years?\n\ndonald g. mcneil jr.\n\nYes.\n\nmichael barbaro\n\nAnd during that, the virus lasts? It doesnt die off in the hot summers?\n\ndonald g. mcneil jr.\n\nThere is zero evidence that this virus dies off in hot weather. The virus is circulating now in India, in Brazil, in Australia.\n\nmichael barbaro\n\nVery, very hot environments.\n\ndonald g. mcneil jr.\n\nExactly. Theres no evidence that its going to die out in the summer.\n\nmichael barbaro\n\nDonald, Im willing to speak for many listeners when I say that the idea of living in masks, with everyone sitting six feet apart, and the expectation that a viral resurgence might mean that even that becomes too risky and so everyone goes back under lockdown  that that could go on for years is really pretty depressing and kind of hard to wrap ones head around.\n\ndonald g. mcneil jr.\n\nI know. But if we dont go into a dance, means theres going to be more infections and more deaths.\n\n[music]\n\nmichael barbaro\n\nWell be right back. Don, during this period, it feels like not everyone is going to be on equal footing, in the sense that some of us will have been infected and will possess some kind of immunity to Covid-19, right? And many of us, of course, will not have been infected and will not possess that immunity. So how does that factor into this, give and take, this dance youre describing?\n\ndonald g. mcneil jr.\n\nWell, were already seeing this happen. There are a very small number of people now who are immune. And theyre very much in demand. Theyre in demand for their blood, because you can harvest antibodies from their blood. Theyre in demand for doing medical jobs that are dangerous, like intubating patients, because they can do it without fear of infection. Theyll be in demand for all sorts of other jobs, because they can travel anywhere. They can do face-to-face interactions with customers without any fear. And theyre going to be a special class in society. Therell be different standards, different ways of living for two different classes in society. So say youre an immune and Im not. I basically have to stay inside here in hiding, and Im depressed as hell about it. I have a granddaughter whos going to be born in June, and I sit here in my apartment thinking, I may not see her until shes two years old. And thats horrible to contemplate, but it may be a fact. Meanwhile, you, as an immune, could go visit my granddaughter or go out and take my job, or \n\nmichael barbaro\n\nNo one can take your job, Donald, just to be clear.\n\ndonald g. mcneil jr.\n\nNot a heck of a lot of people want my job. Therell be different standards, different ways of living for two different classes in society for a while. Its quite science fiction-y. Its kind of dystopian.\n\nmichael barbaro\n\nRight. That kind of a societal schism, right, between the immune and the still susceptible, it would seem to require a few pieces of firm knowledge. One is that theres a widespread ability to tell who is immune versus who is not, and the other piece of knowledge is that we know for sure that being infected confers immunity. So how do you resolve either of those?\n\ndonald g. mcneil jr.\n\nWe dont know those things yet. We dont know them for dead sure, but as Tony Fauci says, usually when you recover from disease, youre immune for a while. But we dont know how long the immunity lasts, because this disease has only been around since November at the earliest.\n\nmichael barbaro\n\nMm-hmm. Are there plans? Do you envision a universe in which people literally wear some sort of sign that they are immune and that that can be rigorously proven?\n\ndonald g. mcneil jr.\n\nYes. That is already beginning to take place. Germany is talking about issuing certificates, but you dont want something you can pass from person to person. So China takes peoples cell phones and has a QR code that you read as you come into the subway, you come into a restaurant, you come into any place where somebody can check your phone. And that readout tells the person looking at your phone that youre immune. So yeah, people are already thinking about this.\n\nmichael barbaro\n\nIn the scenario that youre laying out, immunity and the ability to show immunity would seem to be incredibly desirable and might create some very complicated incentives.\n\ndonald g. mcneil jr.\n\nYes. People are going to be tempted to become immunes and to do it the chickenpox party way.\n\nmichael barbaro\n\nWhat do you mean?\n\ndonald g. mcneil jr.\n\nTo deliberately infect themselves, hoping for the best, but that they emerge at the end of it as an immune. That temptation is going to be enormous.\n\nmichael barbaro\n\nYoure describing deliberate and perhaps large scale acts of self-infection.\n\ndonald g. mcneil jr.\n\nYes. I am. There is a lot of historical precedent for that stuff. In the years before smallpox vaccine, people used to take pus from the blisters of smallpox victims, or dried up scabs from smallpox victims, and put the pus into  stab a little hole in their childs arm and put some of the pus in there, or blow the scabs into your nose. And that would give you a usually mild case of smallpox. And I talked to an immunologist who said, look, the child had about a 1 percent chance of dying, and the parents recognized that. And that was better, because if you had a smallpox epidemic come through, usually, about a third of the susceptibles died. So if you had six kids, you might think hard about giving them all a little bit of smallpox in their arm.\n\nmichael barbaro\n\nDon, what youre describing is a very calculated risk that some people may take to self-infect, and I wonder just how dangerous it may be if people miscalculate.\n\ndonald g. mcneil jr.\n\nWith the virus acting the way it is acting now, its very dangerous. We know that there are people who are more at risk, but we also know that its unpredictable  that young, athletic, healthy people, totally unpredictably, end up on a ventilator, and a few of them die.\n\nmichael barbaro\n\nRight.\n\ndonald g. mcneil jr.\n\nSo its people making life or death decisions for freedom.\n\nmichael barbaro\n\nAnd a paycheck.\n\ndonald g. mcneil jr.\n\nAnd a paycheck, yes.\n\nmichael barbaro\n\nEverything that youre talking about here seems to assume the absence of a successful treatment and a world where were pretty much waiting for a vaccine. Could that change? When weve asked you this question in the past, you have said that there wasnt a viable treatment. Do you have any sense that that may be changing and that a treatment might come before a vaccine?\n\ndonald g. mcneil jr.\n\nI dont have any sense that its changing in an important way. There is something that doctors place some hope in, and that is taking the blood from people whove recovered from the disease, and removing the red blood cells and the white blood cells and everything else and leaving just the antibodies. Those antibodies glob onto the virus and neutralize it, and so you can inject them into somebody whos sick. But its a technology that is not fast-moving, so its not in the immediate future. But scientists are hopeful that its in the mid-term future.\n\nmichael barbaro\n\nSo in other words, for the time being, we are left pretty much with the hammer and the dance as our most practical solution.\n\ndonald g. mcneil jr.\n\nExactly.\n\nmichael barbaro\n\nSo Donald, with everything that you just said in mind, I want to return to that first time we ever spoke. Because when we had that conversation, you were well ahead of anybody else in preparing us for what the pandemic would mean on a personal level. You told us about your stockpile of food, your month worth of medicine, and you told us that we should be prepared not to see our friends and our family for a while. And all of that proved prescient. But theres one area where I recall you, perhaps, underestimated something. You said be prepared for a couple of months of something that might look like a lockdown. And now, its feeling like its going to last a lot longer. So with that in mind, what preparations are you making now that the rest of us may end up making for ourselves in the coming days, weeks, months, to prepare for that new reality?\n\ndonald g. mcneil jr.\n\nIm busy. Im working harder than Ive ever worked hard before, and thats given me a sense of purpose. That gives me some psychological stability that a lot of other people dont have the luck to have. Im thinking about what am I going to do to entertain myself? Im thinking of buying a fishing rod and becoming one of those old guys on the piers whos fishing for bluefish. I like trout fishing, but it seems unlikely Im going to get away to do that for a while. So its just, you have to mentally prepare yourself for these things. And now be it said, I have visions for the future that are rosy, and that keeps me going too.\n\nmichael barbaro\n\nYou do?\n\ndonald g. mcneil jr.\n\nYeah. If you look at the periods after World War I and after World War II, not only did the economy come back after both those periods. Remember, after the one-two punch of World War I plus the Spanish influenza, we had the roaring 20s. After World War II, we had a period in which, in Europe, the war widows and pensions fund became the European welfare state. War profiteers suddenly faced higher taxes and a lot of scrutiny. People had pretty much had it with the rich by that time, and they wanted more. They wanted the G.I. Bill. They wanted federally-sponsored mortgages for housing. They wanted better health care. And to some extent, they got it. I was born in 1954, and my parents were of the generation that had made it through the Great Depression and through the Second World War. And they had a different attitude on life. They had a sense of, hey, we did this incredible thing. We did it all together. We got through it. I hope that sort of era comes again, that people will take more pleasure in small things in life. And that we will do more to make sure that we take care of each other, and that thatll go through all levels of society. And like I said, I try not to predict the future, but maybe something like that will emerge from this.\n\nmichael barbaro\n\nWell, of all the visions that you have given us, I like that one the best.\n\ndonald g. mcneil jr.\n\nMe too.\n\n[music]\n\nmichael barbaro\n\nDonald, thank you very much.\n\ndonald g. mcneil jr.\n\nThank you.\n\nmichael barbaro\n\nOn Friday, Vice President Mike Pence declared that states have sufficient amount of testing to begin the process of reopening their economies, a claim that governors in multiple states immediately rejected as untrue. Its not accurate to say theres plenty of testing out there, and the governor should just get it done. Thats just not being straightforward. In interviews on CNN on Sunday, the governor of Maryland, Larry Hogan, and the governor of Virginia, Ralph Northam, said they would need significantly higher levels of testing before they would consider lifting their lockdowns.\n\narchived recording (ralph northam) Thats just delusional to be making statements like that. For the national level to say that we have what we need and really to have no guidance to the state levels is just irresponsible, because were not there yet.\n\n[music]\n\nmichael barbaro\n\nWell be right back. Heres what else you need to today.\n\narchived recording (protestors) [CHANTING]\n\nmichael barbaro\n\nDemonstrators took to the streets in several states across the country over the weekend to protest stay-at-home orders that they said were destroying the economy.\n\narchived recording (protestor) I hope Whitmer understands that shes not just going to be able to rule Michigan like other politicians rule China or something like that. Were going to take our liberties, and were going to keep them, and were going to fight for them.\n\nmichael barbaro\n\nThe protests, which drew hundreds of people in Michigan, Texas and North Carolina, among other states, were largely organized by anti-government activists and libertarian groups, and were encouraged by President Trump, who took to Twitter to urge residents to liberate their states. But polling shows that most Americans support the lockdowns. A recent survey by Pew Research found that 66 percent of respondents feared that states would lift restrictions too quickly.\n\n[music]'	b'The Coronavirus in America: The Year Ahead'	2020-04-18	['Donald G.

I was in dental hygiene school, and he was in culinary school. And he was working at that cafeteria. My friends said that they have good food over there, and they wanted to go. And so we went over there, and he was a quiet guy in the corner doing his own thing. I said, excuse me, what do you have here that is good and healthy that I can eat? And he looks up, and he said, Nothing is good enough for you.\n\nmichael barbaro\n\nOh, jeez.\n\njasmine lombrage\n\nAnd then I turned to walk away, and he said, But if you come back tomorrow, Ill make something for you.\n\nmichael barbaro\n\nMm-hmm.\n\njasmine lombrage\n\nAnd I just kind of smiled and said, No, thank you. And I had a few friends who are like, Yes, were coming back tomorrow. So the next day, he made something for me. He made stir fry, and my friends  I had one of my crazy friends. She said  I said, Im not going to eat. I dont know if this guy is some kind of psycho or crazy and hes going to put something in my food. Shes like, Well, Im going to eat. If nothing happens to me in a few minutes, then you  you can try it. So thats what happened. And he came back and asked, how was everything? I said, it was good. And then we started talking. Then  no then he said Im going to be his wife, and I said, Im sorry. Thats not going to happen. You know, and he said, well, hes a praying man. He always gets his heart desire.\n\nmichael barbaro\n\n[LAUGHS]\n\njasmine lombrage\n\nYes, 10 years later, we ended up married.\n\nmichael barbaro\n\nSo when you  when you two met, you were a dental hygienist student. He was training to be a chef.\n\njasmine lombrage\n\nYes.\n\nmichael barbaro\n\nAnd so how did you end up in the food industry?\n\njasmine lombrage\n\nWell, growing up, my mom always cooked, you know, for many people. So it was always a passion. I grew up cooking also with mom and just family and aunts. We just  that was just something we did. And then Angel, my husband, Chef Angel, my husband, you know, we  he was the executive corporate chef that started Voodoo BBQ & Grill, which is a restaurant here in the South. And he was known as the Pitmaster. And so what we did, we started Jazz City then, Jazz City was a catering company. And we were  he was like, well, this is what I love to do. And we wanted to do something  we have two young kids. We know that, you know, you can work hard for anyone and everyone, but really, if you want to leave that  create something for your family, you need to create something so that it can stay down and passed down for generations and generations and possibly grow. And that is our goal is to have it grow and flourish. And we ended up here at the Bullfish, and Bullfish was already  it was a restaurant previously owned by someone else. And when we came here, we made it our own by bringing new menu items. And this is the only place you can come in Louisiana and find an authentic Caribbean and Southern fusion cuisine. What hes done, what Chef has mastered, hes taken the fresh herbs that we have in the Caribbean, and then hes merged it with the wonderful spices that we have here in Louisiana. And he  theres a fusion of jerk, fish, and Southern barbecue shrimp.\n\nmichael barbaro\n\nMm.\n\njasmine lombrage\n\nYes. And the paella  you know, Chef makes a paella with  you know, he uses scallops. And the crawfish, which is from Louisiana, he infuses that with the andouille sausage, and then he puts the shrimp in there and the crab meat. And so its just the different twist that he puts on all of the dishes. Its just magic in your mouth.\n\nmichael barbaro\n\nMm.\n\njasmine lombrage\n\nAnd I dont know if you heard the music in the background a little. We kind of use a lot of Caribbean kind of music from different parts of the Caribbean, and we play different music from here. The vibe is just so, I dont need a passport, but I can get away here. Does that makes sense?\n\nmichael barbaro\n\nMm-hmm. Its funny you keep calling your husband chef. Is that how you refer to him?\n\njasmine lombrage\n\nAt work, we keep it professional. At home, well, when we get in a car, its honey. But when were at work, we refer to each other  I refer to him as Chef, and he would just say whatever he had to say to me or, OK, yes, maam, and that would be it.\n\nmichael barbaro\n\nGot it.\n\njasmine lombrage\n\nYes.\n\nmichael barbaro\n\nAnd when did you take over the restaurant?\n\njasmine lombrage\n\nThat was last year, 2019, May 22, 2019.\n\nmichael barbaro\n\nOK. So just about  just about a year ago.\n\njasmine lombrage\n\nYes. And this restaurant, the Bullfish, it is personal for us, because our home is connected to the Bullfish.\n\nmichael barbaro\n\nHuh.\n\njasmine lombrage\n\nYes. So thats why this pandemic  I personally have spent many nights not sleeping, because I know our home is connected to it. Its not like we have 5, 6, 7, 20 locations. This is all we have. In our home, we have two kids. My daughter, my oldest, Gaby, shes autistic. I dont know  I mean, I dont know whats going to happen, but for now, shes depending on us to care for her. So as she grows, the home is  before we committed our home to the Bullfish  was part of the security blanket that we had. In the event something happened, she would have that.\n\nmichael barbaro\n\nTell me what you mean when you say that your home is connected to Bullfish. You mean physically or emotionally or what?\n\njasmine lombrage\n\nWell, whenever you get a loan, you have to give some kind of guarantee, like a personal guarantee. And thats what we did, you know. We took that leap of faith and decided that we were going to put 100 percent in here to make it work. So we have to make the Bullfish work.\n\nmichael barbaro\n\nSo if something were to happen to the restaurant, it would mean potentially losing your home?\n\njasmine lombrage\n\nYes.\n\nmichael barbaro\n\nAnd it sounds like that house is something you plan on passing on to your daughter, whos autistic.\n\njasmine lombrage\n\nYes, well, both of our girls, but we know her, at least, we can have somewhere for her in case she needed somewhere to be, and then we can have that there for her. That is something that always gets me emotional talking about, because \n\nmichael barbaro\n\nMm-hmm.\n\njasmine lombrage\n\n[CRYING] Im sorry.\n\nmichael barbaro\n\nI understand.\n\njasmine lombrage\n\nIts  you know, and shes standing in front of me looking at me now. And we want to do whatever it takes to make it work. You know, we just have to make it work. So when this pandemic started, it really gave us a scare, because if were not able to pay for everything, and we default on our loan, well, we understood the consequences, you know.\n\nmichael barbaro\n\nWas there a moment when you felt that you had really kind of made it with this place, having bought it and started to make it your own?\n\njasmine lombrage\n\nYes. About a month before the pandemic, we were like, yeah, this was a good choice. My husband and I, we usually go to early morning service for church, and afterwards, we came here for brunch. And then before we were open, we had people waiting outside for us.\n\nmichael barbaro\n\nWow.\n\njasmine lombrage\n\nIt was wonderful. And we were like, OK, wow, this is really going to work. This is really working. And wow, honey, this is our baby, and were going to grow it, and were going to be able to pay up the loan, and were going to be able to just blow this thing out of the park. And then the pandemic started. And yes.\n\nmichael barbaro\n\nWhen did you first start to notice that the pandemic was impacting the restaurant?\n\njasmine lombrage\n\nOK, early March  early March, because it was February was good with Valentines Day. Early March is when everything started changing, and as March went on, the governor shut down the state. This is when, you know, you started losing staff members saying theyre not coming out. I mean, you cannot blame them. We also started doing curbside delivery, and we were doing social media posts and putting up signs, handwritten signs offering discounts, letting people know that curbside pickup is available, just getting different yard signs made.\n\nmichael barbaro\n\nSo you have to put up signs in the windows or outside telling people, were still around, you just need to call in.\n\njasmine lombrage\n\nYes, yes, yes. And then about maybe the second week after the state was closed, we would be lucky if we got two people that would call for curbside pickup. And we would just be sitting here the entire day, 11 to 8, and theres no one that would come by or no one that would call. So then I started calling the restaurant phone a couple of times to make sure the phone was working, because it never rang. We were there for hours.\n\nmichael barbaro\n\nSo you called the restaurants main number with your cell phone just to see if it was working.\n\njasmine lombrage\n\nYes. [LAUGHS]\n\nmichael barbaro\n\nWow\n\njasmine lombrage\n\nAnd, you know, I started reaching out to third party  third party delivery providers to see if I can sign up with them, like Uber Eats and Waitr and DoorDash and ChowNow. And theyre charging  some of them are charging from 25 percent to 35 percent.\n\nmichael barbaro\n\nPer order?\n\njasmine lombrage\n\nYeah, thats your food costs. Yes. You know, in addition to that, were not able to buy in bulk anymore, because weve wasted so much food. Weve thrown away so much stuff, so now were having to go ourselves, Chef and I, to different mom and pop stores that are open, and were having to purchase items. Of course, now youre paying more money for them, because youre not buying the same quantity anymore, and youre buying from a local retailer. So, you know, and then we have a bar here, and we werent  no one was coming out to drink anymore, so that went away. So yeah, the pandemic, you know, its been hard on us.\n\nmichael barbaro\n\nMm-hm. Im so sorry.\n\njasmine lombrage\n\nYes.\n\nmichael barbaro\n\nSo with these delivery apps, these new sources of orders, how much money do you make off of any individual customer percentage-wise?\n\njasmine lombrage\n\nRight now, you dont, because the fact that were buying things from not just local distributors but smaller volume  were buying things in smaller volume, so our profit margin is smaller. So were basically not making anything. Youre keeping the doors open, but youre not making anything from it.\n\nmichael barbaro\n\nCan you give us a sense of where your daughters have been throughout this period? At what point was their schooling interrupted?\n\njasmine lombrage\n\nMaybe March. Angelle, when did school close? March or April?\n\nangelle lombrage\n\n[FAINT] It closed in March.\n\njasmine lombrage\n\nOK, school closed in March.\n\nmichael barbaro\n\nMm-hmm.\n\njasmine lombrage\n\nI used to bring my  I still do bring my two girls, so I can homeschool them, because school  they are out of school. So I use a corner of the restaurant, and I do schooling there for my girls. But it was a challenge. The change was not welcomed and open for the girls, especially my oldest, Gaby.\n\nmichael barbaro\n\nWhat do you mean?\n\njasmine lombrage\n\nYou know, with autism, everything has to be  you need to have something  everything scheduled and everything has a plan you need to follow through. And this whole pandemic kind of just went haywire for her in the beginning. She was not sleeping. She was more agitated. And my youngest, Angelle, she kept saying she wanted to go back to school, so I had to find other ways to help them. So \n\nmichael barbaro\n\nAnd Jasmine, I think I hear your daughters in the background. Is that right?\n\njasmine lombrage\n\nYes, you do.\n\nmichael barbaro\n\nDo you think there was a point where your daughters picked up on what has been happening for you and your husband, but beyond the stresses that theyre experiencing, you know, from not being at school and social distancing, that they understood that you and your husband are struggling with this business and struggling financially?\n\njasmine lombrage\n\nI think so. There is one incident. My daughter, my youngest, she  you know, she gets allowance, and someone gives her money or whatever. And she saved the money, and one day, she wrote a note. And then she left a note on the bed, on my bed. I was taking a bath, and I came out, and she had a note saying that, Mom, I know you and Dad are working really hard, and things are really tough. I have some money saved. I hope this helps for you to pay for stuff.\n\nmichael barbaro\n\nOh, wow.\n\njasmine lombrage\n\nYes. That was hard. That was hard.\n\nmichael barbaro\n\nHow old is this daughter who left you \n\njasmine lombrage\n\nAngelle was 8 when she did that. She just turned 9 in April. So she had a pandemic birthday.\n\nmichael barbaro\n\nCan I ask how much she gave you?\n\njasmine lombrage\n\nI think it was like $57 she had.\n\nmichael barbaro\n\nWow. And what did you do with it?\n\njasmine lombrage\n\nI still have it saved. I still have it there. I try not to use it. It was just such a touching moment, and just to see, you know, that they realize, kids realize more than you let them know. And knowing that theyre here like almost every single day with me, and \n\nmichael barbaro\n\nThey see everything.\n\njasmine lombrage\n\nYes.\n\nmichael barbaro\n\nHow bad are things, financially speaking, right now?\n\njasmine lombrage\n\nNot close at all to where we want to be. Not good at all. Not good at all. We have applied for a lot of, you know, small business loans, and were just waiting to hear back.\n\nmichael barbaro\n\nHave you been able to cover all the payments that you owe to the bank?\n\njasmine lombrage\n\nI havent. I think finance is one of the things people dont like to talk about, but I havent been able to meet a lot of  I had to ask for abatements. So well see what happens.\n\nmichael barbaro\n\nMm-hmm. I mean, do you think there is a situation that you could imagine using that money from your youngest daughter, that $57?\n\njasmine lombrage\n\nI dont want to  I dont want to, because its hers. Even though she gave it to me, its hers. I do not want  I dont want to.\n\nmichael barbaro\n\nRight.\n\njasmine lombrage\n\nI  Im just afraid to  Im just afraid to even think about a situation like that.\n\n[music]\n\nmichael barbaro\n\nWell be right back. Jasmine, for listeners who dont know what the rules are in Louisiana, what was announced earlier this week?\n\njasmine lombrage\n\nWell, restaurants  commencing Friday, you can, restaurants can be open for 25 percent of the capacity.\n\nmichael barbaro\n\nSo you can seat up to 25 percent of what would normally fit inside the restaurant. So how many people do you think that is?\n\njasmine lombrage\n\nWell, we can seat about 90 people comfortably in here. And so about 25 percent of that now is what were allowed to do.\n\nmichael barbaro\n\nSo if you can only put, you know, 20 or so people inside, can you make money?\n\njasmine lombrage\n\nI dont see how thats going to happen, to be honest with you, because 20 percent  having 20 percent of people inside the business is not enough to sustain, and I dont know how long thats going to go on for.\n\nmichael barbaro\n\nRight.\n\njasmine lombrage\n\nSo [SIGHS] its hard. Its a hard thing to digest right now.\n\nmichael barbaro\n\nBut you have decided that youre going to let people back inside?\n\njasmine lombrage\n\nHonestly, me, personally, no. So it is still an open debate. We  actually, after Im done with this interview, were going to sit down and weigh our options, the pros and the cons, and see if its something that we want to do.\n\nmichael barbaro\n\nCan I ask you what you see as the cons and the pros?\n\njasmine lombrage\n\nYeah, the pros  that, you know, well have 25 percent more revenue than what were seeing now. And then the cons is knowing that someone will  Im afraid that, oh, my god, somebodys going to come out, and theyre a carrier of Covid-19, and they infect somebody else. So I have no way of controlling that.\n\nmichael barbaro\n\nHave you heard from customers about their opinions on whether its time to go back inside the restaurant?\n\njasmine lombrage\n\nYes, I have. Ive had mixed reviews. We tend to ask customers, whenever theyre picking up or, are they ready for everything to open back up. Thats normally the question we would ask. And I feel that Im getting more nos than yes, though, in my opinion.\n\nmichael barbaro\n\nMm.\n\njasmine lombrage\n\nYes.\n\nmichael barbaro\n\nThose who have told you, Jasmine, that they do want to come out, what did they say is their reason for wanting to come out, to come back and eat in a restaurant?\n\njasmine lombrage\n\nThey want to get out of the house. You know, sometimes its just the fact that you cannot do something makes you want to do it.\n\nmichael barbaro\n\n[LAUGHS] Yes. Yes, the forbidden fruit. Yes.\n\njasmine lombrage\n\nYes. My point, thats exactly. Like, oh, you tell me I cannot eat this? OK, Im going to. So yes, thats what I feel Im getting.\n\nmichael barbaro\n\nI wonder, for you, if you didnt run a restaurant, would you go out and eat right now? Would you walk into a restaurant, sit down, order food?\n\njasmine lombrage\n\nI would probably go out on a weekday, because weekdays are usually less busy, because I have a child that has a compromised immune system. So Im usually very careful to go out. I dont want to take something home to her, so that would be another reason that I personally will not go out. And if I did go out, minus my daughters situation, I would have definitely found the seat  ask to be seated in the area that is far away from everybody else.\n\nmichael barbaro\n\nI mean its interesting to hear you say that, that you wouldnt want to go to a restaurant unless it was specifically at a slow time because of the health of your daughter, because youre talking about yourself reopening a restaurant. So its quite a weird conundrum.\n\njasmine lombrage\n\nYes, but its honest.\n\nmichael barbaro\n\nI just want to make sure I understand which of your daughters is immunocompromised.\n\njasmine lombrage\n\nGaby is.\n\nmichael barbaro\n\nIs that the daughter who is autistic?\n\njasmine lombrage\n\nYes, because she was a former premature baby. I ruptured at 14 weeks when I was pregnant with her, and she had a lot of health challenges. They said, you know, that Gaby would never walk, talk, see, or hear. She was not via  she does not have any viability of life, and that she would never make it out of the hospital alive, you know. We were told that we were making a mistake for her. She coded, and it was even pronounced, and she came back. And she had a trach before, and she was on a ventilator before. She was on oxygen for the first  almost the first four years of her life. You know, she started talking late, walking late, and she had to do therapy, and, you know, she had a walker. So she had a lot of challenges to see where she is now and where she came from. So Im always careful, you know. A typical cold for you and I is just a cold, but for her, it can lead to pneumonia, or weve lost her. Weve had her stop breathing a couple times, and nothing  I dont even know how to explain that.\n\nmichael barbaro\n\nMm. Given your daughters health, are you worried that youre going to basically be in the kind of situation it sounds like youre afraid of kind of all the time, because people are going to be coming into your restaurant, and they could potentially get you sick, and you could potentially get your daughter sick?\n\njasmine lombrage\n\nYes. You know, I dont know what I would do if I find myself bringing something to my child. So I find myself in a very difficult position as a business owner.\n\nmichael barbaro\n\nThat would be very hard to live with. I understand.\n\njasmine lombrage\n\nThat would  yes. You know \n\nmichael barbaro\n\nI mean, it sounds  it sounds like that \n\njasmine lombrage\n\n[SIGHS]\n\nmichael barbaro\n\n that has to  that has to be weighing on you as youre making this decision.\n\njasmine lombrage\n\nYes, it is. It is. It is. This is personal. This is not like, oh, OK, well, Im just going to open and make the money. Its not that situation for me. I have to be careful for it. I am responsible for her, and Im also responsible for my customers, making sure they have the best experience. And Im also responsible for my team that are coming to work. So \n\nmichael barbaro\n\nAnd youre also responsible for that house \n\njasmine lombrage\n\nYes!\n\nmichael barbaro\n\n that is connected to this \n\njasmine lombrage\n\nRight!\n\nmichael barbaro\n\n restaurant.\n\njasmine lombrage\n\nYes.\n\nmichael barbaro\n\nYeah.\n\njasmine lombrage\n\nSo my hands are tied. Like, yes. It  yes, Im just  Im just in a bind. Yeah, Im just in a bind right now. And say hi, Gaby.\n\ngaby lombrage\n\nHi.\n\nmichael barbaro\n\nHi, Gaby.\n\njasmine lombrage\n\nSay hi. Its OK.\n\ngaby lombrage\n\nHi.\n\nmichael barbaro\n\nOh, I want to see you on the video. Nice to meet you, Gaby.\n\njasmine lombrage\n\nCan you see her? I dont know how this works.\n\nmichael barbaro\n\nMm-hmm. I can see her. Yeah, shes got a great  shes got a leopard patterned sweater on.\n\njasmine lombrage\n\nYes. Are you going to talk?\n\ngaby lombrage\n\nHi.\n\nmichael barbaro\n\nHi. Gaby is waving.\n\ngaby lombrage\n\nHow are you doing?\n\nmichael barbaro\n\nIm doing well. Your mom was just telling us about you. She  she loves you.\n\njasmine lombrage\n\nYes. [LAUGHS] Yes.\n\nmichael barbaro\n\nShe loves you  she loves you very much.\n\njasmine lombrage\n\nI do. I love you, Gab.\n\ngaby lombrage\n\nI love you, too.\n\njasmine lombrage\n\nOK.\n\nmichael barbaro\n\nWell, that was  that was a nice gift.\n\njasmine lombrage\n\nYes, she walked up, so. [SIGH] Im sorry.\n\nmichael barbaro\n\nYeah, just give me a sec. Oof.\n\njasmine lombrage\n\nIm sorry. I didnt mean that \n\nmichael barbaro\n\nNo, I \n\njasmine lombrage\n\nHence the reason why Im torn up. For someone that was 1 pound, 3 ounces when she was born, she is like  shes like  I mean shes beautiful. Shes doing so well. And then this is so scary.\n\nmichael barbaro\n\nYeah.\n\njasmine lombrage\n\nThis is so scary, you know. And then its a hard decision. I  we dont open up, then to get customers to come in, were putting our house more at risk. We open up, and then something happens, then Im putting my childs life at risk. I dont want  I dont even want to be me right now.\n\nmichael barbaro\n\nYep. Im going to be really eager  were all going to be very eager to understand what decision you make. And I want you to know that we really enjoyed getting to know you and talking to you, and were rooting for you and for your family.\n\njasmine lombrage\n\nThank you. Thank you so very much. Thank you.\n\nmichael barbaro\n\nThank you, and please give our best to your husband and to the rest of your family.\n\njasmine lombrage\n\nThank you.\n\ngaby lombrage\n\nBye.\n\njasmine lombrage\n\nGaby says bye.\n\nmichael barbaro\n\nBye, Gaby.\n\njasmine lombrage\n\nSay bye.\n\ngaby lombrage\n\nBye.\n\njasmine lombrage\n\nOK, thank you, guys.\n\nmichael barbaro\n\nBye.\n\n[music]\n\nmichael barbaro\n\nOn Thursday night, after we spoke, Jasmine, her husband, and their staff decided that they would reopen their restaurant for indoor dining, starting on Tuesday. Well be right back.\n\n[music]\n\nmichael barbaro\n\nHeres what else you need to know today.\n\narchived recording (rick bright) Good morning, Chairwoman Eshoo and Ranking Member Burgess and distinguished members of the subcommittee.

Here are some suggestions for expressing sympathy clearly and supportively to the bereaved.\n\nEmail is fine, but avoid texting. In typical circumstances, a letter of condolence should be written by pen on paper and sent in the mail. But there is little that is typical about current circumstances. First, you may not have stamps available, though you can download postage from websites such as stamps.com, and print it from your personal computer. Or you may want to be sensitive to fears, justified or not, that paper sent through the U.S. Postal Service might be contaminated. (After collecting mail from a post office or home mailbox, wash your hands with soap and water for at least 20 seconds or use a hand sanitizer with at least 60 percent alcohol, the C.D.C. advises.) In this case, the act of sharing your sentiments is more important than the medium you choose. Still, if you opt for digital communication, email is preferable to text or direct messages. Many mourners save condolence letters and turn back to them at anniversaries and other times of reflection. Emailed letters are easily printed, filed and saved.\n\nLet them know how to reach you. Even if you send an email, you might include your mailing address or phone number so the mourner can get in touch at a later date if they want to.\n\nConsider tone carefully. Avoid emoji and other digital flourishes. You dont want to be stuffy or stiff, but its OK to convey an air of solemnity, even as you express personal warmth. Instead of just stating the name of the recipient, as you might while dashing off a quick email or text, open the letter with a formality (Dear Katie instead of Hey there or Katie) that matches the seriousness of the occasion.\n\nBe direct. This isnt the time for small talk or meandering introductions. Start with the reason you are writing. I was so sorry to learn of the death of your mother.\n\nBe gentle. This leads to an important consideration, which is whether to use the word death or to instead choose a phrase like passed away. Guides to effective writing encourage avoiding euphemisms but your recipient might belong to a culture or religion where they are customary. Loss can be a good compromise.\n\nBe specific. If possible, explain how you knew the person, how well you knew the person and the role that the person played in your life. This is important both for notes sent to people who dont know who you are (Your brother was my 5th grade teacher, and he is a big part of the reason that I became interested in science and went to nursing school) and to those who already know you (Your son was my best friend since high school and there will not be a day when I will not miss his optimism). If there are poignant memories and anecdotes you wish to share, go with the instinct. Dont shy away from funny stories. The reader likely could use the laugh and will cherish the memory.\n\nAcknowledge unfamiliarity. Some of the most comforting condolence notes are sent not because we knew and loved the deceased but because we care about the survivor. In this case, reflect on your affection for the person you are writing to as it relates to the death of their loved one. I have no doubt but that you made your father proud. As your friend, I so admire your sense of compassion and humor, and can only imagine how much joy you brought to your dad.\n\nBe forthright. If you and the person who you are writing to have had a complicated or adversarial relationship, its not a bad idea to nod to the existing tension and move on. I know we didnt always agree on the way things worked at the office, but I respected and admired the obvious love and closeness you and your daughter shared.\n\nAcknowledge current circumstances. Given the extraordinary ways that Covid-19 is interfering with end-of-life interactions and mourning rituals, it is appropriate to recognize this if youre moved to do so. It is always terrible to lose a loved one but the fact that you could not be at your husbands bedside to comfort him, and now cant benefit from being surrounded and supported by your extended family and community in your grief, is truly unfair.\n\nBrevity is fine. Dont be afraid to keep the message short.\n\nEmphasize ongoing mindfulness. To conclude, you might offer a wish for the future and if you intend to reach out again, let the person know. I am sending you and your whole family my wishes for peace. I will be in touch in the weeks ahead to see if you might be up for a phone call or even a visit, when we once again can indulge in simple gatherings.'	b'How to Write a Condolence Note'	2020-04-09	['Katherine Rosman']	['dont', 'sent', 'condolence', 'knew', 'loved', 'instead', 'write', 'important', 'note', 'letters', 'writing', 'person', 'know']	b'In typical circumstances, a letter of condolence should be written by pen on paper and sent in the mail.\nMany mourners save condolence letters and turn back to them at anniversaries and other times of reflection.\nIf possible, explain how you knew the person, how well you knew the person and the role that the person played in your life.\nSome of the most comforting condolence notes are sent not because we knew and loved the deceased but because we care about the survivor.\nTo conclude, you might offer a wish for the future and if you intend to reach out again, let the person know.'

Protester: Put that fist up  were all him. All lives matter. When that didnt happen on Thursday, some demonstrators escalated their tactics   while others tried to keep the peace. [shouting] Police scanner audio, and footage from outside the precinct, provide insight into what happened. The police shoot tear gas from grenade launchers. You want more of your people to die? You [expletive] coward. You want more of the people youre supposed to protect to [expletive] die? You [expletive] coward  [expletive] you! This back and forth with protesters continues for about an hour. Around 10 p.m., the officers begin evacuating the precinct. Crowd: No justice, no peace. Protester: Everybody get garbage  lets fill the cops place with garbage. Protester: Burn it! On Friday, one former officer was charged with murder and manslaughter in connection with George Floyds death.'	b'Special Episode: The Latest From Minneapolis'	2020-05-29	[]	['garbage', 'officers', 'shoot', 'protester', 'protesters', 'special', 'hands', 'expletive', 'episode', 'latest', 'george', 'peace', 'minneapolis', 'precinct']	b'Protester: Hands up, dont shoot.\nHands up  [explosion] The Third Precinct of the Minneapolis Police Department.\nAll lives matter.

This is The Daily.\n\n[music]\n\nToday: For the first time in history, a private company is sending astronauts into space. Science reporter Kenneth Chang on the dawn of a new era in space travel. Its Thursday, May 28. Ken, how many space launches have you covered in your career?\n\nkenneth chang\n\nIve forgotten. Because I started covering these at the end of the space shuttle era. So it was probably five or six then. And there was a few other scattered ones. And Ive actually made more trips than that. Because especially with the space shuttle, they would postpone the launch at the last second a gazillion times. So I would just fly in in, fly out, fly in, fly out, and not even see a launch.\n\nmichael barbaro\n\nBut if you had to guess, how many fly-ins and fly-outs have you made to try to watch a space launch?\n\nkenneth chang\n\nOh, Id say 20.\n\nmichael barbaro\n\n[LAUGHS] Thats a lot.\n\nkenneth chang\n\nYeah.\n\nmichael barbaro\n\nAnd thats where you are right now, when we say fly in, fly out, you are in at the moment.\n\nkenneth chang\n\nI am in. Im actually currently in a Hampton Inn in Titusville, which is 20 minutes from the Kennedy Space Center.\n\nmichael barbaro\n\nGive me the scene there in Florida at the Kennedy Space Center. I know youre not there, but youre soon to be there. Whats it look like right now?\n\nkenneth chang\n\nSo because of the coronavirus, NASAs basically limiting the number of people there. The visitors center, where the public usually gathers for the launch, is closed. So when I go there, Ill get to watch it. But Ill be outside the whole time and with a mask and at least six feet away from everyone else.\n\nmichael barbaro\n\nSo Ken, at this point, its about 1:20 p.m. Where are we in the countdown for todays launch?\n\nkenneth chang\n\nSo the astronauts have put on their space suits. Theyre about ready to get in a car to drive to the launch pad. And this is part of whats really different about this launch versus whats happened in past years from the Kennedy Space Center. In the past, it was NASA having the space shuttle and such. This time, it is a private company, one called SpaceX that was founded by Elon Musk, the billionaire who also operates Tesla, which is a company that makes electric cars.\n\nmichael barbaro\n\nSo whats happening where you are in Florida on Wednesday is that a private company is putting NASA astronauts into space on a privately owned vessel?\n\nkenneth chang\n\nYes. And this has never been done before. If you think, theres been three countries that have sent people to space: the United States, the former Soviet Union and now Russia, and China. And now you have this small company called SpaceX, which I guess is not so small anymore. But it is now joining these big nations to do something thats really hard.\n\nmichael barbaro\n\nKen, when I think of the space program, I think of it as the pride and joy of the United States. And I think of it first and foremost as a federal government program, NASA. So how did we get to this point where a private company has more or less supplanted NASA in sending astronauts into space?\n\nkenneth chang\n\nSo of course, at the beginning of the space era, you think of Sputnik.\n\narchived recording [RADIO SIGNAL BEEPING] Until two days ago, that sound had never been heard on this Earth. Its a report from mans farthest frontier \n\nkenneth chang\n\nThe Soviets sent a satellite up before the great, mighty United States did.\n\narchived recording  a radio signal transmitted by the Soviet Sputnik, the first manmade satellite as it passed over New York earlier today.\n\nkenneth chang\n\nThis spurred, of course, a lot of fear and worry in the United States.\n\narchived recording Is it possible that it is transmitting a code, not just a beep signal for radio listening? Yes, its quite possible that its transmitting a code.\n\nkenneth chang\n\nSo the United States started a major space program and created NASA to do things that would counter what the Soviet Unions were doing.\n\narchived recording The space age had begun.\n\nkenneth chang\n\nAnd so the first space missions, you just think of \n\narchived recording Shepard himself had been hauled up into the helicopter.\n\nkenneth chang\n\n you think of Alan Shepard, the first American to reach space.\n\narchived recording (john glenn) Roger \n\nkenneth chang\n\nJohn Glenn, the first American to orbit the Earth.\n\narchived recording (john glenn) A little bumpy along about here.\n\nkenneth chang\n\nAnd each of these baby steps that led to Apollo.\n\narchived recording (neil armstrong) Tranquility Base here. The Eagle has landed.\n\nkenneth chang\n\nAnd of course, Neil Armstrong walking on the surface of the moon.\n\narchived recording (neil armstrong) Thats one small step for man, one giant leap for mankind.\n\nkenneth chang\n\nThese were all events tied up in the identity of the United States as a nation.\n\narchived recording (richard nixon) This is the greatest week in the history of the world since the creation. The world is bigger, infinitely. I only hope that all of us in government, all of us in America, we can reach for the stars just as you have reached so far for the stars.\n\nkenneth chang\n\nAnd so that was the mentality that drove the space program through the 60s into the early 70s. And then after that, it was a transition to try to figure out what to do. Once weve gotten to the moon, how do we get to the next step? So NASA basically came up with three options to present to President Nixon. You could go for broke, you could start planning to go to Mars. Or you could build a space station and a space shuttle to go to the space station. Or you could just build a space shuttle. And Nixon chose just to build the space shuttle. That was the cheapest that he was willing to invest in. And so because the space shuttle did not have a space station to go to, it had to serve other purposes. One of them was that the military wanted to use it to launch spy satellites. Other people want to use it to run science experiments in orbit. And so this sort of became this pickup truck that was supposed to do all these different chores for different parts of the federal government. It ended up being a technological marvel that was not great at doing any one particular task.\n\narchived recording 8, 7, 6, 5.\n\nkenneth chang\n\nI mean, with the space shuttle, if you think about the launch, if you watch one, it was an amazing sight.\n\narchived recording 2, 1, [INAUDIBLE]. [LAUNCH SOUND]\n\nkenneth chang\n\nYou could hear the rumble as it goes up. But you could never get over just how bright the light from the engines are. It never does justice to see it on a computer screen or a TV. But it didnt capture the imagination of people like going to the moon did for Apollo. Tasks were not the grand dreams that fueled the Space Age.\n\nmichael barbaro\n\nSo what happens to this kind of underwhelming NASA space program that youre describing?\n\nkenneth chang\n\nThe space shuttles were actually designed to be run almost like a commercial enterprise. They were reusable. The thought was that they could land and fly very quickly. And that they would fly often enough that the cost of a mission would be fairly cheap as NASA got better and better at running the shuttles. In fact, at various points, there were actually discussions that NASA would outsource the operation of the shuttles to a private company.\n\nmichael barbaro\n\nHm.\n\nkenneth chang\n\nThose didnt happen.\n\narchived recording We have main engine start  4, 3, 2, 1, and liftoff, liftoff of the 25th space shuttle mission. And it has cleared the tower.\n\nkenneth chang\n\nBecause first, in 1986 \n\narchived recording 1 The engines throttling up. Three engines and now at 104 percent. archived recording 2 Challenger, go with throttle up.\n\nkenneth chang\n\nThere was a Challenger accident where the shuttle disintegrated during launch.\n\narchived recording We have a report from the flight dynamics officer that the vehicle has exploded. Flight director confirms that. We are looking at checking with the recovery forces.\n\nkenneth chang\n\nAnd it killed Christa McAuliffe, the teacher who was aboard.\n\narchived recording President Reagan has declared a week of mourning for the seven astronauts  five men and two women  who lost their lives on their way into space this morning.\n\nkenneth chang\n\nAnd this was a huge setback. And NASA had to go back and fix the design. And then they became very careful to make sure that it was safe enough for the astronauts. And of course, once youre very careful about safety, youre safer. But that means that everything costs more, everything is slower. And this piece of the space shuttle program continued. Then in 2003, there was another accident.\n\narchived recording A few minutes ago, it was about eight oclock, the space shuttle Columbia was going over north Texas.\n\nkenneth chang\n\nColumbia, it was actually on a mission conducting some science experiments. And \n\narchived recording Youll notice here it looks like you can see pieces of the shuttle coming off.\n\nkenneth chang\n\n as it reentered the atmosphere for landing \n\narchived recording Some kind of objects leaving some kind of trail over the skies of North Texas.\n\nkenneth chang\n\n the structure of the shuttle disintegrated and the seven astronauts aboard died. And this was a turning point, for NASA and the country to decide going to space is dangerous. We are risking our astronauts lives to do something in space. What should we be asking them to risk their lives for?\n\nmichael barbaro\n\nMhm.\n\nkenneth chang\n\nAnd this soul-searching led to the decision that the shuttles were now too old, too complex, too dangerous to continue operating.\n\narchived recording (george w. bush) The shuttles chief purpose over the next several years will be to help finish assembly of the International Space Station.\n\nkenneth chang\n\nSo that there would be a few more flights, and then it will be retired.\n\narchived recording (george w. bush) In 2010, the space shuttle, after nearly 30 years of duty, will be retired from service.\n\nmichael barbaro\n\nSo after all these years of neglecting the space shuttles and running into safety problems, the decision is not to invest more in them, but essentially, to kind of walk away from the program?\n\nkenneth chang\n\nThats essentially what happened. But still, NASA needed a way to get its astronauts to and from the space station.\n\narchived recording Included in the White Houses two billion dollar budget is $850 million to help along commercial space ventures, like SpaceXs Falcon rocket and Dragon capsule.\n\nkenneth chang\n\nSo when the Obama administration came in, they took a look at what NASA was doing and decided that was an opportunity to get more commercial companies into this business of sending people to space.\n\nmichael barbaro\n\nAnd what is NASA thinking at this moment, as it starts to contemplate farming out travel to the space station?\n\nkenneth chang\n\nSo the thinking of the NASA officials were, we really want to go back to the moon. We really want to go to Mars. We want to go send astronauts off on new places where they can go look at things that we have never seen before. And because too much of the budget was tied up with the space shuttle, they wanted to find some way to spend less money on what they thought was routine missions, so that they could do something that was more exciting and could better justify what they were created to do.\n\nmichael barbaro\n\nGot it. So the thinking is: let a private company do the kind of grunt work of space travel. And that would free the federal government, NASA, up to do the grand explorations.\n\nkenneth chang\n\nThat was exactly the reason. And NASA chose two of them that they liked and decided to fund them. One was Boeing and one was SpaceX. And of course, NASA wanted both of these to be operational as soon as possible. It became a sort of friendly competition. Both companies actually ended up three years behind schedule.\n\nmichael barbaro\n\n[LAUGHS]\n\nkenneth chang\n\nAnd at this final time, SpaceX is going to be first. And Boeing is still, perhaps, a year behind.\n\nmichael barbaro\n\nSo SpaceX wins the competition.\n\nkenneth chang\n\nYes. There actually is a flag on the space station. So on the very last space shuttle mission, the astronauts left a flag there. And whoever was going to be on the first vehicle to get to the space station would capture the flag.\n\nmichael barbaro\n\nAnd so that will be SpaceX.\n\nkenneth chang\n\nYes.\n\nmichael barbaro\n\nOK. So Ken, I know you need to go actually watch this rocket launch. So we will let you go \n\nkenneth chang\n\nYes.\n\nmichael barbaro\n\n and talk to you once the launch is done and you are off deadline.\n\nkenneth chang\n\nIf I miss the launch, my editor is going to kill me. This was actually a conversation I had with my editor. [LAUGHS]\n\nmichael barbaro\n\nWell be right back.\n\narchived recording 1  we want to make that call. Because shortly after that, we will begin loading liquid oxygen onto the second stage. Standby. archived recording 2 We continue violate a couple different weather rules that we now do not expect to clear in time to allow for a launch today. And todays launch attempt, Launch Control would end the launch auto sequence and proceed to the launch abort auto sequence, please. archived recording 3 Launch abort has started. archived recording 4 And Dragon SpaceX, unfortunately, we are not going to launch today. You are go for 5.100. Launch scrub. archived recording 5 Weve heard the call from the crew. They have been informed. Launch director \n\nmichael barbaro\n\nSo Ken, its nearly 7 p.m. And things did not quite go as planned. What actually just happened down there in Florida?\n\nkenneth chang\n\nSo through the whole day, the weather looked really icky. It was raining. It was cloudy. And then, about an hour before liftoff time, the rain sort of cleared up. The clouds start thinning out. And it looked like, for a while, that they were going to actually be able to get the rocket off the launch pad. But then, at the very end, about 15 minutes before the liftoff time, the weather officer said were still red for launch. They called off the launch. And theyre going to try again on Saturday.\n\nmichael barbaro\n\nSo no launch on Wednesday, but perhaps a launch over the weekend?\n\nkenneth chang\n\nYes.\n\nmichael barbaro\n\nSo I want to talk about, Ken, this private company that, I guess, almost just put American astronauts into space  SpaceX. I mean, what was it about this company that attracted NASA to it and allowed it to get this coveted contract?\n\nkenneth chang\n\nSo SpaceX was this upstart small company. It was very ambitious. And they found ways to do rockets and such that was less expensive and faster than many of the bigger companies in the past. And I always described them for the longest time as the Southwest of the rocket business, Southwest Airlines.\n\nmichael barbaro\n\n[LAUGHTER]\n\nkenneth chang\n\nThey found efficiencies that other companies did not that has allowed them to find new markets and find ways to do things that werent a business model before, because it was too expensive and too slow in the past.\n\nmichael barbaro\n\nWhat are some examples, Ken, of ways that they inexpensively innovated and seemed to save a lot of money on this kind of a launch?\n\nkenneth chang\n\nSo in the very beginning, their engineering decisions were often driven by how things could be done efficiently. And this could have been as simple as recycling parts of their rockets. So if youve ever watched a rocket launch, the bottom part of the rocket, which is the first stage or booster stage, is the part that lifts up the rocket through the thick bottom part of the atmosphere. And it usually just drops away when its done after a few minutes.\n\nmichael barbaro\n\nRight.\n\nkenneth chang\n\nAnd for the longest time, this piece would just fall back into the ocean and be lost.\n\nmichael barbaro\n\nRight. And that sounds like a pretty expensive thing to just toss off into the ocean.\n\nkenneth chang\n\nIts a very expensive thing. Just each engine would be several million dollars.\n\nmichael barbaro\n\nWow.\n\nkenneth chang\n\nSo one of the things that, from the very beginning, Elon wanted to do was, we should try to use them again. And for a while, when they were trying to land these boosters, they would just crash and abort. And there was these fantastic explosions as the thing almost landed. And then, finally, they succeeded. They actually managed to land this booster back on the ground at Cape Canaveral. And then now, they do this almost routinely. For every SpaceX launch, you watch it go up, you see the booster drop off. And about 10 minutes after launch, you see it land vertically, almost like those rockets in those 1950s science fiction movies.\n\nmichael barbaro\n\nWow.\n\nkenneth chang\n\nIts amazing. This is where SpaceX went from being the Southwest Airlines to a true innovator in this field.\n\nmichael barbaro\n\nSo Ken, how much, in the end, does it feel like SpaceX has saved in terms of cost from what NASA might have paid to put someone into space a decade ago?\n\nkenneth chang\n\nSo the clearest comparison that we have is that before SpaceX came along, NASA had a plan to develop its own rocket and capsule for taking astronauts to the space station. And when that program was canceled, the estimated cost to do this would have been at least $20 billion dollars.\n\nmichael barbaro\n\nWow.\n\nkenneth chang\n\nNow SpaceX has a contract with NASA basically to provide the exact same service, so that all the development costs, plus providing some of the actual launches, for $2.6 billion.\n\nmichael barbaro\n\nWow. So a fraction of that $20 billion dollars?\n\nkenneth chang\n\nYes.\n\nmichael barbaro\n\nSaving that much money would seem like a tremendous boon for NASA, for the federal government, for the American taxpayer. Does anyone at NASA worry that something fundamental is lost when a private company  that is ultimately a business thats interested in making profit  is running a launch like this?\n\nkenneth chang\n\nI think theyre most excited about what the rocket does as opposed to who builds it and who operates it.\n\nmichael barbaro\n\nHm.\n\nkenneth chang\n\nI always remember the Saturn V rocket from the Apollo missions in the 60s, the most impressive thing thats flown to date. However, it wasnt because it was so big. Its because it went to the moon. Thats why we remember it. It doesnt necessarily matter whose rocket goes to the space station or ultimately takes people to the moon and beyond. Its that these systems, if they work well, they enable NASA and other agencies to go explore the solar system in new ways that we werent able to do before.\n\nmichael barbaro\n\nKen, is this ultimately a positive development that youre describing here, the privatization of space exploration? Which, I guess, at first blush, seems like something people might be worried about. Is it turning out that this is a very natural evolution of a process that began with the government creating a market, taking these serious risks and opening up to a more efficient private company, and that thats a pretty good progression?\n\nkenneth chang\n\nSo if we go back in history, think of an example where this has happened before. And that is the airplane. So in the very earliest days, there was various people building different types of an airplane. But theres no real business for doing it. It is when the government decides to start sending air mail that it created a business where people could start airlines to carry the mail. And thats led to this wonderful air travel system that we have in the United States and around the world today.\n\nmichael barbaro\n\nSo if we follow that logic, eventually private space travel could be a vast network that many companies enter and perhaps many civilians use, just like civilian aircraft?\n\nkenneth chang\n\nSo once its no longer just NASA astronauts going to space, theres all sorts of new possibilities that open up. So if you have a commercial space station that has nothing to do with NASA that could be filled with millionaire space tourists to spend a couple of weeks in space. It could also be a pharmaceutical company that wants to try out new drugs that can only be made in zero gravity. So once there is a market of going to space that doesnt involve the government, then everyone else can start thinking of how can I get up there, too? How can I make money up there?\n\nmichael barbaro\n\nSo when SpaceX does pull off this launch, maybe its in a couple of days, youre saying its not really just putting two astronauts into space on a private aircraft. Its truly launching a new era in the space program. And its, I guess, the private era of space travel.\n\nkenneth chang\n\nYes. And its coming sooner than you realize. Theres a company out there doing it right now called Axiom Space. They have a contract with SpaceX. They have an agreement with NASA to use part of the space station for these tourists. And this could be launching as soon as the second half of next year.\n\nmichael barbaro\n\nHm. So Ken, everything that youre describing is very exciting. But it occurs to me that its also somewhat conditional. I mean, what happens if, now that its delayed on Saturday, on Sunday, whenever this launch occurs, what happens if it fails? What happens if it goes badly? Is everything youre describing then in doubt?\n\nkenneth chang\n\nIts certainly pushed into the future and delayed. Is it such a setback that everyone says this was a bad idea, we give up, we need to go back to the way things were? I dont think so. Space is still a very hard business, no matter whether its SpaceX or NASA or someone else running these programs. There is a risk to whoever is riding on top of that rocket every time it launches. Everyone whos down there watching is nervous. They always go, I hope this is not a bad day. Because they realize it could be a bad day. And I dont think that one bad day means we never go back to space.\n\nmichael barbaro\n\nWell, Ken, good luck. I hope that you do get a launch in the next few days. And well check in with you after that.\n\nkenneth chang\n\nGreat. Thank you very much.\n\nmichael barbaro'	b'Space Travel, Privatized'	2020-05-28	[]	['think', 'company', 'space', 'travel', 'nasa', 'launch', 'shuttle', 'spacex', 'astronauts', 'changso', 'recording', 'privatized']	b'Because I started covering these at the end of the space shuttle era.\nmichael barbaroBut if you had to guess, how many fly-ins and fly-outs have you made to try to watch a space launch?\nOr you could build a space station and a space shuttle to go to the space station.\nAnd so because the space shuttle did not have a space station to go to, it had to serve other purposes.\nmichael barbaroSo what happens to this kind of underwhelming NASA space program that youre describing?'

Derek, I want to start by asking you if you could tell me about your first ever memory of the Postal Service.\n\nderek harpe\n\nWhen I was growing up in rural Davie County  of course, then there wasnt all the video games and computers and everything. We were in the yard with balls and bats, and the summers, when we would be home from school, we would be out. The mail carrier that came through, we were always right there to see him, and hed give me a little piece of candy, or a piece of bubble gum, or something that we dont do now, by any means.\n\n[laughter]\n\nderek harpe\n\nMy parents knew him. I got to know him. He was an all around good guy. And then as I grew up seeing him, same guy all through my teen years. He wasnt family, but he was close, you know what I mean?\n\nmichael barbaro\n\nAnd what was his name?\n\nderek harpe\n\nVernon.\n\nmichael barbaro\n\nVernon.\n\nderek harpe\n\nAs a child, he was what I knew to be the Postal Service. The rural carriers in a lot of areas, they are the picture of the Postal Service.\n\nmichael barbaro\n\nRight. In a place like where you grew up, that is the Postal Service  one man.\n\nderek harpe\n\nThat was pretty much what I knew growing up, yes. And then when I went to technical school and decided that wasnt what I wanted to do, I told the guy at the post office, I said, Look, seems like Id like to do what yall do. And I talked to him about it and ended up on the route that my parents lived on when I was growing up as a boy. I deliver to that house, and I fell in love with it once I started.\n\nmichael barbaro\n\nI wonder if you can tell me about a typical day on your route in Advance, N.C.\n\nderek harpe\n\nI live in Advance. I work out of Mocksville. And I go into the office each morning, I gather up my mail, and gather my packages, and I go to the street with it and start my route. And we do the last mile for some of our competitors, because I am in rural America.\n\nmichael barbaro\n\nAnd when you say last mile, what do you mean?\n\nderek harpe\n\nWere constitutionally bound to go to every house every day.\n\nmichael barbaro\n\nIn the United States Constitution?\n\nderek harpe\n\nYes. And the private companies, the Walmarts and the Amazons, and of course, UPS and FedEx, they bring their parcels to us to deliver what we call the last mile.\n\nmichael barbaro\n\nSo even though we think of those companies as doing their own delivery from wherever a package originates to a persons home, youre saying that in many cases, its the United States Postal Service, its you, who ends up literally taking it the last couple of miles to the destination.\n\nderek harpe\n\nYes.\n\nmichael barbaro\n\nI feel like thats something a lot of people dont quite understand.\n\nderek harpe\n\nOh, yes. Lots of folks dont realize it.\n\nmichael barbaro\n\nRight.\n\nderek harpe\n\nA guy asked me at church, he said he was following his package by one of our competing delivery companies, and he was following it to each one of their hubs and their facilities, and then all of a sudden it said its at the post office. And then it said it was out for delivery at the post office. Then he said, Then the mailman brings it to my door. Whats the deal? He said, How does that happen? And I said, Well, we carry the last mile for some of the companies to get it out there.\n\nmichael barbaro\n\nRight, and if you werent there, what would happen to those packages? Where would they go?\n\nderek harpe\n\nThe private companies would have to deliver them if the post office wasnt there. And if its a long ways away from town out in rural America, its not profitable for them to go.\n\nmichael barbaro\n\nSo since the pandemic started, I have to imagine there have been significant changes to your routine, right? I mean, how is delivering the mail different now?\n\nderek harpe\n\nWell, now, of course, we have PPE, social distancing, post offices supplying the masks, the gloves. Or, I was carrying a paint stick some days ringing the doorbell, to prevent \n\nmichael barbaro\n\nA paint stick?\n\nderek harpe\n\nYeah. They didnt have to worry about me touching their doorbell or me worry about their doorbell. And Im carrying a lot more essential needs. I think were always essential, but now, with folks not being able to get out or getting out, weve stepped it up, especially the ones that have underlying health issues. Theres a lot of essential needs there that were meeting now. And I sense that from a lot of them in the past few weeks. I would depart from their porch, and they would step out and call my name and say, Derek, we appreciate you. And that means a lot.\n\nmichael barbaro\n\nAnd whats your sense of how the Postal Service is doing in this moment?\n\nderek harpe\n\nWell, what I read and hear, its not good, that its crippled us to a degree. But I just hope that it can continue on. Its the number one loved entity of the government, and I just dont understand how we could not be there for the American citizen.\n\n[music]\n\nmichael barbaro\n\nFrom the New York Times, Im Michael Barbaro. This is The Daily. Today, Americas most beloved government agency has never been more vital, and yet, as thousands of companies receive federal bailouts, the United States Postal Service finds itself at the back of the line. My colleague, Nick Fandos, on why that is. Its Wednesday, May 27. Nick, tell me about the history of the U.S. Postal Service.\n\nnicholas fandos\n\nThe Postal Service traces its roots back basically as far or farther than the country itself.\n\n[music]\n\nnicholas fandos\n\nIn the 1770s, Benjamin Franklin, everybodys favorite founding father, was actually appointed to be the first postmaster general of the new United States.\n\narchived recording Postal business is transacted through some 47,000 post offices, contract stations, and branches in 42,000 U.S. communities.\n\nnicholas fandos\n\nAnd over the years, it becomes what the founding fathers wanted it to be then, which is something that could connect the country, allow Americans to correspond with each other, do business with each other. Basically bring these disparate colonies and communities together.\n\narchived recording The biggest retail business in the world today is the United States Post Office, devoted exclusively to the service of its owners, the American public.\n\nnicholas fandos\n\nIt has grown into basically the most trusted government service, this kind of ubiquitous and beloved face of the federal government, that is massive in its own right.\n\narchived recording Today, postal employees must cope with an ever-increasing avalanche of mail which, in the past decade, has quadrupled in volume.\n\nnicholas fandos\n\nIts a big, complex business that employs over 600,000 people. If it was a private company, it would be easily on the Fortune 500 list.\n\narchived recording Though 90 percent of its income is derived from the sale of stamps, the post office is also the largest savings bank in the country, and the largest agency with a transfer of money. It takes in more than $1.5 billion annually.\n\nnicholas fandos\n\nAnd so while the Postal Service was not set up to be a kind of moneymaking engine for the government, it did, for much of its modern life, either break even or make modest profits based on the sale of postage.\n\nmichael barbaro\n\nSo when does that all start to change?\n\nnicholas fandos\n\nSo starting in the early to mid 2000s, there is a relatively quick succession of major changes in the kind of environment for the Postal Service, some of which are foreseen and some of which are not, that begin to dramatically erode its finances. The first one is this large change that were all familiar with in consumer habits and the way that people communicate and spend money, and thats just \n\narchived recording Youve got mail.\n\nnicholas fandos\n\nThe advent of the kind of like, everyday worldwide web.\n\narchived recording 1 You can now glimpse the future with nothing more than a modem, a phone line, and a few dollars a month. archived recording 2 And then theres email. archived recording 3 Email? I heard thats really neat. My cousin has a pen pal in Sweden, and they write back and forth, and it transmits right away, and doesnt cost anything. archived recording 4 Yeah. You can even talk with people all over the world on chat lines.\n\nnicholas fandos\n\nThese things directly replace a lot of the Postal Services bottom line. Personal correspondence, billing, business solicitations, and things like that. And so you start in kind of the early years of the new Millennium, and the trend picks up to see a decline in overall mail volume.\n\narchived recording The House will be in order.\n\nnicholas fandos\n\nAnd then a few years into this trend, Congress makes another consequential decision.\n\narchived recording This legislation mandates transparency in the services finances, costs, and operations, creates a modern system of rate regulation, establishes fair competition rules, and a powerful new regulator to oversee operations. I urge my colleagues to adopt.\n\nnicholas fandos\n\nThe Postal Service is financing itself. Its self-sustainable. But Congress sees on the horizon an issue with this very large, relatively well-paid federal workforce hitting retirement age.\n\narchived recording 1 Those in favor, say aye, archived recording 2 Aye. archived recording 3 Those opposed, no. The bill is passed, and without objection, the motion to reconsider is laid upon the table.\n\nnicholas fandos\n\nAnd it decides that the Postal Service ought to set aside money in advance to fund the health care benefits of all of its retirees. This is, in actuality, billions of dollars a year on top of its normal operating costs that the Postal Service needs to start setting aside, basically. And that proposition makes a lot of sense in a world where the Postal Service has a healthy business model, is in the black, and bringing in revenue. What they cant foresee is the financial crisis.\n\n[music]\n\narchived recording 1 The U.S. Postal Service says it will be insolvent next month, and wants to lay off 120,000 people. archived recording 2 By the end of September, the Postal Service will be on the brink of defaulting on all its employee pension obligations, unable to borrow any more money, and only have enough cash to cover one week of operations.\n\nnicholas fandos\n\nSo businesses are spending less money on mail, individuals are spending less money, and the Postal Service, saddled with this new obligation to fund its retirees health care well into the future, and battling a recession that any business was struggling with at that time, finds itself very quickly moving further and further into the red.\n\narchived recording The Postal Service adapting to this economy right now surely wont be easy.\n\nmichael barbaro\n\nSo Nick, I have to imagine if that financial crisis hurts the Postal Service, that this one thats now underway has just clobbered them.\n\nnicholas fandos\n\nAbsolutely. I mean, the agency never really fully recovered or regained its footing. And here, basically the whole world and the economy shuts down overnight, and theres a precipitous decline  5 percent a first, 10 percent, 15 percent, 20 percent, 30 percent  of overall mail volume.\n\nmichael barbaro\n\nWow.\n\nnicholas fandos\n\nSo it may seem like youre getting more packages than ever and that the Postal Service  you know, your mailman is the one person that keeps coming to your building and your door, and theres kind of a greater awareness about it. And package volume is up overall, which has helped offset some losses. But for the Postal Service, where they really make their money  and its helpful to think about the mail you get at home  are the kind of solicitations, the bills, the flyers, the things that form the bulk of that stack if you bring letters into your house from the mailbox.\n\nmichael barbaro\n\nRight.\n\nnicholas fandos\n\nAnd thats what has contracted at an alarming rate. And those losses have not, at least to this point, been able to be offset. And so the Postal Service begins to put together projections that say, if these trends continue, we could be looking at a volume in mail decline by half by the middle of the summer. And so what weve seen in the last few weeks is the Postal Service come to Congress, basically hat in hand. and say, look, if you dont come and bail us out right now, if you cant help us get a infusion of billions and billions of dollars, we could be out of cash by the fall. And that will threaten service and threaten the very viability of this thing that Americans seem to be more cognizant of and more relying on than they have been in a really long time.\n\n[music]\n\nmichael barbaro\n\nWell be right back. So I have to imagine that this pretty beloved institution is at the front of the line for any kind of bailout at a moment when Congress is handing out money to a lot of businesses across the country.\n\nnicholas fandos\n\nI think thats a fair assumption. And so we saw in March, when Congress was racing to put together the CARES Act, its big $2 trillion relief bill to try and prop up the economy, Democrats and Republicans get kind of a handshake deal to send it $13 billion in direct funding that will help it keep operating through the summer and the fall, and hopefully weather the worst of the crisis. But in the middle of these high-stakes negotiations, the White House comes, and out of trillions of dollars of spending, points to the United States Postal Service and says, Uh-uh, were not going to support a bailout. Were not interested in including them in this bill, and you better not put it in our way, because we dont want to have a problem.\n\nmichael barbaro\n\nAnd why is that? Why wont the White House bail out the Postal Service?\n\nnicholas fandos\n\nSo it actually starts with The Washington Post, the newspaper that the president feels has covered him too critically, too unfairly. He perceives it as one of his biggest enemies in Washington. That paper happens to be owned by Jeff Bezos, the founder and chief executive of Amazon. And Amazon, as we know, is heavily reliant on the United States Postal Service to deliver many of its packages all across the country. The details of its contracts are kept private, but the Postal Service does quite a bit of business with Amazon.\n\narchived recording Whats Amazon done that bugs you, sir? archived recording (donald trump) Well, you take a look at the post office \n\nnicholas fandos\n\nAnd this, as much as anything else, is what has informed Trumps view of the Postal Service.\n\narchived recording (donald trump)  and the post office is losing billions of dollars, and the taxpayers are paying for that money, because it delivers packages for Amazon at a very below cost, and thats not fair \n\nnicholas fandos\n\nHes of the opinion that Amazon is basically ripping off the Postal Service.\n\narchived recording (donald trump) And Amazon has the money to pay the fare rate at the post office, which would be much more than theyre paying right now.\n\nnicholas fandos\n\nThat its getting its packages delivered far too cheaply, and that Bezos is being enriched off of this government service.\n\narchived recording (donald trump) Amazon is going to have to pay much more money to the post office. Theres no doubt about that.\n\nnicholas fandos\n\nAnd so hes basically put down a line in the sand and said, Unless the Postal Service agrees to jack up prices 400 or even 500 percent on Amazon packages  thats quite a lot of money  Im not going to give them a cent. Im not going to bail him out, I wont give them a loan, Im not going to do anything for them because theyre being such suckers.\n\nmichael barbaro\n\nWow. So the president has specifically linked his reluctance to assist the Postal Service financially with his frustrations with Amazon and Jeff Bezos.\n\nnicholas fandos\n\nAbsolutely. There is, though, a second thing going on here, and this is kind of  this other interest is maybe better represented by Steve Mnuchin, who is the treasury secretary. So what Mnuchin and some of these others want are basically to change the Postal Service in ways that will cut its costs, that will increase its prices, and kind of shrink its footprint. Both so that it can meet its own financial obligations and start to address this big debt that its racked up, but also in ways that will allow its private competitors like FedEx and UPS to get a little bit more of an upper hand in the market. I mean, they would say that this is about competition, and that the Postal Service has been given some unfair monopolies in certain areas, or has been allowed to keep its rates too low in a way that harmed these private businesses and needs to be changed in a way that will make the whole field more competitive.\n\n[music]\n\nnicholas fandos\n\nSo this is all in the White Houses mind when Congress comes to it a few weeks ago and says, we want this money to bail out the ailing Postal Service. And all of a sudden, they realize that theyre presented with a real new opportunity to put a mark on the Postal Service in this moment of flux that could effectuate a lot of both what President Trump and what Mnuchin and his allies want to see.\n\nmichael barbaro\n\nAnd how? How could this be an opportunity for the White House?\n\nnicholas fandos\n\nSo Mnuchin recognizes that the Postal Service is in a bad way, that it has a real financial need. And if instead of giving it a no-strings-attached bailout, the Treasury Department instead gets authority to give it a loan, then he, as treasury secretary, could essentially dictate terms, changes that the Postal Service would have to adopt if it wants to get this loan money from the Treasury Department. And so it gives him significant new leverage to try and put in place some of these long-held ambitions that he has for the Postal Service, most explicitly this question of rates. Mnuchin wants more not only rate increases, but increases where Amazon would essentially have to pay more. But he wants to be able to look at those contracts himself and make sure that they are meeting, I suppose, his standard for what that ought to look like.\n\nmichael barbaro\n\nNick, is it possible that thats exactly what the Postal Service should be doing? I mean, Im mindful of the fact that Amazon, for example, is the countrys most profitable business. It could probably stand to pay higher rates, and would that be better for the Postal Service?\n\nnicholas fandos\n\nIts a very good question, and thats very possible. At a time when the volume of packages, because of the pandemic, is increasing significantly at the Postal Service, this could be an area to really close some of the revenue gap. But theres a couple of things to keep in mind. One, theres a big difference between modest changes and re-evaluating a contract to increase prices maybe 10 percent or 15 percent, I dont know, and what President Trump is talking about. Which is a wholesale increase of four- or five-fold so that if a package today costs $8 to ship, its going to be $32 or higher. And that kind of thing, independent business analysts will quickly tell you, is kind of ludicrous. It just wont work, and it would probably backfire on the Postal Service, because Amazon could easily find a way to deliver that package cheaper. Its too drastic an increase all at once. And the other thing to keep in mind that the presidents comments often obscure is that these contracts with companies like Amazon, while they are secretive, or we, the public, havent seen them, they are certified to be profitable. They are making the Postal Service money. So the idea that the Postal Service is just being totally ripped off by Amazon isnt exactly right either.\n\nmichael barbaro\n\nNick, how does this approach from the White House sit with congressional Republicans who presumably represent a lot of Americans who like the Postal Service?\n\nnicholas fandos\n\nSo this is the biggest question for the Postal Service right now, because if you have the White House on one side and Democrats on the other, its really congressional Republicans that could tip the outcome here one way or another, and they seem to be split in their own way. Traditionally, Republicans, particularly those that represent rural states or districts, places like Maine, or Alaska, or just congressional districts that are outside of big cities all over the country, have been big supporters of the Postal Service because their constituents are heavily reliant on it. And so they have generally been on the side of giving the Postal Service what it asks for. I mean, take the case of Dan Sullivan, who is a Republican senator from the state of Alaska, very rural state, heavily reliant on the Postal Service, whos up for re-election this fall. Sullivan was, not too long ago, actually, at the White House.\n\narchived recording (donald trump) The Postal Service is a joke.\n\nnicholas fandos\n\nWhen President Trump went off on a riff against the Postal Service and about how they were being ripped off by Amazon \n\narchived recording (donald trump) The post office, if they raised the price of a package by approximately four times, it would be a whole new ballgame.\n\nnicholas fandos\n\nHe stood there silently watching it, and then, hearing the view of the president of his party \n\narchived recording (donald trump) If they dont raise the price, Im not signing anything.\n\nnicholas fandos\n\nA short time later, speaking with constituents back in Alaska at a town hall \n\narchived recording (dan sullivan) Im concerned about the post office and whats going on with the post office \n\nnicholas fandos\n\nBasically expressed the view that many Republicans have.\n\narchived recording (dan sullivan)  that other states might be like, Oh wait, why cant you just drive there? Well, you guys all know why we cant just drive there  because so many of our communities dont even have roads.\n\nnicholas fandos\n\nI recognize how important the Postal Service is to my state, and Im not going to let anything happen to it that would jeopardize the ability of the mail to reach all of you.\n\narchived recording (dan sullivan) We are defenders of all of these programs, because you cant be treated differently just because youre an American and you live in a village without a road.\n\nnicholas fandos\n\nOn the other hand, there are Republicans in Congress that I think are sympathetic to that point of view, but feel like the Postal Service has been losing money for quite a long time, that its business model wasnt working even before the pandemic. And that if theyre going to be giving them a bunch of money, if theyre going to be asking taxpayers that dont normally fund the Postal Service to be chipping in billions of dollars, they want to see some changes from it, maybe changes that look like what the White House wants along the way.\n\nmichael barbaro\n\nSo where does this all leave the post office, Nick? I mean, the White House is saying, take this loan. Sounds like the post office is not thrilled about the conditions that would be attached to it. I suppose it could just not take the money, or maybe it could wait and see whether the election changes the composition of Congress, or even the White House.\n\nnicholas fandos\n\nI think all of those things are possible, but another interesting thing has happened as this whole dynamic has played out, which is that there have been some pretty significant personnel changes at the top of the Postal Service. President Trump, as is his prerogative, named in recent weeks a new postmaster general, not somebody that comes from within the agency, but is a Republican donor who comes from private business.\n\nmichael barbaro\n\nDuring the pandemic?\n\nnicholas fandos\n\nDuring the pandemic, who is believed to be much more sympathetic to the presidents views and Secretary Mnuchins views. And so there is a possibility that the Postal Service could ultimately decide either to take the loan, or maybe financial conditions improve enough that they dont need to take the loan, but they still make some of the kind of changes that the White House is asking for. Regardless of whether or not Democrats want them to take them or their own workforce wants them to take them, it may well be that what the president has finally succeeded in doing is putting a kind of like-minded or sympathetic leadership team in place, and thats what it takes.\n\nmichael barbaro\n\nAnd if the Postal Service doesnt take this money, how much longer can it operate as it currently does?\n\nnicholas fandos\n\nSo obviously, in the context of the pandemic, a lot of things are subject to change. But by the Postal Services own projections, it could run into serious cash flow problems as early as September, this fall. And without a major infusion either in the form of bailout from Congress or a loan coming from the Treasury Department, it would struggle to meet its obligations and put even delivering the mail in jeopardy.\n\nmichael barbaro\n\nNick, thank you very much.\n\nnicholas fandos\n\nThank you, Michael.\n\n[music]\n\nmichael barbaro\n\nDerek, why do you think it is that the federal government is offering financial assistance to many private companies across the U.S. economy and not to the Postal Service? What do you think that the rationale is?\n\nderek harpe\n\nI know Ive read some things about us not charging enough for some of the package business, but the Postal Service is not a for-profit private company like some of the others. The founding fathers I dont think ever meant for it to be that, according to what Ive read. The post office surviving  I hope that it survives at a uniformity that every American deserves.\n\nmichael barbaro\n\nWell, Derek, we really appreciate you spending time with us, and wish you the best of luck on your routes and good health.\n\nderek harpe\n\nCertainly appreciate that.\n\nmichael barbaro\n\nGood talking to you.\n\nderek harpe\n\nThank you very much for the opportunity.\n\nmichael barbaro\n\nWell be right back.\n\n[music]\n\nmichael barbaro\n\nHeres what else you need to know today.\n\narchived recording The disease can jump up at any time. We cannot make assumptions that just because the disease is on the way down now that its going to keep going down and were going to get a number of months to get ready for a second wave.\n\nmichael barbaro\n\nThe World Health Organization is warning that even before a second wave of infections may arrive in the fall, there could be a surge of infections in the coming weeks as measures to contain the virus are lifted in places like the U.S. The W.H.O. described such a surge as a second peak.\n\narchived recording We may get a second peak in this wave. This happened during pandemics in the past. It certainly happened in the pandemic of 1919 and the Spanish flu. We got a second peak, not necessarily a second wave.\n\nmichael barbaro'	b'Can the Postal Service Survive the Pandemic?'	2020-05-27	[]	['survive', 'amazon', 'post', 'postal', 'office', 'service', 'going', 'money', 'recording', 'kind', 'lot', 'pandemic']	b'Derek, I want to start by asking you if you could tell me about your first ever memory of the Postal Service.\nPostal Service.\nnicholas fandosThe Postal Service traces its roots back basically as far or farther than the country itself.\nAnd so what weve seen in the last few weeks is the Postal Service come to Congress, basically hat in hand.\nnicholas fandosSo Mnuchin recognizes that the Postal Service is in a bad way, that it has a real financial need.'
trusted	b'The Story of Two Brothers From Mexico'	true	[]		trusted	[]	https://www.nytimes.com/2020/05/26/podcasts/the-daily/immigration-coronavirus.html	https://www.nytimes.com/	b'annie correal\n\nSo I cover immigration in and around New York City, and over the past few months, like everybody, Ive been covering the coronavirus crisis. And not too long ago, I started looking at how that experience has been different for Latino immigrant families.\n\n[music]\n\nOne thing I noticed pretty much right away is that hundreds and hundreds of families were turning to GoFundMe, to the crowd funding site. And they were setting up pages to pay for funerals and hospital bills and also to send their relatives remains back to their home countries, to maybe mothers or grandmothers. So I started just sending emails to the people who had created these sites, and one of the first responses I got was from a girl in New Jersey and her twin sister. I got a very polite text saying that they were willing to speak, so I gave them a call. And quickly, I learned that their story was just wrenching.\n\nannie correal Melanie? Melanie, can you hear me? melanie cruz morales Yes.\n\nmichael barbaro\n\nFrom The New York Times, Im Michael Barbaro. This is The Daily. Today, the experience of immigrant families during the pandemic. Annie Correal with the story of one of them. Its Tuesday, May 26.\n\nannie correal All right. Hi there, Melanie. How are you? melanie cruz morales Hi. Im OK. Im taking every day by day. How are you today? annie correal Im fine. Thank you.\n\nannie correal\n\nSo Sheila and Melanie Cruz Morales, theyre identical twins. They live in Teaneck, N.J., which is a suburb of New York City.\n\nannie correal And tell me a little bit about yourself. How old are you? melanie cruz morales So I am 19 years old. I am a political science major at Bergen Community College. Im from a Mexican immigrant family, and I am a DACA recipient. Those are a couple things about me.\n\nannie correal\n\nTheyre really obviously studious, dedicated, driven young women. And they have a kind of passion for politics that they say theyve discovered in their early teenage years.\n\nmelanie cruz morales Yeah, and were both going to transfer somewhere else this fall. annie correal I overheard Sheila in the background. Do you want to  hi, Sheila. sheila cruz morales Hi. Sorry. annie correal Thats OK. Nice to meet you. sheila cruz morales Yeah, its nice to meet you.\n\nannie correal\n\nSo Sheila, shes kind of the shy one of the two.\n\nsheila cruz morales Im usually very quiet and I just let Melanie do the talking.\n\nannie correal\n\nSo its Melanie, her sister, who tells me the entire story of their uncle Javier. She just lost him to Covid-19.\n\n[music]\n\nmichael barbaro\n\nAnd who is her uncle, Javier?\n\nannie correal\n\nSo her uncle Javier, Javier Morales, is the kind of father figure for her whole family.\n\nmelanie cruz morales Basically the way we migrated over here to this country really started with my uncle Javier, who he was one of the first ones who planted seeds in this country.\n\nannie correal\n\nYou know, he speaks English. Hes more integrated.\n\nmelanie cruz morales He basically taught us a lot and prepared us for what life would be like here.\n\nannie correal\n\nAnd hes come a long way because he and his family come from this little tiny village of 200 people and shrinking in Oaxaca. Its called Santa Catarina Yosonot.\n\nmichael barbaro\n\nAnd whats this village like in Oaxaca?\n\nmelanie cruz morales Its literally a small town in the midst of mountains everywhere.\n\nannie correal\n\nSo Santa Catarina Yosonot is indigenous. Many people only speak a language called Mixtec.\n\nmelanie cruz morales I think one of the smells that always, always brings me back to it is the scent of fire and wood burning.\n\nannie correal\n\nBecause people cook the tortillas over wood fires.\n\nmelanie cruz morales You know, theres no stove. Theres not really much electricity.\n\nannie correal\n\nIts like lost to time.\n\nmelanie cruz morales And theres not much technology. The way that we call my grandmother who lives in a pueblo is by calling the station where they have phones.\n\nannie correal\n\nTheres just a central call center.\n\nmelanie cruz morales Because no one else has phones there.\n\nannie correal\n\nWhere someone comes onto the loudspeaker and announces.\n\nmelanie cruz morales Its Lourdes. Im calling for Seora Francesa. And then its just funny because my mom is, like, on the phone for five minutes waiting for Grandma to rush down to the center and pick up the phone call.\n\nmichael barbaro\n\nSo this town is small enough that when an announcement is made over some loudspeaker, everyone in town can hear it.\n\nannie correal\n\nThats right.\n\nmelanie cruz morales Its a very small town.\n\nannie correal\n\nSo in this village, theres one little grocery store that everyone goes to. This is where youd go for your beans and rice and Coca-Cola. And this is where uncle Javier worked when he was young, along with his seven siblings. It was the family business.\n\nmelanie cruz morales Because everybody would come to the store to buy things, and thats how everyone knows my family back home.\n\nannie correal\n\nBut when Javier was about 18, his father died tragically, and thats why he left and went to the United States to begin supporting his rather large family.\n\n[music]\n\nmichael barbaro\n\nSo where in the U.S. did he go?\n\nannie correal\n\nHe goes first to California, and he works in the fields. He works as an agricultural worker and eventually travels over to Florida before going up to Teaneck, N.J. And there he found a job for a trucking company, called Cort. He starts driving  they supply furniture for big events like the Super Bowl one year and conventions at the Javits Center in New York City. And so he gets to know the whole country as he makes these trips. And in the process, he seems to sort of fall in love with the United States. He finds an apartment building, and he slowly starts telling his relatives, theres a lot of opportunity here. Why dont you come? So slowly, some cousins come over, more and more people, his best friend. Javiers baby brother, Martin, comes over when hes about 18, and they move into the apartment complex that hes found for them. And eventually, the twins, Melanie and Sheila, come over with their mother when theyre about four years old.\n\nmelanie cruz morales Just like a lot of other migrants, we crossed the border.\n\nannie correal\n\nThey walk across the desert from Mexico into Arizona and travel by car to New Jersey.\n\nmelanie cruz morales Its funny because I vividly remember coming off Route 80.\n\nannie correal\n\nEven though they were so little, Melanie remembered pulling off Route 80 and driving up to what would become her new home, this apartment complex in this unfamiliar new country, and the first person she sees is her uncle Javier, who greets them with open arms.\n\nmelanie cruz morales And thats the first time I really got to meet my cousin and uncle. So they were already here. They were just waiting for us. annie correal So you created like a little second village in Teaneck, N.J.? melanie cruz morales Yeah, we really did. We all realized that this is where we would all be able to have a better life, and little by little over time, we have made it our home. Yeah.\n\n[music]\n\nmichael barbaro\n\nAnd what is this new home, this apartment complex in Teaneck, N.J., like?\n\nannie correal\n\nSo they really come to love this building.\n\nmelanie cruz morales So our apartment building, that weve lived in for 15 years, is three stories. And outside of it is brick, so it stands really strong, and its up on a hill. And in the back of the apartment building, theres this really, really, really big parking lot.\n\nannie correal\n\nTheres a big parking lot outside where they grill meat and sit around on Sundays. The men sit around on their one day off per week, and they listen to music and have a couple of beers, and no one minds because everyones family.\n\nmelanie cruz morales And the parking lot is where everyone would see each other at least once a day, and we would stop and smile and wave at each other, catch up. And it was also where all the little kids who lived in the apartment building would come out to play.\n\nannie correal\n\nYou walk inside, and theres a central staircase.\n\nmelanie cruz morales Which leads you to the second floor, and that is where my uncle Javier used to live. On the third floor is my apartment, and then directly across is where my cousin Kobe and his two little siblings and my aunt and my uncle Martin also lived.\n\nannie correal\n\nEveryone calls each other to and ta.\n\nmelanie cruz morales I said hi, to, and he said hi.\n\nannie correal\n\nUncle and aunt.\n\nmelanie cruz morales Our apartment had always the doors open because we all knew each other.\n\nannie correal\n\nThey go back and forth between each others apartments. The doors are unlocked. You know, theyre constantly passing each other in the stairwells, knocking on the door and asking for salsa or soda.\n\nmelanie cruz morales We always knew that my uncle Javier always had soda stocked up. So we would go rushing down to his apartment building and tell him, Hey, do you want to come up and have dinner with us? And bring soda. And he would always come upstairs with anything that we needed.\n\nmichael barbaro\n\nSounds pretty idyllic.\n\nannie correal\n\nYeah, I mean, its really been home.\n\nmelanie cruz morales A lot of people say that when you rent an apartment, its always very temporary, and you dont really feel at home, but that place, for some reason, always, always felt like a forever type of situation. Sometimes in the night when I would be speaking to my sister and my brother, wed all come around. And I told them, one day when we have money, and we have our careers, and were grown, I would like to come back to this place. And I would like to purchase a building with you, with my sister, with my brother, and have it as a place for the family because it was that special to us.\n\nmichael barbaro\n\nAnd what was Melanie and her sisters relationship like with their uncle Javier?\n\nannie correal\n\nSo I think they had a special bond with their uncle Javier. In some ways, he recognizes a lot of promise in them. When he became a US citizen, he actually asked Melanie to sit down with him, and they made flashcards so he could study for his citizenship exam.\n\nmelanie cruz morales I would ask him, who was the first president of the United States? And he would tell me the answer, and I guess that was one of the times where we really bonded.\n\nannie correal\n\nAnd she remembered that as a kind of funny role reversal because she was 9, 10 years old, and there she was trying to teach her uncle who the countrys first president was.\n\nmelanie cruz morales It was a bunch of him just getting the wrong answers or him getting the right answers and me being so surprised by it.\n\nannie correal\n\nHe really believed in them and thought that they were on a path to success. They were trying to transfer to a four-year college, and he was constantly checking in with them and asking them where they wanted to go and what they wanted to be. At some point, he delivers furniture to Yale University, and he sees the Gothic campus and the beautiful old buildings, and it makes an impression. He comes back, and he tells the twins, Thats the kind of place where you should go.\n\nmelanie cruz morales He came back and he showed me, Look, this is the school. He showed so many pictures. He was like, I really liked it. I hope that one day that you can go to a school like this.\n\nannie correal\n\nHes a real believer in the American dream, and he passes that on to his nieces.\n\n[music]\n\nSo he passes the test, and he obtains citizenship status. And that means a lot of things. I mean, for him, it means he can travel back to his village and see his mother. And having a citizen in the family is so important. There are things you never think of.\n\nmelanie cruz morales I felt in a way safer to know that I had an uncle who was a citizen, you know, simple little things like me hopping into his car and him driving. And me knowing that he had a license meant the world to me just because of how on edge you are as an undocumented person.\n\nannie correal\n\nAnd because hes legally on the books working for this trucking company, he has a salary, he has vacation time, he has paid sick leave.\n\nmichael barbaro\n\nAnd these are things that many of the people living in that apartment complex, many of his relatives dont have.\n\nannie correal\n\nExactly. I mean, at the time, none of them, no one had citizenship. So hes only 48, but he has really become kind of the central figure of the family. Hes also really the heart of the family.\n\narchived recording (JAVIER SINGING) melanie cruz morales (LAUGHS) Its so funny. He liked a lot of Mexican bands, corridos, a lot of banda. He was so proud of it, and he loved to show it off, and its like a little joke in our family. archived recording (JAVIER SINGING) melanie cruz morales Ill never forget, I think it was his birthday three years ago or two years ago, and theres this one song that you sing when youre heartbroken, when you just got like broken up with. And we had, like, the microphone, and like, everyone in the tiny little apartment was enjoying it, had a good time, and it was literally like being in a little concert. But everyone was so into it, like even the little kids, even the teenagers, like my cousin, sometimes we think they were too cool for our culture, that were too Americanized, but in that moment, everyone was just enjoying it. And it was just really, really nice, because he was so happy, and everyone was really happy.\n\n[music]\n\nmichael barbaro\n\nSo Annie, what happens to this family over the past few months?\n\nannie correal\n\nSo this year, Javier goes on his annual trip to Mexico in early March to see his mother, and he comes back and goes straight back to work at the trucking company. And not long after, he starts to feel sick. And you know, he thinks its just a cold, but hes watching the news and all these reports about the coronavirus, and he decides to self-quarantine. Again, you know, he has a job that offers him paid sick leave. So he stops working, and you know, hes pretty sure its nothing to worry about, but its better to be safe, and it doesnt go away.\n\n[music]\n\nSo he goes to the closest hospital, to Teaneck. He describes his symptoms. He tells them what kind of work he does and that hes just traveled, and he asks to take a test, and hes turned away. Hes told he probably has the flu, and he should rest, take some medicine, and hell get better. So he goes home, and the next day he wakes up, and hes still sick. In fact, hes even sicker than the day before. And he starts to get a little frightened, so he goes to another doctor, and they tell him the same thing. So its now been two attempts, and his symptoms are getting worse. So he does hear that theres a new testing site in New Jersey at a community college, but he goes on a day when theyre only testing first responders, like doctors and nurses, and he didnt know that. So they turned them away. And at that point, hes really scared.\n\nmelanie cruz morales So he had no other option but to go to another hospital in Hackensack.\n\nannie correal\n\nSo he drives to the hospital in Hackensack, N.J., that same day, and he goes straight to the E.R., and finally, he gets admitted.\n\nmelanie cruz morales He went there, and he basically told my aunt he, told them, Oh, Im here, Im OK, dont worry, and Ill call you back later. And that was last time my aunt was ever able to speak to him.\n\nmichael barbaro\n\nSo this is his fourth attempt to get a test.\n\nannie correal\n\nThats right, and its on this visit where he finally gets tested, and he tests positive for Covid-19.\n\nmelanie cruz morales They realized that he was in critical condition, so they moved him up to the I.C.U. and immediately put him on a ventilator. And all the events really happened so fast, nobody could have thought that he would have contracted the virus. We see it on the news, and we see whats going on, but it doesnt hit you until it hits home. And then thats when the reality starts to settle in.\n\nannie correal\n\nThe whole family is just worried to death. Then, a few days later, Javiers baby brother, Martin, starts to feel a little sick himself.\n\nmelanie cruz morales When I found out that my uncle, who lived right across from me, was sick, I really couldnt believe it. I thought it was a joke. Like, I thought theres no way that two family members could possibly have this virus. And so I called my little cousin Kobe, and I told him, Whats going on, is your dad OK? And he said, Yes, hes fine. Hes just showing flu-like symptoms.\n\nannie correal\n\nThe thing is, hes younger than Javier. Hes 39. He cycles every day. He loves riding his bike to the George Washington Bridge. He keeps in really good shape. And so when he gets sick, no one is really all that worried. And he decides that after having seen everything that his brother went through, hes not going to jump through those hoops. He, unlike his brother, is undocumented. So he thinks, if that was what my brother went through, whats it going to be like for me?\n\nmichael barbaro\n\nSo he thinks, since Im undocumented, what would be my chances of ever getting tested or treated efficiently, so he just basically does nothing.\n\nannie correal\n\nExactly. So he goes into isolation in a room in his apartment, in this complex, where the whole family lives.\n\nmelanie cruz morales My dad rushed over and made a huge pot of home remedies. He made tea. He made onion, garlic, ginger, a bunch of things mixed together, and he packaged it up and dropped it off right in front of his door, of my uncle Martins door. And he gave it to him, and thats basically all that my uncle was taking, because I dont think he understood this virus. I dont think anybody did and especially not us.\n\nannie correal\n\nSo meanwhile, Uncle Javier is still in the Hackensack hospital. His family is getting regular reports, even some reports that hes stable.\n\nmelanie cruz morales He had been in the I.C.U. for seven days, a week total. And on the last day, we got the phone call.\n\nannie correal\n\nOn Monday, April 6, they learned that uncle Javier has died. His heart has stopped.\n\n[music]\n\nSo the night after Javier has died, the twins and their big brother, theyre having dinner, and they go and they get some tequila, and theyre about to raise a glass to their uncle Javier.\n\nmelanie cruz morales We were in our living room playing Mexican music. And we had  my brother opened a bottle of Patron because my uncle Javier had just passed away, and we wanted to take a shot of tequila and honor him because it was his favorite drink.\n\nannie correal\n\nWhen they hear someone banging on the door. And they go to the door without opening it, and its their cousin Kobe. Its Martins son. Hes 16, and hes shouting for help.\n\nmelanie cruz morales Help! Help! Call the ambulance. My dad is unresponsive.\n\nannie correal\n\nSo Martin, who was doing OK and trying to get through this at home, is suddenly unconscious.\n\nmelanie cruz morales I called the ambulance.\n\nannie correal\n\nSo Melanie calls 911.\n\nmelanie cruz morales I had to lock my mom and my dad in my room.\n\nannie correal\n\nThe twins mother is immunocompromised, so theyre very nervous that she could get sick. And so when Kobe comes to the door and bangs on the door and says, My dad is unconscious, hes unresponsive, they dont even open the door.\n\nannie correal Did you let him into your apartment? melanie cruz morales No.\n\n[music]\n\nmichael barbaro\n\nWell be right back. I have to imagine that that was really hard for the twins and for everybody, I mean, given what an open household this was. People going in and out of each others apartments all the time, and suddenly, a locked door and cousins who wont let somebody in.\n\nannie correal\n\nAbsolutely. I think its something that the twins are still struggling with now.\n\nmelanie cruz morales It was the hardest thing I had to do, but I knew that my moms immune system is so weak that I wasnt going to risk putting her in danger. So I just said, Im sorry, Im sorry, but I cant. It was just a fight or flight reaction.\n\nannie correal\n\nI think it added a layer of just horror to be listening to all of this over the phone or even through the wall.\n\nannie correal So you call 911, and youre just waiting for the ambulance.\n\nannie correal\n\nSo they have Kobe, their cousin, on one line, the paramedics on the other. And the ambulance arrives. And theyre guiding them over the phone through the apartment complex, so they can get to the right door.\n\nmelanie cruz morales We were kept on the line. So we heard everything through that phone call. We might have not been there, we might have not been able to see it, but we definitely heard it.\n\nmichael barbaro\n\nAnd what are they hearing as theyre guiding these paramedics in and as the paramedics arrive across the hall?\n\nannie correal\n\nSo theyre hearing them run up the stairwell and go into the apartment, and theyre pressed against the door and against the wall.\n\nmelanie cruz morales I had to comfort my cousin through the phone. I had to hear his yell. I could hear everything.\n\nannie correal\n\nThey hear their cousin Kobe talking to his father, and hes saying to him, Dont go, come back. And at some point, hes overcome, and he just throws the phone. And they cant hear anymore whats going on, except for these muffled sounds, these panicked sounds as they try to revive Martin.\n\nmelanie cruz morales We hear the yells and the cries, and we knew what was going on.\n\nannie correal\n\nAnd you have to imagine that his wife and his two young children are also in the apartment at the same time. So the twins are waiting. They say that its just the worst 25 minutes of their life. And then theres silence. And they look through the peephole, and they see the body taken down the stairs.\n\nmelanie cruz morales The people from the funeral home come and dragged my uncles body down the stairs, and that definitely changes a person. Theres nothing that will prepare you for that. And I was left cold. I was left numb. I couldnt cry. There was no tears coming down my face because I had never ever processed something like that. Our lives completely changed.\n\nmichael barbaro\n\nThats horrible.\n\nannie correal\n\nIt is. But then the twins learned that the neighbors who lived across the hall from Javier on the second floor, theyre sick, too.\n\nmelanie cruz morales So when we heard that that family who lived across my uncle Javier was also getting sick, thats immediately when I went into full panic mode and said I have to get out of here.\n\nannie correal\n\nIt starts feeling like the coronavirus is just ripping its way through the building.\n\nmelanie cruz morales It felt like I was literally trapped in something that I couldnt get out of, and it just felt like I needed to get out. Like I want  we all did. Like, my mom, my dad, my brother, like everyone felt the need to leave.\n\nannie correal\n\nAnd so they start planning some sort of escape. Through a connection, they find a home out in rural Pennsylvania, and they just start throwing things literally out the window.\n\nmelanie cruz morales We were throwing bags of clothes outside our window because we werent going to risk getting anything caught, like in the air of like the staircase, how like they had to pull my uncles body down through the stairs, and like we were just so panicked.\n\nannie correal\n\nTheir refuge and their family home has turned into what feels like a death trap.\n\nmelanie cruz morales We felt like the virus was every corner. So it was survival. It was running for your life.\n\nannie correal\n\nAnd so they are just gathering everything that they can and fleeing into a car and eventually making their way out into the farmlands of Pennsylvania.\n\nmichael barbaro\n\nDo the twins have any idea how this happened, how Javier got sick, whether he may have passed it on to his brother Martin, and then onto the others in the apartment?\n\nannie correal\n\nIts all kind of speculation. I mean, he traveled to Mexico, so they think, was it making his way back to New Jersey? Could it have been on one of his work trips? Was it maybe Martin who picked it up as he continued to work? Theres really no way to trace how it made it into the apartment complex and why it hit them so hard. Another thing that has really struck me as Ive talked to many, many families in the immigrant communities of New York and New Jersey is that many people who have been hospitalized or died, they didnt even know if they had pre-existing conditions because they never sought out a doctor or treatment unless it was really an emergency that youd go to the emergency room for, like an accident or a broken leg. They would just kind of soldier on.\n\nmichael barbaro\n\nBut what seems so striking to me about Javier is that he was attentive to his health. He tried over and over again to get a test, and it was such an ordeal. There were so many obstacles.\n\nannie correal\n\nI mean, its maddening looking back, and I think its worth keeping in mind that thats what a lot of people were experiencing, whether they were immigrants or not, citizens or not. People were kind of groping around in the dark and not understanding how this virus worked or how quickly it could become a critical illness. I think what is interesting, though, is that in this family, one man died in the hospital, and although his life wasnt saved, he had doctors and nurses and people checking his oxygen. And the other man stayed at home and drank home remedies of ginger and garlic and never saw a doctor at all. And I think you have to multiply that scenario by many, many thousands to understand why it will be a long time before we begin to grasp the effect on the marginalized communities in America, including the undocumented, because so many people died at home.\n\nmichael barbaro\n\nHm. Of course, the irony here is that the man in the hospital, the man at home  having the privileges that one brother did, citizenship, health care, access to a hospital, it didnt seem to make a difference.\n\nannie correal\n\nRight. And thats the irony, that the outcomes were the same.\n\n[music]\n\nmichael barbaro\n\nAnnie, I wonder how the twins are making sense of all this. I mean, this uncle that they idolized and who had such a vision for what America could be for the family and who did everything right, he was not protected from this virus.\n\nannie correal\n\nYeah, I think that thats a challenge that theyre grappling with because I dont suggest that these young women are naive at all. But I think seeing this, seeing it firsthand that their uncle who did everything that one is supposed to do, the fact that he still somehow fell through the cracks and that he wasnt seen right away, I think it created a lot of confusion and maybe even disillusionment. This sense of their community was still somewhat on the margins even when they tried to do everything right.\n\n[praying in spanish]\n\nmichael barbaro\n\nAnnie, when did you last speak with the twins, and how are they doing?\n\nannie correal\n\nSo the last time I spoke with them was in the first weeks of May, and they had been living out there in rural Pennsylvania just with their brother and their parents and staying far away from everyone else.\n\n[praying in spanish]\n\nannie correal\n\nSo Melanie tells me that every day, they gather for a prayer circle. And one recent evening, theyd had a really hard day.\n\nmelanie cruz morales Some days, we have really bad, sad days. And that day was just sad.\n\nannie correal\n\nAnd the twins are really asking themselves, what are we even doing here?\n\nmelanie cruz morales Within this pandemic, weve been reflecting our entire life and time here in the United States and really saying, is it worth it? Why are we even here?\n\nannie correal\n\nSo that night, Sheila asks God for some sign.\n\nsheila cruz morales I dont ask for much, but I need a sign to keep going.\n\nannie correal\n\nAnd later that night, Melanie gets an email. Theres an update from Georgetown.\n\nmelanie cruz morales And I was like, oh my god, like, Im not ready to hear any news whatsoever anymore. Like, throw the whole phone away. I dont want to see it. So I said, just me and Sheila and my brother are going to be in our room, and were going to open our decision. And I opened my notification first, but in that moment, I really, really forgot how to read, and I couldnt understand anything until  it took me like a good minute for me to finish reading the letter, and then thats when I started screaming. And I started crying. And I was, like, I got in.\n\nannie correal\n\nShes been admitted to her first choice and been invited to transfer to Georgetown to finish her four year degree.\n\nmelanie cruz morales Then my sister checked her phone at the same time, and she also started screaming. And then we were both like, Oh my god, we both got in. And it was the happiest day that my family and I had had in the longest time because we had done everything to make this possible, and we had forgotten about it for a second because of this pandemic. But like I said, it was always in the back of my mind. And it was a sign.\n\nannie correal\n\nSo suddenly, they go from, you know, sort of having to be the adults in the family to getting to be excited 19-year-olds again.\n\nmelanie cruz morales Dear Melanie, it gives me great pleasure to inform you that the committee of admissions has admitted you to Georgetown University. I am happy to offer you a place at the university beginning in the fall of 2020. This year, the committee \n\nannie correal\n\nThey also saw it, as I understand it, as a bit of encouragement from their uncle Javier, because for all of the obstacles, he was a believer in the possibilities. And we all have to make sense of the things that happen to us one way or another. So whatever it means, it does offer them a little bit of relief, a sense that the future might hold good things in this country.\n\nmichael barbaro\n\nNot just awful things.\n\nannie correal\n\nNot just awful things.\n\nmelanie cruz morales One time in the summer, I was with him outside in the parking lot, and he was asking me about all these schools, and then he asked me, Where do you want to go after you graduate from Bergen? And I told him I want to go to this really good school in Washington D.C. Its called Georgetown. Bill Clinton went there, all these senators, congressmen, they all went there. And he was like, Wow, I know one day youre going to do it. I know that you and your sister are going to get in, and the day that you get accepted, Im going to post it on my Facebook and brag to all my friends that I have really smart nieces. annie correal So did you post on your Facebook so that his family could see and the family could see in Mexico? melanie cruz morales Yeah, I posted it. I know that my uncle knew. And I know that he was with me that day. And I know that hes proud and he believed in me and my sister. So its been hard, but I know that hes with us, and that gives me comfort. I never understood what people meant when they say  when they talk about when someone passes away, and theyre like, Theyre with you, you can feel them. But that night, I completely felt my uncle with me.\n\n[music]\n\nannie correal Well, again, I want to thank you for your tremendous generosity with your time and your experience. And I know that its hard and not easy. So I hope after this two and a half hour call, that you will breathe some fresh air and be with your family. melanie cruz morales Yes, I definitely will. But thank you again for giving me an opportunity to tell our story and document this. And I know that 10 years from now on, where Ill be able to look back as this and, whichever position I am able to be, that our story will help define the history and the moments that we are going through right now. annie correal Thank you again, Melanie. melanie cruz morales Youre welcome. Have a good night. annie correal Bye bye.\n\n[music]\n\nmichael barbaro\n\nThe Mexican government said that as of last week, close to 650 Mexican nationals have died from the coronavirus in the New York City area, by far the highest toll anywhere in the U.S. Sheila and Melanie have reached their goal of raising $30,000 to send their uncles remains back to Mexico. But for now, their ashes are still sitting inside of a church in New Jersey.\n\n[music]\n\nmichael barbaro\n\nWell be right back.\n\n[music]\n\nmichael barbaro\n\nHeres what else you need to know today. Over the holiday weekend, the U.S. death toll from the coronavirus reached nearly 100,000, a staggering milestone that the Trump administration at one point had predicted would never be reached.\n\narchived recording A month ago, you and President Trump were both talking about a total of 60,000 Covid-19 deaths. Early this coming week, were going to reach 100,000 deaths from the coronavirus, and those models that youre citing now talk about close to 150,000 deaths by August. What happened, doctor? archived recording (deborah birx) I think a few things are together \n\nmichael barbaro\n\nIn interviews on Sunday, White House pandemic coordinator Dr. Deborah Birx was asked about what turned out to be an inaccurate estimate of the death toll from the White House.\n\narchived recording (deborah birx) So from the beginning, and I think when we had that first briefing, we talked about 1.2 million to 2.4 million and 100,000 to 240,000 people succumbing to this incredibly aggressive virus. Those are the figures that we continue to stand by in this first wave.\n\nmichael barbaro\n\nMeanwhile, the Trump administration has banned travel from Brazil because of the outbreak there, adding the country to a growing list of nations, including China, the United Kingdom, and much of Europe, whose residents can no longer enter the U.S.\n\narchived recording (mike pence) What you hear the president saying today is just a very reasonable request of the governor of North Carolina. We all want to be in Charlotte. We love North Carolina. But \n\nmichael barbaro\n\nOn Monday, the president and vice president threatened to pull the Republican National Convention out of North Carolina this summer because the governor there cannot ensure full attendance under the states social distancing rules.\n\narchived recording (mike pence) I think the president is absolutely intent on ensuring that, as we see our nation continue to make steady progress on putting the coronavirus epidemic in the past, that come this August, well be able to come together in a safe and responsible venue and renominate President Donald Trump for four more years.\n\n[music]\n\nmichael barbaro'	b'The Story of Two Brothers From Mexico'	2020-05-26	[]	['mexico', 'cruz', 'uncle', 'javier', 'morales', 'correalso', 'hes', 'really', 'know', 'melanie', 'family', 'brothers']	b'annie correalSo her uncle Javier, Javier Morales, is the kind of father figure for her whole family.\nmelanie cruz morales He basically taught us a lot and prepared us for what life would be like here.\nAnd in the back of the apartment building, theres this really, really, really big parking lot.\nAnd it was just really, really nice, because he was so happy, and everyone was really happy.\nmelanie cruz morales And I was like, oh my god, like, Im not ready to hear any news whatsoever anymore.'

I was driving on my way home. And I began to feel that the car I had just purchased was a lemon because the wheels appeared to be running off the car. I managed to stop the car. And I looked in stupefaction at the road about 10 feet ahead of me and saw the road break open, and then, like two big halves of a huge sandwich, start moving like scissors back and forth, one half moving in one direction, the other half moving in the other direction. And all the time, while watching the road, it suddenly dawned on me that this was not an ordinary disaster, that it was perhaps one of the greatest disasters to hit North America. I kept thinking, what will Alaskans do now? What will Alaskans do now?\n\n[gentle music]\n\njohn mooallem\n\nThere are moments when the world we take for granted instantaneously changes, when reality is abruptly upended and the unimaginable overwhelms real life. We dont walk around thinking about that instability, but we know its always there. At random and without warning, a kind of terrible magic can switch on and scramble our lives. You may know the feeling. In 1964, it happened to Anchorage, Alaska and to a woman named Genie Chance.\n\nmichael barbaro\n\nFrom The New York Times, Im Michael Barbaro. This is The Daily. Today, the great Alaska earthquake was the biggest earthquake to ever hit North America. John Mooallem, author of the book This is Chance!, on the story of that disaster and the voice that held the state together. Its Friday, May 22.\n\njohn mooallem\n\nSunday, February 23, 1964, a month before the earthquake \n\n[small dogs bark]\n\n just before 1:00 PM.\n\narchived recording Dog team on the trail.\n\njohn mooallem\n\nThe deciding heat of the world championship sled dog races was about to start.\n\narchived recording They have estimated the crowd as high as 12,000 people.\n\njohn mooallem\n\nAnd all of Anchorage, it seemed, had gathered downtown to watch.\n\narchived recording And this is the one time of the year, the only time of the year, we ever get that many people into Alaskas largest city. And I think its a wonderful thing.\n\njohn mooallem\n\nThe races were one of the longest running traditions in a community that didnt have a lot of traditions yet, something for the fledgling city to look forward to in the coldest, loneliest stretch of winter.\n\narchived recording Yes, you are thanks to the City of Anchorage. But well be back with more after this important message. (SINGING) Buckle up for safety. Buckle up.\n\njohn mooallem\n\nAnchorage, Alaska in 1964 was a blotch of Western civilization in the middle of emptiness. Alaska had only become the countrys 49th state five years earlier. And it was often disregarded as a kind of free-floating addendum to the rest of America.\n\narchived recording (SINGING) Now listen to the saga of \n\njohn mooallem\n\nBut Anchorage was Alaskas biggest and proudest city, a community whose essential spirit, one visitor wrote, reached aggressively and greedily to grasp the future, impatient with any suggestion that such things take time.\n\narchived recording (SINGING)  Black Label Beer.\n\n[whistle]\n\njohn mooallem\n\nIt was a modern-day frontier town that imagined it was a metropolis \n\narchived recording OK, back here with more action.\n\njohn mooallem\n\n straining to make itself real.\n\narchived recording Heres the countdown now.

At 37 years old, she was strikingly beautiful, with short, wavy blond hair and high-cut bangs. She grew up in a small town in Texas, where shed met her husband, Winston, and had three kids. There, Winston sold used cars, but he wasnt particularly good at it. Even when he did manage to land a commission, he had a habit of blowing it on a steak dinner and drinks before he got home. The financial strain started to destabilize their marriage. And the pressure fell on Genie to hold the family together and make their precarious life feel safe. Were not poor, shed tell her children. We just dont have any money. At the time, a wave of young Texans was decamping for jobs in Alaska. And Winston was convinced it was a land of opportunity, where anyone willing to work could wind up flush. But Genie hesitated. Alaska didnt sound like a fun adventure to her. It sounded desolate and dreadful, like moving to the Moon. Then again, if life didnt improve for her and Winston in Anchorage, maybe divorce might feel a little more feasible there. Shed be at the edge of the world. Nobody would have to know. But Alaska didnt solve Winstons troubles with money. And before long, the Chance family was unable to pay the rent. Winston said not to worry, hed sell some cars soon. Genie worried. And this is what a good wife is supposed to do? she wrote. Just wait at home for her man to bring money in to pay the bills and feed the family? If other wives do it all the time, why cant I learn to relax and let it happen? She went to Winston weeping one day, she said. And he told her, well, if youre so worried about paying the rent, why are you sitting on your fat fanny? Get out there and get a job. Genie was speechless. Two weeks later, she got herself hired at KENI.\n\narchived recording Coming up Cordova Hill, lets go out to Genie Chance. archived recording (genie chance) Yeah, [INAUDIBLE]. And hes just now at the bottom of Cordova Hill. Here he is. His dogs too are looking real good.\n\nmichael barbaro\n\nAt the time, women broadcasters typically covered fashion and homemaking or hosted on-air recipe swaps. But in her year and a half at the station, Genie had forged a role for herself as an industrious roving reporter. She covered crime, and the courts, and city hall. She reported from crab boats and missile sites, burning buildings and Inuit villages, and sled dog races.\n\narchived recording (genie chance) And immediately behind him, right on his heels is Dr. Lombard. So working real  no! No! Its reverse. Its reverse. Dr. Lombard \n\nmichael barbaro\n\nDuring the final stretch of the race, Genie lost herself in the excitement a little \n\narchived recording (genie chance)  both sides of dog and man alike working as a team \n\njohn mooallem\n\n and just started shouting oh and yes into her microphone as the mushers passed.\n\narchived recording (genie chance) Oh! Yes! And  oh!\n\njohn mooallem\n\nAnd another KENI broadcaster appeared to make a sly, off-color crack about her breathlessness on the air.\n\narchived recording (genie chance) What was the time when they came through here, Bill? archived recording Youre breathless, Gene. One minute, one hour, and \n\nmichael barbaro\n\nGenie tried to be gracious and stoic, to do what was expected of her without complaint. She figured this was the only way to defuse the discomfort of the men around her.\n\narchived recording (genie chance) Id like to thank all those who help make it possible for me to be a part of \n\nmichael barbaro\n\nAt the end of the sled dog races that afternoon, shed sign off by thanking not only all the KENI listeners and spectators \n\narchived recording (genie chance)  spectators who cheered me on.\n\njohn mooallem\n\n but her male co-workers too.\n\narchived recording (genie chance) And I want to thank you, too, [INAUDIBLE],, Tye Park, and Bob Fleming for allowing this little gal to be a part of the biggest broadcast show ever \n\nmichael barbaro\n\nAnd she was also sure to thank her husband.\n\narchived recording (genie chance)  my loving husband, Winston, who not only gave his permission but also his full cooperation, to our neighbor \n\njohn mooallem\n\n for his permission.\n\narchived recording (genie chance) Now, back to Seppala Center. archived recording Thank you, Genie. You did a fine job. And heres Mike Seffin with a dog [INAUDIBLE] coming right over the finish line. Boy \n\n[music]\n\njohn mooallem\n\nSometimes, the future falls open without a warning. The earthquake, when it came, would knock peoples lives off kilter so brutally and abruptly that its power seemed to reverberate forever. Some people like Genie would find their lives oriented differently in its aftermath. Others would find their entire worldview had changed. More than half a century later, an attorney in Anchorage would explain, even now, I can look at this solid ground out my window and know its not permanent. It can change anytime. It just moves. Everything moves. Anyway, this is who Genie was and where everything stood before what it stood on moved. Friday, March 27, 1964, the night of the earthquake.\n\narchived recording (genie chance) On the night of Good Friday, 1964, I was writing a letter to a friend in Juno.\n\njohn mooallem\n\nAround 5:30, Genie Chance sat at the typewriter in her bedroom, stealing some time alone before fixing dinner for her husband Winston and their three children, eight-year-old Jan, 11-year-old Albert, and 13-year-old Winston Jr., or Wince, who just then appeared at her bedroom.\n\narchived recording (genie chance) My son Wince came to me and said that he just had to get down to the bookstore to get \n\njohn mooallem\n\nHed forgotten to buy a copy of the Red Cross lifesaving manual that he was supposed to bring to his swimming class the next morning.\n\narchived recording (genie chance) And I said please, for heavens sakes, when you have to have something, dont wait until the last minute. Youve known \n\njohn mooallem\n\nSo Genie pulled on a pair of boots and a parka and headed out.\n\narchived recording (genie chance) So Wince and I got in the car. And I was still in somewhat of a unhappy mood about having to make a last-minute errand downtown.\n\njohn mooallem\n\nAt 5:36, snow is falling as Genie and Wince headed downtown. The city was quiet. As they approached the intersection of C Street and 9th, the traffic light turned red.\n\narchived recording (genie chance) As I touched my brake, the car began to bounce.\n\nmichael barbaro\n\nThe car started bucking.\n\narchived recording (genie chance) So I said, oh, no. And Wince says, whats the matter? And I said, a blowout.\n\njohn mooallem\n\nAnd Genie assumes shed blown a tire.\n\narchived recording (genie chance) And then it got worse.\n\njohn mooallem\n\nShe gripped the wheel. Wince held onto to his seat beside her. For a moment, they bounced violently without speaking a word.\n\narchived recording (genie chance) Nothing was said between us for a few minutes. And I said, you know, its not a blowout. It must be a hard wind. And he said, boy, its a wind all right. But the car bounced worse and worse. And I lowered my window. And I heard a banging \n\n[distorted music]\n\n this clang banging. And I looked across. And on one corner of the intersection \n\njohn mooallem\n\nCars parked in a line were slamming into one another and separating again, like a grotesque accordion opening and closing.\n\narchived recording (genie chance) I saw down the street to my left two people holding on to each other, trying to stand up. Three people came \n\njohn mooallem\n\nThe world and everything in it appeared to be convulsing. Genies eyes were seeing it, but her mind couldnt organize all this information into a coherent story.\n\narchived recording (genie chance) The car continued to bounce and bounce.\n\njohn mooallem\n\nSuddenly, she watched the road roll away from the car \n\narchived recording (genie chance) It never did crack. It rolled.\n\njohn mooallem\n\n as though some humpbacked shadow creature were surging under its surface, heading for town. Finally, Genie found a word that could fasten together this chaos in her mind.\n\narchived recording (genie chance) And I said, Wince, this is an earthquake. Wince could only say, yeah.\n\n[gentle music]\n\njohn mooallem\n\nThe great Alaska earthquake lasted 4 and 1/2 minutes. It overwhelmed people the way the strongest emotions do. It was pure sensation, coming on faster than the intellects ability to register it. It was amazing what details people noticed, the focal points their minds locked on to when the world went blurry. On Fourth Avenue, a high school track star watched the window of a stationery store rattle and explode. And he stood there, admiring the perfect, hurdling form of the man who came leaping out of it. At Presbyterian Hospital, one man watched blood seeping into the hall from under a doorway, like a scene in a horror movie. It took a second for him to realize that the hospitals blood bank had broken open and spilled. At the J.C. Penney department store, a 15-year-old in the elevator with some friends watched a book that one of them had dropped suddenly levitate off the floor and hang weightless in midair right in front of him. For a split second, it was like they were in orbit. The elevator was falling.\n\n[intense music]\n\nBut Genies mind had already turned to reporting the news.\n\narchived recording (genie chance) And as soon as it stopped, I looked up. And I could see that our television tower was still standing. And \n\njohn mooallem\n\nShe assumed her station would have power back on soon and that the 6 oclock news broadcast would go on as usual. That meant she had less than 20 minutes to put together a story.\n\narchived recording (genie chance) And I knew we had no power by the fact that the traffic lights went out. But I knew that our very ingenious engineers would have us on the air very shortly. And not realize \n\njohn mooallem\n\nSo Genie sped to the public safety building, where the police and fire departments were headquartered, to round up some details for a quick report.\n\narchived recording (genie chance) As I dashed in, I saw that all of their huge, heavy filing cabinets and desks were thrown face down on the floor. And my son, Wince, came running in the door. And he yelled, come quick. Penneys is falling. Well, he \n\njohn mooallem\n\nStanding in the doorway of the public safety building, they could see the brand-new J.C. Penney department store. The building was a point of pride in Anchorage. Penneys was one of the first major chain retailers to believe in Alaska enough to build in the city.\n\narchived recording (genie chance) But as I stood there and watched, I saw \n\njohn mooallem\n\nBut now, as Genie and Wince watched through the flurry of snow \n\narchived recording (genie chance) Big slabs of concrete walls silently break loose and start toward the ground. And \n\njohn mooallem\n\nThe tremendous concrete panel from the exterior started to swing away from the building, as though on a hinge.\n\narchived recording (genie chance) And it fell to the street with a roar, that deafening roar.\n\njohn mooallem\n\nWith the facade peeled off, parts of the store were now open to the cold air, exposed like the rooms of a dollhouse.\n\narchived recording (genie chance) And Wince looked at me. And I saw horror in his eyes.\n\n[gentle music]\n\njohn mooallem\n\nAll at once, she registered the extent of the wreckage surrounding her. A voice said something about people buried in the rubble. A group of men came running down the street, yelling Fourth Avenue is gone. And behind them, Genie could see the roof of a familiar building resting on the street, jabbed into the pavement at an incomprehensible angle.\n\narchived recording (genie chance) Then was the first time that I thought, the first thing I must do before I can go any further is get my family together and make sure everything is all right. I wheeled out of there and headed home. Oh, before we got home, I could see the house was still standing. And I remember breathing out loud, thank god. And Wince \n\njohn mooallem\n\nAs she pulled up, Jan and Albert shot out of the neighbors house across the street. Wince leapt out of the car and ran to his sister and brother.\n\narchived recording (genie chance) I said, Penneys has fallen down, and there is more damage downtown. And Al then pulled off from me, and he looked at me very soberly, and he said, Im all right. Dont worry about me. Go on and do your job.\n\njohn mooallem\n\nAll three Chance children began to understand without being told that their mother would be leaving again.\n\n[upbeat music]\n\nGenie was proud of how self-sufficient her kids had become. But whatever pride she felt was undercut by guilt. She knew her family was growing independent of her out of necessity, because she wasnt around as much as other mothers and wives were. Down in the lower 48, the womens movement was underway. But Anchorage was 1,500 miles away from the rest of America. And feminism wasnt a word Genie used. Her struggle to balance work and family felt like a problem unique to her. And isolated moments could trigger self-doubt. At breakfast one morning a few weeks earlier, the family was watching through the kitchen window as their neighbor scraped the ice off her husbands Cadillac before he left for work. This was the custom among many Anchorage wives. But in the Chance home, the roles were reversed. Winston warmed up the car for Genie. Now, Winston asked her, honey, if I get you a Cadillac like that, would you scrape the ice off and warm it up yourself? There must have been a tinge of disgruntlement in his voice because, before Genie could answer, eight-year-old Jan interrupted to remind her father that he was actually very lucky. Its not everyone who gets to warm up the car for Genie Chance. It was funny, but uncomfortable. And in hindsight, it might feel ominous, too, since after the earthquake, the more successful Genie became, the more Winston seethed.\n\n[music]\n\nIt was nearly six oclock, about 20 minutes since the quake, the last half hour of daylight.\n\narchived recording (genie chance) So I headed immediately back down to the downtown area, still thoroughly confident we would be on the air in a very short time and I would have to have something to say. And \n\njohn mooallem\n\nAs Genie headed back downtown, she kept her transistor radio tuned to KENI, hoping the station would be back on air in time for the hourly newscast. But so far, nothing, only static.\n\narchived recording (genie chance) I went on down toward Penneys on the \n\njohn mooallem\n\nWithin minutes, she was back at J.C. Penney.\n\narchived recording (genie chance) And got the car parked about a half block \n\njohn mooallem\n\nShe parked and approached the store, but stopped short in front of a slab of something in the snow. She stared at it, mesmerized and repulsed, but couldnt place what it was. She remembered, as a girl in Texas, watching her father kill off his few remaining hogs after a snowstorm and hang their fleshless hindquarters from the rafters of the barn. This thing in the snow reminded Genie of that somehow. Finally, a man shouted an explanation to her. It was half a woman, he said. Hed seen her get struck by the falling debris.\n\n[ominous music]\n\nGenie moved on quickly.\n\narchived recording (genie chance) I went on over to Fourth Avenue to survey the damage there so that I could make a report. And I was horrified to discover that two whole blocks had simply fallen into a crack that had opened up, and there was no street under them.\n\njohn mooallem\n\nFor two whole blocks, everything was wedged in a ragged chasm that had ripped open under the street.\n\narchived recording (genie chance) Fourth Avenue has just collapsed. Its just collapsed.\n\njohn mooallem\n\nSoon, an aftershock struck. The windows of a bank started popping, spraying glass across the sidewalk ahead of Genie as she headed back to her car. Her transistor radio still tuned to KENI continued to broadcast static. It was snowing hard. The sun was setting, the city going dark.\n\narchived recording (genie chance) No telling how many people left at home without heat, and without power, and without telephones would think \n\njohn mooallem\n\nGenie knew that the citizens of Anchorage were scattered around, cut off from each other. The electrical grid was down. Most phone lines were dead. Thered be no way to know exactly what had happened or how thoroughly their world had been jumbled.\n\narchived recording (genie chance) I realized that if there is any way I can be of service, Ive got to do it.\n\n[static]\n\nI heard the weird strains of music coming over our KENI station.\n\n[distorted music]\n\nAnd I knew that our auxiliary unit had gotten on the air. We were on the air some way.\n\narchived recording Because of the disaster we have just experienced and emergency condition which now exists \n\njohn mooallem\n\nWhen an announcer finally broke through \n\narchived recording (genie chance) I called in.\n\njohn mooallem\n\n Genie called the station from the portable radio unit in her car, explaining that she was ready to make a report about the situation downtown.\n\narchived recording (genie chance) It has become obvious that the earthquake that struck Anchorage less than an hour ago was a major one. A great deal of damage \n\njohn mooallem\n\nShe spoke fast, taking sharp, quick breaths.\n\narchived recording (genie chance) The J.C. Penney building had two walls collapse. However, it is believed at this time that everyone who was inside the building managed to escape safely. There is a two-block portion on Fourth Avenue where the buildings just sunk into the ground.\n\njohn mooallem\n\nShe was astonished later when people told her she sounded calm.\n\narchived recording (genie chance) KENI will keep you informed throughout the night. So stay tuned to your radios. Check on your neighbors. See if they have transistor radios. If they dont, possibly they could move in with you and share one for the night. It seems like its going to be a long, cold night for Anchorage. So prepare to batten down the hatches. And stay tuned to KENI.\n\n[upbeat music]\n\njohn mooallem\n\nGenie drove back to the public safety building, where city officials were gathering. She told the fire chief and police chief that KENI was on the air again and that she had her mobile unit, ready to go live. They were free to use her rig to broadcast announcements. Without much thought, the police chief immediately offloaded that job on Genie. She was going to be the one talking to Anchorage, he told her.\n\n[static]\n\narchived recording (genie chance) Yes, Genie Chance inside civil defense headquarters here at the public safety building at the corner of 6th and C in Anchorage. We would like to \n\njohn mooallem\n\nShe started reeling off the information shed collected, taking uncertain stock of Anchorages wounds.\n\narchived recording (genie chance) But there is apparently a great deal of damage just west of L Street there at Ninth Avenue. Of course, weve already  We have received word from the state police that the Eagle River bridge is passable. We had  The two docks owned by the oil companies down there at Seward are currently on fire.\n\njohn mooallem\n\nShe listed the locations of public shelters opening up for the displaced and started directing equipment and personnel around the city.\n\narchived recording (genie chance) Anybody who has a spare chlorinator, they are in dire need of a chlorinator there at Providence Hospital. All electricians and plumbers, please go to Building 700. All line personnel, report to work as soon as possible.\n\n[whooshing]\n\nWell, were ready to go again. The plug got kicked here, and we ran out of power. I thought maybe it was one of those little tremors. I dont know if youre sitting up there in the studio. To contact Chuck Dummond. Chuck Dummond. He is needed urgently to install the chlorinator at Providence Hospital. Providence Hospital needs six cases of 6-inch plaster of Paris. This is a message for Mr. Grace. If he can manage to get that \n\njohn mooallem\n\nThe city managers spoke through her \n\narchived recording (genie chance) All right, any fuel or \n\njohn mooallem\n\n ordering her to put out a call for diesel fuel.\n\narchived recording (genie chance)  diesel fuel oil down at the site of the turbine \n\nmichael barbaro\n\nA public health official stood over her shoulder.\n\narchived recording (genie chance) In order to make it pure, you want \n\njohn mooallem\n\n while she repeated his instructions for purifying snow for drinking.\n\narchived recording (genie chance) You add 1 teaspoon of household bleach to every 5 gallons of water. Be sure not to just melt it, but boil it also. Right now, that is the latest we have to report from the inside civil defense \n\njohn mooallem\n\nGenie understood that everyone would be trapped together for the foreseeable future, in the snow, in the dark, with no electricity, in below freezing temperatures. Under those circumstances, she wrote later, mass hysteria would have meant total destruction.\n\narchived recording (genie chance) The chlorinator, were happy to report, has been installed at Providence Hospital. Chuck Dummond did arrive.\n\njohn mooallem\n\nEssentially, she was doing her job. She was talking to Anchorage on the radio. As one man put it, Genie Chance was telling everyone, youre not alone.\n\narchived recording (genie chance) KENI radio will fit in where we are needed and do our best to carry on 24 hours a day. We have another message to Mr. Nolly.\n\njohn mooallem\n\nAnd thats how the first hours unfolded. But something else was happening that Friday night too, the thread of this story that, as time passed, would come to feel almost like folklore.\n\narchived recording (genie chance) Mr. And Mrs. R.W. Fisher have lost their children. They cant find them. Mr. And Mrs. Fisher are at the home of Charles Ball. Mr. and Mrs. Fisher \n\njohn mooallem\n\nAt the public safety building, ordinary people who were separated from their children or other family members started stumbling up to Genies counter and asking her for help. They were converging on Genie, desperate to know if somebody they loved was safe, to find one another, to shout across their fractured city in the dark.\n\narchived recording (genie chance) Bill Noble would like to get a message if at all possible as to their whereabouts and if they are all right. Meryl Sleeger, who lives on 86th Avenue, please come home. Mr. and Mrs. Dick Fisher are still here at the police headquarters at 6th and C, waiting for any word of their children. Their home went off the bluff. Theyre out there in the Turnagain area, where we understand a great deal of damage took place.\n\njohn mooallem\n\nThey hoped that Genie could amplify their voices with her own.\n\n[gentle music]\n\nAnd then, as the night went on \n\njohn mooallem\n\nA message to Kenneth Sadler, Mrs. Sadler is fine. Kenneth Sadler, hes out in the bush and listens on a transistor radio. Mrs. Sadler is fine. A message to Walter Hart at Kenai, Lee Hart is fine. We have another message that Bob DeLose is all right. Tim Murphy and Bill Somerville at Point Hope, your families are A-OK. Frank Smith at Beluga, your family is safe and at the home of Red Dodge. I also have received a report from a person who is monitoring stations from the lower 48 states  All the people, one after another, calling in to report that they were OK. You could to hear the potential death toll in the city gradually ticking down. And with each small declaration of survival that aired, you could imagine a constellation of affirming flames slowly lighting the emptiness outside. Finally \n\narchived recording (genie chance) Ive been so involved trying to assist down here in the coordination of the messages \n\njohn mooallem\n\n it was Genies turn.\n\narchived recording (genie chance)  that I really hadnt stopped to think how worried and concerned my parents must be. So if my friends in Fairbanks would take down a message for me and get the word to my family in Bonham, Texas, that the Chance family is all right. Place a collect call to Judge A.S. Broadfoot, B-R-O-A-D-F-O-O-T, at Bonham, Texas, and tell him that the Chance family is all right. Ill appreciate this if the message can get to Texas, for I know that my family, as well as everybody elses, is very concerned.\n\njohn mooallem\n\nIt was still dark early on Saturday morning when the telephone rang at the home of Judge and Mrs. A.S. Broadfoot in Bonham, Texas. The caller explained that he had just received a phone call from his son, who lived in Fairbanks. Thered been a terrible earthquake in Alaska, his son told him. But believe it or not, he was listening to the Broadfoots daughter, Genie Chance, covering the disaster on the radio right now. And hed just heard her ask for someone to phone her parents in Texas and tell them, the Chance family is all right.\n\n[peaceful music]\n\nThe phone rang again. This time, it was a perfect stranger, a military officer in Fairbanks calling collect, just like Genie had instructed on the air. He was passing on the same message. The Chance family is all right. From then on, the phone rang constantly, Genies mother wrote. I just let down and bawled in a boo-hoo of all time. Back in Anchorage, 13 hours after the quake hit, Genie was still on the air. Shed been working straight through the night. And as the city went to sleep in the early hours of the morning, despite their power being out and their phone lines down, theyd been connected to one another once again. Saturday, March 28, 1964, the day after the earthquake.\n\narchived recording [INAUDIBLE] were coming in on an approach now. All right. Theres a crater like the surface of the Moon. Its obviously \n\njohn mooallem\n\nEarly that morning, as news of the great Alaska earthquake filtered into the outside word, word reached a small team of sociologists at the Disaster Research Center at Ohio State University. It was a brand new institute, funded by the Department of Defense, to send social scientists as quickly as possible to wherever a disaster struck.\n\narchived recording These beautiful houses are just lying in the water, tumbled over. Theyre \n\njohn mooallem\n\nThe Cold War was escalating. And the military was desperate to prepare America for the possibility of nuclear war. One of its presiding assumptions was that a bomb dropped on the United States wouldnt just cause physical destruction, but pandemonium, lawlessness, and violence among the survivors, too. The government needed to get a handle on how to manage that chaos. And theyd locked on to natural disasters as realistic proxies. Each community hit by an earthquake, hurricane, or flood would be like a laboratory, a full-scale simulation in which a team of sociologists could scrutinize that breakdown of society in advance.\n\narchived recording It just takes my breath away, and disheartens me. Its really hard to describe it.\n\njohn mooallem\n\nNow, the sociologists in Ohio were hearing rumors that downtown Anchorage had been swallowed in a ball of fire. The trauma and confusion would be horrific.\n\narchived recording  be the entire force facility has just been wiped out.\n\njohn mooallem\n\nProfessionally speaking, it was too good to be true.\n\narchived recording Just has to be seen to be believed. You cant hardly believe it.\n\njohn mooallem\n\nThey roused me out of bed, one of their grad students said. I threw on my duds and I was off to the airport in an hour and a half. But when the disaster researchers started touching down \n\narchived recording (genie chance) And well be able to notify you where you will be able to go get C rations to feed the \n\njohn mooallem\n\n they couldnt find the chaos theyd come to document.\n\narchived recording (genie chance) So we are making arrangements at this time for civil defense and the military to supply C rations that can be carried to these public shelters. Stay tuned to KENI and we will be able to tell you when and where you can pick up C rations. Now back to you.\n\njohn mooallem\n\nThe sociologists learned, for example, that when Presbyterian Hospital started filling with gas after the quake, Boy Scouts, whod been distributing phone books in the neighborhood, help to walk all the hospitals patients down three or four flights of stairs. And an armada of taxis and other civilian drivers pulled up outside to evacuate everyone to a second hospital across town.\n\narchived recording (genie chance) We are still having a number of people coming in and offering their services here in the public safety building. I believe everything is pretty well under control. And survey teams \n\njohn mooallem\n\nOutside the crumbling J.C. Penney building, bystanders rushed to dig people out and worked together to tow away a huge section of the fallen concrete facade, then extract a woman whod been crushed beneath it in her station wagon.\n\narchived recording (genie chance) It was very heartwarming, of course, to see the way these families did get back together because quite a few of them were separated.\n\njohn mooallem\n\nEverywhere in Anchorage, clusters of ordinary people had gone straight to work, spontaneously, teaming up and switching on like a kind of civic immune response. They just started solving whatever problems they saw in front of them and often surprised themselves by how capably they were getting the job done. Genie was one of those people.\n\narchived recording (genie chance) All military and civilian personnel are giving a terrific effort right now on an evaluation, search and \n\njohn mooallem\n\nOne man told the sociologists, everybody jumped right in. Everybody was trying to do a little bit of everything for everybody. Since then, an entire field of sociology has documented the same phenomenon in disasters around the world. And eventually, two founders of the Disaster Research Center would theorize about why, why disasters seemed to bring out the best in people. In ordinary life, they wrote, we suffer alone. Any struggle, any pain winds up isolating us from other people or even making us resentful of everybody else, who seem to somehow have it easier. But in a disaster, an entire community suffers together. Trauma and even death, the stuff that we suppress in daily life, spills out as a public phenomenon for everyone to see. The present becomes all-consuming. The past and the future fall away. And all those who share in the experience, the researchers wrote, are brought together in a very powerful, psychological sense. And something else happens. When everything gets scrambled, our assumptions about each other and ourselves get scrambled too. As another sociologist put it, the instant disaster strikes, life becomes like molten metal. It enters a state of flux from which it must reset upon a principle, a creed, or purpose. It is shaken, perhaps violently, out of rut and routine. What hes really saying is in catastrophe, theres an opportunity for transformation.\n\n[upbeat music]\n\nGenie finally stepped away from her microphone at three oclock on Saturday. But she was back two hours later, claiming to have taken a nap. Journalists were descending on Anchorage by then. And Genie spoke with one group from Europe, and was taken aback when they instantly recognized her name. Oh, yes, they told her, weve heard you on the radio. Her voice had traveled around the world, spraying out of Anchorage on an array of convoluted paths.\n\narchived recording (genie chance) All electricians and plumbers of Fort Ridge, go to Building 700 immediately. Howard \n\njohn mooallem\n\nOne originated at KENIs sister station in Fairbanks, which also relayed that signal to a radio station in Juneau.\n\narchived recording (genie chance) Mrs. Sadler is fine. Kenneth Sadler is out in the bush and listens on a transistor \n\njohn mooallem\n\nThen man in Juneau telephoned a radio station in Seattle and seemed to simply hold his phone up to the radio and let the broadcast play.\n\narchived recording (genie chance) Lee Hart is fine. Jim Murphy and Bill \n\njohn mooallem\n\nThe announcer in Seattle threw that call onto his own airwaves. The sound relayed, and relayed, and relayed again was thin, distant, and hissy.\n\narchived recording (genie chance) Bill Noble would like to get a message, if at all possible, as to their whereabouts.\n\njohn mooallem\n\nBut there was Genie, unmistakably, churning through personal messages from Alaskans separated from their loved ones.\n\narchived recording (genie chance) Mr. And Mrs. Dick Fisher still all here at the \n\njohn mooallem\n\nShe later wrote to an editor in London, just a little old housewife and mother helping out with the family finances being heard around the world? How crazy can this world be? Without realizing it, Genie had become famous.\n\n[jazz music]\n\narchived recording This is Richard Peters speaking from the State House of Representatives \n\njohn mooallem\n\nThe next week, as Alaskas legislature began putting together a plan to rebuild the state, the speaker of the House called the session to order by recognizing Genie. She got a standing ovation.

Im sure that any woman could do the same thing. It just so happened that it was my fate.\n\nmichael barbaro\n\nAs the story of the disaster started to be written, Genie became one of its recurring characters. The media called her the voice of Alaska, the stand-in for the resourcefulness and composure of an entire state. The quake had temporarily unraveled the fabric of society. And Genie had found the space to slip through. But then that fabric stitched together again, and Genie didnt fit. She asked KENI for a raise, but was told that she was already making the highest salary for a woman. She quit the same day. At home, Winston felt increasingly overshadowed by her. It turns out hed been physically abusing Genie for years. And now, it got worse. Eventually, she was through with it. She filed for a divorce. Soon, people around Anchorage were asking her if shed ever thought about running for office. And shed spend the better part of the 70s in the Alaska State Legislature, ramming through as much progressive legislation as she could, often while wearing a frosted blond wig, short skirt, and white gogo boots on the chamber floor. As one of Genies young aides put it to me, she was making up for lost time. January 8, 2017, 53 years after the earthquake. Im sitting in a basement in Juneau, Alaska, surrounded by boxes of Genie Chances things. Genies daughter Jan has kept them all here for years, not knowing what to do with them. There were 38 boxes in all, filled with reel-to-reel recordings of radio broadcasts, old diaries, and letters, and photographs. And Id spend days in Jans basement over the next couple of years looking through all of it, at every document inside, from a lock of Genies baby hair to one of her campaign posters, with a photo of her in a fur-lined parka, holding a radio microphone. And that image of her might have seemed like the fairy-tale ending to the story of Genie and the earthquake, except I was starting to realize that this story is about the deceptiveness of such endings, the potential for circumstances that feel conclusive and stable to randomly come apart. Because there were more boxes after that, lots of them. And in those, Genie lost her seat in the legislature to a slimy Californian transplant who ran a bareknuckled campaign. Wince, the son whod been with her in the car the evening of the quake, was diagnosed with cancer and died in 1990, just shy of his 40th birthday. And her other son, Al, was in and out of rehab and would die a few years after that. Then Genies second husband died. And as soon as he was gone, Genie was hit by dementia, hard. Thats why the boxes were there, unopened. Genie had packed them up, planning to write her autobiography, but she never got the chance.\n\n[mellow music]\n\nIll be honest. It was pretty depressing. Id never heard of Genie Chance. Id never even heard of the Great Alaska Earthquake. And it was unsettling that something so consequential, the most powerful earthquake in North America, could recede so invisibly into history. To take in a strangers entire life at that speed, blurred and compressed so dramatically, started to make me feel like maybe time itself was a slow-moving natural disaster that eventually shakes everything apart. And from such a telescopic distance, it was impossible not to recognize the form that all our lives assume, a forgettable blip, a meaningless straight line from birth to death. At some point, sitting in that basement, I started picturing my own boxes in one of my own daughters basements one day. And then I imagined how many other sets of boxes are already out there and how many people hadnt left boxes at all. But  and maybe this parts harder to explain  it doesnt feel depressing to me now because I also know that, sealed inside this vulnerable little snow globe we call the present, life feels anything but forgettable and meaningless, and that recognizing the starkness of it all, the course our straight line is taking, liberates us into the present. It imbues life with immediacy, just like a disaster does. And just like disaster, it gives us the chance to expand those boundaries the only way we can, by reaching out, by connecting our lives to the lives of others, by thatching our lines together like a net.\n\narchived recording (genie chance) Jim Murphy and Bill Summerville at Point Hope, your families are A-OK.

This is The Daily.\n\n[music]\n\nToday: From the earliest days of the coronavirus, health officials believed that it largely spared children and teenagers, but recently that belief has been challenged. My colleague Pam Belluck on the story of a 14-year-old boy whose case is being studied to better understand the impact of the virus on children. Its Thursday, May 21. Pam, when does this understanding that we all seem to have about the coronavirus and how it spares children, when does that start to change?\n\npam belluck\n\nIn late April, there was this bulletin that was sent out by a pediatric health service in the United Kingdom. It just said were noticing some kids, not very many. They seem to have these symptoms of inflammation. We dont really know what this is about. Some have tested positive for coronavirus. Some havent. And it was just kind of saying we think were seeing something. So I talked to my editors about it, and we were trying to figure out whether we should explore it more at that point. And we decided, well, we dont really know a whole lot. It seems like a small number of cases. We cant even say for certain that its connected to coronavirus, and so we just kind of put it aside for a bit and watch it. And then I think a couple days later I got an email from a hospital in New York City. The person said weve got two cases of this syndrome that theyve been talking about in the UK. If you want to talk to somebody, let us know. And thats how I got to know Jack McMorrow and his family in their apartment in Queens.\n\nmichael barbaro\n\nAnd tell me about this visit.\n\npam belluck\n\nIts a very warm, kind of cozy apartment. There are all these welcome home banners and balloons for Jack. And the family, Jack and his father John and his mother Doris, they just immediately welcomed me and our photographer Gabriela in, and they all just start talking. I just know immediately I have to put on my tape recorder because theres no way Im going to capture all this writing things down.\n\njohn mcmorrow He sent him a letter. jack mcmorrow Yes. Can I explain something  john mcmorrow Oh, come on. Im giving backdrop here. You can explain all you want. jack mcmorrow No. First of all, I wanted to talk about how the virus was behaving like a bacteria. john mcmorrow OK, youre gonna, but I just want to say  jack mcmorrow That was way back when. john mcmorrow  Randall  jack mcmorrow This things probably not picking up anything. doris stroman I hope you know shes taping all of you because  john mcmorrow Yeah, we barter like this all day long. doris stroman I got a bell from school  jack mcmorrow Stop with the bell. doris stroman  because they bicker. And I have to do this  john mcmorrow And its a timeout bell. doris stroman  and tell them to both go to each corner. jack mcmorrow Im sorry about all this chaotic  pam belluck Its wonderful. Its wonderful. [bell ringing] john mcmorrow And these cleaned arteries, they have to bring you right back. jack mcmorrow I was coherent at this time. john mcmorrow No, I know. But I know youve been jumping things, and I know when youre excited. jack mcmorrow Me jumping things? pam belluck Youre doing great. Youre doing great. jack mcmorrow Dad, you went from day one to me in the new I.C.U. Thats like a  doris stroman Do I need to get my bell? jack mcmorrow  huge jump. Dude, if  speaker Oh my God.\n\nmichael barbaro\n\nAnd tell me about this family. Who are they?\n\npam belluck\n\nSo Jacks father is John McMorrow.\n\njohn mcmorrow I know its your story, son.\n\npam belluck\n\nHe is a truck driver. He works as a Teamster for the film industry. He was recently laid off because of the pandemic. And his mother, Jacks mother, is Doris Stroman. She works at a lab school with five and six-year-old kids. She was wearing a mask that had The Rolling Stones tongue logo on it.\n\ndoris stroman  to figure out what was going on, starting with his pediatrician.\n\npam belluck\n\nAnd Jack is 14. Hes a ninth grader. He goes to Catholic school in Queens.\n\njack mcmorrow Yeah, and I have a whole bunch of other prop replica stuff. pam belluck So youre a Star Wars fan? jack mcmorrow I like Marvel a lot more than I do  pam belluck Oh, youre more of a Marvel person. OK. jack mcmorrow This is the Infinity Gauntlet from Avengers: Infinity War. I really have to  doris stroman They dont have time for that, Jack. jack mcmorrow This is why \n\nmichael barbaro\n\nAnd, Pam, what is the story that Jack and his parents tell you about this mysterious condition that he has?\n\npam belluck\n\nSo Jack was living the world of a New York City teenager in a pandemic.\n\ndoris stroman He never left the house. jack mcmorrow I havent left  john mcmorrow Since March 13, hes been in the house. doris stroman You never left the house. His school  john mcmorrow In his room, not even in here. doris stroman His Catholic school was one of the first that were closed. pam belluck Oh wow. doris stroman Didnt leave the house.\n\npam belluck\n\nMarch 12 was his last day of school, and he was doing the online learning thing.\n\ndoris stroman The one time he left the house other than  was to help me with the laundry and didnt want to touch anything. jack mcmorrow I took a shower after I came up from the laundry room. doris stroman Yeah, the kid just  jack mcmorrow Im a germophobe.\n\npam belluck\n\nThey just kind of stayed in. He was playing video games. He was chatting with his friends and that kind of thing. That was Jacks world.\n\n[music]\n\nThen in mid-April, Jacks parents start to notice some unusual things.\n\njohn mcmorrow Three weeks ago, he came out to me with a rash on the backside of his hands. jack mcmorrow Yeah. john mcmorrow I thought it was  jack mcmorrow It was bad. john mcmorrow  from the antibacterial soap. You know, Purell. Maybe hes doing it too much. Hes sensitive. jack mcmorrow Yeah, for like  we thought it was nothing more than eczema. john mcmorrow And then I think a day or two later he  jack mcmorrow No, it was like  john mcmorrow  your mother told you something about your eyes. She thought you were playing video games too much. jack mcmorrow Yeah, the eyes definitely, but I dont know if that was \n\npam belluck\n\nThey went on, and then the next week  and this was April 21 \n\njack mcmorrow I had got a normal fever, like 101, 102.\n\npam belluck\n\n Jack gets a fever.\n\njack mcmorrow I woke up one day with  doris stroman Sore throat. jack mcmorrow  sore throat. That was the first inflammation symptom that we had, which was  doris stroman On his hands, on his feet  jack mcmorrow On my hands, on my feet  doris stroman  on his neck. jack mcmorrow  and on my neck. That was the first \n\npam belluck\n\nAnd then around Friday, April 24, things start to get more severe.\n\njack mcmorrow That ended up being a swollen lymph node that grew to about the size of a tennis ball that you could visibly see coming on the side of my neck. doris stroman That was alarming.\n\npam belluck\n\nBy the next day, Saturday morning, he wakes up and hes got a 104.7 fever.\n\nmichael barbaro\n\nThat is a real fever.\n\npam belluck\n\nThat is a serious fever. They call their pediatrician at 7:30 in the morning, and she says, you guys, you got to get to an urgent care clinic, and they do. And there he gets a coronavirus test, but its going to be a couple days before he gets the results.\n\nmichael barbaro\n\nSo at this point they think it might perhaps be Covid-19.\n\npam belluck\n\nIt doesnt look like Covid-19, but were living in a world of Covid-19, and so I think that they are just sort of saying, well, lets just test him. We dont really know what this is. They send him home. Things just keep getting worse and worse. And by Monday morning, Jack wakes up. He cannot move. He cant move.\n\njack mcmorrow Because I wake up, and to even sit up, I screamed for them. And I had 105 almost.\n\npam belluck\n\nAnd hes lying on the couch.\n\njack mcmorrow I was sleeping with my socks on, and he kind of saw red. And he takes off my socks to reveal my entire feet, right here, had just rashes on the insides and bottom. doris stroman At that time  jack mcmorrow And my hands. doris stroman  we thought that was the apex. jack mcmorrow And my hands. doris stroman But it wasnt until days later. jack mcmorrow Yeah, they thought that was bad. My hands here on my palms, a little bit at the back, all rashes. So my skin  to even touch my skin and feel \n\npam belluck\n\nIts terribly, terribly frightening. And he says to me, I was very emotional.\n\njack mcmorrow Im using the word emotional to try and cover up the fact I was crying like a baby. It was so bad.\n\npam belluck\n\nThey happen to have a home blood pressure monitor, so they take his blood pressure. And this is where, as if all of these symptoms werent alarming enough and frightening enough, the blood pressure is very low. And so they know they had to take him to the hospital. They had to figure out how to get him out of the house. He cant move. So John and Jack kind of demonstrate this for me.\n\njack mcmorrow I put my hands on his arms like this and, not kidding, shuffled my way. john mcmorrow And I had to then hold him up  jack mcmorrow With his arms.\n\npam belluck\n\nJohn picks him up, puts Jacks feet on top of Johns feet, and then walks backward out the apartment door, sort of shuffling Jack along.\n\ndoris stroman And when we got to the hospital  john mcmorrow They took a wheelchair. doris stroman  they took a wheelchair. jack mcmorrow Yeah, I took a wheelchair. doris stroman He couldnt walk. john mcmorrow He couldnt walk no more. He couldnt bend his legs.\n\npam belluck\n\nSo he gets to the hospital. They are trying to figure out, again, whats going on. They dont know.\n\njohn mcmorrow  everything back and forth. You had a cardiologist department. You had the pulmonary specialist, infectious disease experts, and then you had the immunology all throwing numbers and prescriptions and how they count through each other to deal with him. And this is stuff that I  its French to me. You might as well just tell me \n\npam belluck\n\nAnd while hes there, they get the coronavirus test results back from the clinic that he went to on Saturday two days earlier.\n\nmichael barbaro\n\nAnd what does it say?\n\npam belluck\n\nTheyre negative. So theyre crossing that off the list. They say, we really should probably send you home because we dont really know what this is, and we think maybe you can just kind of watch it at home.\n\ndoris stroman Because they were riding the wave that he tested negative.\n\npam belluck\n\nWell, Doris is not happy about that. She says \n\ndoris stroman And I said, well, he needs to be tested again. And she said, we only test those who are admitted. And I said, well, then he needs to be admitted. We have nowhere to be \n\npam belluck\n\nSo theres a communication around that. And they agree theres no harm in doing another coronavirus test. Why not? We dont really know whats happening. Why not? So they do another coronavirus test. And then while theyre there waiting, another symptom emerges.\n\ndoris stroman When he woke up, his eyes were like this. And I was just like, what just  jack mcmorrow Yeah, they were rolling in the back of my head. doris stroman And they were red.\n\npam belluck\n\nHis eyes turned bright red. As his mom is telling me about this, she is pointing to a red pillow on their couch, and she says, its like this. And his eyes are rolling back into his head, and theyre bright red.\n\ndoris stroman He was like, Im fine, Im fine, like this. Im fine. Im fine. john mcmorrow When was this?\n\npam belluck\n\nThen the doctor comes in and tells them that, guess what? The new coronavirus test, the second one, it was positive.\n\nmichael barbaro\n\nPam, how could that be that he has a negative test and just a few days later, suddenly a positive test?\n\npam belluck\n\nWell, unfortunately this is kind of the reality of coronavirus testing right now that they are not 100 percent reliable. Its a little bit of a Wild West situation. So there are cases of false negatives, and thats obviously what was the case with Jack. So once they realize that he is Covid positive, they decide at that hospital that hes got to go to a childrens hospital. And Jack is not on board with this. He does not want to go. And the doctor says to him, If I send you home today, you will be dead by tomorrow.\n\njack mcmorrow That, I would say, had scared me to death. But it more scared me to life. It scared me to fight.\n\npam belluck\n\nSo Jack gets to the childrens hospital in the ambulance. And the doctors take one look, and they realize, this is not what we thought coronavirus infection looks like. This is not the way it usually affects patients. And they know that by looking at Jack and figuring out whats going on with him, they are going to learn a lot more about what this virus can do to kids.\n\n[music]\n\nmichael barbaro\n\nWell be right back.\n\njack mcmorrow Im getting to the pain now. It was a throbbing, stinging rush of, like, you could feel it going through your veins.\n\npam belluck\n\nSo when Jack gets to the hospital, he is just exhausted and in so much pain.\n\njack mcmorrow You could feel  it was almost like someone injected you with straight up fire. Just fire.\n\npam belluck\n\nThe major symptom thats going on with Jack is that he has very low blood pressure.\n\njack mcmorrow Youve got to remember, my heart rate was at 165 while I was sleeping. Thats like a marathon runner.\n\npam belluck\n\nAnd he has a very, very fast heart rate, because his heart is trying very hard to compensate for that low blood pressure that is preventing him from pumping oxygen and nutrients throughout his body to his critical organs. So thats what theyve got to treat. That is a condition that is called cardiogenic shock. It is heart failure. It is fatal if not treated. And he was telling me that he started to focus his energy. He started to feel like, I have got to understand what is going on with my body. Ive got to know, because if I dont know what Im fighting, then I cant fight it. So he starts to talk to the doctors.\n\njack mcmorrow They dont get a lot of kids that can actually talk to them since its pediatrics.\n\npam belluck\n\nAnd hes a ninth-grade kid, and hes been taking biology, and he has some understanding about the heart and the lungs and how they all work. And so hes asking them lots of questions.\n\njack mcmorrow We were going back and forth with the whole  especially the way my heart related to my cardiovascular and circulatory system, never mind my \n\npam belluck\n\nAnd that made him feel much more in control, or at least it was a little bit less terrifying for him once he kind of realized what he could understand. But in that first day or two \n\njack mcmorrow It was scary.\n\npam belluck\n\n he did feel like he wasnt going to come out of it.\n\nspeaker It didnt look like I was coming out of it the same, if at all.\n\nmichael barbaro\n\nAnd how do the doctors try to treat Jack during this time?\n\npam belluck\n\nSo the first thing that theyre trying to do is give him blood pressure medication to try to get his blood pressure up, but its just not working. Its been 48 hours. And they are so worried about his heart, which is not pumping enough oxygen to his body, that they think theyre going to need to put him on a ventilator.\n\nmichael barbaro\n\nWow.\n\njohn mcmorrow They were going to intubate him. And I said, you know, that was breaking my heart. doris stroman If they were to  john mcmorrow And so did they. They didnt want it, because they know that they had to brace me on the realistic approach that only 20 percent come off.\n\npam belluck\n\nSo they say, well, you know, why dont we try some steroids? Now, steroids are this widely used medication that works in a lot of different ways and works for some things, it doesnt work for other things, and its really hard to know whether its going to help him or not. But within a few hours, he starts to stabilize. They decide they dont need the ventilator, and \n\njack mcmorrow They were bringing me Icees and ginger ale  john mcmorrow They were bringing him everything, lollipops  jack mcmorrow  and I hadnt had water. john mcmorrow He hadnt no water, nothing in his mouth for over 48 hours because they were  jack mcmorrow For 48 hours. john mcmorrow  preparing him to do the tube. jack mcmorrow My mouth was  I felt like I was dying. And then they were throwing Icees my way. They were like, here you go, kid. They gave me lollipops. They gave me ginger ales. I was, like, living the life.\n\npam belluck\n\nSo it seems like the steroids worked, but doctors actually dont know that 100 percent. And John, Jacks father, called the pediatrician, their longtime pediatrician, and said, what happened? I dont know what happened. And \n\njohn mcmorrow He laughed. And I said, why? Why? Why? How did this happen? What did he do? And he goes, I dont know. I said, you know my familys going to believe this was the power of prayer. And he goes, Ill go with that, because we dont know why. We dont know.\n\npam belluck\n\nMy family is going to think that its a miracle. And the pediatrician says, well, that works for me because I dont really know either.\n\nmichael barbaro\n\nAnd Pam, beyond the steroids and whether or not those worked, what did the doctors understand about what was going on here?\n\npam belluck\n\nWell, theyre kind of mystified. I mean, theyve got this kid, and they know that he has a positive coronavirus test, but he doesnt have symptoms that kind of look like what theyve come to expect from coronavirus. And at the same time, just that very morning theyve had two or three other kids show up with the same symptoms, very similar symptoms. And those kids have tested negative for coronavirus. So they dont have a live coronavirus infection, but the doctors are wondering. And so they have another test in their toolkit. They have whats called an antibody test, which can tell you not whether you have the live infection right now, but it can tell you whether somebody has ever had coronavirus infection. And they think, lets just give these kids  these other kids that test and see. And lo and behold, those kids end up being positive for coronavirus antibodies. And that means that all of these kids who are showing up with these mysterious symptoms that cannot be explained by anything else that doctors know have this one common denominator. They have all had coronavirus.\n\nmichael barbaro\n\nPam, at this point, what do the doctors think that this is exactly? Because all of these kids have had coronavirus, but most of them dont still have it.\n\npam belluck\n\nWhat they think is this may be a kind of second-stage effect of coronavirus that we didnt know was possible, that we didnt know was part of the way this virus worked. These kids didnt get the lung problems, the breathing problems, that kind of assault on the lungs that is the primary way that coronavirus works. And so what the doctors think is that at the time of their infection, their immune system did a really good job of just swatting the infection away, of battling it away  thats why they didnt have any symptoms at the time. But that somehow in the course of that fight, their immune system got so revved up and so hyperactive that it generated this inflammatory response weeks later, and their bodies had this incredible overzealous reaction that went throughout their bodies and caused all sorts of havoc.\n\nmichael barbaro\n\nSo this is not coronavirus for kids. Its some kind of later-down-the-line, affiliated set of horrible conditions that follows it.\n\npam belluck\n\nExactly.\n\nmichael barbaro\n\nI mean, what seems particularly scary about this is that theoretically any kid who has had the coronavirus  and I have to imagine there are tens of thousands, maybe hundreds of thousands of these across the United States, people like Jack who probably showed no symptoms whatsoever from the original infection  it now seems possible that they could develop these really awful new secondary symptoms.\n\npam belluck\n\nThats exactly the risk here. Thats exactly the worry. We know that kids are just as likely to get infected as adults. They dont have any protection from infection. A whole lot of them end up showing no symptoms. And we wanted to think that that meant that they really werent getting that sick. But now we have this thing that shows up weeks later, and we dont have any idea who will end up with this inflammatory syndrome and when.\n\nmichael barbaro\n\nI mean, what are the implications of that as we think about reopening schools, for example? I mean, one of the kind of saving graces, silver linings of this pandemic was that kids were supposed to be spared, and that understanding seems to have been the basis for plans to reopen schools. What does it mean that this second-stage set of symptoms is now starting to show up among children?\n\npam belluck\n\nIt definitely puts a serious complication in those plans. Its something that governors, federal officials, they are already thinking about  they are going to have to think about. Its not like you can test kids and say, OK, youre negative, or you have antibodies, youre going to be fine. Because you could have antibodies, and then you could end up with this. So it makes that issue much more tenuous and much more complicated, and I dont think anybody has a good answer for that right now.\n\nmichael barbaro\n\nAnd Pam, how is Jack doing at this point?\n\npam belluck\n\nHes doing OK. Hes home.\n\njack mcmorrow And I came home to take the best shower Ive ever had in my entire life. Not even gassing it. It was like 30 minutes. doris stroman You cant get him in, and then you cant get him out. jack mcmorrow No, no, no. It was like  doris stroman You know. You have kids. jack mcmorrow It was like 30 minutes, this one. And it felt fine, and then I was like, I got to stop running around because Im going to fall. Im going to get lightheaded and pass out. But completely ignoring my own self advice, just ran into my room, put on my headphones, talked to my friends, and I said, Im home! And they were all like, yeah! doris stroman Any time he runs around  jack mcmorrow And it was the best. doris stroman  and says Im alive, Im alive  jack mcmorrow No. doris stroman  we go, Im a real boy! jack mcmorrow Im a real boy. doris stroman Im a real boy! jack mcmorrow No, no, no, because I said that. doris stroman From Pinocchio. jack mcmorrow No, because I was in the hospital, and I was like there are no strings on me because  john mcmorrow Because he did IVs \n\npam belluck\n\nHe has some residual heart issues, but they think that his issues, because hes so young and otherwise healthy, that hell probably emerge from this with no real issues. They are going to be following him. Theyre going to be following these other kids, too, because this is still a mystery, and they dont really know whether its going to have any long-term effects. And since his case, since his successful treatment, doctors have been using the same playbook on other kids with his issue. So they think that the steroids were what helped him, and they are giving other kids steroids a lot earlier when they come into the hospital. So far, apparently the results have been pretty encouraging. They are writing up Jacks case, along with some of the other kids, in an article thats going to be published in a medical journal. Jack was very excited to learn about that. And he said to me \n\njack mcmorrow Its been really good being back home, and I just want to do more with my life now, now that I have it back.\n\npam belluck\n\nI really want to do something with my life, now that I have it back.\n\njack mcmorrow In any way that I can. pam belluck That is awesome. jack mcmorrow Yeah.\n\npam belluck\n\nHe said this while holding his Captain America shield. So I thought  [LAUGHTER]\n\nmichael barbaro\n\nHe is, after all, a 14-year-old.\n\npam belluck\n\nHe is, after all, a 14-year-old boy.\n\njack mcmorrow I literally sent my biology teacher an email, saying thank you for educating me. pam belluck Really? john mcmorrow Oh, that was the first thing he did. jack mcmorrow I can show you it if you want. john mcmorrow Yes. You should actually  pam belluck I would love to see it. john mcmorrow  show it. doris stroman No, no, not now. Not now. Let her have it so  pam belluck Yeah, why dont you email it to me. doris stroman Its long, so just let her read it when she gets a minute.\n\npam belluck\n\n[READING JACKS EMAIL] OK, Ill try to make this email quick, because Im still in the hospital recovering. The complications of this virus have left me with pneumonia. And more serious than that, heart issues. A mild heart blockage, as explained by the doctors. This heart blockage is the main reason Im not at home recovering right now, but rather in a cardio-monitoring room. As hard as it is to keep up with all of this and understand many aspects of these complications, because of how little they know of Covid, I have to say, once it came around to them talking to me about my heart and my systems, Im confident that I was able to keep up with the conversation and understand what was wrong with me and what to do to keep fighting  or rather, to keep my vitals in check. To summarize what Im trying to say  and this is the honest truth  I would like to thank you for educating me as you did and for providing me the educational support to understand my body when I need to most. Because based off of my knowledge on my heart and circulatory system, Im now able to work off of that knowledge and help myself understand the doctors and communicate to them. I dont want to drag this out, and I know I said that Id try to make this short, but I really do have to thank you for educating me enough to know what I needed to know. Im sorry for making this email so long, and I really feel bad for disturbing you on a Saturday night. But seriously, Im genuinely thanking you for educating me as you did, and I look forward to seeing you on Zoom or in class if we return this school year. I hope your family and yourself stay safe. Thank you.\n\nmichael barbaro\n\nThats lovely.\n\npam belluck\n\nIsnt that amazing?\n\nmichael barbaro\n\nIs he back in school remotely?\n\npam belluck\n\nHe is back. Jack is back in school remotely.

We really appreciate it.\n\npam belluck\n\nThank you.\n\n[music]\n\nmichael barbaro\n\nLast week, health officials gave Jacks condition a name: Multisystem inflammatory syndrome in children. So far, it has been found in about 200 children in the U.S. and Europe, and has killed several of them. Because the condition was just identified, its unclear how many cases have remained unreported.

Connecticut allowed restaurants and malls to reopen with significant limits. And New York allowed religious gatherings of up to 10 people.\n\narchived recording (andrew cuomo) I understand their desire to get back to religious ceremonies as soon as possible. As a former altar boy, I get it. I think those religious ceremonies can be very comforting.\n\nmichael barbaro\n\nBut there were signs on Wednesday that the reopenings would be slow and risky.

This is The Daily. Today, the coronavirus is killing black Americans at staggeringly higher rates than white Americans. My colleague, Times Magazine writer Linda Villarosa, on the myth of the pandemic as the great equalizer. Its Wednesday, May 20.\n\nlinda villarosa Hello? nicole charles Hello. Hello? linda villarosa Hello. Hi, my names Linda Villarosa. Im from The New York Times Magazine. nicole charles How are you, Miss Linda? linda villarosa Im OK. How are you? nicole charles Im just OK, too. linda villarosa Yeah. I think we should just accept that were, like, OK. And listen, Im  Ive been hearing stories about your husband all morning and, you know, wish I had gotten to meet him. What a wonderful person he sounds like. nicole charles Oh, yes he was. Thats what he was.\n\nmichael barbaro\n\nLinda, tell me about Cornell Charles.\n\nlinda villarosa\n\nCornell Charles, who goes by the nickname Dickey, was born and raised in New Orleans. He still lived in the house where he grew up. He was a family man who had two daughters. He was married for decades to Nicole Charles, his wife, who I got to speak to recently.\n\nnicole charles My husband loved to cook. Every Sunday my husband would cook  you would think he was cooking for the military.\n\nlinda villarosa\n\nDickey was the king of the kitchen. Every Sunday after church, friends and family gathered at Nicole and Dickeys house.\n\nnicole charles You didnt have to have an invite to come in. Everybody knew it  I want to eat something, Im going by Cornell and Nicoles.\n\nlinda villarosa\n\nPeople knew you could just go there. The door was open.\n\nnicole charles He loved for you to gloat over his food. He wanted you to brag on it. So he would literally sit there and watch you eat it, and he was always like, OK, how it taste? How it taste? And everybody would be like, Look at the plate. What does that tell you? You know, so  linda villarosa And what were his best dishes? nicole charles Oh, my god, Miss Linda. His gumbo was number one. He was definitely a seafood boiler.\n\nlinda villarosa\n\nHe cooked seafood. He cooked gumbo.\n\nnicole charles He also was a master of spaghetti salad.\n\nlinda villarosa\n\nHe also made meatballs.\n\nnicole charles He would cook meatballs the size of a baseball. So everybody would call them miniature meatloaves, because they were so big.\n\nlinda villarosa\n\nAnd as a community man, he was also part of this club called the Zulu Club.\n\nlinda villarosa Tell me about what the Zulu group meant to your husband. nicole charles It was  let met see how I can  it was in his blood. If I can  that kind of sums it up.\n\nmichael barbaro\n\nAnd what is the Zulu Club?\n\nlinda villarosa\n\nSo the Zulu Club is an organization of mostly black men in New Orleans.\n\nnicole charles He first got involved in Zulu in around 2004. My dad was Zulu governor that year. And my husband began to deal with Zulu.\n\nlinda villarosa\n\nAnd it was started in 1909. Black people were still reeling from the end of slavery. And also, it was during the years of Jim Crow, when black people and other people couldnt afford funerals. And so the Zulu Club members came together to pool their money together to bury their dead in a dignified manner.\n\nnicole charles He was passionate about it. And he would give his all. Zulu was definitely something he enjoyed. It was a respectable organization of men.\n\nlinda villarosa\n\nMost of the year, its a civic club. So they collect food. Theres scholarships, a mentoring program. But during Mardi Gras \n\narchived recording 1 All right. And now we are showing  archived recording 2 The King of Zulu. archived recording 3  King Zulu, Ryan \n\nlinda villarosa\n\nIts the symbol of black New Orleans. And it involves festivals, and balls, and all kinds of different events.\n\n[band music]\n\nlinda villarosa\n\nThe event that Dickey Charles was the most involved with was the Governors Ball. And there were thousands of people at that event. Its a party. People bring their own food. You have to wear formal clothes or else you cant get in. People are elbow to elbow. Theyre dancing. And it lasts all night. Its really fun. But as this was happening, behind the scenes coronavirus was also building.\n\n[parade sounds]\n\nlinda villarosa\n\nSo.\n\nnicole charles He came home from work.\n\nlinda villarosa\n\n10 days after Mardi Gras ended, Dickey Charles didnt feel well.\n\nnicole charles Then he said, I feel like Im coming down with something. Which is normal for him. I said, well, OK. You know, why dont you just take it easy? But he spiked a fever, like the next day. And Im just thinking, he got the flu. So lets give you some Tylenol and then put some fluids in you and  whatever, whatever. So two or three days of that went on with his flu spiking. And my husband is a big man. Even if he was sick, he would still eat. But I couldnt even get him to eat soup, and that was his go-to thing when he was sick. So I said, Baby, you have to put something in your stomach, because he was a diabetic. He also had high blood pressure, and he also had kidney disease. Saturday morning, we wake up. Still. I said, Baby, how you feel? And he was just like, Ah, you know, Im  I feel faint. And I said, OK, I dont like that. I said, go take a shower, put on some clothes. Were going to the E.R. So that was March 14.\n\nlinda villarosa\n\nThey checked him in to the hospital, and by the following day, it was clear that something was wrong.\n\nnicole charles Sunday, when the medical doctor came in, she said, I want you to see the chest X-rays. So I said OK. She put it up on the screen. She said, Well, you see where his left lung is clear? Left lung is fine. She said, But you see this little cloud over his right lung? I said, yes, maam. She said, well, this could be pneumonia. But she said, But Im going to start him on some antibiotics. In case thats what it is, I want to beat it. In a matter of hours  in a matter of hours, they come back, and they tell me how bad his lungs are.\n\nlinda villarosa\n\nAnd that was a clue that they needed to test him for the coronavirus, even though it would take 10 days for the results to come back.\n\nnicole charles And one of the doctors came in and said, We need to have a very honest conversation. We need to vent your husband now. So of course my heart dropped. And I said, A ventilator? And he was like, Yes, maam. His lungs will not be functioning much longer on their own. linda villarosa Goodness. nicole charles I was like, he really is  my husband really is sick, which I didnt realize it was to that extent. If theyre telling me he needs to be on a ventilator. I dont want to say no and not give him a chance. Do you know what Im saying? linda villarosa Mm-hmm. nicole charles So Im like, OK. All right, lets do it.\n\nlinda villarosa\n\nSo for the next three days, Nicole was at the hospital. Dickeys on the ventilator. He was in a coma-like state, so hes not responding.\n\nnicole charles So  linda villarosa What were you saying to him? nicole charles Oh, my god, how much I love him. I miss him. You know, pray. I need you to pray. You know, I was telling him, You may not can speak, but God can hear your prayer. And that was basically my conversation for him every day in I.C.U. You know, and we would listen to gospel music. I would pray for him anyway. And I was in the midst of praying for him  which is what I did all the time. I would touch him from his head to his toe, and I would pray over his body. I was at his feet, and I was coming back up towards his head, and he opened his eyes for me. And I said, Oh, I said, Baby, you opened your eyes for me. I said, Im so proud of you. And he knew I was there, because he would nod. Now, at this time I was playing gospel music, and the phone went off. And I said, Do you want me to play another gospel song for you? And he nodded his head. Do you love me? And he nodded his head. And I said, I love you so much. I said, Im so proud of you. You opened your eyes. And he had his eyes open the whole time I was there. And the nurse who was working with him that day, she said, Mr. Charles, Ive been trying to get you to open your eyes all day, and youre showing off for your wife. And I said, Thats right, because he had to look at his wife. He heard my voice, and he had to see my face. And that was the last time I saw my husband with his eyes open. He looked good. My husband never lost weight. He never looked sick, Miss Linda. He never  even when he was on the ventilator, he never looked sick. He never looked sick. And I thank God for that. Because him looking sick and being sick probably would have really screwed me up. Looking at him looking healthy, and  and I  you know, I told him. I said, I love you, and Im leaving you in Gods hands. I kept talking to him and just  telling him how much we loved him. And how much were going to miss him. And he took his last breath in front of me at 1:33 on the 24th. He looked really, really peaceful. He did. Yes.\n\nlinda villarosa\n\nHe died that afternoon. And he was only 51 years old.\n\n[music]\n\nlinda villarosa\n\nThe next day, as Nicole was grieving, she finally got the results of Dickeys Covid test and found out that, yes, he was positive. He did die of the coronavirus.\n\nnicole charles The phone calls that I have gotten from Zulu members have been overwhelming. They have reached out via text, via phone call, sending cards. Its just so much, you know Miss Linda, and I didnt realize the magnitude of the people my husband touched until his passing. And Ive gotten so many phone calls to tell me, you know, he motivated me to do this, or he encouraged me to do that, or he was my mentor. I mean, I can just stand so proud and say he was my husband. I can stand tall and just brag that that was my husband, you know what I mean? Its so funny, because being his wife, and as much as he used to go  and when I say go, he went with a purpose. Baby, Im going to  Ive got to go practice this team at this time. I have to practice this team at that time. When I leave there, I have to go to this meeting, or whatever, whatever. And to realize what his purpose was now gives me such a sense of joy. archived recording Well, Since Mardi Gras Day, it has been a devastating couple of weeks for Zulu Social Aid and Pleasure Club.\n\nlinda villarosa\n\nBut he wasnt the only member of the Zulu Club to get sick.\n\narchived recording Several of their members tested positive for coronavirus.\n\nlinda villarosa\n\nAt the time I finished my reporting, 30 members of the Zulu Club had been infected with the virus, and of those 30, eight had died.\n\nmichael barbaro\n\nWow.\n\nlinda villarosa\n\nI looked at the Facebook page yesterday and saw that on May 4 another one of them died.\n\nmichael barbaro\n\nLinda, what did you, and what did the members of the Zulu Club, make of the number of members who were dying?\n\nlinda villarosa\n\nAt first, it felt like, oh, wrong place, wrong time situation. Mardi Gras was really crowded. Carnival season lasted for six weeks. And there were crowds. People were elbow to elbow. So it made sense at the beginning. But, frankly, behind the scenes, those of us who understand public health or who look at questions of public health started to worry, because we knew that there were going to be high death rates among black people and high hospitalization rates. But there was no data yet. So when the data started rolling out \n\narchived recording Nationwide, cities have been releasing Covid-19 data showing racial disparities in diagnosis and in death.\n\nlinda villarosa\n\nIt confirmed what many in public health knew.\n\narchived recording Those numbers show a disturbing trend.\n\nlinda villarosa\n\nBut it was still very scary.\n\narchived recording Black people are dying at a much higher rate than any other race right now.\n\nlinda villarosa\n\nIn the state of Louisiana \n\narchived recording Of the more than 500 people whose final breaths were stolen by this disease, the state says that more than two thirds of them were black.\n\nlinda villarosa\n\nBlack people comprise 30 percent of the population but 70 percent of those who have died of Covid. Then other states started to roll out their data.\n\narchived recording A thousand more cases of Covid-19 confirmed here in Illinois just today.\n\nlinda villarosa\n\nIn Illinois \n\narchived recording 1 More than half of all cases in Chicago are in the African-American community. archived recording 2 38 percent of Missourians who died from Covid-19 were black, but African-Americans only make up 12 percent of Missouris population. archived recording 3 The reports are startling  in North Carolina, Connecticut, and Michigan, too.\n\nlinda villarosa\n\nSo at that point, it begged the question why. Why was this killing so many black people? Why was it having such a devastating effect on black America?\n\nmichael barbaro\n\nWell be right back.\n\n[music]\n\nmichael barbaro\n\nLinda, how do we explain this extraordinarily higher death rate in the black community from the coronavirus?\n\nlinda villarosa\n\nWell, it was interesting. During the beginning of this pandemic \n\narchived recording (andrew cuomo) Everyone  everyone  is subject to this virus. It is the great equalizer.\n\nlinda villarosa\n\nPeople started saying, oh, Covid is the great equalizer, or, the virus doesnt discriminate.\n\narchived recording From the moment the coronavirus outbreak began, health officials have preached that Covid-19 doesnt discriminate, that its an equal opportunity killer.\n\nlinda villarosa\n\nBut those of us who have studied public health know that that wasnt true. And in fact, we say it a different way. We say, when America sneezes the black community gets pneumonia. And for me, Im really passionate about racial health disparities. Ive been studying it for 30 years. I was a young editor at Essence magazine, and I started first writing about this. Im writing a book about it now. And we have long known that all kinds of diseases do discriminate. Its not equal.\n\nmichael barbaro\n\nAnd how does Covid-19 discriminate against black America?\n\nlinda villarosa\n\nCovid-19 is more serious in black Americans. So were more likely to be hospitalized, to have a serious case, and to also die from it. And there are three main reasons for this disparity.\n\nmichael barbaro\n\nOK. And what is the first of those reasons?\n\nlinda villarosa\n\nThe first reason is simple. Its proximity to the virus. Black Americans are more likely to be employed in essential jobs, in frontline jobs, in jobs where they are more commonly exposed to the virus itself. Im thinking of Dickey Charles. He continued working. He was a courier for a medical company. I think of the Zulu members. One of the men who died was a postal worker. He was a mail carrier. One was a police officer who contracted Covid. Another was a security guard. And look, we dont know whether these members of the Zulu Club contracted the virus at Mardi Gras or on their jobs. But we do know that the majority of black people in this country have jobs that put them at risk. So thats the first reason black Americans are dying at such disproportionate rates. The second factor is discrimination that is embedded in the health care system itself.\n\nmichael barbaro\n\nLinda, this is something you and I first talked about over a year ago when we did an episode of The Daily about black women and their mortality rates when giving birth. And you explained this concept that, essentially, racism  conscious or deeply unconscious  influences the kind of medical care delivered to black patients.\n\nlinda villarosa\n\nYes. And I believe that its unconscious. And its not just white doctors, its also black doctors we  or doctors of other races. Because we all live in this society that has discrimination and racist images embedded in our culture. Its baked in. Thousands of studies have shown over decades that black people get unequal treatment in our health care system.\n\nmichael barbaro\n\nI wonder if you can walk me through a scenario that people in public health say could or has happened when it comes to this pandemic that explains this.\n\nlinda villarosa\n\nWell, you can imagine being a health care provider, specifically being a physician, and youre having to make life-or-death decisions  who should get tested? Who should be admitted to the hospital? Who needs to be put on a ventilator? Who needs to be taken off a ventilator? So youre a doctor, and people that dont look like you, dont have the same culture as you, dont have the same background with you come in, you may think about them differently. Medical providers dont go into medicine to harm people, but that harm may show up, especially during a very stressed out moment, which is the essence of this moment and coronavirus.\n\nmichael barbaro\n\nSo, Linda, what is the third major factor here in why something like the coronavirus discriminates against black Americans?\n\nlinda villarosa\n\nSo the third reason is that black Americans have more of the underlying conditions that make Covid-19 worse. Some of these are hypertension and heart disease, diabetes, stroke, and asthma. So if you have these underlying conditions, youre more likely to be quite sick. That was the case with Dickey Charles. He had high blood pressure. He had diabetes. He had kidney disease. And that is also the case with so many other black Americans.\n\nmichael barbaro\n\nAnd why is that? Why is there such a disproportionate level of these pre-existing underlying conditions?\n\nlinda villarosa\n\nSo at first glance, it seems like, well, if everyone just takes better care of themselves, you can avoid these kinds of conditions.\n\nmichael barbaro\n\nRight.\n\nlinda villarosa\n\nBut that tilts toward a kind of irresponsibility among black people that really isnt fair. So a study in early April found out that people who have been subjected to long term exposure to air pollution are more likely to have serious cases of Covid than people who dont. And black people are more likely to live in areas that are polluted. New Orleans is part of cancer alley, which is an 85-mile stretch along the highway in Louisiana where theres the largest concentration of petrochemical factories in the country. And so New Orleans itself is the victim of this kind of inequal exposure to dirty air, dirty water, dirty soil. And this is where the Zulus live. This is where Dickey Charles and Nicole Charles live. So the environment is one factor that drives the underlying conditions that black Americans are disproportionately more likely to face. But a second factor is the concept of weathering.\n\nmichael barbaro\n\nAnd weathering is the concept that racism takes a physical toll on the black body and leaves it more vulnerable to all kinds of illness.\n\nlinda villarosa\n\nThats exactly right. And its best to think of it as a kind of accelerated aging. So adversity comes in the form of discrimination. It could be discrimination in housing. It could be discrimination by police. It could be discrimination in employment. It could just be the stress of having to struggle every day. It changes the systems of the body at a cellular level. So if you are faced with a kind of adverse event, your blood pressure goes up, your heart rate goes up, your breathing becomes more rapid. And this is all part of the fight-or-flight syndrome. But it shouldnt be made to happen over and over and over again. But if youre facing that kind of adversity, thats what happens, and it wears away the body. It ages the body. So that would make sense why black people are more likely to have these kind of underlying conditions and why we get them at younger ages.\n\nmichael barbaro\n\nSo, Linda, putting all of this together, all these factors, you have a black population at a higher risk of exposure, just given the nature of their work; a population that already has higher rates of underlying conditions; on top of that, there is this weathering phenomenon that deepens those conditions, literally seems to age this already-not-well, vulnerable body; and finally, a medical system inclined to undertreat these people when they come in to a hospital or a doctors office.\n\nlinda villarosa\n\nYes. And that is what has created this perfect and terrible storm when it comes to the coronavirus and black people in America.\n\nmichael barbaro\n\nLinda, it sounds like the public health experts you talked to, that they knew these death rates, these infection rates, this kind of disproportionateness, was going to play out with this pandemic. And now that it has, how are they thinking about it?\n\nlinda villarosa\n\nI think this is a difficult moment, but its also a moment where a tragedy can be turned into something else. So those in public health have known that there are racial disparities in health. I mean, weve known since 1899 when W.E.B. Du Bois was calling it a crisis. And some of the people that I interviewed in my story have been studying this for decades and have added up the price. And so theyre hoping that now is a moment of reckoning to say, this is a horrible moment, please dont turn away. Do something about this.\n\nmichael barbaro\n\nIm curious what the governments response to this pandemic, which is widely acknowledged, was slow, what that has meant for this particular group of Americans.\n\nlinda villarosa\n\nSo the governments slow and uncoordinated and confusing response hurt everyone. It hurt all Americans. It harmed us. But it hurt this group  black people, black Americans  worse. Because we were already more vulnerable to many of these health problems that make Covid-19 worse. And sometimes when I think of it, I think specifically about the men in the Zulu Club and how they were harmed by this federal response. And it had this terrible sad trickle-down effect to them on the ground.\n\nmichael barbaro\n\nRight. Well, how are members of the Zulu Club and their families doing at this point?\n\nlinda villarosa\n\nThe entire group is reeling from what happened. I mean, theyre a brotherhood, so theyre trying to support and take care of each other. But theyre in pain.\n\nlinda villarosa And youre good? Youre feeling OK?\n\nlinda villarosa\n\nI also checked in with Nicole, Dickey Charless wife, just to see how she was doing.\n\nnicole charles Im feeling as good as I can be. God didnt choose me, so I have to find a way to maneuver my new life.\n\nlinda villarosa\n\nThis is a very hard time for her. Shes grieving this man that she was married to for three decades.\n\nnicole charles But its going to be a huge, huge adjustment. I tell people my life did a 180-degree turn within a matter of 10 days, you know. linda villarosa Yeah. nicole charles And I sorely miss my husband. Out of 30 years, Miss Linda, Ive never not slept next to him for longer than two days. In 30 years. linda villarosa Oh, wow. nicole charles If I did not sleep next to him, he was going to a football camp \n\n[music]\n\nlinda villarosa\n\nMore than a week after Dickey Charles died, she arranged his funeral. It was at their church. There were 10 people there  10 family members and an organist.\n\narchived recording (SINGING) I feel trust in the Lord. I feel \n\nlinda villarosa\n\nIt was also live streamed. Six hundred people tuned in. I tuned in.\n\narchived recording (SINGING) Oh, I feel trust in the Lord.\n\nlinda villarosa\n\nI found it sad and hard, because I was thinking about someone like Dickey and many of the other Zulus would have gotten a different kind of sendoff. Would have gotten a second line funeral, where, you know, it happens in the street, and all those 600 people would be right there in person. People would be dressed up. There would be music. And that is the legacy of the Zulu Club. It was formed to help people send off their dead in a graceful, in a respectful, in a dignified way, and in a way that celebrated their life.\n\n[music]\n\nmichael barbaro\n\nLinda, thank you very much. We appreciate it.\n\nlinda villarosa\n\nThank you. And please take care of yourself.\n\nmichael barbaro\n\nYou, too.\n\nlinda villarosa Well, thank you so much. nicole charles Thank you for taking out the time and  linda villarosa Take care of yourself. nicole charles I will.

This is The Daily. Today: President Trump has fired the inspector general for the Department of State, whose investigation posed a threat to his administration. Maggie Haberman on the pattern that that reveals. Its Tuesday, May 19. Maggie, where does the idea of an inspector general come from?\n\nmaggie haberman\n\nSo the idea of inspectors general, who are basically public watchdogs, emerged out of the Watergate era.\n\narchived recording (richard nixon) I have never been a quitter. To leave office before my term is completed is abhorrent to every instinct in my body.\n\nmaggie haberman\n\nRichard Nixon resigned in disgrace after abusing his office.\n\narchived recording (richard nixon) As president, I must put the interests of America first.\n\nmaggie haberman\n\nFaith in government dipped substantially among the public.\n\narchived recording (richard nixon) By taking this action, I hope that I will have hastened the start of that process of healing, which is so desperately needed in America.\n\n[music]\n\nmaggie haberman\n\nAnd this idea came about of permanent government oversight at each federal agency of the executive branch, and each one would have their own watchdog in place. And they are supposed to do audits of operations. Theyre investigating reports of waste or fraud or abuse. These oversight officers were essentially a bulwark against corruption, a bulwark against the type of abuses that took place during the Nixon era.\n\nmichael barbaro\n\nSo a kind of internal affairs department inside each agency of the executive branch?\n\nmaggie haberman\n\nThats exactly right. Inside each agency of the executive branch was somebody who people could report tips to. And the I.G. could then investigate those and decide whether those were substantiated or not substantiated. And if they decide that there is something real there, they would immediately notify Congress within a week, within seven days. And so there is supposed to be this chain of accountability that exists with the I.G.s.\n\nmichael barbaro\n\nAnd the final chain is Congress, so an entirely different branch of government.\n\nmaggie haberman\n\nExactly.\n\nmichael barbaro\n\nAnd how are these inspectors general regarded after this law is passed?\n\nmaggie haberman\n\nThey are very respected. What was originally 12 inspectors general expanded and became dozens and dozens across the executive branch. And over the years, they have launched investigations into \n\narchived recording Strippers, casinos, Las Vegas  it sounds like a wild bachelor party, but instead, its Pentagon employees using their government-issued credit cards.\n\nmaggie haberman\n\nWasteful spending into fraud.\n\narchived recording A new report by the inspector general at the Department of Homeland Security finds the U.S. citizenship and immigration services, or CIS, improperly granted citizenship \n\nmaggie haberman\n\nInto conflicts of interest, into abuse.\n\narchived recording The Justice Department released details of a 2004 CIA inspector generals report detailing chilling interrogation techniques, including waterboarding.\n\nmaggie haberman\n\nAnd for the most part, presidents choose not to tangle with them. There are some notable exceptions. Ronald Reagan, for instance, replaced all of the inspectors general on day one. He said that he wanted a clean slate.\n\nmichael barbaro\n\nMm-hmm.\n\nmaggie haberman\n\nGeorge W. Bush raised some eyebrows with how he handled a NASA inspector general, for instance. And then we get to 2009. President Obama had been in office for only a handful of months. And at that point, he abruptly fires the inspector general, Gerald Walpin.\n\narchived recording Barack Obama fired Gerald Walpin. He is the inspector general of the Corporation and National Community Service. That is the federal agency responsible for distributing money to organizations like Americorps \n\nmaggie haberman\n\nWho was overseeing investigations into Americorps and other national service programs and how money was being spent on them.\n\narchived recording He was investigating a close political pal of President Obamas, but \n\nmaggie haberman\n\nAnd one of the people who Walpin was investigating was the Sacramento mayor and a former N.B.A. basketball star, Kevin Johnson. He was an Obama supporter, and the fact that there was a connection between the president and this person, who is connected to one of the groups that Walpin was looking at, raised a lot of eyebrows.\n\narchived recording (gerald walpin) Well, actually, I was fired, because I was doing my job and doing it well and supporting my staff, who are \n\nmaggie haberman\n\nAnd President Obama alerted Congress that he had lost confidence in Walpin and was going to remove him from that position.\n\nmichael barbaro\n\nHmm.\n\n[music]\n\nAnd did he say why he lost confidence?\n\nmaggie haberman\n\nHe did not get into why he had lost confidence. He didnt really offer any full explanation.\n\narchived recording (chuck grassley) What we have here is a bigger problem with inspector generals that we got to watch this administration on.\n\nmaggie haberman\n\nAnd at the time, Chuck Grassley, the Republican senator from Iowa, who has been very, very assiduous in his support for the I.G.s, was disturbed by what took place.\n\narchived recording (chuck grassley) And I use inspector generals tremendously in my oversight work, so Im going to fight hard to make sure they maintain their independence.\n\nmaggie haberman\n\nHe said at the time that he thought it looked as if Walpin had been doing a good job, that he had identified a lot of money in America funds that had not been used properly.\n\nmichael barbaro\n\nMm-hmm.\n\nmaggie haberman\n\nThe criticism of this move by Obama, it should be remembered, was not just Republicans. Claire McCaskill, senator from Missouri, who was an Obama supporter, was very critical of Walpins firing at the time. And this was the last time that Obama did this.\n\nmichael barbaro\n\nHmm, so lesson learned. Dont mess with inspector generals.\n\nmaggie haberman\n\nRight, or lesson certainly appeared to have been learned. It was, it was a hot stove that he touched, and he never touched it again.\n\nmichael barbaro\n\nMm-hmm.\n\nmaggie haberman\n\nBut from there, we got to President Trump, who, throughout his term, has been extremely skeptical of inspectors general.\n\nmichael barbaro\n\nWhy?\n\nmaggie haberman\n\nHes a business guy, Michael. He has never been in government before. And the idea of having this in-house adversarial relationship, somebody who works for him but who is there to tell him that hes doing things wrong, is just a concept thats anathema to him. And so he has chafed at it and has found it uncomfortable, to put it mildly. And then when they had started to do things that upset him, he becomes very angry. And that is what has led us to this unprecedented moment of, in the last two months, the president waging open war on the inspectors general.\n\n[music]\n\nmichael barbaro\n\nWell be right back. Maggie, tell us about this unprecedented war that President Trump is waging on these inspectors general.\n\nmaggie haberman\n\nSo there have been four inspectors general who he has targeted. And in each case, he has felt some level of threat from each of them it seems. Michael Atkinson was the first one, and whats important about Atkinson is he is the person who received a whistleblower complaint from an official in the intelligence community, who was detailed to the White House. And this complaint accused the president of an abuse of power related to foreign policy to force Ukraines government into announcing investigations related to Joe Biden and his son, that could have personal political benefit for the president. Atkinson found that complaint to be credible enough to have raised a, quote unquote, urgent concern. And it, under that label, had to be disclosed to Congress. And this report from Atkinson is what triggered the impeachment inquiry into the president. The president, last fall  before there were actual hearings related to the impeachment, but while Congress was starting to look at this  the president talked to his advisors about firing Michael Atkinson at the time. The presidents advisers told him this was a really bad idea. That if he did this, he was just throwing gasoline on an existing fire. So he waited, and the president was acquitted in the Senate impeachment trial on February 5. And he dismissed Atkinson a handful of weeks later.\n\n[music]\n\nmichael barbaro\n\nAnd what does the president say when he fires Atkinson? Does he acknowledge that it appears to be an act of retribution for Atkinsons role in the impeachment?\n\nmaggie haberman\n\nNo, the president does not acknowledge that at all.\n\narchived recording (donald trump) I thought he did a terrible job, absolutely terrible.\n\nmaggie haberman\n\nHe says that he has lost confidence in Atkinson, and he says this in a letter to Congress.\n\narchived recording (donald trump) He took a whistleblower report, which turned out to be a fake report. It was fake. It was totally wrong. It was about my conversation with the president of Ukraine. He took a fake report, and he brought it to Congress.\n\nmaggie haberman\n\nThat was as much of a reason as Congress was getting.\n\narchived recording (donald trump) That man is a disgrace to I.G.s. All right, lets go.\n\nmichael barbaro\n\nAnd I guess as much of a reason as the president needed to give Congress.\n\nmaggie haberman\n\nAll that he needed to say, and the way that he described it in his letter to Congress was, As is the case with regard to other positions where I, as president, have the power of appointment, by and with the advice and consent of the Senate, it is vital that I have the fullest confidence in the appointees serving as inspectors general. That is no longer the case with regard to this inspector general. Thats as much as they got.\n\nmichael barbaro\n\nAnd Maggie, what is the reaction in Congress, and I guess beyond Congress, to this firing of this inspector general?\n\nmaggie haberman\n\nThere was a large outcry.\n\narchived recording (adam schiff)  course, were in the middle of a pandemic, and what is this president doing as thousands of people are dying? He is retaliating against people that are on his enemies list and doing it in the dead of night. archived recording Listen, he got fired for political reasons. He got fired because the president believes that a deep state exists, a group of civil servants that are out to get him. That is not true.\n\nmaggie haberman\n\nDemocrats and even some Republicans said they were enormously troubled by what appeared to be an act of political retribution. But there was no consequence for this president. Hes right. Its within his power of appointment as president. So he did it again a couple weeks later with another I.G.\n\nmichael barbaro\n\nAnd who the second inspector general who was targeted by the president?\n\nmaggie haberman\n\nNext up was Glenn Fine, who had been the acting inspector general for the Department of Defense since prior to President Trump took office. Now Michael, what was notable about Fine was that was about to become the chairman of a new committee that was going to do oversight on the spending in response to the coronavirus pandemic. This was going to be oversight of $2.2 trillion in coronavirus relief.\n\nmichael barbaro\n\nSo he was going to make sure that money was being properly spent. He was going to account for it.\n\nmaggie haberman\n\nThats right. Fine was going to be the watchdog for this massive amount of government spending. The president abruptly moved him out of his office, and therefore he couldnt be the chairman of that committee. It seemed as if the president wanted to move out somebody who didnt report directly to him or who was not promoted by him and not handpicked by him in the first place. That he wanted somebody who more fit that bill to sit on that committee that would be overseeing the spending of this $2.2 trillion.\n\n[music]\n\nNext on the list was the principal deputy inspector for the Department of Health and Human Services, Christi Grimm. She had done a report that was based on a number of interviews with hospitals all over the country, and those pinpointed massive shortages of supplies at various medical centers, efforts and struggles to obtain test kits, gear for hospital workers, ventilators that weve heard so much about since.\n\narchived recording Despite the nearly 1.8 million tests that you say the United States has done, the inspector general for the Department of Health and Human Services released a report today, a survey, of more than 300 \n\nmaggie haberman\n\nThe president was really unhappy about this report. What he said to reporters at the time was, its just wrong.\n\narchived recording (reporter) I mean a week or longer. archived recording (donald trump) Its just wrong. Did I hear the word inspector general? Really? Its wrong, and theyll talk to you about it. Its wrong.\n\nmaggie haberman\n\nMany asked about who had written the report.\n\narchived recording (donald trump) Well, where did it come from? The inspector general. Whats his name? archived recording (reporter) It came from the inspector general report  archived recording (donald trump) No, whats his name? Whats his name? archived recording (reporter) I dont know his name off the top of my head. archived recording (donald trump) Well, find me his name. Let me know, OK? If you find me his name, Id appreciate it. archived recording But sir \n\nmichael barbaro\n\nHes asking reporters for the name of the inspector general who has done something that has upset him.\n\nmaggie haberman\n\nHe was asking reporters to figure out for him  and he was assuming it was a male, it was a woman  who had written this report. Three weeks after Christi Grimm wrote this report, President Trump announced her replacement.\n\nmichael barbaro\n\nOK, so that brings us, I believe, to inspector general number four. What is the story there?\n\nmaggie haberman\n\nInspector general number four, Steve Linick, had, according to Democratic congressional aides, opened up an inquiry into Secretary of State Mike Pompeo and his wife. And whether they were misusing a political appointee at the State Department to serve them, essentially  to perform menial duties like walking their dog, making restaurant reservations, picking up dry cleaning. And at the same time, Linick had been looking into, and was close to finishing, an investigation into Pompeos decision to go around Congress with an emergency declaration to approve billions of dollars in arms sales to Saudi Arabia last year. There was an enormous outcry in Congress that this did not go through approval by congressional officials at the time. And Linick was looking into this.\n\nmichael barbaro\n\nSo the issue here is whether or not the State Department kind of created a false sense of urgency around approving an arms sale to the Saudi Arabian government.\n\nmaggie haberman\n\nThats exactly right. And that report, as I said, was close to completion. So these two investigations were going on, and we are told that Mike Pompeo told the president that he thought that Linick should be fired. So on Friday, thats exactly what happened. Another late Friday night ousting of an inspector general, Linick was announced as departed.\n\nmichael barbaro\n\nWhat has been the reaction to this firing?\n\nmaggie haberman\n\nDemocrats are very upset about this.\n\narchived recording (robert menendez) We need to know why an inspector general all of a sudden gets sacked on a Friday night, added to the three other I.G.s that have been sacked. archived recording (nancy pelosi) The fact is if it looks like its in retaliation for something that the inspector general is doing, that could be unlawful.\n\nmaggie haberman\n\nBut given whats happening with coronavirus, given that the attention of the country is largely on either the deaths caused by the virus or the economic devastation caused by the response to dealing with the virus, this has not broken through in the way that it might in any other moment in time.\n\nmichael barbaro\n\nHmm, how are Republicans reacting to this ouster?\n\nmaggie haberman\n\nWith the exception of some concern from Chuck Grassley, whos been consistent about inspectors general, and Mitt Romney, who was very critical and who was the only Republican vote in favor of impeachment against President Trump, there has been radio silence from Republicans on this.\n\nmichael barbaro\n\nIt feels like the events of the past few months reveal a pretty central flaw in the original creation of the inspectors general, which is that it allows the president to fire these independent figures, right? I mean its interesting that it was created in the aftermath of Watergate as a check against bad actions in government. And yet, Watergate was all about a president being abusive, and here you have a law that allows a president to fire those internal watchdogs.\n\nmaggie haberman\n\nMichael, I think youve identified the exact problem with this law, which is that its only as good as the honor system around it. Because if its just another piece of the presidents power, if the president isnt going to abide by what these inspectors general find and let them do their investigations, then its not worth very much.\n\nmichael barbaro\n\nSo the political consequences for the president are, at this point, uncertain for removing these inspector generals. But Im curious what you think the consequences are for the inspector generals who remain throughout the executive branch. I mean will this affect how they do their job?\n\nmaggie haberman\n\nMichael, I think that were never going to know for certain most likely, but I could see scenarios where inspectors general feel like they cant open an investigation, because if they do, its just going to get shut down. Or they get pieces of information, and they want additional confirmation before theyll pursue something. It could absolutely have a chilling effect on how these folks do their jobs.\n\n[music]\n\nmichael barbaro\n\nHave any of these fired or dismissed inspectors general spoken out since they lost their jobs?\n\nmaggie haberman\n\nThere was a really remarkable statement that Michael Atkinson, the dismissed intelligence community inspector general, put out. And he defined this as a message he was leaving for, quote, any government employee or contractor who believes they have learned of or observed unethical, wasteful or illegal behavior in the federal government. And he had a very dramatic line in it, talking about the significance of his office: The American people deserve an honest and effective government. They are counting on you to use authorized channels to bravely speak up. There is no disgrace in doing so. And then he goes on to talk about the importance of whistleblower programs and says, Please do not allow recent events to silence your voices.\n\n[music]\n\nmichael barbaro\n\nMaggie, thank you very much.\n\nmaggie haberman\n\nMichael, thank you.\n\nmichael barbaro\n\nOn Monday, Secretary of State Mike Pompeo acknowledged in an interview that he had asked President Trump to fire the inspector general of the State Department, but said that it was not an act of retaliation. Democrats remain skeptical. House Speaker Nancy Pelosi sent President Trump a letter demanding a detailed explanation for the firing. In the letter, Pelosi called it, quote, part of a pattern of undermining the integrity of the inspectors general and therefore our government. Well be right back. Heres what else you need to know today.\n\narchived recording (alex azar) We must be frank about one of the primary reasons this outbreak spun out of control. There was a failure by this organization to obtain the information that the world needed, and that failure cost many lives.\n\nmichael barbaro\n\nIn a speech at the annual meeting of the World Health Organization, the U.S. Secretary of Health and Human Services, Alex Azar, pointedly criticized the group, saying it had mishandled the original outbreak of the virus in China by promoting misinformation from the government there.\n\narchived recording (alex azar) The status quo is intolerable. W.H.O. must change, and it must become far more transparent and far more accountable.\n\nmichael barbaro\n\nAt the meeting, leaders of the World Health Organization said that they would review their response to the pandemic, something that several member countries, including the U.S. have demanded. And \n\narchived recording (donald trump) Yeah, Ive taken it for about a week and a half now, and Im still here.\n\nmichael barbaro\n\nDuring a news conference on Monday, President Trump said that he has been taking doses of hydroxychloroquine as a preventative measure against the virus, despite a lack of evidence that it works.\n\narchived recording Can you explain, sir, though, what is the evidence that it has a preventative effect? archived recording (donald trump) Here we go. You ready? Heres my evidence. I get a lot of positive calls about it. The only negative Ive heard was the study where they gave it  was it the VA with, you know, people that arent big Trump fans gave it, and weve done a great \n\nmichael barbaro\n\nThe Times reports that the presidents disclosure has alarmed doctors, who fear it may encourage Americans to use the drug. The Food and Drug Administration has previously issued a safety warning about the medicine, saying that it can cause serious heart problems and should not be used outside of hospitals or clinical trials.\n\n[music]'	b'Trumps Purge of the Watchdogs'	2020-05-19	[]	['trump', 'report', 'inspectors', 'general', 'inspector', 'watchdogs', 'archived', 'trumps', 'going', 'congress', 'recording', 'purge', 'president']	b'maggie habermanSo the idea of inspectors general, who are basically public watchdogs, emerged out of the Watergate era.\nWhat was originally 12 inspectors general expanded and became dozens and dozens across the executive branch.\nmaggie habermanGeorge W.

This is The Daily.\n\n[music]\n\nToday: Saving the U.S. economy from the fallout of the pandemic may require a historic infusion of cash. Ben Castleman on the debate over that spending. Its Monday, May 18. Ben, were talking to you on Friday morning, and a bunch of big, ugly, economic numbers just came out this morning. So we wanted to sift through them with you.\n\nben castleman\n\nYeah. Its been a pretty dark morning for the economy.\n\nmichael barbaro\n\nWhere do you think we should start?\n\nben castleman\n\nMaybe the place to start is actually on Thursday.\n\narchived recording We turn now to the economy. Nearly 3 million more Americans filed for unemployment benefits last week.\n\nben castleman\n\nWhen we learned that another 3 million Americans had filed for unemployment benefits.\n\narchived recording Thats more than 36 million people in two months.\n\nben castleman\n\nWere two months into this crisis, and yet we are still losing millions of jobs every week.\n\narchived recording For eight straight weeks now, jobless claims have been in the millions with 3 million more people filing for unemployment last week.\n\nmichael barbaro\n\nRight. Every week.\n\nben castleman\n\nEvery week.\n\narchived recording This did not happen naturally. All of these companies didnt just go out of business because demand disappeared. We turned our economy off. Right? Think about New York. Think about the state of California. If you ran a restaurant, a mini golf course, or a clothing store, theres a really good chance you would have laid your workers off.\n\nben castleman\n\nAnd then, Friday morning, we get up.\n\narchived recording Its the services industries that are getting crushed here.\n\nben castleman\n\nAnd we learn that retail sales in April were down more than 16 percent. Thats by far the worst that weve ever seen.\n\narchived recording But as far as these retail sales go, worse than expected month over month.\n\nben castleman\n\nOver the last two months, restaurants lost half their business. Apparel and clothing stores have lost nearly 90 percent of their business.\n\narchived recording The countrys shut down, and people arent buying stuff. I hate to state the obvious, but theyre not buying cars, down 12 percent. Theyre not buying furnishings and home furnishing items, down 58 percent. Clothing and clothing accessories, down 78 percent.\n\nben castleman\n\nAnd then we got another data point that said that industrial production, right, this is the actual stuff that we make in the economy, was down by the most in more than a century that weve been keeping records, meaning worse than the Great Depression.\n\nmichael barbaro\n\nIn other words, as bad as it gets.\n\nben castleman\n\nAs bad as it has ever gotten. We know that this is deep. We know that it is broad-based. We dont yet know how long it will last. And thats the fundamental question going forward.\n\nmichael barbaro\n\nSo given all that, I want to turn to a speech.\n\narchived recording Good morning. Its my pleasure and privilege to welcome back Chair Jay Powell.\n\nmichael barbaro\n\nThat the chairman of the Federal Reserve, Jerome Powell, made a couple of days ago, that I think speaks to all this data.\n\nben castleman\n\nYeah.\n\nmichael barbaro\n\nAnd of course, the chairman of the Federal Reserve doesnt make a ton of speeches, so I know that his words carry a lot of weight.\n\nben castleman\n\nYeah. So Jerome Powell comes out.\n\narchived recording (jerome powell) The coronavirus has left a devastating human and economic toll in its wake.\n\nben castleman\n\nOf course, hes giving the speech remotely, so hes in front of these blue curtains  or maybe theyre digitally superimposed blue curtains, Im not actually sure  on a Zoom-style call. But he comes out with this really stark message.\n\narchived recording (jerome powell) The scope and speed of this downturn are without modern precedent.\n\nben castleman\n\nAnd hes saying, this economic crisis is incredibly deep.\n\narchived recording (jerome powell) We are seeing a severe decline in economic activity and employment.\n\nben castleman\n\nIts incredibly broad.\n\narchived recording (jerome powell) And already, the job gains of the last decade have been erased.\n\nben castleman\n\nAnd it is hitting the most vulnerable workers more than anyone. He has this line early in the speech where he says \n\narchived recording (jerome powell) While were all affected.\n\nben castleman\n\nWhile we are all affected \n\narchived recording (jerome powell) The burden has fallen most heavily on those least able to bear it.\n\nben castleman\n\n The burden has fallen most heavily on those least able to bear it.\n\narchived recording (jerome powell) Among people who were working in February, almost 40 percent of those in households making less than $40,000 a year, had lost a job in March.\n\nben castleman\n\nLower income Americans, black Americans, less educated Americans.\n\narchived recording (jerome powell) But the coronavirus crisis raises longer term concerns as well. The record shows that deeper and longer recessions can leave behind lasting damage to the productive capacity of the economy.\n\nmichael barbaro\n\nAnd Ben Powell talks about this specter of permanent economic damage in this speech, and perhaps he was referring most urgently to these lower income workers. But I want to understand that concept, because it feels a little bit new to me. I think of almost all economic conditions as temporary. So what did he mean by that?\n\nben castleman\n\nYoure right to think about most economic conditions as temporary, because historically, that is the way economists have thought about recessions and economic downturns  is some people lose their jobs, and then they get those jobs back when things get better. Some businesses lose business, or maybe they go out of business, but other things come back up and replace them. But weve learned over time that that is not the way recessions always work, and especially long and deep recessions. That when people lose their jobs, if theyre out of work for too long, they can drift away from the labor market. They can lose their connections, and all of a sudden, even when the economy starts to get better, its very hard for them to get back to work.\n\nmichael barbaro\n\nI wonder if you can give me an example of this to bring it to life.\n\nben castleman\n\nWell, imagine a small company, right, that maybe somebody has spent their lives, maybe a couple generations building. You could imagine if this crisis were to last a few weeks, they lose some revenue, they take a hit, but they start right back up where they left off. But as this drags on and they fall behind on loans, you fall behind on your rent payments, and all of a sudden, you can get to a place where you cant reopen that business, where you cant restart. And sure, the business owner might be able to go and find another job, but that business is lost forever.\n\nmichael barbaro\n\nAnd so that is what Powell is referring to when he talks about permanent economic damage from this pandemic.\n\nben castleman\n\nThats what Powell fears, and thats what he wants to make sure we avoid.\n\nmichael barbaro\n\nWhat kind of solution, what kind of plan does he have in mind in this speech to avoid permanent economic damage?\n\nben castleman\n\nWell, Powell starts by talking about all the things that we have already done, and hes full of praise for that.\n\narchived recording (jerome powell) The response here in the United States has been particularly swift and forceful.\n\nben castleman\n\nHe talks about what the Fed itself has done, of course, but he also talks about \n\narchived recording (jerome powell) To date, Congress has provided roughly $2.9 trillion.\n\nben castleman\n\n what Congress has done, the nearly $3 trillion in emergency spending that Congress has approved.\n\narchived recording (jerome powell) For households, businesses, health care providers and state and local governments.\n\nben castleman\n\nAnd there are a lot of programs that Congress has enacted to try to deal with this, right? Theyve written checks to virtually every American. Theyve offered loans and grants to businesses, and Powell says that all of those things have been incredibly important to softening the blow of this crisis.\n\narchived recording (jerome powell) The overall policy response to date has provided a measure of relief and stability and will provide some support to the recovery, when it comes.\n\nben castleman\n\nBut then, he says \n\narchived recording (jerome powell) But the coronavirus crisis raises longer term concerns as well.\n\nben castleman\n\n basically, were not done yet.\n\nmichael barbaro\n\nThat that was not enough.\n\nben castleman\n\nThat it probably wont be enough. That we know now that this is not a crisis that is going to last for just a month or just a couple of months. Its going to drag on. And that as it drags on, if the government doesnt step in and do enough to keep people and businesses afloat, then were going to see a lot more of that kind of permanent damage that Powell is talking about.\n\nmichael barbaro\n\nAnd when he suggests that we arent done yet, what is he really saying?\n\nben castleman\n\nWhat hes really saying is to Congress, you need to keep spending. The Fed will do what it can do, but the Fed can only lend money. Its Congress that has the ability to spend money, to give money to people, to give money to businesses. And that is, in all likelihood, what it will take to get through this period. He describes whats been done so far as a bridge, a bridge across temporary interruptions, he says. And what hes basically saying is the bridge doesnt yet reach all the way across the river. And a bridge doesnt do you much good if it stops when youre still over water.\n\nmichael barbaro\n\nNo. It does not. Is that normal for the chairman of the Fed to do this, to be advising Congress to spend a lot more money in this manner?\n\nben castleman\n\nNot in as direct terms as this. But this was, at least by the standards of Fed chairs, a pretty direct call to action.\n\narchived recording (jerome powell) Additional fiscal support could be costly but worth it, if it helps avoid long term damage and leaves us with a stronger recovery. This trade-off is one for our elected representatives who wield powers of taxation and spending.\n\nmichael barbaro\n\nAnd can we safely assume that when the chairman of the Federal Reserve tells Congress, this is what I think you should do, that he assumes that that is what Congress will do?\n\nben castleman\n\nOh, I dont think we should assume that Powell thinks that Congress will do it. But I think Powell knew that he was speaking at a moment when theres a major political debate thats playing out between Democrats and Republicans about what the role of government is in this crisis. And hes, in effect, weighing in on one side of that debate, but I dont think hes under any illusion that he alone will resolve it.\n\nmichael barbaro\n\nWell be right back.\n\n[music]\n\nmichael barbaro\n\nSo Ben, describe the divisions between Democrats and Republicans in Congress about this advice from Jerome Powell, the chairman of the Federal Reserve.\n\nben castleman\n\nWell, think back for a moment to those trillions of dollars in spending that have already taken place.\n\narchived recording (charles grassley) I want to highlight a few areas of bipartisan economic relief we will be voting on today. Recovery checks to give Americans needed cash to provide for their families.\n\nben castleman\n\nWhen Congress approved those measures, it was really bipartisan.\n\nmichael barbaro\n\nRight.\n\narchived recording (chuck schumer) This is a strange and evil disease. There is much we still dont know about it, and it is keeping us apart.\n\nben castleman\n\nBut that came at a moment when the economy was in the process of shutting down, and there was pretty widespread agreement that that had to happen.\n\narchived recording (chuck schumer) When we passed this bill, instead of hugging each other, well wave from a distance. None of us can know when this plague will pass. The only thing we know for sure is that we must summon the same spirit that saw previous generations through Americas darkest hours.\n\nben castleman\n\nWere now in a very different moment.\n\narchived recording Democratic leader. archived recording (chuck schumer) Well, its been two weeks since Leader McConnell called us back into session.\n\nben castleman\n\nWhere there are real divisions between Republicans and Democrats about how quickly reopening should take place.\n\narchived recording (chuck schumer) In that time, it was announced that 30 million Americans filed for unemployment. And yet the Republican leader has scheduled exactly zero votes, zero, on legislation related to the coronavirus crisis.\n\nben castleman\n\nAnd with that comes real disagreement about the role of the federal government in continuing to support businesses and especially workers.\n\narchived recording (chuck schumer) Lets solve the problem right now. What are we going to do for people who are out of work?\n\nben castleman\n\nThe Democrats are by and large saying, much of the country is still shut down.\n\narchived recording (chuck schumer) What are we going to do for businesses that are going under?\n\nben castleman\n\nAnd so the government has to continue to support workers and businesses. It has to keep on spending. The Republican side is a little more complicated.\n\narchived recording (mitch mcconnell) This emergency is very serious. So the Senates response has been serious.\n\nben castleman\n\nIts not unanimous, but there is certainly, at least in Congress, more of an inclination to say \n\narchived recording (mitch mcconnell) Look, here in the real world, Senate Republicans are working seriously to help the country reopen.\n\nben castleman\n\nLets see how this reopening process goes. Lets see if the businesses reopen, and if they do, maybe we dont need to do very much more. And if they dont come back and theres a need for further action, then we can talk about that then.\n\nmichael barbaro\n\nSo its a bit more of a wait and see whether Congress really needs to spend all that much more money.\n\nben castleman\n\nThats right, and that question of spending is whats hanging over this. The Republicans are looking at the trillions, with a T, that have been spent so far and saying, can we wait to spend more?\n\narchived recording (mitch mcconnell) The crushing unemployment figures show us that no amount of federal spending could substitute for the entirety of the U.S. economy. We need to be smart, and we need to be safe, but we have to find a more sustainable middle ground.\n\nmichael barbaro\n\nBen, how tied are these different approaches to the long-standing economic ideologies of the Democratic and Republican parties?\n\nben castleman\n\nWell, look, Republicans have a long-standing discomfort with programs like unemployment insurance.\n\narchived recording (john coryn) At a certain point, these benefits are going to do more harm than good, and I would say they already are starting to do that. So extending unemployment benefits through next year would deter people from trying to return to work, because why would they? Why would someone choose to do more work for less money?\n\nben castleman\n\nSo its not surprising that as we move from the acute phase of this crisis into the long, slow recovery, that Republicans would be the first to start raising questions about the spending and to start thinking about pulling back on some of those programs.\n\narchived recording (john coryn) So were already looking at staggering debt that we are going to have to deal with at some point, because its immoral to expect our kids and grandkids to pay that money back after weve already cashed those checks.\n\nben castleman\n\nDemocrats have long advocated for more generous unemployment benefits, for a larger role for government, and so its not too surprising that they are more comfortable with these programs lasting longer.\n\narchived recording (elizabeth warren) We need to show that we have a government that understands the scale of this problem and understands that the approach to it is to get money down into the hands of the people who will put it down at the grassroots level and help support this economy from the ground up.\n\nmichael barbaro\n\nAnd so this is the long-standing, very inflexible ideological terrain that Powell is entering when he goes to Congress and says, hey, cough up trillions of dollars more.\n\nben castleman\n\nThats right.\n\nmichael barbaro\n\nBut it feels like in this debate, the real anxiety is over just the enormity of the scale of money that were talking about. And I feel at this point, I have to ask you the question that we all pretend to know the answer to, which is: Where does all this money come from that Powell is suggesting Congress spend and that Democrats and Republicans are not really agreeing on whether to spend?\n\nben castleman\n\nIn the simplest terms, were borrowing it. The congressional budget office projects that the deficit this year will be $3.7 trillion.\n\nmichael barbaro\n\nAnd were borrowing those trillions of dollars from whom?\n\nben castleman\n\nSo Congress decides how much its going to spend, and it of course sets tax rates as well. And any time that Congress decides to spend more than it brings in in tax rates, then the Treasury Department has to sell bonds to make up the difference. And that just means that its asking people, investors, foreign governments to lend the United States money. You give us money now, well give you money back with a small amount of interest in anywhere from a few days to 10 years.\n\nmichael barbaro\n\nRight. So when we hear about treasury bonds and their yields, that is the interest payment that the U.S. government is giving to someone who buys a treasury bond, and then the process has lent money to the U.S. and to Congress.\n\nben castleman\n\nThats right. Every time the government sells a bond, its borrowing money from the public. Its paying some interest on that, just like if you borrowed money to buy a house or to make a purchase, to buy a car. The only difference is the federal government gets a much better interest rate than you or I ever will.\n\nmichael barbaro\n\nSo we kind of become the bank.\n\nben castleman\n\nWe become the bank.\n\nmichael barbaro\n\nAnd to hear someone like Jerome Powell describe it, that doesnt seem all that risky for Congress to spend all that money, which would require the U.S. borrowing that much from us and anyone who wants to buy U.S. treasury bonds. But is it risky?\n\nben castleman\n\nSo in the short term, theres really no risk here. We can keep borrowing, as long as people will keep lending us money. In the long term, of course, we have to make good on those loans.\n\nmichael barbaro\n\nRight.\n\nben castleman\n\nAnd we have to pay interest on those loans. And so there will certainly be a debate when we come out the other side of this crisis about what the government should do about these huge deficits. But that debate is still years away. Because were at a very particular moment right now, which is that were in the middle of an immediate crisis. And if we dont get our economy back on track, then none of that longer run debate matters. That debate is conditional on having an economy at all on the other side of this.\n\nmichael barbaro\n\nRight. So you could have an economy with little debt, but you might not have much of an economy at all.\n\nben castleman\n\nYeah. Powell is saying, the debt is the least of our worries right now. Its not that it doesnt matter. Its not that it will never matter. But we have to try to get the economy through this period and moving again, before we can worry about any of those other long-run concerns. You could think about it like performing CPR. Right? Performing CPR often involves breaking ribs, and thats a real consequence. But that doesnt mean you dont perform CPR. You perform CPR, you try to get somebody whose heart started again, and then you worry about the other consequences once the persons heart is beating again.\n\nmichael barbaro\n\nAnd just to be clear, in this metaphor the broken ribs is massive U.S. debt spending on stimulus.\n\nben castleman\n\nAnd the heart is the American economy, which right now is stopped and which we somehow have to get beating again. And so what you now have is Powell and lots of other economists who, like him, would normally be worried about the debt who are saying, now is not the moment. That includes people who were advisers to George W. Bush, people who were advisers to Republican candidates and Republican leaders throughout the last several decades. Pretty much all of the economists that I talk to and that my colleagues have been talking to are saying the same thing, which is now is not the moment to worry about the debt.\n\nmichael barbaro\n\nSo if this is the broad consensus of economists across the United States, Ben, why is this much of a debate in Congress at all?\n\nben castleman\n\nEconomists like to think that they issue these sage pieces of advice, and everybody on Capitol Hill and in statehouses will rush to follow them. But of course, thats not the way the world works.\n\nmichael barbaro\n\nAnd so it may well be the case that many members of Congress thank the Federal Reserve chairman but say, you know, were not going to follow that advice.\n\nben castleman\n\nAnd weve already heard Republicans in Congress saying exactly that.\n\narchived recording (mitch mcconnell) Look, we cant spend enough money to prop this economy up forever. People need to be able to begin to be productive again, consistent with the guidelines that have been laid down by the health care professionals toward opening up the economy. Its the only solution to the dilemma with which we are confronted.\n\nben castleman\n\nThey just dont believe that what Powell is saying right now is the real solution to our economic problems, even though many of their own economic advisers are telling them the same thing.\n\n[music]\n\nmichael barbaro\n\nBen, thank you very much.\n\nben castleman\n\nThanks for having me.\n\nmichael barbaro\n\nWell be right back.\n\n[music]\n\nHeres what else you need to know today.\n\narchived recording [CHEERING] Congratulations. You did it. Were so proud of you, Davie.\n\nmichael barbaro\n\nThousands of high school and college seniors across the country \n\narchived recording Yeah. Congratulations. Good job.\n\nmichael barbaro\n\ncelebrated their graduation over the weekend in virtual ceremonies.\n\narchived recording Happy graduation, Madison. We all love you! Love you!\n\nmichael barbaro\n\nAnd were toasted in commencement speeches by everyone from Oprah Winfrey to Tom Hanks.\n\narchived recording (tom hanks) You are the chosen ones. You are the chosen ones because of the fate unimagined when you began your Wright State adventures. You started in the olden times, in the world back before the great pandemic of 2020. You will talk of those earlier years in your lives just that way. Well, that was back before the Covid-19.\n\nmichael barbaro\n\nIn his commencement speeches, former President Barack Obama delivered pointed criticism of how the U.S. government has handled the pandemic.\n\narchived recording (barack obama) More than anything, this pandemic has fully finally torn back the curtain on the idea that so many of the folks in charge know what theyre doing. A lot of them arent even pretending to be in charge.\n\nmichael barbaro\n\nObama did not mention President Trump by name, but his remarks were seen as a clear indictment of his successor.\n\narchived recording (barack obama) All those adults that used to think they were in charge and knew what they were doing, turns out, they dont have all the answers. A lot of them arent even asking the right questions. So if the worlds going to get better, its going to be up to you.\n\nmichael barbaro'	b'Can Government Spending Save the Economy?'	2020-05-18	[]	['spending', 'think', 'economy', 'powell', 'save', 'congress', 'money', 'economic', 'going', 'recording', 'jerome', 'right']	b'archived recording (jerome powell) And already, the job gains of the last decade have been erased.\nHe has this line early in the speech where he says archived recording (jerome powell) While were all affected.\nben castlemanWhile we are all affected archived recording (jerome powell) The burden has fallen most heavily on those least able to bear it.\nben castlemanBut then, he says archived recording (jerome powell) But the coronavirus crisis raises longer term concerns as well.\nSo you could have an economy with little debt, but you might not have much of an economy at all.'

I will just lift myself up. People at home wont see this, but I literally like to  just every once in a while, this yogic squat is very  malasana, I think they call it. This is just really good for your legs every hour or something like that.\n\n[music]\n\nHi, Im James Poniewozik, and Im a TV critic for The New York Times. Other than the fear of death and social collapse and economic catastrophe, the day-to-day of my life has not really changed that much. I always work from home. This thing that everybody is dealing with now  you know, how do I keep myself from going insane if I dont go outside  thats been my life for years. Were all kind of stay-at-home TV critics now. Welcome to my world, America. Particularly as a TV critic, Im very attuned to the fact that there is a lot of language of shame that is built around our consumption of TV. People who watch TV are couch potatoes. And there might be a feeling that if youre quarantined inside and watching six episodes of something on Netflix, that youre doing something shameful and unproductive. And I am here to tell you, as a professional TV watcher, that you should not feel ashamed. Consuming entertainment, experiencing good or even brilliantly dumb art is a form of self-care. It is something salutary that you are doing for your brain. To help your brain deal with the often painful process of living in the world in this really crazy time. Art, whether it is a marble statue or a network sitcom, is human beings trying to express something that they cant express in literal language, and how to process all of the overwhelming things that humans have to deal with. Honestly, that was probably a big aspect of my childhood. I think my parents and I often communicated with each other more through the shows we were watching at the same time than through things that we directly said to each other.\n\n[m*a*s*h theme music]\n\nI remember watching M*A*S*H during the afternoon and the early evening, when it would rerun, with my dad. My dad drove a beer and liquor delivery truck. He was a Teamster, which was a very physically punishing job. Like, he destroyed his back and his knees. And so when he would come home, he would  for some reason this felt good to him  would lie down on the living room floor in front of the TV. And my memory of watching M*A*S*H is me on the living room couch and my dad in front of me, maybe propped up on one arm on the floor, watching the TV sort of at my feet.\n\narchived recording (m*a*s*h) Beans, beans, beans, beans. Potatoes, potatoes, potatoes. Applesauce, applesauce, applesauce. You got that?\n\njames poniewozik\n\nMy dad was not of the generation where you would, you know, you purposely do things to bond with your children.

Im afraid to tell him. archived recording 3 You better show him the orders, Radar. archived recording 4 Hell hit me.\n\njames poniewozik\n\nSo right now its my wife and I, and we have two kids at home. My younger sons in high school. My older son is in his first year of college and is now around the house. And \n\n[""survivor"" theme music]\n\n were not really a sports family. But Survivor, its our competition. There is a great deal of meta Survivor analysis that occupies much of the time in our household.\n\narchived recording Go!\n\njames poniewozik\n\nI tend to get shushed a lot while were watching Survivor.\n\narchived recording  right in it!\n\njames poniewozik\n\nBecause I make comments or have questions for my son, the Survivor expert \n\narchived recording You didnt do anything! You were made fun of! And you come here and you \n\njames poniewozik\n\n that kind of break the spell or interrupt somebodys dialogue. And then somebody has to rewind.\n\narchived recording You didnt do anything! You were made fun of! And you come here, and you tell me, dont bite the hand that feeds you? I feed myself!\n\njames poniewozik\n\nAnd Im in trouble, and I am reminded that watching Survivor is a privilege and not a right.\n\narchived recording I took myself out of this game!\n\njames poniewozik\n\nIve been watching Bobs Burgers. Thats the show that just Andre and I  my younger son and I  watch together. My wife is not particularly into the show. My older son can take it or leave it. So that will be if everybody else has gone to bed or is doing something else. And we do have a little dance that we do sitting on the couch. Theres the theme song. Its on I think ukulele.\n\n[""bob\'s burgers"" theme music]\n\nDun, dun, dun, dun, dun, dun, dun. And theres this, like, percussion thing. Boom! And we lean into each other and bump shoulders. Boom! Back the other way. Boom! And bump shoulders again. Just us.\n\njames poniewozik\n\nWhat are some of other regular shows? My older son, whos a music major in college, he was able to airdrum, beginning to end, all the percussion moments in the Friday Night Lights theme song.\n\n[""friday night lights"" theme music]\n\nHe had all these gestures that I cant reproduce or whatever. This is one of the most beautiful shows ever made for television thats not just about football.\n\narchived recording (coach taylor) Everybody wrote us off. Everybody.\n\njames poniewozik\n\nBut about community. About the connection among people. And about how a society needs every one of its members to contribute for the good of all.\n\narchived recording (coach taylor) There are a few out there who do still believe in you, fewll never give up on you. You go back out on the field. Those are the people I want in your minds.

Lets go!\n\njames poniewozik\n\nI cant change the fact that every human on earth has a real existential problem right now. And I cant change how, even some of the shows that I love and that simply entertained me before are now, in many ways, painful reminders. But I can deal with them, and make it a little easier to tolerate, and even enjoy getting through it, through the people that I watch with and through the rituals that we have of watching. Sharing TV with people you love, whether theyre with you or on the other end of a Zoom chat, can be a really valuable way to get through this.\n\n[music]\n\ntejal rao\n\nHi, Im Tejal Rao. Im the California restaurant critic for The New York Times, and Im also a columnist for The New York Times Magazine. Well, its been really strange, because there isnt much use for restaurant criticism right now. The restaurant industry is suffering, and so many restaurant workers are out of work. And Im really, really worried. Im really missing going out to restaurants and being in public spaces, and the luxury of other people cooking for me. And Im cooking a lot at home, but Im also doing this really slightly strange thing, which is rewatching food scenes in movies that I love. Because I havent had that kind of contact in public spaces, and restaurants are so important to me. So theres something about seeing people being together, and cooking, and eating in a film or in a TV show thats just really doing it for me right now.\n\n[music]\n\nOK, so over the weekend, I watched Big Night.\n\narchived recording (claudio villa) [SINGING IN ITALIAN]\n\ntejal rao\n\nSo I intended to just watch the dinner scene, which is kind of an epic, Italian-style dinner, set in the 1950s. But when the movie opened, its Claudio Villa singing this very beautiful song with his operatic voice.\n\narchived recording (claudio villa) [SINGING IN ITALIAN]\n\ntejal rao\n\nWaves are rolling on the Jersey shore, and I just ended up watching the whole movie. I feel like I just want to explain a tiny bit of the movie to you. So \n\narchived recording What?\n\ntejal rao\n\nIts about two brothers.\n\narchived recording More salt.\n\ntejal rao\n\nStanley Tucci, Tony Shalhoub.\n\narchived recording Not too fine. Sometimes you cut it too fine, then all you taste is the garlic.\n\ntejal rao\n\nWho are running a restaurant on the Jersey shore. And its a classic setup. The restaurant across the street from them is super successful. Meanwhile, their restaurant is really quiet, kind of failing. They owe the bank a lot of money. And part of it is that they just refuse to cook Italian-American food.\n\narchived recording 1 But I get a side order of spaghetti with this, right? archived recording 2 Why? archived recording 3 Well, no. archived recording 4 I thought all main courses come with spaghetti. archived recording 5 Well some, yes. But, you see, risotto is rice, so it is a starch. And it doesnt go really with pasta.\n\ntejal rao\n\nYou know, people want spaghetti with meatballs, and they want tons of seafood in their risotto.\n\narchived recording 1 There are no meatballs with the spaghetti? archived recording 2 No. Sometimes spaghetti likes to be alone. [LAUGHTER]\n\ntejal rao\n\nAnd Tony Shalhoub plays this perfectionist chef, who refuses to compromise.\n\narchived recording 1 Just make me a side order of spaghetti please. archived recording 2 What? Why? archived recording 3 She likes starch. I dont know! Come on!\n\ntejal rao\n\nAnd they only want to make very traditional Italian stuff.\n\narchived recording Who are these people in America? Shes a criminal. I want to talk to her.\n\ntejal rao\n\nThere are moments  I dont want to be mean to Stanley Tucci  but there are moments, where its almost like, you know how the French accents are in Monty Python?\n\narchived recording I dont want to talk to you no more, you empty-headed \n\ntejal rao\n\nWhere theyre just so absurd and silly and over-the-top.\n\narchived recording I fart in your general direction.\n\ntejal rao\n\nThere are few moments where \n\narchived recording They both are a starch. Maybe I should make a mashed potato for on the other side.\n\ntejal rao\n\n their Italian accents get a little cartoonish.\n\narchived recording Shes a Philistine. Im not going to talk to her. She no understand anyway.\n\ntejal rao\n\nBut its so charming. Its so charming all the same that its fine.\n\narchived recording [SINGING IN ITALIAN]\n\ntejal rao\n\nOne of my favorite moments is just, like, Stanley Tucci and Tony Shalhoubs hairy forearms making the pasta. Theres something about seeing these bare, hairy forearms making a huge mess with egg yolks and flour, and kneading it directly on the table, where one of the cooks also sleeps. Were all being so careful right now, as we should be, with gloves and masks. And the intimacy of the two of them cooking together and also cooking for other people, its a really, really beautiful scene. So, the rival restaurant across the street thats doing really well, its run by this showboat restauranteur, who lights stuff on fire to create a scene in the dining room. And the brothers run this very quiet, simple restaurant. And the rival restauranteur says, you know what? Im friends with Louis Prima, and hes coming to town next week. And Ill tell him to come to your restaurant. So why dont you cook a special dinner for Louis Prima. And so they plan this big night to cook for a celebrity. And theyre waiting and waiting. And people start drinking and dancing and eating snacks. Wisps of hair coming undone, because people are starting to get a little wild. And they just sit down to eat dinner without Louis Prima.\n\narchived recording No, no, no. We dont have time for tour. Lets go. Come on. Come on. [INAUDIBLE] open the door.\n\ntejal rao\n\nThats where the magic of the movie happens. Its all at the table.\n\narchived recording 1 What is that? archived recording 2 Its timpano. Its a secret recipe that they brought from their hometown.\n\ntejal rao\n\nTheyre in this very plain dining room. The music is blasting, and theres always this moment at a dinner party when all of a sudden, people have had just enough to drink that they sort of start to loosen up. And you see it happen in real time in the movie.\n\narchived recording 1 [DISHES CLATTERING] archived recording 2 Dammit! archived recording 3 This is so [EXPLETIVE] good, I should kill you.\n\ntejal rao\n\nAll of a sudden \n\narchived recording [LAUGHTER AND CHATTER]\n\ntejal rao\n\n all the glasses start clinking. People are holding wine bottles and pretending to karaoke into them. And dancing. You can see all these women with their perfect red lips unobscured by masks. And everyones making sure that everyone elses glasses stay full all the time. It was like catnip for me. And it also emotionally kind of wrecked me to see people having so much fun. Theres something magical about seeing restaurants that are really, really alive and busy, and financially successful probably, too. Its so fortifying to remember that we can gather like that again on the other side of this.\n\n[music]'"	b'A Bit of Relief: Reruns, Rituals and Restaurants'	2020-05-15	[]	['relief', 'tv', 'restaurants', 'rituals', 'watching', 'restaurant', 'come', 'im', 'archived', 'really', 'recording', 'dont', 'right', 'bit', 'reruns']	b'And Im really, really worried.\nIm really missing going out to restaurants and being in public spaces, and the luxury of other people cooking for me.\nAnd the intimacy of the two of them cooking together and also cooking for other people, its a really, really beautiful scene.\narchived recording 1 [DISHES CLATTERING] archived recording 2 Dammit!\nTheres something magical about seeing restaurants that are really, really alive and busy, and financially successful probably, too.'

And what kind of a living do the people generally make?\n\nphil campbell\n\nI mean, many of the people in our company, they provide for their families. You know, theyre the breadwinner. You know, a new technician like starting might make 35.\n\nmichael barbaro\n\nMm-hm.\n\nphil campbell\n\nAnd then a technician whos been with us for a while and knows what hes doing, he can make in the high 50s or 60s. So with the 30 employees we have, we feed about 100 mouths, with their children and families. So we feel responsible for about 100 peoples well-being.\n\nmichael barbaro\n\nAnd what did the first Michigan lockdown, the one ordered by Governor Whitmer  what did it mean for your pest control business?\n\nphil campbell\n\nHer order did not exempt us. The text of the order itself, it did not make an exemption for wildlife control, pest control. And we were preparing to shut down. And then I noticed that it said for its definition of essential services, for further clarification, see this document by the Department of Homeland Security. And we found that we were allowed to stay open.\n\nmichael barbaro\n\nGot it.\n\nphil campbell\n\nBut very quickly after that we had to furlough a couple people after that, because even though we were allowed to stay open, our customer base, many of them arent working. So if your customers arent working, theyre not spending money. And it doesnt really matter if youre open if all the people you serve arent working, you know what I mean?\n\nmichael barbaro\n\nRight. I dont want to pry too much, but if you were bringing in  I think you said almost $3 million a year in revenue  before this, what did it start to look like once the lockdown was in place and the calls from customers began to taper off?\n\nphil campbell\n\nAt first, it was a 50 percent drop.\n\nmichael barbaro\n\nWow.\n\nphil campbell\n\nAgain, this is for a company that was allowed to stay open.\n\nmichael barbaro\n\nRight.\n\nphil campbell\n\nAnd then around this time, the second shutdown order came in, which was the one that everybody started protesting about.\n\nmichael barbaro\n\nTell me what you mean.\n\nphil campbell\n\nYeah, the second shutdown order just ramped down on the first. This was the one that went in and shut particular sections of stores that were still open. So like it said, you cant buy paint products, you cant buy gardening products. Because what was happening is people thinking, OK, I got to stay home, I might as well work on my house, you know? So a lot of those people were going to Home Depot, were going to whatever to get their supplies. And then the governor said, no, you cant get that stuff. So this was the order that said you cant go out on a lake by yourself in your boat in your private lake, if the boat has a motor. But if it doesnt have a motor, you can go. Things that seemed a lot more arbitrary. The one that said you cant have someone come mow your lawn, even though they pull up in a truck, they drive the lawnmower off, they dont touch you, they dont go into your house. Its just one guy mowing your lawn. You know, things that people started thinking, like, the economys already in freefall, is it really necessary to go this far with it? From my own experience, if the economy takes a dump and we cant get back to where we were, we have to cut their health insurance or were going to have to lay people off. Were going to take other measures to stay afloat. I dont know what were going to have to do. I dont want to hypothesize. I dont want my employees to listen to this and be like, what did you say is going to happen? I dont know, were going to have do something. We cant just suddenly take a 30 percent to 50 percent decline. Thats huge. What if you got a 50 percent pay cut? It would affect your life. And so Im thinking about the ripple effect. We take a 30 percent to 50 percent drop. Our employees take a dip. Maybe they cant afford to pay their debts. Maybe they cant afford to pay their own mortgages or whatever. I dont know. I havent assessed the financial situation of each of my employees. But I guess what I am frustrated about  and I dont want to minimize the risk of Covid-19 or the people whove had it  but as someone whos worked for 10 years in this business trying to build it up, get it to where it is, Im frustrated with the attitude of some people that we can just shut it off for a while, and then just turn it back on when everythings safe, and just pick up where we left off. Like, no, thats not how business works. Thats certainly not how small business works. If you take a big enough hit, its hard to recover from it, you know?\n\nmichael barbaro\n\nSo Im curious when you first hear about the possibility of a public demonstration, a protest, in Michigan of these lockdown rules?\n\nphil campbell\n\nI saw an event on social media, I think, or I saw people talking about it  like, hey, lets go down to Lansing and protest. So the owner and I  works been slow, so we said, hey, we got time. Lets drive down to Lansing on Thursday. The way I understood it, we were going to drive by the capitol and honk our horn, basically.\n\nmichael barbaro\n\nAnd what was that honked horn going to mean?\n\nphil campbell\n\nThe honked horn was going to mean like, we are workers, and we want the freedom for people to be able to work. Please consider opening things back up a little more. The capitol in Lansing, its on a loop, so you drive around in like a circle around the capitol. So I thought that all the traffic would come in, wed kind of loop around and wed honk, and then wed go back home, you know? But they were anticipating a certain amount of people  I think 10 times more than they anticipated showed up. So it took us two hours to get to Lansing. We got in Lansing, and then we were just  Michael, it was a traffic jam. Thats what it was. It was just a big traf  it was like an organized traffic jam.\n\nmichael barbaro\n\nBut what did it feel like to be in that traffic jam? Because its a particular kind of traffic jam with like-minded people there to protest something.\n\nphil campbell\n\nIt was really neat. It was nice to not feel so alone, because I was really sick of people on social media telling me Im selfish because I dont want the company I helped build for 10 years to just collapse.\n\nmichael barbaro\n\nWhos calling you selfish, do you feel like?\n\nphil campbell\n\nOh, just people on social media, my friends. People in my broader circle. You know, not people Im necessarily close to, but Id say I lost some friends over this, honestly. When the governor shut the economy down, I said this is going to be very hard on businesses and this is going to be very hard on us. And a lot of peoples response seemed to be like, what, do you want people to die or something, you know? And it kind of degenerated into, like, either you want people to die or you hate my business and stuff like that. And I was really glad, because I was starting to feel kind of isolated, to see a solidarity of so many other Michiganders who were similarly frustrated at the situation. Afterwards, when I got home, I saw there was a lot of people with a lot of Trump stuff, and I was kind of thinking, like, no, this isnt political. Dont make it into a political thing because this isnt about the governor happens to be a Democrat or a woman or something. Because I would have gone down there if it was a Republican, you know? It wasnt about her party affiliation. So I was frustrated \n\nmichael barbaro\n\nWhat did you make of the flavor of the protest? It seems like you didnt see this yourself in your car, but as youve hinted, there were strong strains of libertarianism and conservatism, and pro-Trump posters, as well as people with guns, as well as some, you know, some more vulgar and extreme sentiments. Some people compared Governor Whitmer to Hitler.\n\nphil campbell\n\nOh, like Governor Whitler? [LAUGHS] Oh, I dont know, I think thats just juvenile. I mean, I think its pretty juvenile in public discourse when the only thing you go to is compare your opponent to Hitler. I wish it wouldnt have been so much anti-Whitmer, because this isnt about like Governor Whitmer, the person, you know? I wish that it would have been more on point and focused about let me work, you know?\n\nmichael barbaro\n\nI wonder where you fall in the political spectrum. Did you vote for Trump? Did you vote for Whitmer? And how did your political views apply to this event?\n\nphil campbell\n\nMy political views didnt apply to this event really at all. You know, like, I wouldve been there if this was a Republican. I did vote for Trump. I dont particularly think hes doing that great of a job. So Im not a gung-ho Trump supporter. I didnt vote for Whitmer, but I didnt like the guy running against her, either. So.\n\nmichael barbaro\n\nYoure saying youre not seeing this crisis or the lockdowns through a political lens?\n\nphil campbell\n\nNo, no, not at all. Not at all. The little match between President Trump and Governor Whitmer is making it more political. When Trump tweets, Liberate Michigan, when he refers to her as that woman from Michigan, obviously, that sets Governor Whitmer up as a foil against President Trump, which politicizes it. When rumors start coming out that Biden wants to consider her as V.P. material, that politicizes it. I really liked when I was there that it simply seemed like a spontaneous expression of working class frustration.\n\nmichael barbaro\n\nPhil, I want to tick through what your governor said when she began this process of locking down the state and basically enforcing social distancing. And heres what she said: The only tool we have to fight the virus at this moment and to support our health care system is to give them the opportunity by buying some time.\n\nphil campbell\n\nYeah.\n\nmichael barbaro\n\nAnd she went on to say, Without aggressive measures, more people will get sick, more people will die, and our economy will suffer longer. And in her telling, the disease spreads if people are out there. If people arent out there, the disease doesnt spread. So she is making the case in the beginning that these sacrifices are required to prevent a system overload. What do you think of that?\n\nphil campbell\n\nWell, we were willing to go along with that, because we were all expecting this huge crunch on all our hospitals. We were worried about not enough beds, not enough ventilators. But the fact is the curve is flattened now. We now have hospitals, theyre not overwhelmed anymore. So what were saying is that was all well and good, but now, we can start to open up again because we flattened the curve. Even if infections go back up at this point, as I grant they could if we start being more economically active, it seems highly unlikely, given all the empty hospitals, that were going to get to another crush where we dont have enough beds or something like that.\n\nmichael barbaro\n\nSo I want to make sure I understand what youre saying when you talk about where things are in Michigan. The Times has maps about where the virus is in each state. And just pulling this up, Michigan has about 38,000 infections, and theres been about 3,300 deaths.\n\nphil campbell\n\nYeah, were the third highest state, I think.\n\nmichael barbaro\n\nSo when you talk about your frustrations with the different phases of this lockdown, how do you square it with those numbers?\n\nphil campbell\n\nWell, I square it because my understanding is that the lockdown wasnt supposed to be like, were going to lockdown until this goes away. What we were told was that this lockdown was to distribute those amount of cases over a longer period of time, so that the health system doesnt get overwhelmed. So I look at the total number of deaths and infections and say, OK, this thing is here to stay whether we like it or not. The hospitals do have the ability to take people in. So it seems like to me that the goal has been met. The goal is not to \n\nmichael barbaro\n\nIt sounds like youre saying that if we assume that the measures taken so far have flattened the curve to some degree in Michigan, that youre willing to accept the risks of restarting the economy, even if that means that the curve might go up a little bit. That you think that so far the measures taken have done enough to merit that kind of experimentation with, essentially, taking the risk of reopening.\n\nphil campbell\n\nI think so. And again, Im not saying just a full, like  the economy isnt a switch, you just turn it on, everybody comes back out, you know? But I think people who want to work and can work in a way that is maintaining safe protocols, I think they should be able to. Because the thing is, what I would like people to understand is that its not like either we stay home and stay safe, or we all get the coronavirus and die. Its like staying home and nobody working has its own inherent risks and dangers and devastation thats going to come. When I talk about the economy, Im not saying Im worried about the stock market or the financial sector. Im talking about the ability of the average person to provide sustenance for himself and ones family. So we could have negative outcomes because of the shutdown, not because of Covid  negative outcomes that dwarf Covid.\n\nmichael barbaro\n\nMm-hm. So were now talking on Monday, April 27. And that protest was about two weeks ago.\n\nphil campbell\n\nYeah.\n\nmichael barbaro\n\nAnd Im curious if you think that protest, which was one of the very first protests, had any kind of impact?\n\nphil campbell\n\nYeah, I think it did. I mean, this is just me kind of blue skying this, but I think it let her see that she only had a limited amount of political capital that she could keep carrying this out indefinitely. She started to say, well let lawn service in again, well let various things start.\n\nmichael barbaro\n\nShe rolled back some of the more, in your mind, problematic restrictions.\n\nphil campbell\n\nYeah. She rolled back some of the more problematic restrictions and she started talking about an end game, you know? So in that respect, I think it was helpful. I think it got the message across.\n\nmichael barbaro\n\nWe plan to talk to Governor Whitmer and I wonder what you most want to communicate to her about what you think she may not understand, what she might not be getting in this moment?\n\nphil campbell\n\nWell, first, I would say to her, Americans are responsible people. Were creative people. Tell us what social distancing guidelines you think we should be maintaining when were out there, and let us find a way to do it. If you think we need to be six or seven feet apart, if you think we shouldnt have more than six people in a room, give us a safe paradigm of personal behavior and let us work within it. Dont lock us down and say that we cant provide for ourselves. Thats the most basic human right  is to provide for your own well-being. Just let us find some way to work.\n\n[music]\n\nmichael barbaro\n\nWell, Phil, thank you very much. We really appreciate your time.\n\nphil campbell\n\nYeah, thank you. I was very happy to be with you today.\n\nmichael barbaro\n\nWell be right back. Hi, there.\n\ngretchen whitmer\n\nHi.\n\nmichael barbaro\n\nGovernor Whitmer, its Michael Barbaro. How are you?\n\ngretchen whitmer\n\nIm doing all right. How are you doing?\n\nmichael barbaro\n\nIm doing great. Where are you right now? That looks like it might be home.\n\ngretchen whitmer\n\nYes. Yes, Im at the governors residence in one of the rooms.\n\nmichael barbaro\n\nIs that a sign of you that says, The Gov?\n\ngretchen whitmer\n\nIts a beer that was named after me. So yes, thats the poster.\n\nmichael barbaro\n\nAnd the beer is called The Gov?\n\ngretchen whitmer\n\nYep.\n\nmichael barbaro\n\nIs that any good?\n\ngretchen whitmer\n\nIt is pretty good. Its an Indian pale ale.\n\nmichael barbaro\n\n[LAUGHS] So governor, over the past few weeks, it feels like a lot of people have learned your name. But I sense a lot of Americans, a lot of our listeners dont know all that much about you, and how it is you became the governor of Michigan. So in brief, what is that story?\n\ngretchen whitmer\n\nYou know, Im a lifelong Michigander. Ive lived here my whole life. I was brought up in a household with a father who was kind of a Republican, a mother who was kind of a Democrat. I decided to run for governor after spending some time practicing law and teaching, and I did a stint as a prosecutor in my hometown. But I think that part of my nature is when I see a problem, and I dont see the right people there to fix it, I just kind of want to jump in and do it. The tagline of the campaign was fix the damn roads. And it wasnt because it was poll-tested. Its how everyone in the state talks about their frustration with infrastructure that hasnt been attended to properly for a long period of time. And it is the most visceral daily reminder of government thats not getting the fundamentals right.\n\nmichael barbaro\n\nMm-hm.\n\ngretchen whitmer\n\nThat was kind of the call to action. And I won by almost 10 points after Donald Trump had won my state by less than 11,000 votes just two years before, I think, because we really were trying to rally around getting the fundamentals right.\n\nmichael barbaro\n\nRight. So its fair to say that you did not run in that race for governor as somebody who would become a polarizing and partisan figure in a national debate over the future of the American economy.\n\ngretchen whitmer\n\nCorrect. [LAUGHS] To the contrary, I went out of my way to not go down that path. And so to be right here in this moment, in the midst of a global pandemic, to be trying to pull people together  where things have gotten so polarized in ways that I think many people would say they couldnt have ever predicted, if they were being honest  is kind of surreal.\n\nmichael barbaro\n\nSo lets talk about how that happened, how you have gotten to this point where theres so much polarization over your decision-making. As the pandemic unfolds, soon enough, you begin imposing restrictions on the movement of Michigan residents and what feels like a pretty standard version of a lockdown.\n\ngretchen whitmer\n\nYes.\n\nmichael barbaro\n\nBut then at a certain point, you introduce a second wave of restrictions that are a little bit different, right? Banning travel to second homes, banning motor-boating, limiting what kind of non-essential goods stores can sell. And governor, what was your thinking there with that second wave of restrictions?\n\ngretchen whitmer\n\nSo what we knew at the time was that Covid-19 was ravaging southeast Michigan.\n\nmichael barbaro\n\nMm-hm\n\ngretchen whitmer\n\nWe also know that we have an incredibly high death count compared to our population  10th largest population, but the third highest number of positive cases and number of deaths. We also know that Covid-19 doesnt recognize boundaries of a county. That this is a disease that is highly communicable. There are studies that will tell you Covid-19 can stay active and communicable for 72 hours on a stainless steel surface. And so as the weather starts to warm up here in Michigan, we know people want to head north and go to the lake.\n\nmichael barbaro\n\nMm-hm.\n\ngretchen whitmer\n\nOne of the lakes  we got lots of beautiful freshwater lakes. And the more people that are on the road, the more likely Covid-19 will be spread at a gas station. I often would invoke the visual of that gas pump. So you think about all the nurses and doctors and people that have to touch that gas pump because theyre going out to get groceries, or theyre going out to pick up medication. The more people that are on the road, the more likely Covid-19 spreads to other parts of the state, too. And thats why these restrictions made sense.\n\nmichael barbaro\n\nSo your thinking was, lets shut down anything that might contribute to the spread, and lets make sure that people in the most populous parts of Michigan dont end up basically exporting it to less populous parts of the state, where outdoor activities are concentrated. And lets do this even if it might seem a little bit extreme.\n\ngretchen whitmer\n\nLets shut down whats not life-sustaining activity. That was the thought process of why we went more aggressive than some other states.\n\nmichael barbaro\n\nSo you think those second wave measures were the right call?\n\ngretchen whitmer\n\nI do.\n\nmichael barbaro\n\nGovernor, the protests that broke out in your state, Im sure you were aware of them because youre in Lansing. Protesters very much by design came to you. Did you sympathize at all with the protesters, who said that they found these restrictions to be too onerous, to be unfair, to be  in their minds  undemocratic?\n\ngretchen whitmer\n\nIll say this. I respect peoples right to disagree with me. I do. And I will defend anyones right to say what they want to say. Their ability and right to do that is absolutely something that I have a great deal of respect for.\n\nmichael barbaro\n\nHm.\n\ngretchen whitmer\n\nThe fact of the matter is, congregation is the biggest threat to containing Covid-19. Because when people come from all different parts of the state, congregate, dont observe C.D.C. best practices, and then go back to all parts of the state, thats precisely what were hoping to avoid in terms of continuous transmission and growth in other parts of Michigan.\n\nmichael barbaro\n\nMm-hm.\n\ngretchen whitmer\n\nBut when you look at these protests, there were a variety of different political groups that came together. It had a rally feel to it. It was right outside the office. I saw, I watched a bit of it. People were open carrying automatic rifles. There were demonstrations, anti-choice demonstrations. Theyre displaying Confederate flags and Nazi symbolism, and I think very partisan rhetoric. Was more about a political statement rather than a statement of the sacrifices that Ive asked people to make.\n\nmichael barbaro\n\nWell, yesterday, Governor, I spoke with a man who was at that protest. He stayed in his car. His name was Phil Campbell. He manages a kind of moderate-sized business that he says is suffering right now under these restrictions. And he said that he didnt arrive as a partisan. That he would have gone to Lansing and protested whether you were a Democrat or a Republican. And in his mind, the shutdown is creating its own health and safety costs, right? He says his employees may soon lose their health insurance because business is suffering so much they cant afford to provide it much longer. I mean, what do you say to someone like that  who says this is not about politics, this is not about you being a Democrat, this is not about the Tea Party? This is about a view that this is just not right?\n\ngretchen whitmer\n\nThe reality is, unrestrained activity would have made what was a hard time a catastrophe that would have taken a lot longer to start to re-engage from.\n\nmichael barbaro\n\nMm-hm.\n\ngretchen whitmer\n\nWhat our modeling told us, we would have 220,000 people who would need to be hospitalized this week. We have 3,000 people who are hospitalized. Its worked. And the vast majority of people are doing their part and doing the right thing. It hasnt been easy, but theyve stepped up to do it. And weve saved lives in the process.\n\nmichael barbaro\n\nThis gentleman I spoke with, Phil, the protester, his ultimate message  and it was directed very much at you as governor  is, trust us. Let us start to go back to work not like a band-aid being ripped off, but gradually. And trust us to be able to work and follow social distancing guidelines. And I think his question to you would be, do you trust Michiganders to do that?\n\ngretchen whitmer\n\nI am so inspired by what the people of this state have done in this crisis. Theyve stepped up. Theyve made sacrifices. I have incredible faith and confidence in the people of the state. But we have a duty to make sure that we get this right.\n\nmichael barbaro\n\nMm-hm.\n\ngretchen whitmer\n\nAnd its got to be guided by the best medical experts as well as business leaders. And thats what were working to do. I have a council of business leaders and medical leaders who are helping us determine how do we start to re-engage our economy in a way that avoids a second wave. Because whether Phil and I agree on how quickly that should be done or not, I think we can both agree  I hope so  that none of us ever wants to do this again. You know, in states that are moving, some would say too fast, one of the issues that small business is confronting is that the public is not confident that its safe to re-engage. And so theyve lifted the protections for small business while youre in a crisis. And yet, the publics not coming out to patronize. And that could be even worse for small business. So what we want to do is get it right. And that means working with the business community and public health. And turning up the dial together so we dont have to turn it back.\n\nmichael barbaro\n\nWell, lets talk about how it is that you get it right when it comes to reopening and how youre thinking about that. I mean, is there a data set youre looking at? Is there a set of measurements youre monitoring? And Im curious  and Im sure lots of people Michigan are, too  whats the thing or things that trigger the reopening?\n\ngretchen whitmer\n\nSo weve started to reengage. We are looking, of course, at rolling averages on hospitalizations. We are looking at our ability to ramp up testing. We need to build out when it comes to tracing, so that if someone does test positive for Covid-19, that were able to trace all their contacts and keep it from spreading. I would also add that we in Michigan are assessing different sectors of our economy for risk, asking questions like, is the work done in a region of our state thats been devastated by Covid-19, or a region that has been untouched by Covid-19?\n\nmichael barbaro\n\nRight.\n\ngretchen whitmer\n\nDoes the type of work require that multiple people use the same instruments or machinery? Is the work done indoors or outdoors? That makes a difference.\n\nmichael barbaro\n\nMm-hm. Right, one of the examples that I think Phil gave was around this idea of, is there a work that can be done  that just feels fundamentally safer by nature  that those might come back soon?\n\ngretchen whitmer\n\nSo you use the word feels. Feels safer.\n\nmichael barbaro\n\n[LAUGHS]\n\ngretchen whitmer\n\nAnd I think thats interesting, because what I want to make sure we do is go with data, and make sure that as we are reengaging, were continually measuring. I know Phil doesnt want to be back in a stay home order in August and neither do I.\n\nmichael barbaro\n\nMm-hm.\n\ngretchen whitmer\n\nAnd so I want to get this right for him, for his employees  lawnscaping, lawn care, that is already permitted. That was in our first wave that I announced on Friday. In this next one, we could have construction  that is often in big spaces outdoors with P.P.E. and the protocols necessary. That could be a lower risk one that we can mitigate the risk further through protocols around face masks, or separators between workers who cant be six feet apart but can have plexiglass separators, for instance. And so all of these are pieces to starting to turn the dial up and what it looks like in waves.\n\nmichael barbaro\n\nYou know, we started by talking to you about the fact that when you first ran for governor, it was as somebody literally talking about fixing the roads and fixing infrastructure in Michigan. And through these actions that youve taken in response to the pandemic, you have become a national figure, a national Democratic figure, right? Youre, whether you wanted to or not, sparring with the president. And whether its fairly or unfairly, youre now seen through a partisan lens, as a partisan figure. Are you comfortable now in that role?\n\ngretchen whitmer\n\nNo! [LAUGHS] Im not. I mean, you know, I was thrown into the national spotlight being criticized or attacked by the President of the United States. I didnt ask for that. I did not like it. I didnt sleep \n\nmichael barbaro\n\nReally?\n\ngretchen whitmer\n\n frankly, because I was worried that this would preclude my ability to get the help that I need for Michigan.\n\nmichael barbaro\n\nHm. You fear that you might actually suffer some kind of retribution that might make it harder to get through this pandemic?\n\ngretchen whitmer\n\nYeah. And I think that that was a legitimate fear with some of the statements that have been made.\n\nmichael barbaro\n\nBy the president?\n\ngretchen whitmer\n\nYeah. That if youre not nice, you might not get the help you need. And so Ive bent over backwards to try to smooth that over, not throwing a punch back. I would hate for anyone in Michigan to not have the help they need because Im not popular with the president for some reason.\n\nmichael barbaro\n\nDo you worry that with the divided state of this country, some of your constituents will come away from this pandemic seeing your actions as partisan no matter what happens and no matter what your intentions?\n\ngretchen whitmer\n\nI think thats the unfortunate reality that we live with. I do think, though, that when we have gotten through this when we look back on it, that were going to be comfortable in the fact that the decisions that were made save lives.\n\nmichael barbaro\n\nMm-hm.\n\ngretchen whitmer\n\nThe hard thing about public health is when you do it well, you never know how many lives would have been lost otherwise.\n\nmichael barbaro\n\nMm-hm.\n\ngretchen whitmer\n\nBut we can see it when you look at the curves where we were headed, and where we are today, that theres no question lives were saved. Theres no question that these actions made a difference. And thats what centered everything that weve done.\n\nmichael barbaro\n\nHm.\n\ngretchen whitmer\n\nNot the partisan stuff, not the fear of that, but the determination to do everything in our power to save lives and to keep our health care system working so that its there when we all need it.\n\nmichael barbaro\n\nWell, Governor Whitmer, I want to thank you very much for your time. And I hope youre getting a little more sleep now.\n\ngretchen whitmer\n\n[LAUGHS] No, but Ill sleep sometime. Thank you.\n\nmichael barbaro\n\nThank you. We appreciate it. Well be right back. Heres what else you need to know today. On Tuesday, the number of confirmed cases of the coronavirus in the United States reached 1 million, meaning that roughly one in every 330 Americans has tested positive for the virus. But The Times reports that the actual number of infections is even higher since thousands of Americans have never been tested because of a shortage of testing supplies. And \n\narchived recording (nancy pelosi) We had intended to come back next week. It has been previously scheduled. But once the Capitol physician told us that it was not a proper for us to do that in the interest of not only members and staff, but the custodians, the people who maintain the Capitol, the press who cover us, the staff of the actual legislative chamber, there was no choice for us but to say we will put this off.\n\nmichael barbaro\n\nThe House of Representatives has canceled plans to call lawmakers back into session after members complained that returning to Washington would pose an unnecessary health risk and set a bad example for the country.

trusted	b'Wartime President? Trump Rewrites History in an Election Year'	true	[]		trusted	[]	https://www.nytimes.com/2020/03/22/us/politics/coronavirus-trump-wartime-president.html	https://www.nytimes.com/	b'michael barbaro\n\nFrom The New York Times, Im Michael Barbaro. This is The Daily.\n\n[music]\n\nLast week, President Trump sounded newly serious about combating the coronavirus, calling himself a quote, wartime president. Maggie Haberman on why days later, and with the situation only worsening, the president is abandoning that message. Its Wednesday, March 25.\n\nmaggie haberman\n\nHello, guys.\n\nmichael barbaro\n\nHi.\n\nmaggie haberman\n\nHi.\n\nmichael barbaro\n\nMaggie, it is Tuesday afternoon. Can you tell us about what just happened on the Fox News Channel?\n\narchived recording (bill hemmer) Over the next two hours, the president, the vice president, and the officials tasked with leading our nations response on the virus pandemic will join us to answer your questions all across America.\n\nmichael barbaro\n\nWe just saw Vice President Mike Pence and President Trump sit for two hours at a town hall meeting  virtual town hall meeting  with Fox News from the White House, where they took questions by remote.\n\narchived recording I think a lot of us right now are just wondering, what is the potential for a national stay-at-home order? Is this something that America could be seeing in our near future?\n\nmaggie haberman\n\nPence answered a bunch of questions first.\n\narchived recording (mike pence) Carly, I can tell you that at no point has the White House coronavirus task force discussed what some people call a nationwide lockdown.\n\nmaggie haberman\n\nThen, President Trump came on for the second hour.\n\narchived recording (donald trump) Our people are full of vim and vigor and energy. They dont want to be locked into a house or an apartment or some space. Its not for our country. Were not  were not built that way.\n\nmaggie haberman\n\nAnd his message was even louder of a message that hes been delivering for the last day or so, which is that while we have to take the coronavirus seriously \n\narchived recording (donald trump) You know, I dont want the cure to be worse than the problem itself.\n\nmaggie haberman\n\n in his words, the cure cant be worse than the disease.\n\narchived recording (donald trump)  the problem being, obviously, the problem. And you know, you can destroy a country this way by closing it down.\n\nmaggie haberman\n\nAnd by that, he means that the hits to the economy are becoming unsustainable. That it cant go on forever.\n\narchived recording (donald trump) Youre going to lose people. Youre going to have suicides by the thousands. Youre going to have all sorts of things happen. Youre going to have instability. You cant just come in and say, lets close up the United States of America, the biggest, the most successful country in the world by far.\n\nmaggie haberman\n\nAnd then he broke some news.\n\narchived recording (donald trump) Id love to have it open by Easter. OK? I would love to have it open by Easter. archived recording Oh wow, OK.\n\nmaggie haberman\n\nAnd that news was that he believes that by April 12, which is Easter, that that could be when the country and its economy are reopened.\n\narchived recording (donald trump) Its such an important day for other reasons, but Ill make it an important day for this, too. I would love to have the country opened up and just raring to go by Easter.\n\nmichael barbaro\n\nMaggie, this seems very much at odds with the messaging coming from more local leaders and health officials in the areas of the U.S. that have been most directly hit by this pandemic so far. Im thinking, for example, of the governor of New York, Andrew Cuomo, who was warning New York residents \n\narchived recording (andrew cuomo) Look, this can go on for several months, OK?\n\nmichael barbaro\n\n that they should be preparing for four, six \n\narchived recording (andrew cuomo)  eight months, nine months.\n\nmichael barbaro\n\nNine months of life under isolation and shutdown to fight the coronavirus.\n\nmaggie haberman\n\nMichael, about half an hour or so before Mike Pence started this town hall \n\narchived recording (andrew cuomo) You have 20,000 ventilators in the stockpile. Release the ventilators to New York.\n\nmaggie haberman\n\n Andrew Cuomo was pleading with the federal government to send more resources, especially ventilators, because the number of cases that are severe in New York is growing and keeps getting bigger and bigger. And it is outpacing the number of materials that they have for doctors to treat them.\n\narchived recording (andrew cuomo) I need the ventilators in 14 days. Only the federal government has that power.\n\nmaggie haberman\n\nYou have health officials in New York, health officials in California, health officials in President Trumps own government saying we are not just a mere two or three weeks away from things going back to normal. And theyre basing that not just on idle projections, but watching what those curves have looked like in terms of the spread of the virus.\n\nmichael barbaro\n\nAlso, Maggie, help us understand how we got here and why this is the message from the president at this critical moment  when how we respond, what measures we take, and how long we take those measures really matters. And so I wonder where you think that starts. Where do we begin to understand that?\n\nmaggie haberman\n\nMichael, you need to go back to January 22 when the president was in Davos for the World Economic Forum.\n\narchived recording (joe kernen) Its great to see you. Thank you for joining us again in Davos. Weve done this before. archived recording (donald trump) Thats right.\n\nmaggie haberman\n\nAnd he did an interview with CNBC. And at that point, the virus was already in the U.S.\n\narchived recording (joe kernen) The C.D.C. has identified a case of coronavirus in Washington state.\n\nmaggie haberman\n\nAnd he was asked by the interviewer if he was concerned that this could become a pandemic.\n\narchived recording (joe kernen) Have you been briefed by the C.D.C.? archived recording (donald trump) I have. archived recording (joe kernen) Are there worries about a pandemic at this point? archived recording (donald trump) No, were not at all.\n\nmaggie haberman\n\nAnd the presidents response was, no, not at all.\n\narchived recording (donald trump) Its one person coming in from China, and we have it under control. Its going to be just fine. archived recording (joe kernen) OK.\n\nmaggie haberman\n\nHe didnt want to talk about it publicly at the time.\n\nmichael barbaro\n\nAnd why do you think that was?\n\nmaggie haberman\n\nWell, according to a number of people who were in contact with him, it was because he didnt want to rattle the financial markets. That he was hoping that it was going to stay under control, and the stock markets are his political weathervane, and he thinks they need to stay up in order for him to win re-election. And he didnt want to do anything to disturb that. And he didnt want to create a panic.\n\nmichael barbaro\n\nOK. So what happened next?\n\nmaggie haberman\n\nSo after that, a couple of days later, as there were more cases and it was clear that it was spreading out of China  where it originated  the president took this move that he was widely criticized for by Democrats and even some Republicans at the time. Which was he halted a number of flights from China into the U.S.\n\narchived recording (sean hannity) Disneys closed. archived recording (donald trump) Yeah. archived recording (sean hannity) Movie theaters are closed. Hospitals being built. I think were now up to our eighth case in the United States. How concerned are you? archived recording (donald trump) Well, we pretty much shut it down coming in from China.\n\nmaggie haberman\n\nThe idea was to halt the spread of the disease, keep transmissions to a minimum. He was accused of xenophobia. He was accused of making a racist move. At the end of the day, it was probably effective, because it did actually take a pretty aggressive measure against the spread of the virus. The problem is, it was one of the last things that he did for several weeks.\n\nmichael barbaro\n\nHmm. So the right decision in retrospect, but not accompanied by similar actions that might have contained transmission.\n\nmaggie haberman\n\nThats exactly right. In the same way that George W. Bush was criticized for his Mission Accomplished banner about Iraq, the president treated that moment as if it was his mission accomplished moment. He did not do anything after that in terms of alerting the public, or telling people to be safe, or telling people to take precautions. And it basically squandered several weeks within the U.S.\n\nmichael barbaro\n\nRight. Looking back at the timeline, we can now see that on the same day that the president stopped those flights from China, the coronavirus was already being reported by the W.H.O. in Japan and South Korea, and those countries are still sending their citizens to the United States on flights that have not been stopped. So the horse is out of the barn.\n\nmaggie haberman\n\nExactly. It was not anything close to a whole-of-government approach. And at that point, there was a task force that was formed, and it was being led by the health and human services secretary, Alex Azar. But it was outside of the White House, and it was rife with all kinds of turf battles. And the president, meanwhile, was still trying not to talk about it.\n\nmichael barbaro\n\nAnd succeeding in that, for the most part.\n\nmaggie haberman\n\nAnd succeeding in that, for the most part. It was not something that came up in interviews that he did, which were mostly with friendly interviewers who werent going to ask him things that he didnt want to talk about. And look, its not as if it wasnt getting news coverage. The New York Times had it on the front page almost every day from the end of January. It was very clear that this was a global crisis, but it was not being treated as an American crisis. And I think a lot of that is because the president just was not talking about it.\n\nmichael barbaro\n\nAnd do we know what information the president is receiving during this time? Is he getting a bunch of briefings  one would think he would be  that are conveying the seriousness of the approaching situation?\n\nmaggie haberman\n\nTheres conflicting information, Michael, about exactly how specific and how alarmed the briefing materials the president was receiving were at this time. We understand that a lot of folks in the National Security Council were taking it very seriously, and that information had been passed to him. We understand that Alex Azar, the health and human services secretary, took it very seriously, but its not clear that he was sharing all of that with the president or that he was being allowed to tell it to the president. There were some people in the White House who viewed Alex Azar in particular as quote-unquote alarmist  thought that he was overstating the threat. And when the president doesnt want to take something particularly seriously, hell often poll test advisers until he finds the one who agrees with him that he shouldnt take it seriously. And I have every reason to believe that he was looking for people to affirm his sense that this didnt really need to be addressed. And one of the places that he would go to hear his own thoughts affirmed or for solace was Fox News.\n\narchived recording (jeanine pirro) If youve ever had a question whether the mainstream media distorts, whips up, throw things out of focus or has an agenda, especially when it comes to the Trump administration, look no further than coronavirus.\n\nmaggie haberman\n\nThey were very much echoing what he believed and wanted to believe, which was that the criticisms about inactivity that he wasnt doing enough was all part of an effort to harm him.\n\narchived recording (trish regan) This is yet another attempt to impeach the president. And sadly, it seems they care very little for any of the destruction they are leaving in their wake  losses in the stock market. All this, unfortunately, just part of the political casualties for them.\n\n[music]\n\nmaggie haberman\n\nAt this point, the president is in India being fitted by Prime Minister Modi, and public health officials start basically taking matters into their own hands. They start giving public warnings. One top health expert gave a press briefing where she said that \n\narchived recording (dr. nancy messonnier) Now, its not so much a question of if this will happen anymore, but rather more a question of exactly when this will happen.\n\nmaggie haberman\n\nIt was no longer a question of if the virus would spread in the United States, but when.\n\narchived recording (dr. nancy messonnier) And how many people in this country will become infected, and how many of those will develop severe or more complicated disease.\n\nmaggie haberman\n\nAnd that hospitals and businesses and schools should start making preparations accordingly.\n\nmichael barbaro\n\nRight.\n\nmaggie haberman\n\nThis was as the president was now on his way back from India, and the stock market reacted terribly to these warnings. And the president was furious. He called the health and human services secretary, saying that the remarks had rattled people. He called one of his top economic advisers, Larry Kudlow, wondering what could be done to stop the slide. But at this point, as angry as the president was, it was clear to him and to his advisers that this was no longer something he could ignore.\n\n[music]\n\nmichael barbaro\n\nWell be right back. So Maggie, what happens once the president recognizes that this is something that has to be addressed?\n\nmaggie haberman\n\nThe president put Vice President Mike Pence in charge of the task force.\n\narchived recording (mike pence) Good afternoon. We just completed todays lengthy meeting of the White House coronavirus task force.\n\nmaggie haberman\n\nAnd that was a big moment, because this task force that had been kind of diffuse and fighting with itself was for the first time being run from the White House. And it was meant to signal that the president was taking this seriously. So Mike Pence had control of this thing for basically two weeks. And during that time \n\narchived recording (mike pence) Were continuing to lean into this effort in full partnership with state and local health authorities around the country \n\nmaggie haberman\n\n he was trying to communicate that they were working on a plan \n\narchived recording (mike pence)  to ensure that we do everything to prevent the spread of the disease.\n\nmaggie haberman\n\nTo address the spread, that they were working on guidelines, that they were aware of problems with testing for this virus that have plagued this administration for weeks.\n\narchived recording (mike pence) To mitigate its expansion and to provide necessary treatment to Americans that have been impacted.\n\nmaggie haberman\n\nAnd after two weeks, Vice President Mike Pence was getting a lot of praise for his demeanor in these briefings.\n\narchived recording (mike pence) If I may, well be back here every day. Get used to seeing us. Were going to bring the experts in. Were going to make sure and give you the best and most high quality, real time information from the best people in the world. So thank you all for being here. archived recording Thank you. Youre welcome back any time.\n\nmaggie haberman\n\nAnd that became a point of concern for some of President Trumps own advisers, who didnt want to see Mike Pence get all of the attention.\n\nmichael barbaro\n\nHuh. So the people around the president didnt want the vice resident, rather than the president, to be the one seen as quarterbacking this major national crisis?\n\nmaggie haberman\n\nThats right. There was concern among the presidents top advisers that it would look as if Vice President Pence was basically doing the job the president should be doing  calming a nation, giving out accurate information, sounding as if hes in charge. And that led to this idea that the president should give an Oval Office address. So on March 11, the same day the W.H.O. declared the coronavirus a global pandemic, President Trump sat in the Oval Office behind the Resolute Desk at 9 p.m., and the klieg lights came on and the teleprompter started rolling. And he gave an address to the nation.\n\narchived recording (donald trump) My fellow Americans, tonight I want to speak with you about our nations unprecedented response to the coronavirus outbreak that started in China and is now spreading throughout the world.\n\nmaggie haberman\n\nFor the first time, he acknowledged that this could impact older people.\n\narchived recording (donald trump) The highest risk is for elderly population with underlying health conditions. The elderly population must be very, very careful.\n\nmaggie haberman\n\nHe talked about a ban on most travel from Europe.\n\narchived recording (donald trump) To keep new cases from entering our shores, we will be suspending all travel from Europe to the United States for the next 30 days. The new rules will go into effect Friday at midnight.\n\nmaggie haberman\n\nBut the address, which was brief, as Oval Office addresses usually are, was seen as a disaster.\n\nmichael barbaro\n\nWhy?\n\nmaggie haberman\n\nThe President looked uncomfortable. He stumbled over the teleprompter, which he never does well with.\n\narchived recording (donald trump) I am confident that by counting and continuing to take these tough measures, we will \n\nmaggie haberman\n\nAnd it was riddled with errors, including about the travel ban.\n\narchived recording (donald trump)  and these prohibitions will not only apply to the tremendous amount of trade in cargo, but various other things as we get approval.\n\nmaggie haberman\n\nHe suggested that it would apply to cargo and trade. It didnt, and those mistakes sent the stock markets plummeting.\n\nmichael barbaro\n\nRight. And my assumption was that the President hoped the speech would do the exact opposite, which is it would give confidence to the stock market and send it back up.\n\nmaggie haberman\n\nThats right. The markets continued to tank over the next couple of days. And aides started realizing that there had to be a major course correction or the presidency could be threatened. And the President realized this too. So on March 17 \n\narchived recording (donald trump) I would like to begin by announcing some important developments in our war against the Chinese virus.\n\nmaggie haberman\n\n we saw a pretty different tone from President Trump as he talked about this virus.\n\narchived recording (donald trump) Well be invoking the Defense Production Act just in case we need it. Last week, I signed an emergency declaration under the Stafford Act.\n\nmaggie haberman\n\nHe described it soberly. He suddenly seemed willing to answer questions without being combative.\n\narchived recording (journalist) Do you consider America to be on a wartime footing in terms of fighting this virus? archived recording (donald trump) I do. I actually do. Im looking at it that way, because you know \n\nmaggie haberman\n\nHe described himself as a wartime president. He seemed to be taking this seriously in all of the ways that a nation usually looks for a leader to take such a crisis seriously.\n\narchived recording (donald trump) Its a very tough situation, here. You have to do things. You have to close parts of an economy that six weeks ago were the best theyve ever been. We had the best economy weve ever had. And then one day you have to close it down in order to defeat this enemy. But were doing it, and were doing it well. And Id say the American people have been incredible.\n\nmaggie haberman\n\nThis was dramatically different from what we had heard just a few days earlier.\n\nmichael barbaro\n\nWell, so, Maggie, how then do we get to today, where one week later, the situation with this pandemic has only gotten dramatically worse? The virus is exploding in places like New York. The number of infections and deaths are rising across the country. And yet, the presidents message has now kind of reverted back to where it was weeks and weeks ago. His language has changed. His overall comportment and the words hes using  theyve all kind of returned to a period where he was not taking this as seriously.\n\nmaggie haberman\n\nThere have been people in the Presidents circle who, this entire time, even as the President changed his tone, still thought that some of the moves that the government was making were too aggressive. And those aides started, late last week, talking about the fact that they might want to revisit some of these guidelines and ease up on some of them for targeted groups after this initial 15-day period had ended, which is going to be March 30th. The president started getting the message in earnest on Sunday night that this is something that he needed to worry about. That there might not be an economy to return to once the country was fully back to normal. And so he tweeted on Sunday night that the cure couldnt be worse than the disease. And that was the beginning of a massive shift of the federal government, which had moved toward aggressive measures to mitigate this virus and its spread, to suddenly suggesting that they could see the end nearing.\n\n[music]\n\narchived recording (donald trump) We cant lose a Boeing. And we cant lose some of these companies. And companies  frankly, Bill  that were solid as, like, AAA companies. Because of whats happened over the last couple of weeks, they go from AAA to being, like, they could use a hand. archived recording Tough time. archived recording (donald trump) We cant  youre right. We cant lose those companies. If we lose those companies, were talking about hundreds of thousands of jobs, millions of jobs. The faster we go back, the better its going to be. We have a pent-up energy thats going to be unbelievable.\n\nmichael barbaro\n\nIs there a meaningful contingency of conservative leaders, thinkers, and politicians, economists even, people in business who feel this way, who feel like theres been an overreaction to this virus in the form of shutting down the American economy?\n\nmaggie haberman\n\nThere are. Some of them are people who have been the presidents advisers on and off for a while, like Stephen Moore of FreedomWorks, whos an economist and who advised the president at various points. He wrote an op-ed for The Wall Street Journal with Art Laffer, who the president gave the Medal of Freedom to not that long ago. And in that op-ed, they said, essentially, that the government cant sustain this. That the economy cant sustain this. And that there needs to be less draconian moves made to keep people safe but still allow the country to run.\n\nmichael barbaro\n\nMm-hmm.\n\nmaggie haberman\n\nThere is no public health expert in the government telling the president that these moves are too severe. There is no public health expert in the government telling the president that the curve is about to let up on the spread of the virus. Everything the president has done about this virus has been a reaction to something, and right now he is reacting to pressure to reopen portions of the economy, as the job losses are facing potential millions by April.\n\nmichael barbaro\n\nYou know, I dont know whether the President would frame it this way, but I wonder if hes forcing all of us to reckon with what is the ultimate moral dilemma of this pandemic, which is what economic and social cost were willing to pay to save some uncertain number of lives. And he seems to be saying, in effect, Im willing to take the risk that a certain number of Americans will get sick and will die for the greater economic good and health of the United States.\n\narchived recording (donald trump) I mean, think of it. We average 36,000 people  death, death. Im not talking about cases, Im talking about death. 36,000 deaths a year. People die, 36  from the flu. But weve never closed down the country for the flu. So you say to yourself, what is this all about? Now  archived recording How did you  archived recording (donald trump) Its never been done. archived recording How did you process that? archived recording (donald trump) Not good. I wasnt happy about it.\n\nmaggie haberman\n\nMichael, I think thats very much what hes saying. And in fairness to him, Governor Cuomo has openly voiced the same moral dilemma that he is wrestling with. Its just that Governor Cuomo came down on the other side of it, which was that there is no cost that can be put on human life.\n\narchived recording (andrew cuomo) Yeah, my mother is not expendable. And your mother is not expendable. And our brothers and sisters theyre not expendable. And were not going to accept a premise that human life is disposable. And were not going to put a dollar figure on human life. The first order of business is save lives, period. Whatever it costs.\n\nmaggie haberman\n\nNew York has been, as we know, much harder hit than most of the rest of the country. Most of the rest of the country has not had to go through what New York is going through right now with surges in hospital stays and a number of sick people. The president says most of the country agrees with him, and maybe thats why.\n\n[music]\n\nBut the president is taking a really large gamble, and going with his gut, that the greater good will be served for the rest of the country by trying to preserve the economic health of the country more quickly than his health experts would like him to.\n\nmichael barbaro\n\nMaggie, thank you very much.\n\nmaggie haberman\n\nMichael, thank you.\n\nmichael barbaro\n\nOn Tuesday night, Dr. Anthony Fauci, an infectious disease specialist and an influential member of the presidents coronavirus task force, was asked about the presidents plan to reopen the U.S. economy by Easter.\n\narchived recording (journalist) Where are you now with this timeline of 19 days from now? archived recording (dr. anthony fauci) So thats really very flexible. We just had a conversation with the president in the Oval Office talking about, you know, you can look at a date, but youve got to be very flexible. On a literally day-by-day and week-by-week basis, you need to evaluate the feasibility of what youre trying to do.\n\nmichael barbaro\n\nWith the president standing beside him, Fauci said it would be foolhardy to ease restrictions if major parts of the country were still in the throes of the pandemic.\n\narchived recording (dr. anthony fauci) Obviously, no one is going to want to tone down things when you see whats going on in a place like New York City. I mean, thats just, you know, good public health practice and common sense.\n\n[music]\n\nmichael barbaro\n\nWell be right back. Heres what else you need to know today.\n\narchived recording (narendra modi) [SPEAKING HINDI]\n\nmichael barbaro\n\nNationwide lockdowns over the virus continued on Tuesday with India becoming the latest and largest country to require citizens to remain indoors, in Indias case, for the next 21 days.\n\narchived recording (narendra modi) [SPEAKING HINDI]\n\nmichael barbaro\n\nIn a televised speech, Prime Minister Narendra Modi told Indians, quote, If you cant handle these 21 days, this country will go back 21 years. And in the United States, Senate leaders said they were nearing a deal on a historic $2 trillion stimulus bill after days of objections from Democrats over who would monitor billions of dollars in loans to American businesses.\n\narchived recording (chuck schumer) Weve been fighting very hard that any bailout fund  money to industries that have trouble  have real oversight and transparency. Thats vitally important.\n\nmichael barbaro\n\nOn Tuesday, Democrats said they had persuaded Republicans and the Trump administration to allow an independent inspector and a congressional oversight board to scrutinize the loans, and were almost ready to support the bill.\n\narchived recording (chuck schumer) I hope, I pray, that we can come together very quickly and pass in large numbers a bipartisan bill that will help the American people who so badly, badly, badly need our help.\n\n[music]\n\nmichael barbaro'	b'Wartime President?

Here Are 6 Key Factors'	true	[]		trusted	[]	https://www.nytimes.com/interactive/2020/world/asia/china-coronavirus-contain.html	https://www.nytimes.com/	"b""A few drugs are being tested in clinical trials, but a vaccine is still at least a year away.\n\nWhile the virus is a serious public health concern, you are very unlikely to get infected outside of areas where it is spreading widely, including China, Italy, Iran and South Korea. To avoid any viral illness, experts advise washing your hands frequently and avoiding your office or school when youre sick. Most healthy people dont need masks, and hoarding them may contribute to shortages for health workers who do need them, experts say.\n\nHow contagious is the virus?\n\nIt seems to spread very easily, making containment efforts difficult.\n\nThe scale of an outbreak depends on how quickly and easily a virus is transmitted from person to person.\n\nThe new coronavirus seems to spread very easily, especially in homes, hospitals, churches, cruise ships and other confined spaces. It is much more contagious than SARS, another coronavirus that circulated in China in 2003 and sickened about 8,000 people.\n\nThe pathogen can travel through the air, enveloped in tiny respiratory droplets that are produced when a sick person breathes, talks, coughs or sneezes.\n\nThese droplets fall to the ground within a few feet. That makes the virus harder to get than pathogens like measles, chickenpox and tuberculosis, which can travel 100 feet through the air. But it is easier to catch than H.I.V. or hepatitis, which spread only through direct contact with the bodily fluids of an infected person.\n\nHow far viruses travel Coronaviruses can travel only about six feet from the infected person. Its unknown how long they live on surfaces. Some other viruses, like measles, can travel up to 100 feet and stay alive on surfaces for hours. Coronaviruses can travel only about six feet from the infected person. Its unknown how long they live on surfaces. Some other viruses, like measles, can travel up to 100 feet and stay alive on surfaces for hours. Coronaviruses can travel only about six feet from the infected person. Its unknown how long they live on surfaces. Some other viruses, like measles, can travel up to 100 feet and stay alive on surfaces for hours. Coronaviruses can travel only about six feet from the infected person. Its unknown how long they live on surfaces. Some other viruses, like measles, can travel up to 100 feet and stay alive on surfaces for hours.\n\nResearch is still in its early stages, but some estimates suggest that each person with the new coronavirus could infect between two and four people without effective containment measures. That is enough to sustain and accelate an outbreak, if nothing is done to reduce it.\n\nHeres how that works. In the animation below, a group of five infected people could spread the virus to about 368 people over just five cycles of infection.\n\nIf 5 people with new coronavirus each infected 2.6 others ... ... there could be 5 sick after 1 generation .\n\nCompare that with a less contagious virus, like the seasonal flu, which can be slowed by vaccines and immunity from past epidemics. People with the flu tend to infect 1.3 other individuals, on average. The difference may seem small, but the result is a striking contrast: Only about 45 people might be infected in the same scenario.\n\nIf 5 people with seasonal flu each infected 1.3 others ... ... there could be 5 sick after 1 generation .\n\nThe transmission numbers of any disease arent set in stone. They can change depending on how much people interact at school, work or religious gatherings. When global health authorities methodically tracked and isolated people infected with SARS in 2003, they were able to bring the average number each sick person infected down to 0.4, enough to stop the outbreak.\n\nHealth authorities around the world are expending enormous effort trying to repeat that. But the number of people infected globally is rising quickly, with large clusters of cases in Italy, Iran, Japan and South Korea.\n\nThe viruss high rate of transmission means containment measures  such as wearing masks, keeping a distance from infected people and implementing quarantines if people are exposed  must block more than 60 percent of transmissions in order to effectively control the outbreak, which is difficult.\n\nCoronavirus cases have far surpassed the rate of new SARS cases in 2003:\n\n75,000 reported cases Numbers rose drastically after China changed its diagnostic criteria. 50,000 Covid-19 25,000 SARS 0 Day 20 40 60 80 100 120 140 The first day that W.H.O. received reports of the outbreaks Covid-19 75,000 reported cases Numbers rose drastically after China changed its diagnostic criteria. 50,000 25,000 SARS 0 Day 20 40 60 80 100 120 140 The first day that W.H.O. received reports of the outbreaks Notes: The official World Health Organization case count for SARS was delayed at the beginning of the outbreak. Some cases were suspected but not confirmed; SARS is a diagnosis of exclusion, so previously reported cases may have been discarded after further investigation. New coronavirus data as of Feb. 27.\n\nHow deadly is the virus?\n\nIts hard to know yet. But the fatality rate may be more than 1 percent, much higher than the seasonal flu.\n\nThis is one of the most important factors in how damaging the outbreak will be, and one of the least understood.\n\nIts tough to assess the lethality of a new virus. The worst cases are usually detected first, which can skew our understanding of how likely patients are to die. People with mild illness may never visit a doctor, and there may be more cases than China is counting, leading to a lower death rate than initially thought.\n\nIts easier to miss mild cases that resolve by themselves than it is to miss dead people, said Dr. Angela Rasmussen, a virologist at Columbia Universitys Mailman School of Public Health.\n\nBut early research indicates the virus may be significantly more deadly than the seasonal flu, which kills roughly one in 1,000 people. An analysis of outcomes for more than 44,000 confirmed patients in China found that roughly one in 50 died. Eighty-one percent of patients infected with the new coronavirus had mild illness, 14 percent had severe illness and 5 percent had critical illness, according to the study.\n\nThe pathogen is considerably less dangerous than other coronaviruses, such as MERS, which kills about a third of people who become infected, and SARS, which kills about 1 in 10. All of the diseases appear to latch on to proteins on the surface of lung cells, but MERS and SARS seem to be more destructive to lung tissue.\n\nHeres how the new coronavirus compares with other infectious diseases:\n\nFatality rate (log scale) 100% Bird flu Ebola 50 Smallpox More deadly MERS 20 SARS 10 5 Spanish flu New coronavirus Most estimates put the fatality rate below 3%, and the number of transmissions between 2 and 4. 2 Spreads faster 1 Measles Seasonal flu 0.1 Polio Common cold 2009 flu Chickenpox 0 1 5 10 15 Average number of people infected by each sick person Fatality rate (log scale) 100% Bird flu Ebola 50 Smallpox MERS More deadly 20 SARS 10 5 Spanish flu 2 New coronavirus Most estimates put the fatality rate below 3%, and the number of transmissions between 2 and 4. Spreads faster 1 Seasonal flu Measles 0.1 Polio 2009 flu Common cold Chickenpox 0 1 5 10 15 Average number of people infected by each sick person Fatality rate (log scale) 100% Bird flu 50 Ebola More deadly Smallpox MERS 20 SARS Spreads faster 10 5 Spanish flu 2 New coronavirus Most estimates put the fatality rate below 3%, and the number of transmissions between 2 and 4. 1 Measles 0.1 Seasonal flu Polio Common cold Chickenpox 0 1 5 10 15 Avg. number of people infected by each sick person Note: Average case-fatality rates and transmission numbers are shown. Estimates of case-fatality rates can vary, and numbers for the new coronavirus are preliminary estimates.\n\nThe chart above uses a logarithmic vertical scale: data near the top is compressed into a smaller space to make the variation between less-deadly diseases easier to see. Diseases near the top of the chart are much deadlier than those in the middle.\n\nOlder people are much more likely to face serious illness than younger people, the analysis of Chinese patients found. In that study, nearly 15 percent of infected people over 80 died, along with 8 percent of people in their 70s. Very few young children seem to be falling ill, a pattern seen with some other respiratory viruses.\n\nThose numbers could be reduced as more cases are discovered. And it is possible that death rates at the center of the outbreak in China, where hospitals were overwhelmed, will end up higher than elsewhere in the world.\n\nPathogens can still be very dangerous even if their fatality rate is low. Even though influenza has a case fatality rate below one per 1,000, roughly 200,000 people end up hospitalized with the virus each year in the United States, and about 35,000 people die.\n\nHow long does it take to show symptoms?\n\nTypically between five and seven days, allowing the illness to go undetected.\n\nThe time it takes for symptoms to appear after a person is infected can be vital for prevention and control. Known as the incubation period, this time can allow health officials to quarantine or observe people who may have been exposed to the virus. But if the incubation period is too long or too short, these measures may be difficult to implement.\n\nSome illnesses, like influenza, have a short incubation period of two or three days. People may be shedding infectious virus particles before they exhibit flu symptoms, making it almost impossible to identify and isolate people who have the virus. SARS had an incubation period of about five days, and it took four or five days after symptoms started before sick people could transmit the virus. That gave officials time to stop the virus and effectively contain the outbreak.\n\nOfficials at the Centers for Disease Control and Prevention estimate that the new coronavirus has an incubation period of two to 14 days. When symptoms do start to appear, they can include fever, cough and difficulty breathing or shortness of breath.\n\nBut mild cases may simply resemble the flu or a bad cold, and people may be able to pass on the new coronavirus even before they develop obvious symptoms.\n\nThat concerns me because it means the infection could elude detection, said Dr. Mark Denison, an infectious disease expert at Vanderbilt University in Nashville, Tenn.\n\nHow much have infected people traveled?\n\nEnough to spread the outbreak all over the world.\n\nWuhan was a difficult place to contain an outbreak. It has 11 million people, more than New York City. On an average day, 3,500 passengers take direct flights from Wuhan to cities in other countries. These cities were among the first to report cases of the virus outside China.\n\nPassengers flying from Wuhan to other countries October to November 2019 Russia United Kingdom Italy France United States 8,000 Japan 23,000 passengers CHINA Turkey Wuhan South Korea Taiwan U.A.E.

Destinations with fewer than 1,000 passengers are not shown.\n\nChina was not nearly as well connected in 2003 during the SARS outbreak. Large numbers of migrant workers now travel domestically and internationally  to Africa, other parts of Asia and Latin America, where China is making an enormous infrastructure push with its Belt and Road Initiative. This travel creates a high risk for outbreaks in countries with health systems that are not equipped to handle them, like Zimbabwe, which is facing a worsening hunger and economic crisis.\n\nOver all, China has about four times as many train and air passengers as it did during the SARS outbreak:\n\n4 billion travelers Passenger traffic has quadrupled, opening more routes for infection. 3 When SARS broke out, there were about 1 billion travelers. 2 Train passengers 1 Air passengers 1990 00 10 2019 Passenger traffic has quadrupled, opening more routes for infection. 4 billion travelers 3 When SARS broke out, there were about 1 billion travelers. 2 Train passengers 1 Air passengers 1990 00 10 2019 Note: Air travel data includes passengers only on Chinese airlines.\n\nIn January, China took the unprecedented step of imposing travel restrictions on tens of millions of people living in Wuhan and nearby cities. Some experts questioned the effectiveness of the lockdown, and Wuhans mayor acknowledged that five million people had left the city before the restrictions began, in the run-up to the Lunar New Year.\n\nYou cant board up a germ. A novel infection will spread, said Lawrence O. Gostin, a law professor at Georgetown University and director of the World Health Organization Collaborating Center on National and Global Health Law. It will get out; it always does.\n\nSeveral countries, including Italy, Iran and South Korea, are already discovering clusters of cases with no clear ties to the outbreak's epicenter in China. On Feb. 26, the C.D.C. also reported what it called possibly the first case of community spread in the United States.\n\nHow effective will the response be?\n\nChina has slowed new cases for now, but the spread around the world is accelerating.\n\nWorld Health Organization officials have praised Chinas aggressive response to the virus  walling off cities, forcing people to stay home and tracking large numbers of contacts of infected people  saying that it helped curb the spread of more cases. The daily tally of new cases there peaked and then plateaued between Jan. 23 and Feb. 2, and has steadily declined since.\n\nMany countries have also enacted travel restrictions and bans, closing their doors to people from countries with sustained transmission of the virus. Governments around the world have been screening incoming passengers for signs of illness. Airlines and cruise lines have canceled service to many Asian destinations.\n\nCritics fear those measures wont be enough.\n\nThe rate at which transmissions are spreading in several countries makes it seem unlikely that containment will be a strategy that will completely stop this virus, said Clarence Tam, an assistant professor of infectious diseases at the School of Public Health at the National University of Singapore.\n\nThe ability of nations to prepare for the arrival of coronavirus cases will depend on the strength of their health systems; their capacity to test, provide hospital beds, drugs and respirators for severely ill patients; and their effectiveness in communicating to the public.\n\nHow long will it take to develop a treatment or vaccine?\n\nA few drugs are being tested in clinical trials, but a vaccine is still at least a year away.\n\nThere are no approved treatments for any coronavirus diseases, including the new coronavirus.\n\nSeveral drugs are being tested, and some initial findings are expected soon. An antiviral medication called remdesivir appears to be effective in animals, and it was used to treat the first American patient in Washington State. Researchers are now testing the drug in clinical trials in the United States, China and other countries.\n\nSeveral groups are also working to develop a vaccine for the virus in order to stop the spread of the disease. But vaccines take time.\n\nAfter the SARS outbreak in 2003, it took researchers about 20 months to get a vaccine ready for human trials. (The vaccine was never needed, because the disease was eventually contained.) By the time of the Zika outbreak in 2015, researchers had brought the development timeline down to six months.\n\nNow, they hope that work from past outbreaks will help cut the timeline even further. Researchers have already studied the genome of the new coronavirus and found the proteins that are crucial for infection. Scientists from the National Institutes of Health, in Australia and at least three companies are working on vaccine candidates.\n\nIf we dont run into any unforeseen obstacles, well be able to get a Phase 1 trial going within the next three months, said Dr. Anthony Fauci, director of the National Institute of Allergy and Infectious Diseases.\n\nDr. Fauci cautioned that it could still take months, and even years, after initial trials to conduct extensive testing that can prove a vaccine is safe and effective. In the best case, a vaccine may become available to the public a year from now."""	b'How Bad Will the Coronavirus Outbreak Get?

This is The Daily.\n\n[music]\n\nToday: Saving the U.S. economy from the fallout of the pandemic may require a historic infusion of cash. Ben Castleman on the debate over that spending. Its Monday, May 18. Ben, were talking to you on Friday morning, and a bunch of big, ugly, economic numbers just came out this morning. So we wanted to sift through them with you.\n\nben castleman\n\nYeah. Its been a pretty dark morning for the economy.\n\nmichael barbaro\n\nWhere do you think we should start?\n\nben castleman\n\nMaybe the place to start is actually on Thursday.\n\narchived recording We turn now to the economy. Nearly 3 million more Americans filed for unemployment benefits last week.\n\nben castleman\n\nWhen we learned that another 3 million Americans had filed for unemployment benefits.\n\narchived recording Thats more than 36 million people in two months.\n\nben castleman\n\nWere two months into this crisis, and yet we are still losing millions of jobs every week.\n\narchived recording For eight straight weeks now, jobless claims have been in the millions with 3 million more people filing for unemployment last week.\n\nmichael barbaro\n\nRight. Every week.\n\nben castleman\n\nEvery week.\n\narchived recording This did not happen naturally. All of these companies didnt just go out of business because demand disappeared. We turned our economy off. Right? Think about New York. Think about the state of California. If you ran a restaurant, a mini golf course, or a clothing store, theres a really good chance you would have laid your workers off.\n\nben castleman\n\nAnd then, Friday morning, we get up.\n\narchived recording Its the services industries that are getting crushed here.\n\nben castleman\n\nAnd we learn that retail sales in April were down more than 16 percent. Thats by far the worst that weve ever seen.\n\narchived recording But as far as these retail sales go, worse than expected month over month.\n\nben castleman\n\nOver the last two months, restaurants lost half their business. Apparel and clothing stores have lost nearly 90 percent of their business.\n\narchived recording The countrys shut down, and people arent buying stuff. I hate to state the obvious, but theyre not buying cars, down 12 percent. Theyre not buying furnishings and home furnishing items, down 58 percent. Clothing and clothing accessories, down 78 percent.\n\nben castleman\n\nAnd then we got another data point that said that industrial production, right, this is the actual stuff that we make in the economy, was down by the most in more than a century that weve been keeping records, meaning worse than the Great Depression.\n\nmichael barbaro\n\nIn other words, as bad as it gets.\n\nben castleman\n\nAs bad as it has ever gotten. We know that this is deep. We know that it is broad-based. We dont yet know how long it will last. And thats the fundamental question going forward.\n\nmichael barbaro\n\nSo given all that, I want to turn to a speech.\n\narchived recording Good morning. Its my pleasure and privilege to welcome back Chair Jay Powell.\n\nmichael barbaro\n\nThat the chairman of the Federal Reserve, Jerome Powell, made a couple of days ago, that I think speaks to all this data.\n\nben castleman\n\nYeah.\n\nmichael barbaro\n\nAnd of course, the chairman of the Federal Reserve doesnt make a ton of speeches, so I know that his words carry a lot of weight.\n\nben castleman\n\nYeah. So Jerome Powell comes out.\n\narchived recording (jerome powell) The coronavirus has left a devastating human and economic toll in its wake.\n\nben castleman\n\nOf course, hes giving the speech remotely, so hes in front of these blue curtains  or maybe theyre digitally superimposed blue curtains, Im not actually sure  on a Zoom-style call. But he comes out with this really stark message.\n\narchived recording (jerome powell) The scope and speed of this downturn are without modern precedent.\n\nben castleman\n\nAnd hes saying, this economic crisis is incredibly deep.\n\narchived recording (jerome powell) We are seeing a severe decline in economic activity and employment.\n\nben castleman\n\nIts incredibly broad.\n\narchived recording (jerome powell) And already, the job gains of the last decade have been erased.\n\nben castleman\n\nAnd it is hitting the most vulnerable workers more than anyone. He has this line early in the speech where he says \n\narchived recording (jerome powell) While were all affected.\n\nben castleman\n\nWhile we are all affected \n\narchived recording (jerome powell) The burden has fallen most heavily on those least able to bear it.\n\nben castleman\n\n The burden has fallen most heavily on those least able to bear it.\n\narchived recording (jerome powell) Among people who were working in February, almost 40 percent of those in households making less than $40,000 a year, had lost a job in March.\n\nben castleman\n\nLower income Americans, black Americans, less educated Americans.\n\narchived recording (jerome powell) But the coronavirus crisis raises longer term concerns as well. The record shows that deeper and longer recessions can leave behind lasting damage to the productive capacity of the economy.\n\nmichael barbaro\n\nAnd Ben Powell talks about this specter of permanent economic damage in this speech, and perhaps he was referring most urgently to these lower income workers. But I want to understand that concept, because it feels a little bit new to me. I think of almost all economic conditions as temporary. So what did he mean by that?\n\nben castleman\n\nYoure right to think about most economic conditions as temporary, because historically, that is the way economists have thought about recessions and economic downturns  is some people lose their jobs, and then they get those jobs back when things get better. Some businesses lose business, or maybe they go out of business, but other things come back up and replace them. But weve learned over time that that is not the way recessions always work, and especially long and deep recessions. That when people lose their jobs, if theyre out of work for too long, they can drift away from the labor market. They can lose their connections, and all of a sudden, even when the economy starts to get better, its very hard for them to get back to work.\n\nmichael barbaro\n\nI wonder if you can give me an example of this to bring it to life.\n\nben castleman\n\nWell, imagine a small company, right, that maybe somebody has spent their lives, maybe a couple generations building. You could imagine if this crisis were to last a few weeks, they lose some revenue, they take a hit, but they start right back up where they left off. But as this drags on and they fall behind on loans, you fall behind on your rent payments, and all of a sudden, you can get to a place where you cant reopen that business, where you cant restart. And sure, the business owner might be able to go and find another job, but that business is lost forever.\n\nmichael barbaro\n\nAnd so that is what Powell is referring to when he talks about permanent economic damage from this pandemic.\n\nben castleman\n\nThats what Powell fears, and thats what he wants to make sure we avoid.\n\nmichael barbaro\n\nWhat kind of solution, what kind of plan does he have in mind in this speech to avoid permanent economic damage?\n\nben castleman\n\nWell, Powell starts by talking about all the things that we have already done, and hes full of praise for that.\n\narchived recording (jerome powell) The response here in the United States has been particularly swift and forceful.\n\nben castleman\n\nHe talks about what the Fed itself has done, of course, but he also talks about \n\narchived recording (jerome powell) To date, Congress has provided roughly $2.9 trillion.\n\nben castleman\n\n what Congress has done, the nearly $3 trillion in emergency spending that Congress has approved.\n\narchived recording (jerome powell) For households, businesses, health care providers and state and local governments.\n\nben castleman\n\nAnd there are a lot of programs that Congress has enacted to try to deal with this, right? Theyve written checks to virtually every American. Theyve offered loans and grants to businesses, and Powell says that all of those things have been incredibly important to softening the blow of this crisis.\n\narchived recording (jerome powell) The overall policy response to date has provided a measure of relief and stability and will provide some support to the recovery, when it comes.\n\nben castleman\n\nBut then, he says \n\narchived recording (jerome powell) But the coronavirus crisis raises longer term concerns as well.\n\nben castleman\n\n basically, were not done yet.\n\nmichael barbaro\n\nThat that was not enough.\n\nben castleman\n\nThat it probably wont be enough. That we know now that this is not a crisis that is going to last for just a month or just a couple of months. Its going to drag on. And that as it drags on, if the government doesnt step in and do enough to keep people and businesses afloat, then were going to see a lot more of that kind of permanent damage that Powell is talking about.\n\nmichael barbaro\n\nAnd when he suggests that we arent done yet, what is he really saying?\n\nben castleman\n\nWhat hes really saying is to Congress, you need to keep spending. The Fed will do what it can do, but the Fed can only lend money. Its Congress that has the ability to spend money, to give money to people, to give money to businesses. And that is, in all likelihood, what it will take to get through this period. He describes whats been done so far as a bridge, a bridge across temporary interruptions, he says. And what hes basically saying is the bridge doesnt yet reach all the way across the river. And a bridge doesnt do you much good if it stops when youre still over water.\n\nmichael barbaro\n\nNo. It does not. Is that normal for the chairman of the Fed to do this, to be advising Congress to spend a lot more money in this manner?\n\nben castleman\n\nNot in as direct terms as this. But this was, at least by the standards of Fed chairs, a pretty direct call to action.\n\narchived recording (jerome powell) Additional fiscal support could be costly but worth it, if it helps avoid long term damage and leaves us with a stronger recovery. This trade-off is one for our elected representatives who wield powers of taxation and spending.\n\nmichael barbaro\n\nAnd can we safely assume that when the chairman of the Federal Reserve tells Congress, this is what I think you should do, that he assumes that that is what Congress will do?\n\nben castleman\n\nOh, I dont think we should assume that Powell thinks that Congress will do it. But I think Powell knew that he was speaking at a moment when theres a major political debate thats playing out between Democrats and Republicans about what the role of government is in this crisis. And hes, in effect, weighing in on one side of that debate, but I dont think hes under any illusion that he alone will resolve it.\n\nmichael barbaro\n\nWell be right back.\n\n[music]\n\nmichael barbaro\n\nSo Ben, describe the divisions between Democrats and Republicans in Congress about this advice from Jerome Powell, the chairman of the Federal Reserve.\n\nben castleman\n\nWell, think back for a moment to those trillions of dollars in spending that have already taken place.\n\narchived recording (charles grassley) I want to highlight a few areas of bipartisan economic relief we will be voting on today. Recovery checks to give Americans needed cash to provide for their families.\n\nben castleman\n\nWhen Congress approved those measures, it was really bipartisan.\n\nmichael barbaro\n\nRight.\n\narchived recording (chuck schumer) This is a strange and evil disease. There is much we still dont know about it, and it is keeping us apart.\n\nben castleman\n\nBut that came at a moment when the economy was in the process of shutting down, and there was pretty widespread agreement that that had to happen.\n\narchived recording (chuck schumer) When we passed this bill, instead of hugging each other, well wave from a distance. None of us can know when this plague will pass. The only thing we know for sure is that we must summon the same spirit that saw previous generations through Americas darkest hours.\n\nben castleman\n\nWere now in a very different moment.\n\narchived recording Democratic leader. archived recording (chuck schumer) Well, its been two weeks since Leader McConnell called us back into session.\n\nben castleman\n\nWhere there are real divisions between Republicans and Democrats about how quickly reopening should take place.\n\narchived recording (chuck schumer) In that time, it was announced that 30 million Americans filed for unemployment. And yet the Republican leader has scheduled exactly zero votes, zero, on legislation related to the coronavirus crisis.\n\nben castleman\n\nAnd with that comes real disagreement about the role of the federal government in continuing to support businesses and especially workers.\n\narchived recording (chuck schumer) Lets solve the problem right now. What are we going to do for people who are out of work?\n\nben castleman\n\nThe Democrats are by and large saying, much of the country is still shut down.\n\narchived recording (chuck schumer) What are we going to do for businesses that are going under?\n\nben castleman\n\nAnd so the government has to continue to support workers and businesses. It has to keep on spending. The Republican side is a little more complicated.\n\narchived recording (mitch mcconnell) This emergency is very serious. So the Senates response has been serious.\n\nben castleman\n\nIts not unanimous, but there is certainly, at least in Congress, more of an inclination to say \n\narchived recording (mitch mcconnell) Look, here in the real world, Senate Republicans are working seriously to help the country reopen.\n\nben castleman\n\nLets see how this reopening process goes. Lets see if the businesses reopen, and if they do, maybe we dont need to do very much more. And if they dont come back and theres a need for further action, then we can talk about that then.\n\nmichael barbaro\n\nSo its a bit more of a wait and see whether Congress really needs to spend all that much more money.\n\nben castleman\n\nThats right, and that question of spending is whats hanging over this. The Republicans are looking at the trillions, with a T, that have been spent so far and saying, can we wait to spend more?\n\narchived recording (mitch mcconnell) The crushing unemployment figures show us that no amount of federal spending could substitute for the entirety of the U.S. economy. We need to be smart, and we need to be safe, but we have to find a more sustainable middle ground.\n\nmichael barbaro\n\nBen, how tied are these different approaches to the long-standing economic ideologies of the Democratic and Republican parties?\n\nben castleman\n\nWell, look, Republicans have a long-standing discomfort with programs like unemployment insurance.\n\narchived recording (john coryn) At a certain point, these benefits are going to do more harm than good, and I would say they already are starting to do that. So extending unemployment benefits through next year would deter people from trying to return to work, because why would they? Why would someone choose to do more work for less money?\n\nben castleman\n\nSo its not surprising that as we move from the acute phase of this crisis into the long, slow recovery, that Republicans would be the first to start raising questions about the spending and to start thinking about pulling back on some of those programs.\n\narchived recording (john coryn) So were already looking at staggering debt that we are going to have to deal with at some point, because its immoral to expect our kids and grandkids to pay that money back after weve already cashed those checks.\n\nben castleman\n\nDemocrats have long advocated for more generous unemployment benefits, for a larger role for government, and so its not too surprising that they are more comfortable with these programs lasting longer.\n\narchived recording (elizabeth warren) We need to show that we have a government that understands the scale of this problem and understands that the approach to it is to get money down into the hands of the people who will put it down at the grassroots level and help support this economy from the ground up.\n\nmichael barbaro\n\nAnd so this is the long-standing, very inflexible ideological terrain that Powell is entering when he goes to Congress and says, hey, cough up trillions of dollars more.\n\nben castleman\n\nThats right.\n\nmichael barbaro\n\nBut it feels like in this debate, the real anxiety is over just the enormity of the scale of money that were talking about. And I feel at this point, I have to ask you the question that we all pretend to know the answer to, which is: Where does all this money come from that Powell is suggesting Congress spend and that Democrats and Republicans are not really agreeing on whether to spend?\n\nben castleman\n\nIn the simplest terms, were borrowing it. The congressional budget office projects that the deficit this year will be $3.7 trillion.\n\nmichael barbaro\n\nAnd were borrowing those trillions of dollars from whom?\n\nben castleman\n\nSo Congress decides how much its going to spend, and it of course sets tax rates as well. And any time that Congress decides to spend more than it brings in in tax rates, then the Treasury Department has to sell bonds to make up the difference. And that just means that its asking people, investors, foreign governments to lend the United States money. You give us money now, well give you money back with a small amount of interest in anywhere from a few days to 10 years.\n\nmichael barbaro\n\nRight. So when we hear about treasury bonds and their yields, that is the interest payment that the U.S. government is giving to someone who buys a treasury bond, and then the process has lent money to the U.S. and to Congress.\n\nben castleman\n\nThats right. Every time the government sells a bond, its borrowing money from the public. Its paying some interest on that, just like if you borrowed money to buy a house or to make a purchase, to buy a car. The only difference is the federal government gets a much better interest rate than you or I ever will.\n\nmichael barbaro\n\nSo we kind of become the bank.\n\nben castleman\n\nWe become the bank.\n\nmichael barbaro\n\nAnd to hear someone like Jerome Powell describe it, that doesnt seem all that risky for Congress to spend all that money, which would require the U.S. borrowing that much from us and anyone who wants to buy U.S. treasury bonds. But is it risky?\n\nben castleman\n\nSo in the short term, theres really no risk here. We can keep borrowing, as long as people will keep lending us money. In the long term, of course, we have to make good on those loans.\n\nmichael barbaro\n\nRight.\n\nben castleman\n\nAnd we have to pay interest on those loans. And so there will certainly be a debate when we come out the other side of this crisis about what the government should do about these huge deficits. But that debate is still years away. Because were at a very particular moment right now, which is that were in the middle of an immediate crisis. And if we dont get our economy back on track, then none of that longer run debate matters. That debate is conditional on having an economy at all on the other side of this.\n\nmichael barbaro\n\nRight. So you could have an economy with little debt, but you might not have much of an economy at all.\n\nben castleman\n\nYeah. Powell is saying, the debt is the least of our worries right now. Its not that it doesnt matter. Its not that it will never matter. But we have to try to get the economy through this period and moving again, before we can worry about any of those other long-run concerns. You could think about it like performing CPR. Right? Performing CPR often involves breaking ribs, and thats a real consequence. But that doesnt mean you dont perform CPR. You perform CPR, you try to get somebody whose heart started again, and then you worry about the other consequences once the persons heart is beating again.\n\nmichael barbaro\n\nAnd just to be clear, in this metaphor the broken ribs is massive U.S. debt spending on stimulus.\n\nben castleman\n\nAnd the heart is the American economy, which right now is stopped and which we somehow have to get beating again. And so what you now have is Powell and lots of other economists who, like him, would normally be worried about the debt who are saying, now is not the moment. That includes people who were advisers to George W. Bush, people who were advisers to Republican candidates and Republican leaders throughout the last several decades. Pretty much all of the economists that I talk to and that my colleagues have been talking to are saying the same thing, which is now is not the moment to worry about the debt.\n\nmichael barbaro\n\nSo if this is the broad consensus of economists across the United States, Ben, why is this much of a debate in Congress at all?\n\nben castleman\n\nEconomists like to think that they issue these sage pieces of advice, and everybody on Capitol Hill and in statehouses will rush to follow them. But of course, thats not the way the world works.\n\nmichael barbaro\n\nAnd so it may well be the case that many members of Congress thank the Federal Reserve chairman but say, you know, were not going to follow that advice.\n\nben castleman\n\nAnd weve already heard Republicans in Congress saying exactly that.\n\narchived recording (mitch mcconnell) Look, we cant spend enough money to prop this economy up forever. People need to be able to begin to be productive again, consistent with the guidelines that have been laid down by the health care professionals toward opening up the economy. Its the only solution to the dilemma with which we are confronted.\n\nben castleman\n\nThey just dont believe that what Powell is saying right now is the real solution to our economic problems, even though many of their own economic advisers are telling them the same thing.\n\n[music]\n\nmichael barbaro\n\nBen, thank you very much.\n\nben castleman\n\nThanks for having me.\n\nmichael barbaro\n\nWell be right back.\n\n[music]\n\nHeres what else you need to know today.\n\narchived recording [CHEERING] Congratulations. You did it. Were so proud of you, Davie.\n\nmichael barbaro\n\nThousands of high school and college seniors across the country \n\narchived recording Yeah. Congratulations.

You will talk of those earlier years in your lives just that way. Well, that was back before the Covid-19.\n\nmichael barbaro\n\nIn his commencement speeches, former President Barack Obama delivered pointed criticism of how the U.S. government has handled the pandemic.\n\narchived recording (barack obama) More than anything, this pandemic has fully finally torn back the curtain on the idea that so many of the folks in charge know what theyre doing. A lot of them arent even pretending to be in charge.\n\nmichael barbaro\n\nObama did not mention President Trump by name, but his remarks were seen as a clear indictment of his successor.\n\narchived recording (barack obama) All those adults that used to think they were in charge and knew what they were doing, turns out, they dont have all the answers. A lot of them arent even asking the right questions.

Shes going to do todays workout with you. There are four simple exercises  march in place, squats, push-ups with twist and bicycle crunches. Youll repeat them twice, giving you a total body workout. Each exercise is 30 seconds long. Do them at your own pace. Youll rest for 15 seconds after each exercise. Give yourself enough space to move around. And grab some water, a towel or a mat, if you like. Are you ready? Your six-minute workout starts in three, two, one. Lets go. March in place is a cardio exercise. Lift your knee as you swing the opposite elbow forward. Keep it up as you alternate sides. Keep pace with Jillian, or go faster if you can. Ten seconds to go  three, two, one. You have 15 seconds before your next exercise. Great job. Now rest, stretch or grab some water. Rested? Lets go. Squats work the lower body. As you squat, make sure your knees are behind your toes when you look down. Keep your heels on the floor. Breathe in as you squat, and exhale as you come up. Ten seconds to go  three, two, one. Push-ups with twist combines a kneeling push-up with an upper body rotation and an arm stretch. Try to keep your body straight from head to knees. If youre struggling, you can bend from your hips, like Jillian, to make it a bit easier. If you find the twist too difficult, you can skip it and just do regular push-ups. Ten seconds to go  three, two, one. Bicycle crunches work your abdominal muscles. Lie down on the floor with your knees bent. Now crunch your stomach and pedal your legs. Focus on tightening your core, and dont forget to breathe. Ten seconds to go  three, two, one. Youre halfway there. Now were going to repeat each of these exercises one more time. Ready? Three, two, one. March in place boosts your heart rate without placing strain on your joints. As you march, keep your chest open and your back straight. Start slow with low knees, and begin lifting your knees higher as you warm up. Ten seconds to go  three, two, one. Time for more squats for lower body strength. Squat slowly until your hips are about even with your knees. Extend your arms forward for balance. Remember to keep your knees behind your toes. Ten seconds to go  three, two, one. Push-ups with twist can add variety to your upper body workout. To stay balanced, finish the push-up before starting the twist. If you cant stay straight from head to knees, bending at the hips, like Jillian is doing, lightens the weight on your arms. Ten seconds to go  three, two, one. Bicycle crunches target your core. Keep your shoulder blades lifted off the floor to make sure youre working your upper abs. If its more comfortable, you can cradle your head in your hands. Dont forget to breathe. Ten seconds to go  three, two, one. Congratulations! You just completed your six-minute workout. Grab some water. In a few seconds, were going to cool down with two easy yoga stretches. This is the cat cow pose. Start in a tabletop position. As you inhale, arch your back and press your belly towards the floor. Then, exhale and round your spine towards the ceiling. Do this for 10 deep, slow breaths. Now lets finish in Shavasana. Empty your mind and relax into the floor. Take a moment to check in with your body and how it feels. Congratulate yourself for all you did today. Stay here for as long as you like.'	b'In 6 Minutes, You Can Be Done With Your Workout'	2020-02-18	['Tara Parker-Pope']	['workout', 'jillian', 'exercise', 'youre', 'minutes', 'knees', 'floor', 'pushups', 'twist', 'seconds', 'body']	b'Shes going to do todays workout with you.\nThere are four simple exercises  march in place, squats, push-ups with twist and bicycle crunches.\nYoull repeat them twice, giving you a total body workout.\nYour six-minute workout starts in three, two, one.\nPush-ups with twist can add variety to your upper body workout.'

Kay Ivey had resisted a statewide order, saying that she wanted to balance the health of the state\'s residents with the health of the economy. ""We are not California,"" she said on a conference call with reporters, according to AL.com. But after Birmingham, the largest city in the state, issued a shelter-in-place order for its residents, and amid growing pressure, the governor issued a statewide order. You need to understand we are past urging people to stay at home,"" she said. ""It is now the law. Stay at home\n\nAlaska About 737,000 people ""We crossed a line today,"" Gov. Mike Dunleavy said, issuing instructions for people to stay home or remain six feet or more from one another when outside. The mayor of Anchorage had previously asked residents to ""hunker down."" Stay at home\n\nArizona About 7.2 million people Gov. Doug Ducey said he issued the order at the recommendation of health officials. ""Im grateful to everyone making adjustments to fight this virus and protect others,"" he said. ""We need to keep these efforts up."" Stay at home\n\nCalifornia About 39.6 million people California, Americas most populous state, was the first to order all residents to stay home. Others quickly followed suit. This is not a permanent state, this is a moment in time, Gov. Gavin Newsom said. We will look back at these decisions as pivotal. Stay at home\n\nColorado About 5.7 million people A number of counties and cities in the state, including Denver and Boulder, had issued their own stay-at-home orders, but Gov. Jared Polis also issued a statewide order, reiterating the need for everyone to stay at home. We owe it to ourselves and our fellow Americans in order to save lives, he said. Stay at home\n\nConnecticut About 3.6 million people At this critical time it is essential that everyone just stay home, Gov. Ned Lamont said. Stay at home\n\nDelaware About 973,000 people I dont want Delaware to be the example of what not to do in response to this crisis, Gov. John Carney said. Shelter in place\n\nDistrict of Columbia About 702,000 people Mayor Muriel E. Bowser issued a stay-at-home order for all residents, joining the nearby states of Maryland and Virginia in a move that virtually shut down the nation\'s capital region. ""Many people want to know how they can help right now,"" the mayor said. ""For most people this is how  by staying home."" Stay at home\n\nFlorida About 21.5 million people Gov. Ron DeSantis, who for weeks resisted more stringent statewide measures even as cities and counties took action, announced that he would order the states more than 21 million residents to largely stay at home. The governor said he started coming around to the necessity of a statewide order once the White House extended national guidelines to combat the coronavirus until April 30. To me, that was, People arent just going to back to work, Mr. DeSantis said at a news conference in Tallahassee, the state capital. Thats a national pause button. Stay at home\n\nGeorgia About 10.6 million people Gov. Brian Kemp announced that he would issue a statewide order for all residents to shelter in place, following a similar stay-at-home order in Atlanta and other areas. He said he made the decision, in part, after learning that many people without symptoms are transmitting the virus. ""At this point,"" he said, ""I think it\'s the right thing to do."" Shelter in place\n\nHawaii About 1.4 million people As in other states, there are exceptions to the stay-at-home order in Hawaii, including leaving the house to go surfing and swimming. But the governor\'s office said violations could be punishable by a fine of up to $5,000, or as much as one year in jail. The threat of COVID-19 is unprecedented and requires aggressive action,"" Gov. David Ige said. Stay at home\n\nIdaho About 1.8 million people Our health care and public safety workers are putting themselves in harms way to respond to the coronavirus emergency, and we owe it to them to do our part by following this statewide stay-home order, Gov. Brad Little said. Stay at home\n\nIllinois About 12.7 million people I dont come to this decision easily, Gov. J.B. Pritzker said. I fully recognize that, in some cases, I am choosing between peoples lives and saving peoples livelihood. But ultimately, you cant have a livelihood if you dont have your life. Stay at home\n\nIndiana About 6.7 million people Gov. Eric J. Holcomb asked ""Hoosiers to hunker down."" He added: You must be part of the solution, not the problem. Stay at home\n\nKansas About 2.9 million people After several municipalities in Kansas issued stay-at-home instructions in quick succession, including in the greater Kansas City region, Gov. Laura Kelly issued a statewide order. ""While I left these decisions to local health departments as long as possible,"" she said, ""the reality is that the patchwork approach that has developed is inconsistent and is a recipe for chaos."" Stay at home\n\nKentucky About 4.5 million people Gov. Andy Beshear ordered all non-essential businesses to stop operating in-person services by March 26 and urged residents to stay ""healthy at home."" In a news conference on March 27, he clarified that the state\'s campaign amounted to telling residents to stay home. ""That doesn\'t mean you need to cower down in your home,"" he said. But ""you stay at home, unless you are getting groceries or other supplies that you may need."" Healthy at home\n\nLouisiana About 4.6 million people If we want to flatten the curve, we have to take action today, Gov. John Bel Edwards said. New Orleans had previously issued its own order. Stay at home\n\nMaine About 1.3 million people We are in the midst of one of the greatest public health crises this world has seen in more than a century,"" Gov. Janet Mills said. ""This virus will continue to sicken people across our state; our cases will only grow, and more people will die. I say this to be direct, to be as honest with you as I can. Because saving lives will depend on us. Stay at home\n\nMaryland About 6 million people Citing a drastic uptick in cases and deaths in Maryland and the United States, Gov. Larry Hogan issued a statewide stay-at-home order. ""We are no longer asking or suggesting that Marylanders stay home,"" he said. ""We are directing them to do so."" Stay at home\n\nMassachusetts About 6.9 million people Gov. Charlie Baker stopped short of declaring a formal order, but announced an advisory for residents to stay home. I do not believe I can or should order U.S. citizens to be confined to their home for days on end, he said. It doesnt make sense from a public health point of view, and its not realistic. Stay at home advisory\n\nMichigan About 10 million people Without a comprehensive national strategy, we, the states, must take action, Gov. Gretchen Whitmer said, urging residents to stay home. Stay at home\n\nMinnesota About 5.6 million people Gov. Tim Walz emphasized the need to slow the spread of the virus over time and not overwhelm hospitals in Minnesota. ""We are asking you  because it is going to take cooperation and collaboration  stay home,"" he said. Stay at home\n\nMississippi About 3 million people Gov. Tate Reeves announced a shelter-in-place order and asked all residents to take enforcement seriously. ""If you will self-enforce this, it will go a long way to slowing the spread,"" he said. Shelter in place\n\nMissouri About 6.1 million people Residents in the Kansas City, St. Louis and St. Louis County areas were among those under instructions to stay at home before Gov. Mike Parson issued a statewide order. The governor had previously rejected the step, but issued the order to ""stay ahead of the battle."" Stay at home\n\nMontana About 1.1 million people ""We cannot rebuild our economic strength without doing everything we can now to flatten the curve and slow the spread of this virus,"" Gov. Steve Bullock said. Stay at home\n\nNevada About 3.1 million people Gov. Steve Sisolak had shut down all nonessential businesses and encouraged residents to stay home for weeks before issuing a formal order, codifying a message he had been trying to send for weeks: ""STAY HOME for our State,"" he said on Twitter. Stay at home\n\nNew Hampshire About 1.4 million people Gov. Chris Sununu had earlier described a stay-at-home order as not a ""practical ask"" of residents, but later put one in place. ""We can\'t stress this enough  you should stay at your house unless absolutely necessary,"" he said. Stay at home\n\nNew Jersey About 8.9 million people We know the virus spreads through person-to-person contact, and the best way to prevent further exposure is to limit our public interactions, Gov. Phil Murphy said. Stay at home\n\nNew Mexico About 2.1 million people Addressing questions about whether she was issuing a shelter-in-place order, Gov. Michelle Lujan Grisham said that the tantamount effect of what were doing is basically the same. She added: This is quite frankly an instruction to stay home. Stay at home\n\nNew York About 19.5 million people Gov. Andrew M. Cuomo has shied away from the language of a shelter-in-place order, which he said evoked images of shooter situations or nuclear war. Words matter, the governor said, instead describing it as putting all of New York on pause. This is the most drastic action we can take, he said. Stay at home\n\nNorth Carolina About 10.4 million people A number of cities and counties in North Carolina had already ordered their residents to stay home, but Gov. Roy Cooper made it official statewide. ""Even if you dont think you have to worry about yourself, consider our nurses, doctors, custodial staff & other hospital workers who will be stretched beyond their capacity if we are unable to slow the spread of this disease,"" he said on Twitter. Stay at home\n\nOhio About 11.7 million people Gov. Mike DeWine has been notably aggressive in his response to the coronavirus, and Ohio was among the first wave of states to adopt this measure. We havent faced an enemy like we are facing today in 102 years, he said. We are at war. Stay at home\n\nOklahoma Gov. Kevin Stitt has told older and vulnerable people across Oklahoma to stay home, but mayors in the state\'s major cities, including Oklahoma City, Tulsa and Norman, ordered all residents to do so. ""We want to leave no doubt,"" Mayor David Holt of Oklahoma City said. ""The safest course of action during this public health crisis is to stay home."" Ardmore About 25,000 people Shelter in place Claremore About 19,000 people Stay at home Edmond About 93,000 people Shelter in place Moore About 62,000 people Shelter in place Norman About 123,000 people Stay at home Oklahoma City About 649,000 people Shelter in place Sallisaw About 9,000 people Shelter in place Stillwater About 50,000 people Shelter in place Tulsa About 401,000 people Shelter in place\n\nOregon About 4.2 million people Gov. Kate Brown took the action after seeing the states scenic trails and beaches packed with people over the weekend. If you\'re still not sure about an activity, skip it, she said. Staying home will save lives. Stay at home\n\nPennsylvania About 12.8 million people Starting March 23, Gov. Tom Wolf began ordering an expanding number of counties to stay at home, including in the Philadelphia and Pittsburgh regions. On April 1, he announced he was enacting the order statewide. We appreciate the shared sacrifice of all 12.8 million Pennsylvanians,"" he said. ""We are in this together."" Stay at home\n\nPuerto Rico About 3.2 million people Gov. Wanda Vzquez issued an order imposing a nightly curfew and allowing people to leave their homes during the day only to buy groceries or medicine, go to the bank, attend medical appointments, tend to caregiving responsibilities or work in businesses deemed essential. All citizens will have to stay home to stop the spread of this virus, she said. Curfew\n\nRhode Island About 1.1 million people Gov. Gina Raimondo issued a stay-at-home order in a state that has gone to great lengths to protect itself from outsiders, especially people fleeing New York City. She said a surge in cases was inevitable. ""This is going to get very real very fast for all of us,"" she said. Stay at home\n\nSouth Carolina About 5.1 million people Charleston and Columbia had previously ordered residents in those cities to stay at home before Gov. Henry McMaster issued a statewide ""home or work order,"" which requires all South Carolinians to limit movement outside their home or place of work except for essential activities. South Carolina became the last state on the East Coast to issue such an order. Stay at home\n\nTennessee About 6.8 million people Residents in the Nashville and Memphis areas were already under instructions to stay at home as much as possible when Gov. Bill Lee issued statewide guidelines urging everyone to do so. ""We need you to do that to protect the lives of your neighbors,"" he said. Stay at home\n\nTexas About 29 million people For weeks, Gov. Greg Abbott left it to local officials to impose the most restrictive orders. Millions of people in certain cities and counties were told to stay home, including in Harris County, which includes Houston; Dallas and Tarrant Counties in the Dallas-Fort Worth region; and Bexar County, which includes San Antonio. On March 31, Mr. Abbott tightened guidelines, but said that ""this is not a stay-at-home strategy."" The next day, he released a video message to Texans, saying he had ordered ""all Texans to stay at home, except to provide essential services or do essential things like going to the grocery store. A spokesman for Mr. Abbott later confirmed that Texas was under a statewide stay-at-home mandate. Stay at home\n\nUtah Summit County, a popular area for skiing and tourism, became the first in Utah to issue such a restriction, The Salt Lake Tribune reported. Salt Lake County also issued a similar order. The goals are to save lives and stop our hospital system from being overrun, Mayor Jenny Wilson of Salt Lake County said.

Phil Scott said. Stay at home\n\nVirginia About 8.5 million people Gov. Ralph Northam, who shut down schools and nonessential businesses and banned gatherings of more than 10 people, had said that issuing a stay-at-home order was a matter of semantics. But after seeing beaches and other public areas packed with people, he issued a formal order. ""It is clear more people still need to hear this basic message: Stay home."" Stay at home\n\nWashington About 7.5 million people Gov. Jay Inslee tried begging people to stay at home in Washington State, which has among the worst outbreaks of the virus in the country. Then he made it mandatory. The fastest way to get back to normal is to hit this hard, he said. Stay at home\n\nWest Virginia About 1.8 million people West Virginia was the last state to have a confirmed case of the virus, but Gov. Jim Justice quickly joined a chorus of other governors calling on residents to stay inside. A stay-at-home order is not martial law, he said, reminding residents that they could still leave their homes for food and outdoor activity. But he warned: The magnitude of this is unbelievable. Stay at home\n\nWisconsin About 5.8 million people Gov. Tony Evers initially thought he would not have to issue such an order, but later changed his mind.

Joshua Lott for The New York Times\n\nIt has been about two weeks since the Illinois governor ordered residents to stay at home, but nothing has changed about Adarra Benjamins responsibilities. She gets on a bus nearly every morning in Chicago, traveling 20 miles round trip some days to cook, clean and shop for her clients, who are older or have health problems that make such tasks difficult.\n\nMs. Benjamin knows the dangers, but she needs her job, which pays about $13 an hour. She also cannot imagine leaving her clients to fend for themselves. Theyve become my family, she said.\n\nIn cities across America, many lower-income workers continue to move around, while those who make more money are staying home and limiting their exposure to the coronavirus, according to smartphone location data analyzed by The New York Times.\n\nAlthough people in all income groups are moving less than they did before the crisis, wealthier people are staying home the most, especially during the workweek. Not only that, but in nearly every state, they began doing so days before the poor, giving them a head start on social distancing as the virus spread, according to aggregated data from the location analysis company Cuebiq, which tracks about 15 million cellphone users nationwide daily.\n\n\n\n\n\n\n\n\n\nBeginning in early March, people across the country started limiting their movements as the coronavirus spread. Similar trends can be seen from coast to coast, including in the 25 most populous metropolitan areas. The wealthiest people, those in the top 10 percent of income, however, have limited their movement more than those in the bottom 10 percent of the same metro areas, according to a Times analysis of cellphone location data. By March 16, when President Trump asked people to stay at home to slow the spread of the virus, those in the wealthiest and poorest areas were both moving less than usual. But by that date, those in the highest-income locations had already cut their movement by nearly half. Poorer areas did not see a similar drop until three days later.\n\nThe data offers real-time evidence of a divide laid bare by the coronavirus pandemic  one in which wealthier people not only have more job security and benefits but also may be better able to avoid becoming sick. The outbreak is so new that the relationship between socioeconomic status and infection rates cannot be determined, but other data, including recent statistics released by public health officials in New York City, suggests that the coronavirus is hitting low-income neighborhoods the hardest.\n\nConcerns about getting infected have incited protests and strikes by workers in grocery stores, delivery services and other industries who say their employers are not providing them with enough protection or compensation to counter the increased health risks, even as their jobs have been deemed essential.\n\nRules vary among states, but essential workers generally include those in health care and public safety roles, as well as caregivers, delivery drivers, grocery clerks and plumbers. Hardware stores, pharmacies and takeout restaurants also remain open and staffed. All of these workers are able to stay on the job  a boon in an economy seized by shutdowns  but in most cases they cannot claim unemployment benefits if they quit.\n\nPeople want to talk about this virus as an equal opportunity pathogen, but its really not, said Dr. Ashwin Vasan, a doctor and public health professor at Columbia University. Its going right to the fissures in our society.\n\nGov. J.B. Pritzker of Illinois announced a stay-at-home order in his state on March 20 to combat the spread of the coronavirus. Charles Rex Arbogast/Associated Press\n\nThe mobility data provides a snapshot in time, and the behaviors it captures could change amid a fast-moving crisis. Although several public policy experts who reviewed the data said it strongly indicated that wealthier people are better able to stay home, they added that there could be other reasons for the differences  perhaps higher awareness of the risks or better access to information, for example  and others that are not yet obvious.\n\nEconomists and public health researchers said the data pointed to holes in the governments response to the pandemics fallout for low-income workers, which has focused on those who have lost their jobs because of shutdowns and not on those with essential duties.\n\nCovid-19 is exposing a lot of the structural disadvantages that low-income people face, including a lack of job security and uneven access to health care, said Adie Tomer, a fellow at the Brookings Institution who has studied the essential work force. The well-off are employed in industries where they are at a desk, and so there are some advantages built into these high-income neighborhoods during this pandemic, he added.\n\nIn metro areas with the greatest disparity between the richest and the poorest residents  and where there are orders to stay home  people in higher-income neighborhoods have essentially halted movement. People in lower-income neighborhoods have also drastically reduced their movement, but the data shows an uptick in their movements after the third weekend of March, coinciding with the start of another workweek.\n\nChange in movement in metro areas with high income disparity\n\nIn other areas where income disparity was not as high, it was much more likely that both the richest and poorest continued to move. These cities were also in places that were less likely to have mandated that residents stay home.\n\nChange in movement in metro areas with low income disparity\n\nMany essential workers are in lower-income jobs and have positions that require them to leave home and work face-to-face with others, economists said. The people at this income, theyre either furloughed and not coming in to work, or they are essential construction, grocery cashiers, workers in long-term care institutions, said Matthew Rae, who directs a program on health care markets at the Kaiser Family Foundation.\n\nAnd hundreds of thousands of them dont have health insurance.\n\nMs. Benjamin, the health worker in Chicagos Woodlawn neighborhood, is 26 and among those without health insurance. She carries bottled soap and hand sanitizer with her and is vigilant about not touching her face. But she is worried.\n\nI do have gloves, but I just ran out of masks, she said, and I have no idea where Im going to get any from.\n\nJust 15 miles north of Ms. Benjamin, in the Uptown neighborhood, John Williams has been working at home since March 16, five days before the governors order went into effect. A communications worker for nonprofits, Mr. Williams said people on his team were already used to telecommuting but that his husband, a high school music teacher, had faced more challenges.Honestly, we are grateful for the privilege and security we have at the moment, knock on wood, he said. Its uncomfortable, but its not life-threateningly scary.\n\nMs. Benjamin waiting for a transit bus to get to work. She is an essential worker but does not have health insurance. Joshua Lott for The New York Times\n\nAs federal lawmakers contend with shuttered businesses and millions of people suddenly out of work, little of their legislation has been tailored to help essential workers affected by the pandemic. These workers will get the same stimulus checks that other people get from the $2 trillion economic stabilization package, and the second phase of the coronavirus legislation expanded the mandate for paid sick leave related to Covid-19. But while Democrats have renewed their push to include expanded occupational safety requirements for workers, which failed to gain traction in the most recent legislation, and are also calling for additional hazard pay for workers on the front lines, it is unclear if either of those will prevail in future negotiations.\n\nMr. Tomer, of Brookings, said life insurance and targeted coronavirus-related health insurance for essential workers could help. Its about peace of mind for them and their families, and a form of compensation, he said.\n\nIn reports from many cities, workers have alternated between fear at being exposed to the virus and relief at having a job while so many others are unemployed. Ridership on New Yorks subway system has plummeted, but stations in poorer areas remain crowded.\n\nIn Seattle, one of the earliest coronavirus hotspots in the country, Cassandra Fejarang, a Teamsters union member, was laid off from her restaurant supply position in March but was able to find work in a Safeway grocery distribution center. She travels a few miles by car to the warehouse in Auburn, Wash.\n\nIm blessed to still be able to work, said Ms. Fejarang, 34. She said she has been pulling 10- and 16-hour shifts, loading packs of frozen food, toilet paper, bleach and other goods onto pallets to be taken to stores. Grocery warehouse workers in her union make a good wage  $20 to $29 an hour  and have negotiated extra benefits during the coronavirus crisis.\n\nI definitely wear gloves and try to keep my mask on because were surrounded by people all day, she said. We are all washing our hands, trying to keep our distance. Its hard, but I feel safe when Im there.\n\nWashington State, which had the earliest known major outbreak of coronavirus in the United States, stands out from the rest of the country because the wealthiest people there had nearly a weeks head start over the poorest when it came to staying home.\n\nWith this highly transmissible virus, even days can make a difference in limiting or igniting an outbreak, said Dr. Vasan, the Columbia professor.\n\nIts just moving like wildfire through communities, Dr. Vasan said. We talk about flattening the curve, and every day people are not staying home just makes that harder.\n\nWhen groups started to decrease their movement by half\n\nDr. Vasan and other public health experts cautioned that the nature of this virus means that inequality in health outcomes puts the entire population at greater risk. Pockets of people who are untested or who dont get the appropriate medical treatment can quickly become new clusters.\n\nMs. Benjamin, the home care worker, said she was proud to be essential but would feel better with assurances that she could be taken care of if she fell ill.\n\nI just really want people to understand that its hard right now to go to work and live for other people, she said. I want to make sure that they know were all in this together. Everyone is scared, but the world is in this together.'	b'Location Data Says It All: Staying at Home During Coronavirus Is a Luxury'	2020-04-03	['Jennifer Valentino-Devries', 'Denise Lu', 'Gabriel J.X.

New York State on pause  only essential businesses will be functioning. 100% of the workforce must stay home. This is the most drastic action we can take. Everything is uncharted territory. Nobody knows whats going to happen in the news any minute. I think Ive been asking a lot of how we could have prevented this. Am I going to see another depression like my grandfather saw in the 1920s? Over the past few days, New York City has taken a lot of important measures. Im just worried it came a little bit too late. I think Im scared of having to see more death and from reading stories from abroad, having to make decisions about resources. And Im worried people in my life are going to die from it. A few days ago, I had to watch a patient basically slowly die. I just felt helpless. This is the first time Ive really seen people that I truly dont know how to help. And they are coming in so sick that everything Im used to doing to be able to treat them, I cant really do. How was your day off, Mich? It was emotional, to say the least. Why? Its just, like, the hospital has been insane. And every hour, like, things are changing. So its just, like, trying to keep up with that while trying to read about what I should be treating these people with, while people are rolling in the worst  I dont know. They say in 18 days its supposed to get really bad. I guarantee you tomorrow were going to have like 1,000 more. The numbers are going to go up. Thats no problem at all. Thank you very much. Thats very nice. Thank you. Sounds good. See you then. Bye. Well, I have been working. A lot of people are not, which is hard. This place used to have 30 employees, and on Sunday we let go of 90% of the staff. We want to reopen so we can rehire people, you know? It was really hard to let everyone go. These are people that are at the level, theyre not wealthy, you know? This is a very harsh reality. And actually what the job is, is smiling through stress. And this is hard to smile through. [Rain falling] Its go time here at the community kitchen. This is the time where we have to ramp up our services to be very sensitive to how people are feeling. People are coming to us feeling vulnerable. They maybe work in the restaurant industry. People who work in Broadway and in a lot of the behind-the-scenes, theyre coming here saying, well, I dont have work. So those industries are the folks that are the first ones that were seeing come through. But were preparing to see more people come through in need. All programming at the senior center is suspended for the next two weeks. Stay safe and have a good day. So this is not business as usual. We dont know whats coming up if people have to stay in their homes for a longer period of time. And we want to make sure people are getting food, especially since a lot of industries are out of work. We are expecting a lot of new people, and we are going to be ready to receive them. This is all very new for them, and some of them are feeling guilt or shame coming to an emergency food program. So we have to remember that we do this all the time, but for them, its something new and something that they feel anxious about doing. Were just getting them registered. Theyre getting food. Thats our main priority is people are getting food. [Sighing with exasperation] Im not supposed to touch my face. Hold on a second. I have prepared myself already, mentally, multiple times, to go back to Oregon and leave this entire beautiful dream behind me. So many people, including many of my friends, are working at bars, at restaurants, which are now closed. And now were all at home, wondering, Can we make it another month? Can our families afford to pay their mortgages at home? Do we just need to go back and start working, just so we can help our own families, the people that we love the most, stay in the homes that we grew up in? Its hard to think that my mom or my dad are never going to see retirement. The best things that we can do right now as a community is just to give ourselves over to something that brings us true happiness. Because right now, it feels like its about to get very desperate. This is only something that we can get through if were working together. There will be so much suffering, unnecessary suffering, if were not really looking out for each other and if we only think about ourselves and our well-being. We have to be thinking about each other.

But it transformed how he exerted power, leaving the White House and Twitter to grapple over whether, and how, to rein it in.\n\nIn the past three months, President Trumps tweets have spilled out at triple the rate he set in 2017.\n\nAt the beginning of his presidency, Mr. Trump tweeted about nine times per day.\n\nWhat followed was a barrage of personal attacks, outrage and boasting, in a near-constant stream of more than 11,000 tweets over 33 months.\n\nOn the morning of Inauguration Day 2017, Donald J. Trump tweeted an opening message to the United States.\n\nIn the Oval Office, an annoyed President Trump ended an argument he was having with his aides. He reached into a drawer, took out his iPhone and threw it on top of the historic Resolute Desk:\n\nDo you want me to settle this right now?\n\nThere was no missing Mr. Trumps threat that day in early 2017, the aides recalled. With a tweet, he could fling a directive to the world, and there was nothing they could do about it.\n\nWhen Mr. Trump entered office, Twitter was a political tool that had helped get him elected and a digital howitzer that he relished firing. In the years since, he has fully integrated Twitter into the very fabric of his administration, reshaping the nature of the presidency and presidential power.\n\nAfter Turkey invaded northern Syria this past month, he crafted his response not only in White House meetings but also in a series of contradictory tweets. This summer, he announced increased tariffs on $300 billion worth of Chinese goods, using a tweet to deepen tensions between the two countries. And in March, Mr. Trump cast aside more than 50 years of American policy, tweeting his recognition of Israels sovereignty in the Golan Heights. He openly delighted in the reaction he provoked.\n\nBoom. I press it, Mr. Trump recalled months later at a White House conference attended by conservative social media personalities, and, within two seconds, We have breaking news.\n\nEarly on, top aides wanted to restrain the presidents Twitter habit, even considering asking the company to impose a 15-minute delay on Mr. Trumps messages. But 11,390 presidential tweets later, many administration officials and lawmakers embrace his Twitter obsession, flocking to his social media chief with suggestions. Policy meetings are hijacked when Mr. Trump gets an idea for a tweet, drawing in cabinet members and others for wordsmithing. And as a president often at war with his own bureaucracy, he deploys Twitter to break through logjams, overrule or humiliate recalcitrant advisers and pre-empt his staff.\n\nHe needs to tweet like we need to eat, Kellyanne Conway, his White House counselor, said in an interview.\n\nIn a presidency unlike any other, where Mr. Trump wakes to Twitter, goes to bed with it and is comforted by how much it revolves around him, the person he most often singled out for praise was himself  more than 2,000 times, according to an analysis by The New York Times.\n\nPresident Trump is tweeting more than ever. The second week of October was his busiest, with 271 tweets. He regularly takes to Twitter to lash out at his perceived enemies. In fact, he attacks someone or something in more than half of his tweets. 250 tweets per week 200 150 100 50 2017 April July Oct. 2018 April July Oct. 2019 April July Oct. 250 tweets per week 200 150 100 50 2017 2018 2019 250 tweets per week 200 150 100 50 2017 April July Oct. 2018 April July Oct. 2019 April July Oct. 250 tweets per week 200 150 100 50 2017 April July Oct. 2018 April July Oct. 2019 April July Oct. 250 tweets per week 200 150 100 50 2017 2018 2019 250 tweets per week 200 150 100 50 2017 April July Oct. 2018 April July Oct. 2019 April July Oct.\n\nMost of these attacks occur in the early morning or later in the evening, when Mr. Trump is more likely to be without his advisers. 1,200 tweets 1,000 Total tweets, by hour tweeted 800 600 400 All tweets 200 Attacks 2 a.m. 6 a.m. 10 a.m. 2 p.m. 6 p.m. 10 p.m. 1,200 tweets 1,000 Total tweets, by hour tweeted 800 600 400 All tweets 200 Attacks 2 a.m. 6 a.m. 10 a.m. 2 p.m. 6 p.m. 10 p.m.\n\nThe Times examined Mr. Trumps use of Twitter since taking office, reviewing all his tweets, retweets and followers, and interviewing nearly 50 current and former administration officials, lawmakers and Twitter executives and employees. What has emerged is a rich account, with new analysis, previously unreported episodes and fresh details of how the president exploits the platform to exert power.\n\n[Read how Times journalists sorted more than 11,000 of Donald Trumps Twitter posts.]\n\nNo. of tweets ... that 5,889 attacked someone or something 4,876 praised someone or something 2,405 attacked Democrats 2,065 attacked investigations 2,026 praised President Trump 1,710 promoted conspiracy theories 1,308 attacked news organizations 851 attacked minority groups 758 praised or promoted Fox News and other conservative media 570 attacked immigrants 453 attacked previous presidential administrations 417 conducted presidential business on Twitter 256 attacked Hillary Clinton 233 attacked ally nations 183 bragged about crowd size and applause 132 praised dictators 95 referred to a Trump business 40 promoted voter fraud conspiracy theories 36 called the news media the enemy of the people 16 referred to himself as everyones favorite president Show more Tweets from Jan. 20, 2017 to Oct. 15, 2019.\n\nIt is often by brute repetition. He has taken to Twitter to demand action 1,159 times on immigration and his border wall, a top priority, and 521 times on tariffs, another key agenda item. Twitter is an instrument of his foreign policy: He has praised dictators more than a hundred times, while complaining nearly twice as much about Americas traditional allies. Twitter is the Trump administrations de facto personnel office: The chief executive has announced the departures of more than two dozen top officials, some fired by tweet.\n\nMore than half of the presidents posts  5,889  have been attacks; no other category even comes close. His targets include the Russia investigation, a Federal Reserve that wont bow to his whims, previous administrations, entire cities that are led by Democrats, and adversaries from outspoken athletes to chief executives who displease him. Like no other modern president, Mr. Trump has publicly harangued businesses to advance his political goals and silence criticism, often with talk of government intervention. Using Twitter, he threatened Saturday Night Live with an investigation by the Federal Communications Commission and accused Amazon, led by Jeff Bezos, owner of The Washington Post, of cheating the United States Postal Service.\n\nAs much as anything, Twitter is the broadcast network for Mr. Trumps parallel political reality  the alternative facts he has used to spread conspiracy theories, fake information and extremist content, including material that energizes some of his base.\n\nMr. Trumps use of Twitter has accelerated sharply since the end of the special counsels Russia investigation and reached a new high as Democrats opened an impeachment inquiry, the analysis shows. He tweeted more than 500 times during the first two weeks of October, a pace that put him on track to triple his monthly average. (The Times analyzed Mr. Trumps tweets through Oct. 15. The total by the end of the month reached 11,887.)\n\nHis more than 66 million Twitter followers have become his private polling service, offering what he sees as validation for his performance in office. But fewer than one-fifth of his followers are voting-age Americans, according to a Times analysis of Pew Research national surveys of adults who use Twitter.\n\nThe White House press office declined to comment for this article and turned down an interview request with the president. Now, as Mr. Trump anticipates a bitter re-election battle and faces an impeachment inquiry by Democrats, the stakes are higher than ever before, and Twitter even more central to his presidency.\n\nHis top campaign aides are embracing the outrage that Mr. Trump stirs with his tweets to reinforce his anti-establishment brand and strengthen his bond with the fiercely loyal supporters who propelled him into office. And as public backing for impeachment grows, the president is using the platform to build a defensive echo chamber.\n\nMr. Trump tweeted his first attack as president on his third day in office. He fired off more than 1,100 attacks over the next year. The most frequent targets of Mr. Trumps ire are Democrats, news organizations and investigations  specifically the Russia and impeachment inquiries. Mr. Trumps attack on four Democratic congresswomen of color in July received a lot of attention, and blowback. It was not the first time he had used Twitter to attack minority groups  and it would not be the last. The president has tweeted more attacks so far this year than in the previous two years combined. In total, he has attacked at least 630 people and things in 5,889 tweets since taking office.\n\nWhile people around Mr. Trump acknowledge that his tweets can cause political damage, the president is confident in his mastery of Twitter.\n\nThis past week, as he announced that American Special Forces had killed Abu Bakr al-Baghdadi, the leader of the Islamic State, Mr. Trump noted the terror groups digital prowess. They use the internet better than almost anybody in the world, he said. Perhaps other than Donald Trump.\n\nPolicy via Twitter\n\nWith a single tweet last fall, Mr. Trump sent his administration into a tailspin. I must, in the strongest of terms, ask Mexico to stop this onslaught, he wrote in October 2018, angry about a caravan of migrants from Central America. If unable to do so I will call up the U.S. Military and CLOSE OUR SOUTHERN BORDER!\n\nMr. Trumps aides had tried for weeks to talk him out of shutting down the border  the logistics would be impossible and the economic pain extreme. The tweet prompted an emergency meeting down the hall from the Oval Office as aides scrambled to head off Mr. Trumps impulse, according to people familiar with the frantic scene. Like others in this article, they spoke on the condition of anonymity for fear of angering the president.\n\nThe aides succeeded in temporarily holding him off, but the tweet crystallized for cautious bureaucrats exactly what he wanted: to stop people from coming into the country. In the months that followed, Mr. Trumps threat helped to set off an effort inside the government to find ever more restrictive ways to block immigrants. Nearly six months later, Kirstjen Nielsen, the homeland security secretary, was still trying to prevent a border shutdown when the president brought her resistance to an end.\n\nKirstjen Nielsen, he tweeted, will be leaving her position.\n\nThis is governing in the Trump era. For President Barack Obama, a tweet about a presidential proposal might mark the conclusion of a long, deliberative process. For Mr. Trump, Twitter is often the beginning of how policy is made.\n\nSuddenly theres a tweet, and everything gets upended and you spent the week trying to defend something else, said Representative Peter King, Republican of New York. This person thrives on chaos. What we may find disconcerting or upsetting or whatever, it is actually what keeps him going.\n\nIn October 2017, Rex W. Tillerson, the presidents first secretary of state, was in China with a team of diplomats negotiating sanctions on Kim Jong-un, the North Korean leader, when Mr. Trump weighed in on Twitter. Mr. Tillerson was wasting his time trying to negotiate with Little Rocket Man, he wrote. Save your energy Rex, well do what has to be done!\n\nTwo months later, a Reuters headline blared that Mick Mulvaney, who then was Mr. Trumps new pick to lead the Consumer Financial Protection Bureau, had decided to put on ice sanctions against Wells Fargo for consumer abuses. It was little surprise: Mr. Mulvaney was an ally of the financial industry. But Mr. Trump had other ideas.\n\nFines and penalties against Wells Fargo Bank for their bad acts against their customers and others will not be dropped, as has incorrectly been reported, but will be pursued and, if anything, substantially increased, he tweeted.\n\nPolitical appointees at the bureau wanted to affirm Mr. Trumps desire publicly, despite longstanding policies against commenting on active investigations, according to former officials there. A spokesman for Mr. Mulvaney issued a statement saying only that he shares the presidents firm commitment to punishing bad actors and protecting American consumers.\n\nAccording to two people with direct knowledge of the Wells Fargo inquiry, career bureau officials took Mr. Trumps outburst as a green light to pursue aggressive negotiations with the bank, even as Mr. Mulvaneys team prepared to dial back penalties in other cases or shelve them. Wells Fargo ultimately agreed to a billion-dollar federal settlement, the bureaus largest-ever civil penalty.\n\nOver time, Mr. Trump has turned Twitter into a means of presidential communication as vital as a statement from the White House press secretary or an Oval Office address. The press secretary has not held a daily on-camera press briefing  a decades-long ritual of presidential messaging  since March. Instead, Mr. Trumps Twitter activity drives the day.\n\nAnd Mr. Trump has removed any doubt that his tweets carry the weight once reserved for more formal pronouncements.\n\nIn summer 2018, his aides repeatedly tried to reassure Republican lawmakers that the president backed their hard-line immigration bill, despite his remarks suggesting otherwise. But privately, Mr. Trump told several senators that there was only one certain sign of his support.\n\nIf I dont tweet it, he said, according to two former senior advisers, dont listen to my staff.\n\nAdapting a Platform\n\nWhen Mr. Trump entered office, aides were determined to rein in his itchy Twitter fingers.\n\nIn a series of informal conversations in early 2017, top White House officials discussed the possibility of a 15-minute delay on the presidents account, a technical change not unlike the five-second naughty-word system used by television networks. But, one former senior official said, they quickly abandoned the idea after recognizing the political peril if it leaked to the press  or to their boss.\n\nSeveral weeks later, a trio of close advisers presented Mr. Trump with another idea. Gary Cohn, the top economic adviser; Hope Hicks, the presidents director of strategic communications; and Rob Porter, his staff secretary, argued that they should see the tweets before he sent them out.\n\nMr. Trump was skeptical, worrying that delayed tweets would be irrelevant, according to a former White House official. But he agreed to a weeklong trial. Within 72 hours, the president had resumed tweeting from his golf club in Bedminster, N.J.\n\nThree thousand miles away, in Silicon Valley, similar conversations were unfolding at Twitters offices, where executives faced the same dilemma as Mr. Trumps inner circle: whether, and how, to restrain him.\n\nAt the time, Twitter lagged far behind larger competitors like Facebook. While popular among politicians and journalists, it was struggling financially. But the presidents incessant tweeting gave the company more currency.\n\nHis Twitter account often drove more impressions  a key company metric  than any other in the world. But some of his messages seemed to violate the companys policies against abuse and incitement.\n\nMany of the presidents tweets promoted conspiracy theories or tried to erode faith in democratic institutions. On his sixth day in office, he advanced the false claim that millions of people voted illegally in the 2016 election, depriving him of a popular-vote majority. He has tweeted 40 times about voter fraud and a rigged electoral system. Less than a month into his presidency, Mr. Trump tweeted that Democrats made up Russian interference in the 2016 election to justify Hillary Clintons loss. He then accused Mr. Obama of illegally wiretapping Trump Tower during the campaign. He has since sown doubt about Russian interference and the resulting investigations in more than 1,400 tweets. Mr. Trump has also used Twitter to attack the credibility of journalists, intelligence agencies and the judicial system. He has spoken of a nefarious deep state undermining his presidency, a judiciary that puts the country in peril and a news media that is the enemy of the people, a phrase historically used by autocrats. The president also pushed unfounded claims that Big Tech is biased against conservatives (102 tweets), stoked fears that caravans of migrants were going to invade the United States (43 tweets), and questioned the number of people killed in Puerto Rico as a result of Hurricane Maria (5 tweets). All told, Mr. Trump tweeted conspiratorial language more than 1,700 times.\n\nOn a now-defunct internal company message board known as Twitter Buzz, some left-leaning employees favored barring the president. Mr. Trumps behavior came up at almost every all-hands gathering and at many smaller meetings of executives. Some of them had set their phones to alert them whenever the president tweeted, according to a former employee who spoke on the condition of confidentiality.\n\nWhat I saw was a company coming to grips with an entirely new situation, a new level of scrutiny, a new level of vitriol, said Dianna Colasurdo, a former account executive on Twitters political advertising sales team, and working to adapt their policies in the moment to align with that.\n\nA turning point came in fall 2017, at the height of tensions with North Korea, when Mr. Trump tweeted that the rogue nation might not be around much longer! The countrys foreign minister called that a declaration of war. On Twitter, users wondered if the company would allow Mr. Trump to tweet his way into a nuclear conflict.\n\nThe response came the next day. Referring back to Mr. Trumps online declaration, Twitter announced in a tweet that it took newsworthiness into account when evaluating whether to remove a post that violated its policies.\n\nIn an interview, Twitter executives said that newsworthiness had long figured into the companys internal enforcement guidelines and that officials there had been formulating the announcement, which applied worldwide, months before Mr. Trumps North Korea tweet. But former employees said they understood the announcement to be Trump-driven. Twitter did not want to be in the business of censoring the president.\n\nLate in summer 2018, White House insiders tried again to curb Mr. Trumps use of social media, according to two former aides. After a series of over-the-top weeks of tweeting  including calling Omarosa Manigault Newman, his onetime aide, wacky and a lowlife  several advisers suggested he go just two days without Twitter and see what happened. Mr. Trump nodded, and then promptly discarded the advice.\n\nMr. King, who said most of his Republican colleagues wished the president would tweet less, added that whenever he had raised the issue with White House staff members, they shrugged helplessly.\n\nIts not going to stop, he recalled their saying. Forget it; weve all tried.\n\nSoon enough, Mr. Trump was as prolific as ever.\n\nOn Sept. 13, he mocked Jamie Dimon, the chief executive of JPMorgan Chase, for claiming he could beat Mr. Trump in an election. He doesnt have the aptitude or smarts & is a poor public speaker & nervous mess, the president tweeted. Over the next 12 hours, Mr. Trump attacked two former F.B.I. officials, accused The Wall Street Journal of getting a tariff story wrong and blasted former Secretary of State John Kerry for holding illegal meetings with Iran.\n\nBAD! he wrote.\n\nFirst Things First\n\nMr. Trumps Twitter habit is most intense in the morning, when he is in the White House residence, watching Fox News, scrolling through his Twitter mentions and turning the social media platform into what one aide called the ultimate weapon of mass dissemination.\n\nOf the attack tweets identified in the Times analysis, nearly half were sent between 6 a.m. and 10 a.m., hours that Mr. Trump spends mostly without advisers present.\n\nAfter waking early, Mr. Trump typically watches news shows recorded the previous night on his Super TiVo, several DVRs connected to a single remote. (The devices are set to record Lou Dobbs Tonight on Fox Business Network; Hannity, Tucker Carlson Tonight and The Story With Martha MacCallum on Fox News; and Anderson Cooper 360 on CNN.)\n\nHe takes in those shows, and the Fox & Friends morning program, then flings out comments on his iPhone. Then he watches as his tweets reverberate on cable channels and news sites.\n\nThe symbiotic relationship between Mr. Trump and Fox News is apparent through the presidents tweets. In fact, he praised the network in his first tweet on the first morning he woke up in the White House. He has since praised and promoted the network, individual shows and conservative news media personalities more than 750 times. Over all, at least 15 percent of the content in Mr. Trumps tweets seemed to come directly from Fox News and other conservative media outlets.\n\nEarly on Sept. 2  the start of a week in which he tweeted 198 times  the president sent a few benign tweets, then lashed out at Paul Krugman as a Failing New York Times columnist who never got it! Over the next 44 minutes, he fired off 10 more tweets. He disparaged Richard Trumka, the president of the A.F.L.-C.I.O. (Likes what we are doing until the cameras go on.) He called James B. Comey, the former F.B.I. director, and his dwindling group of friends liars and traitors. He railed against The Washington Post and four women of color in Congress who called themselves the Squad.\n\nAlmost every morning that week, Mr. Trump kicked off the day with an attack on one critic or another: the incompetent Mayor of London, or Bad actress Debra The Mess Messing  whom he accused of being racist  or the Fake News Media. He referred to conservative media outlets 45 times, berated the mainstream media 32 times and tweeted about conspiracy theories 12 times.\n\nSometimes the presidents apparent fury on Twitter is meant to troll his critics and get a rise out of them, many of his closest aides said. But they still brace themselves, knowing that they are likely to be blindsided by one of his tweets. Aides who gather for the early-morning staff meetings in the West Wing said their agenda was regularly blown up when their phones simultaneously went off with a tweet from the boss.\n\nOnce Mr. Trump arrives in the West Wing  usually after 10 a.m.  Dan Scavino, the White House social media director, takes control of the Twitter account, tweeting as @realDonaldTrump from his own phone or computer. Mr. Trump rarely tweets in front of others, those close to him say, because he does not like to wear the reading glasses he needs to see the screen.\n\nInstead, the president dictates tweets to Mr. Scavino, who sits in a closet-size room just off the Oval Office until Mr. Trump calls out Scavino! Often, he prints out suggested tweets in extra-large fonts for the president to sign off on. (A single-page article that Mr. Scavino recently printed out for him ran to six pages after the fonts were enlarged, according to one person who saw it.)\n\nMr. Scavinos role in Mr. Trumps Twitter machine has made him an unlikely White House power broker and the go-to person for aides, business executives, friends and lawmakers who want the president to tweet something. Ms. Conway noted what she called the hypocrisy of many Republicans who begged her to get Mr. Trump to stop tweeting during the 2016 campaign and now come to Mr. Scavino with suggestions. Mr. Scavino declined to be interviewed for this article.\n\nHe sometimes acts as a brake  or tries to  on the presidents tweeting impulses. When Mr. Trump started angrily posting about the Squad, Mr. Scavino told him it was a bad idea, according to an aide who witnessed the conversation. Along with Michael Dubke, who served as White House communications director for several months in 2017 and is from Buffalo, home of the famous chicken wings, Mr. Scavino presented some tweets to Mr. Trump in degrees of outrageousness: hot, medium or mild. Mr. Trump, said one former official who saw the proposed messages, always picked the most incendiary ones and often wanted to make them even more provocative.\n\nAnd while many of Mr. Trumps tweets are shoot-from-the-hip attacks, he chews over others for days or even weeks, waiting for just the right moment to maximize the reaction, aides say.\n\nHe plotted for days to tweet about Mika Brzezinski, the liberal co-host of the popular MSNBC morning program, according to former White House officials, before finally posting one morning in June 2017. He called her low I.Q. Crazy Mika and wrote that she had been bleeding badly from a face-lift during a New Years Eve party.\n\nIn October of last year, the president started telling his aides that he planned to denounce Stormy Daniels, a pornographic-film actress who claimed to have had an affair with him more than a decade earlier. He said he wanted to call her a horse face.\n\nSeveral current and former aides recalled telling Mr. Trump that it was a terrible idea and would renew accusations of misogyny against him. But he persisted.\n\nFinally, after watching a Fox News report days later about how a federal judge had thrown out a lawsuit by Ms. Daniels, the president tapped out the tweet.\n\nGreat, now I can go after Horseface and her 3rd rate lawyer in the Great State of Texas, he wrote.\n\nA Love of Likes\n\nFor Mr. Trump, Twitter reinforces his instincts about his performance as president.\n\nAfter a rally in Dallas in mid-October, Mr. Trumps aides prepared a large-type printout of tweets gushing over his speech that day, including one from Tomi Lahren, a Fox News commentator and the host of a show on the Fox Nation site. Mr. Trump scrawled a thank-you note on one copy to Ms. Lahren  who then tweeted a picture of the letter back at the president.\n\nAides said they often compiled positive feedback for Mr. Trump. He revels in the stream of praise from his most loyal followers, on paper or as he scrolls through his phone early in the morning and late at night. He considers his following to be like the ratings on a TV show, better than any approval poll. After one weekend Twitter spree, the president told Sarah Huckabee Sanders, his press secretary at the time, he had expected a tweet he was particularly proud of to get more response than it did, according to a former administration official. Ms. Sanders said that if he tweeted 60 times, people wouldnt pay as much attention, the official said.\n\nTwitter vs. Reality The polling firm YouGov asks Americans to rate Mr. Trumps tweets every day.

Retweets and deleted tweets are not included in the analysis. Source: YouGovBy The New York Times\n\nThe president is keenly aware of his number of followers and reluctant to acknowledge that any of them are not real. Mr. Trump has accused Twitter of political bias for its periodic purges of bot accounts across the platform, which have cost him  and other prominent users  hundreds of thousands of followers. When he met with the companys chief executive, Jack Dorsey, in April, Mr. Trump reportedly pressed him at length about the lost followers.\n\nThere is plenty of evidence that Mr. Trumps Twitter following may not be a reliable proxy for what the American people think of the job he is doing.\n\nIt is difficult, if not impossible, to determine with certainty how many of Mr. Trumps more than 66 million followers are fake. Some studies of his followers have estimated that a high proportion are likely to be automated bots, fake accounts or inactive. But even a conservative analysis by The Times found that nearly a third of them, about 22 million, included no biographical information and used the services default profile image  two signs the accounts may be rarely used or inactive. Fourteen percent have automatically generated user names, another indication that an account may not belong to a real person.\n\nEven if Mr. Trump is not shouting into the void on Twitter, he is often preaching to the converted. Data from Stirista, an analytics firm, shows that his followers tend to be the kind of users who are most likely to be his supporters  disproportionately older, white and male compared with Twitter users over all.\n\nAnd they constitute just a fraction of the electorate. According to the Times analysis of Pew data, only about four percent of American adults, or about 11 million people, follow him on Twitter. Those followers represent less that one-fifth of his total, the analysis shows.\n\nAccording to data from YouGov, which polls about most of the presidents tweets, some of the topics on which Mr. Trump got the most likes and retweets  jabs at the N.F.L., posts about the special counsels investigation, unfounded allegations of widespread voter fraud  poll poorly with the general public.\n\nBut people close to Mr. Trump said there was no dissuading him that the likes a tweet got were evidence that a decision or policy proposal was well received.\n\nLast December, after Mr. Trump announced plans to withdraw some troops from Syria, lawmakers came to the White House to argue against it. According to Politico, Mr. Trump responded by calling in Mr. Scavino.\n\nTell them how popular my policy is, Mr. Trump asked Mr. Scavino, who described for the lawmakers social media postings that had praised Mr. Trumps decision. Aides said that for Mr. Trump, his Twitter likes were proof that he had made the right call.\n\nThe reaction in the outside world was far less favorable. Within weeks, Mr. Trumps defense secretary and the special anti-ISIS envoy quit over the decision. American allies were enraged. More than two-thirds of the Senate voted to rebuke Mr. Trump, who agreed under pressure to keep the troops in Syria.\n\nAlmost a year later, American troops in Syria became an issue again after Mr. Trump appeared to give President Recep Tayyip Erdogan of Turkey a green light to invade Kurdish-controlled areas in northern Syria.\n\nThat resulted in another congressional rebuke for Mr. Trump and complaints even from loyal Republican allies. In subsequent days, Mr. Trump sought to defend himself on Twitter, alternately denying he had abandoned the Kurds and suggesting the United States had no stake in their safety, threatening Mr. Erdogan if the incursion continued and praising Turkey as an important trading partner.\n\nMany people took note of the back-and-forth, including Mr. Erdogan. When we take a look at Mr. Trumps Twitter posts, we can no longer follow them, the Turkish president told reporters mockingly in mid-October, according to Hurriyet, a Turkish newspaper. We cannot keep track.\n\n\n\nMr. Trump was not all negative. He also used Twitter to express admiration for people, from Aretha Franklin to Ryan Zinke. He often coupled his praise with a jab at someone else, or vice versa. He praised himself more than he did anyone else. All told, Mr. Trump sent 4,876 tweets that expressed approval or praise.\n\nA Tool for Re-Election\n\nIn the months ahead, the man tasked with winning Mr. Trump a second term is hoping to focus the presidents Twitter habit on its original purpose: connecting with voters.\n\nBrad Parscale, who served as Mr. Trumps digital director in 2016 and is now campaign manager, has worked closely with Mr. Scavino to shape perceptions of the president through social media. The two men speak a half-dozen times a day, according to people familiar with their interactions.\n\nMr. Parscale criticized Twitter after it announced on Wednesday that it would no longer allow paid political advertising on the platform, calling it yet another attempt to silence conservatives. But the change may benefit Mr. Trump: He has a far larger organic Twitter following than any of his likely Democratic opponents, and is therefore less reliant on paid ads to spread his message through the platform.\n\nWhile some campaign aides say Mr. Trumps tweets can be a distraction, they also view Twitter as an essential tool to present him as someone strong, willing to stand up to so-called political elites and what the president recently called the unholy alliance of corrupt Democrat politicians, deep-state bureaucrats and the fake-news media.\n\nThe aides seek to cultivate the image of a man who understands regular people. Mr. Trumps team believes that his unvarnished writing, poor punctuation and increasing profanity on Twitter signal authenticity  a contrast to the polished, vetted, often anodyne social media style of most candidates.\n\nTwitter, Ms. Conway said, is the presidents most potent weapon when it comes to bypassing the powerful people he believes have controlled the flow of information too long.\n\nIts the democratization of information, she said. Everyone receives Mr. Trumps tweets at once  the stay-at-home mom, the plumber working on the sink, the billionaire executive, the White House correspondent.\n\nThey all hear ping, she said, at the same time.'	b'How Trump Reshaped the Presidency in Over 11,000 Tweets'	2019-11-02	['Michael D.

Sources: Department of Labor; Ernie Tedeschi, Evercore ISI Research\n\nReplacement rates for each state are determined by dividing the average unemployment payment by the average 40-hour-a-week salary of those who receive unemployment benefits. Ernie Tedeschi, a former Treasury Department official and an economist at Evercore ISI Research, combined the new stimulus relief with each states average unemployment payment at the end of 2019 to estimate how much their replacement rates would increase.\n\nThe Massachusetts replacement rate will increase the smallest amount, he found, though it still doubles. Mississippi will have an 88 percentage-point jump, meaning workers there earning an average wage will make roughly $130 more in benefits.\n\nThese estimates, which reflect what tens of thousands of people around the country may now receive, come with caveats.\n\nAs large portions of the economy remain closed because of the outbreak, rendering more than 26 million people without jobs in a matter of weeks, no one knows for sure how wages and benefits for those receiving unemployment might change as more people enter the ranks.\n\nA provision of the stimulus package, for example, allows part-time and self-employed workers who would normally not qualify for unemployment to receive benefits. That will alter the makeup of the typical pool of people filing claims, not to mention the average benefit paid out.\n\nThe ultimate depth of the economic fallout from the virus remains unclear, as is the question of how long the government will be able to provide extra money to help workers who lost their jobs. And just because someone qualifies for unemployment doesnt mean they will receive it quickly.\n\nWhy $600 a week?\n\nWhen you add $600 to the national average unemployment payment  $371.88 a week at the end of 2019  the replacement rate goes from 38 percent to almost exactly 100 percent. In other words, that amount is what it would take for Congress to replace what the average American worker receiving unemployment would have earned.\n\nI would never two months ago have ever thought of advocating for 100 percent income replacement, said Michele Evermore, a senior policy analyst at the National Employment Law Project. But then when the pandemic hit, it was very different. We needed a policy mechanism to do something that unemployment insurance doesnt usually do, and thats keep people home.\n\nUnemployment benefits are typically meant to keep people afloat but stay low enough to incentivize them to find a job. Now, when seeking work may be both fruitless and dangerous, the incentives have nearly reversed.\n\nBut if the goal is to replace everyones wages, why not do it in a manner similar to how other countries are paying large percentages of worker salaries to prevent layoffs? While state unemployment systems are revealing their lack of preparedness for a crisis of this scale, the United States didnt have many options that already existed to quickly get money to the people who will need it, according to Ms. Evermore. The unemployment insurance system is the system we have, she said.\n\nAnd a $600 flat amount, rather than one relative to each persons income, on top of a states usual benefits, is perhaps the simplest possible policy to enact. State programs are already crashing just under the weight of new claims, Ms. Evermore said. To have them have to reprogram their computers to recalculate how benefits are paid would be completely disastrous.\n\nThe extra money will provide an uneven benefit\n\nWhile an extra $600 a week is enough to replace 100 percent of the average national income, the added benefit will differ depending on where people are and what they typically earn. Ms. Evermore described it as swinging an ax to hit an ant.\n\nA person who earns close to the average weekly wage will roughly get their salary replaced on unemployment, but low-wage workers who lose their jobs are more likely to end up making greater amounts than they were before.\n\nThese workers, many of whom work in hard-hit industries like restaurants and retailing, are also those who are more likely to be in urgent need of cash to pay for necessities. However, because minimum and maximum amounts of unemployment benefits vary by state, the proportion of people whose benefits could exceed their normal salaries will be vastly different by state.\n\nJust over half of workers in Arizona, which had a relatively high minimum benefit of $172 before the crisis, are estimated to make more on unemployment than if they were still working, according to Noah Williams, the director of Center for Research on the Wisconsin Economy at the University of Wisconsin-Madison.\n\nSmaller shares of workers stand to gain as much from unemployment benefits in other states, he found. Other factors, like the cost of living, will affect how far an extra $600 a week will stretch.\n\nStates with higher minimum weekly unemployment insurance benefits ... Minn. Wash. N.M. Mich. N.J. La. Ore. Kan. D.C. Ariz. Ark. N.Y. Ohio Mont. Idaho Hawaii Mass. $0 $25 $50 $75 $100 $125 $150 $175 ... tend to have a larger share of workers who make less in their jobs than they would on unemployment currently if they got the minimum benefit plus $600 Ark.

Wash. 15% 20% 25% 30% 35% 40% 45% 50% Note: Includes those working in January and February 2020, as well as part-time workers but not the self-employed. Under additional provisions of the stimulus bill, some workers who previously were not eligible, mostly those who are part-time or self-employed, will now qualify for unemployment, but will receive half the average weekly benefit plus the $600.  Sources: Current Population Survey and the Labor Department, via Noah Williams, Center for Research on the Wisconsin Economy, University of Wisconsin-Madison\n\nDespite the additional benefits, many people who qualify for unemployment have been stuck waiting to receive money as state systems struggle to process the sheer number of new claims. And as of now, the $600 weekly additional payments will expire at the end of July. Congress may opt to extend the deadline in a further stimulus bill if it seems that the economy is still struggling badly, though the cost of extending will add to the already high price tag of the policy.\n\nStates are paying their usual benefits while the funds for the $600 payments, as well as other unemployment benefits in the stimulus including expanding who will qualify and extending the duration by 13 weeks through the end of 2020, are provided by the federal government. As millions of people apply, the cost for both states and the federal government is enormous.\n\nBut Mr. Tedeschi said the $600-a-week policy, along with other relief measures that put cash directly in Americans pockets, like $1,200 payments for individuals and loans for businesses to keep staff on payroll, demonstrated a real commitment by the federal government to try to keep Americans afloat.\n\nNot only is it bold, he said, but in principle  we can argue about implementation  but in principle its actually bolder than what a lot of other advanced economies have done.'	b'The $600 Unemployment Booster Shot, State by State'	2020-04-23	['Ella Koeze']	['weekly', 'wages', 'rate', 'replacement', 'benefit', 'shot', 'workers', 'unemployment', 'benefits', 'average', 'booster', '600', 'state']	b'Before the coronavirus, people receiving unemployment benefits in most states got, on average, less than half their weekly salaries.\n Sources: Department of Labor; Ernie Tedeschi, Evercore ISI ResearchReplacement rates for each state are determined by dividing the average unemployment payment by the average 40-hour-a-week salary of those who receive unemployment benefits.\nThat will alter the makeup of the typical pool of people filing claims, not to mention the average benefit paid out.\nHowever, because minimum and maximum amounts of unemployment benefits vary by state, the proportion of people whose benefits could exceed their normal salaries will be vastly different by state.\nAnd as of now, the $600 weekly additional payments will expire at the end of July.'

You have murderers and drug addicts, they dont get nine years  nine years for doing something that nobody even can define what he did. Somebody said he put out a tweet, and the tweet, you based it on that. We have killers, we have murderers all over the place, nothing happens. And then they put a man in jail and destroy his life, his family, his wife, his children  nine years in jail. Its a disgrace. In the meantime, Comey walks around making book deals.
