LOS ANGELES (AP) — The U.S. government agency that oversees immigration applications is launching an office that will focus on identifying Americans who are suspected of cheating to get their citizenship and seek to strip them of it.

U.S. Citizenship and Immigration Services Director L. Francis Cissna told The Associated Press in an interview that his agency is hiring several dozen lawyers and immigration officers to review cases of immigrants who were ordered deported and are suspected of using fake identities to later get green cards and citizenship through naturalization.

Cissna said the cases would be referred to the Department of Justice, whose attorneys could then seek to remove the immigrants’ citizenship in civil court proceedings. In some cases, government attorneys could bring criminal charges related to fraud.

Until now, the agency has pursued cases as they arose but not through a coordinated effort, Cissna said. He said he hopes the agency’s new office in Los Angeles will be running by next year but added that investigating and referring cases for prosecution will likely take longer.

“We finally have a process in place to get to the bottom of all these bad cases and start denaturalizing people who should not have been naturalized in the first place,” Cissna said. “What we’re looking at, when you boil it all down, is potentially a few thousand cases.”

He declined to say how much the effort would cost but said it would be covered by the agency’s existing budget, which is funded by immigration application fees.

The push comes as the Trump administration has been cracking down on illegal immigration and taking steps to reduce legal immigration to the U.S.

Immigrants who become U.S. citizens can vote, serve on juries and obtain security clearance. Denaturalization — the process of removing that citizenship — is very rare.

The U.S. government began looking at potentially fraudulent naturalization cases a decade ago when a border officer detected about 200 people had used different identities to get green cards and citizenship after they were previously issued deportation orders.

In September 2016, an internal watchdog reported that 315,000 old fingerprint records for immigrants who had been deported or had criminal convictions had not been uploaded to a Department of Homeland Security database that is used to check immigrants’ identities. The same report found more than 800 immigrants had been ordered deported under one identity but became U.S. citizens under another.

Since then, the government has been uploading these older fingerprint records dating back to the 1990s and investigators have been evaluating cases for denaturalization.

Earlier this year, a judge revoked the citizenship of an Indian-born New Jersey man named Baljinder Singh after federal authorities accused him of using an alias to avoid deportation.

Authorities said Singh used a different name when he arrived in the United States in 1991. He was ordered deported the next year and a month later applied for asylum using the name Baljinder Singh before marrying an American, getting a green card and naturalizing.

Authorities said Singh did not mention his earlier deportation order when he applied for citizenship.

For many years, most U.S. efforts to strip immigrants of their citizenship focused largely on suspected war criminals who lied on their immigration paperwork, most notably former Nazis.

Toward the end of the Obama administration, officials began reviewing cases stemming from the fingerprints probe but prioritized those of naturalized citizens who had obtained security clearances, for example, to work at the Transportation Security Administration, said Muzaffar Chishti, director of the Migration Policy Institute’s office at New York University law school.

The Trump administration has made these investigations a bigger priority, he said. He said he expects cases will focus on deliberate fraud but some naturalized Americans may feel uneasy with the change.

“It is clearly true that we have entered a new chapter when a much larger number of people could feel vulnerable that their naturalization could be reopened,” Chishti said.

Since 1990, the Department of Justice has filed 305 civil denaturalization cases, according to statistics obtained by an immigration attorney in Kansas who has defended immigrants in these cases.

The attorney, Matthew Hoppock, agrees that deportees who lied to get citizenship should face consequences but worries other immigrants who might have made mistakes on their paperwork could get targeted and might not have the money to fight back in court.

Cissna said there are valid reasons why immigrants might be listed under multiple names, noting many Latin American immigrants have more than one surname. He said the U.S. government is not interested in that kind of minor discrepancy but wants to target people who deliberately changed their identities to dupe officials into granting immigration benefits.

“The people who are going to be targeted by this — they know full well who they are because they were ordered removed under a different identity and they intentionally lied about it when they applied for citizenship later on,” Cissna said. “It may be some time before we get to their case, but we’ll get to them.”"	APNewsBreak: US launches bid to find citizenship cheaters	2018-06-12 02:16:47+00:00	['Amy Taxin']	['agency', 'citizenship', 'launches', 'apnewsbreak', 'bid', 'identities', 'immigrants', 'ordered', 'immigration', 'cheaters', 'deported', 'using', 'cissna', 'cases']	"Citizenship and Immigration Services, sits during an interview in Los Angeles.

The life-threatening encounter was followed by a shocking medical bill: $153,000 for his treatment.

Todd Fassler was bitten earlier this month, reportedly while trying to pose for a selfie with the snake.

Like most snake bite victims, Fassler needed many doses of the antivenom CroFab, the only current drug available to counteract the potentially deadly snake venom. Bites from less poisonous snakes can require as little as three doses, but the most toxic poisonous snake bites can take dozens of doses. A California boy bitten by an highly toxic snake in 2012 required 42 vials of antivenom, and some patients need even more.

""The only effective treatment is antivenom,"" Dr. Keith Boesen, director of the Arizona Poison & Drug Information Center, told CBS News. ""There's blood tests we can do to determine the effect of the venom. Hospital bills can always be worked out or negotiated, but you can't really negotiate, other than prosthetics, the loss of part of your hand or your arm.""

Boesen said he knew of one snake bite victim in Arizona who required 74 vials of antivenom. The wholesale rate that hospitals pay to the manufacturer is $2,500 per vial and the markup to patients and insurance is much higher.

Fassler's bill included a line item of $83,341.25 for ""pharmacy"" to cover the antivenom, as reporter Dan Haggerty of KGTV in San Diego posted on Twitter. According to the original report, Fassler used up the antivenom supply from two hospitals.

Remember the Rattlesnake bite story I did Monday? Guy just sent me this pic of his bill. Uhhhhhhh..... pic.twitter.com/ahK2W9KxVg — Dan Haggerty (@10NewsHaggerty) July 16, 2015

Part of the reason the bill is large for most snake bite victims is because there is only one manufacturer and limited supply of the antivenom. In addition, a snake bite requires emergency room treatment, a few days in the hospital intensive care unit and sometimes therapy to recover function of the damaged body part.

Between 7,000 and 8,000 people are bitten by venomous snakes in the U.S. every year, according to the CDC and, of those, about 5 will die. The vast majority of people seek and have access to medical attention where they quickly receive antivenom, also known as antivenin. New antivenoms are in development including one recently approved by the FDA called Anavip, which Boesen's group helped test.

Boesen calls Arizona the ""evenomation capital of the country"" because they treat so many poisonous reptile and insect bites. The problem may become even more common as snakes become bolder searching for water in drought-stricken states in the West. He said the longer snake bite victims wait before receiving the antivenom, the more damage they will sustain.

For a person who is bitten, a snake bite start simply as puncture wounds, then the swelling and tissue die-off visibly creeps up the extremity. At the same time, the venom prevents the blood from clotting, causing bleeding problems and pronounced bruises. All those responses can cause serious and permanent damage to the bitten area.

""You'll see it progress an inch an hour. It's almost at a visible pace where you're watching your arm swell. We'll give antivenom to make that swelling stop, so it will stop progressing,"" said Boesen. ""There is no drug that can reverse the damage, we can only prevent it from getting worse.""

Death is very rare since antivenom has been available in the U.S. since the 1950s, he noted. But faster treatment will mean less damage and less time for the substantial recovery process, which can take weeks to months.

""So if someone, for example, doesn't have any insurance and is afraid of a hospital, I would be much more afraid of losing my hand or my arm than an expensive hospital bill,"" he said."

The decision was made after Murdoch’s channel refused to stop showing graphic video footage shot by the man who killed 49 people at two mosques in Christchurch, New Zealand, on Friday.

This was despite calls from the police urging anyone broadcasting the disturbing footage to stop circulating it. “Police are aware there is extremely distressing footage relating to the incident in Christchurch circulating online,” the New Zealand police said in a statement. “We would strongly urge that the link not be shared. We are working to have any footage removed.”

On Saturday, the New Zealand broadcaster announced the decision to pull the channel off the air. “We stand in support of our fellow New Zealanders and have made the decision to remove Sky News Australia from our platform until we are confident that the distressing footage from yesterday’s events will not be shared,” it said in a now-deleted Tweet.

Soon after in a new Tweet, the broadcaster changed its message saying, “We stand in support of our fellow New Zealanders and are working with our colleagues at @SkyNewsAust to ensure coverage doesn’t compromise ongoing investigations in NZ. We made the decision on Friday with Sky News Australia to replace their live news with sport.”

In a statement Friday, a Sky News Australia spokesman said: “Sky News in line with other broadcasters ran heavily edited footage that did not show the shootings or the victims.”

Sky News Australia didn’t air in New Zealand for five days, returning on Wednesday, March 20, according to Sky New Zealand. In the interim, the networks worked to change the perception created by Sky New Zealand that Sky News Australia had been forced off the air. Sky New Zealand emailed ThinkProgress on March 21, saying that it “would like to take the opportunity to correct statements made by us on Saturday.”

Sky New Zealand spokesperson Chris Major said in a statement that the networks decided together to pull the coverage shortly after the attacks. “It was a proactive and precautionary decision taken by both parties to ensure any live coverage or commentary taking place in Australia, outside of the NZ jurisdiction, did not compromise the NZ investigations and legal process,” the statement said.

Friday’s mass shooting was streamed to Facebook live video by the shooter for at least 17 minutes. YouTube, Reddit, Facebook, and Twitter have since been working to remove footage of the massacre, however, new copies of the video continue to be uploaded.

Officials in the U.K. have also called on the tech companies to stop the spread of this footage. “Online platforms have a responsibility not to do the terrorists’ work for them,” British Home Secretary Sajid Javid wrote in an article for The Daily Express on Saturday.

The alleged shooter was a self-described terrorist who wrote a manifesto about white supremacy, in which he praised President Donald Trump, calling the president a “symbol of renewed white identity and common purpose.” The manifesto also included mention of conservative pundits and other white supremacist killers.

But when asked whether he thought white supremacy was a growing danger around the world, Trump said he did not.

Meanwhile, Murdoch’s Fox News channel in the U.S. has aired several segments in which it positions conservatives as the victims, fearing the Friday massacre is being used as an attempt to limit their free speech.

“Already tonight, you are hearing calls in this country for curbs on free speech in response to the New Zealand massacre,” Fox host Tucker Carlson said Friday night. “Jeff Bezos’ newspaper wasted no time in blaming the entire thing [on] free flow of ideas that are, quote, ‘spreading hate.’ For the censorship class, more control is always the solution. Ban more people, squelch more ideas, go deplatform someone.”

Meanwhile, conservative radio host Rush Limbaugh promoted the theory that the whole event may be a false-flag perpetrated by someone on the left in order to blame conservatives.

CORRECTION: This article previously stated that Limbaugh was a radio host for Fox News. This has been updated to state he is a conservative radio host.

Spread the love

With roughly 1.5 million Floridians initially without electricity from the damage inflicted on Florida’s energy infrastructure, many in the Sunshine State are now questioning why it’s so difficult for people to utilize solar energy.

The simple answer is that one of the major electrical suppliers in the state – Florida Power and Light (FPL) – has utilized a massive lobbying campaign, directed at state lawmakers, to create legal barriers to disallow people from powering their own homes with solar panels without being subject to power companies.

In fact, current Florida state law makes it illegal.

This is the definition of crony capitalism. Companies lobby government officials, who then vote in favor of the corporate position — often for a quid pro quo in the form of financial support for the officials’ reelection campaign.

Any solar panels erected on a home must be connected to the local electrical power grid.

So, if you want to build an off the grid home – it is illegal to install solar panels on your home.

Just ask Robert Tarr who, according to WFTV, spent more than $60,000 for a system of 32 solar panels for his roof. But even though his house can generate enough electricity to run indefinitely without being hooked to a power company, legally, he still has to be connected and pay the Leesburg Electric Department for power he doesn’t even need.

“So you can be completely free of the grid?” Channel 9’s Jamie Holmes asked.

“Yes,” Tarr said.

“But they make you attach to the grid,” Holmes asked.

“Yes,” Tarr said. “I have a problem with it, OK? I think if I want to be totally independent of them, I should be allowed to be,” Tarr said.

If Tarr were to stop paying his electric bill, reports WFTV, he said Leesburg would shut off his power. City officials could also revoke his certificate of occupancy for not being hooked up to the system.

So, if this family wanted to defy the power company and remove his solar from the control of the power company, the government could revoke his certificate of occupancy—making it illegal for anyone to live in the home!

Rest assured that any attempt to resist one’s removal from said home would be met with police force and violent escalation.

The extreme crony capitalism at work in Florida is astounding, and nothing less than draconian.

With roof-mounted solar panels becoming an increasingly inexpensive means of producing cheap renewable energy, the fact that the state panders to the old energy dinosaurs to stifle consumer-friendly innovation is nothing less than infuriating.

In fact, Project Drawdown, which is a broad coalition of researchers, scientists, graduate students, PhDs, post-docs, policymakers, business leaders and activists that have assembled to find and present the best available information on climate solutions in order to describe their beneficial financial, social and environmental impact over the next thirty years has found that widespread solar use would save $3.5 trillion dollars and reduce carbon dioxide emissions by 24.6 billion tons over the next 30 years if utilized.

Ironically, solar panels would make for a completely self-sustaining method of energy production if the local electrical grid were to fail during a crisis — like a hurricane.

Make no mistake, the old energy oligarchy simply refuses to be cut out of potential profits, which is what happens when you no longer need to rely on them for power needs and possess the ability to power your own home.

Instead of owning their greedy intentions, companies like FPL, instead, attempt to rationalize their actions through absurd explanations.

“Operating your renewable system without the bi-directional meter can result in an inaccurate meter reading causing your bill to increase,” FPL claims, which essentially means that for proactively approaching your energy needs, it could result in a potential glitch in their system that will charge you more money on your electrical bill.

They also recommend that all homes powered by FPL, that have solar panels, be connected through the same electrical wiring, and “the [renewable] system must shut down when FPL’s grid shuts down in order to prevent dangerous back feed on FPL’s grid. This is required to protect FPL employees who may be working on the grid.”

Ironically, FPL is basically saying that their workers could potentially be electrocuted if they’re doing maintenance on the grid during an inadvertent or scheduled shutdown, while completely ignoring the fact that there would be NO risk to those workers if the home wasn’t legally required to be connected to the grid!

If Florida residents were not forced to have their solar panels connected to the electrical grid, which FPL lobbied state lawmakers to require, there would be absolutely no problem.

Aside from the clear environmental and security benefits of producing your own energy, becoming a leader in the solar industry would be a boon for the economy in the Sunshine State.

Sadly, it’s these crony capitalist policies that leave states like Florida in the dark.

Short-sighted policies like these have definitely not served the people of Florida, to which the 1.5 million Floridians without power can most certainly attest.

Please share this story to expose how governmental corruption picks the winners and losers and decimates a free market that could much better serve the people!

The country has a population of six million, but there are estimated to be at least two million publicly-owned firearms, including about 600,000 automatic rifles and 500,000 pistols.

This is in a very large part due to Switzerland's unique system of national defence, developed over the centuries.

Instead of a standing, full-time army, the country requires every man to undergo some form of military training for a few days or weeks a year throughout most of their lives.

Between the ages of 21 and 32 men serve as frontline troops. They are given an M-57 assault rifle and 24 rounds of ammunition which they are required to keep at home.

Once discharged, men serve in the Swiss equivalent of the US National Guard, but still have to train occasionally and are given bolt rifles. Women do not have to own firearms, but are encouraged to.

Few restrictions

In addition to the government-provided arms, there are few restrictions on buying weapons. Some cantons restrict the carrying of firearms - others do not.

The government even sells off surplus weaponry to the general public when new equipment is introduced.

Guns and shooting are popular national pastimes. More than 200,000 Swiss attend national annual marksmanship competitions.

But despite the wide ownership and availability of guns, violent crime is extremely rare. There are only minimal controls at public buildings and politicians rarely have police protection.

Mark Eisenecker, a sociologist from the University of Zurich told BBC News Online that guns are ""anchored"" in Swiss society and that gun control is simply not an issue.

Some pro-gun groups argue that Switzerland proves their contention that there is not necessarily a link between the availability of guns and violent crime in society.

Low crime

But other commentators suggest that the reality is more complicated.

Switzerland is one of the world's richest countries, but has remained relatively isolated.

It has none of the social problems associated with gun crime seen in other industrialised countries like drugs or urban deprivation.

Despite the lack of rigid gun laws, firearms are strictly connected to a sense of collective responsibility.

From an early age Swiss men and women associate weaponry with being called to defend their country."

by Ellen Makkai FOR RELEASE: TUESDAY, NOVEMBER 27, 2001, AND THEREAFTER







HARRY THE WIZ IS THE WRONG BIZ







There is a peculiar people out there -- anti-Harry Potter parents.



J.K. Rowling's highly readable and imaginative Harry Potter series -- about a young wizard's tutelage and mastery of the black arts -- is a publishing phenomenon. But these parents see him as Satan's secret agent sent to surreptitiously ensnare souls.



The world has morphed into Planet Potter. The series has been translated into 42 languages, including Zulu. Kids wear Potter PJs, eat from Potter plates and sleep on Potter pillows.



Young witch/wizard wannabes wait in 'round the block lines for the film version of Harry Potter and the Sorcerer's Stone. ""I want to be a wizard,"" responded the two young sons of actor Rob Lowe when asked what they gleaned from the movie.



San Diego movie critic Holly McClure lauds the movie's excellence but says bluntly both print and celluloid versions ""Lay it out there; it's about witchcraft.""



Carol Rookwood, head teacher in a Church of England school, banned Potter saying, ""The Bible is clear about issues such as witchcraft, demons, the devil and the occult. It says clearly from Genesis to Revelation that they are real, powerful and dangerous ... (we) should have nothing to do with them.""



But for parents vexed by video games, Harry Potter is the Holy Grail. Kids once hunched in front of Sony Play Stations now curl up with Harry, reading the voluminous texts for hours on end.



The IRS recognizes certain witchcraft sects as religions but church/state issues have been jettisoned here. Public school teachers read Harry Potter aloud as captivated students sit transfixed. Thomas Jefferson Middle School in Port Washington, Wis., sent 500 students to the film.



Still, headlines read, ""Parents Protest Potter."" According to a July 2000 Gallup Poll, Harry gets nixed by 8 percent of parents with children under 18. ""The books have a serious tone of death ... of evil,"" says Columbia, S.C., parent, Elizabeth Mounce, when addressing the state Board of Education.



To some, Harry is a Trojan horse -- a clever vehicle able to implant a sort of satanic receptor in the human soul -- making youngsters vulnerable to demonic activity and possible infestation. Who can forget Linda Blair in ""The Exorcist""?



""The power of Satan ... is very dangerous, and our children have gone into it,"" says Caryl Matrisciana, occult expert and producer of the video ""Harry Potter: Witchcraft Repackaged.""



Potter fans argue that Harry cavorts in a realm similar to that in C.S. Lewis' Chronicles of Narnia. But the Lewis' allegory draws readers to the beneficent Judaic/Christian God, whereas Harry has no sovereign governing his use of self-seeking manipulative power.



Contrast Harry Potter and ""Idylls of the King,"" Alfred Lord Tennyson's poetic masterpiece interpreting Arthurian Legend. Tennyson's sorcery is recognized as mythological evil while much of Harry's hocus-pocus -- packaged as harmless fantasy -- is genuine. Necromancy, blood sacrifice, incantations, and so on, mirror actual occult ritual.



""There is a tremendous smoke screen in the (Potter) PR machinery,"" Matriciana says. ""Does being packaged as 'fantasy' mean we're not to question content?""



Rowling exhaustively researched the occult to better animate her characters' skills. According to Iowa Licensed Master Social Worker, William Schnoebelen, former Church of Satan member, Potter characters execute satanic ceremony and technique as practiced today.



Schnoebelen, also a former instructor of witchcraft, says Potter imitators are blind to the entities that respond from ""an unknown beguiling arena. It seems so enchantingly fun and innocent, but they are trafficking in evil spirits. The books definitely draw kids to witchcraft.""



High Priest Egan of The First Church of Satan in Salem, Mass., celebrates Harry's contribution, saying, ""Harry is an absolute godsend ... we've had more applicants than we can handle lately.""



Former Satanic mystic, Johanna Michaelson, says, ""There is a beautiful side of evil -- deceptive, subtle, adorned with all manner of spiritual refinements, but no less from the pit of hell than that which is blatantly satanic.""



Witchcraft and sorcery permeate Rowling's books and parents would do well to attempt the impossible; steer kids clear of Hogwarts School of Witchcraft and Wizardry.



At the very least, children determined to explore Harry Potter's realm should be grounded in a flame-retardant faith, that enables them to ride the lightning and still walk away unscathed.

On June 27, 2017, my son Alec was found dead, alone in his Minneapolis apartment. It shouldn’t have happened.

Alec had Type 1 diabetes, a serious condition that is manageable with access to insulin and proper supplies. But Alec turned 26 years old on May 20 of last year, which meant that his coverage under my health insurance policy ended a few days later. Alec had a full-time, steady job. But, like a lot of US workers, he did not have good health insurance offered through his employer.

For Alec and others with diabetes, this presents a deadly situation. Many people with type 2 diabetes need regular access to insulin to live; all persons with Type 1 do. Insulin is a 95-year-old drug whose discoverers sold their patents for $1 each, but its price has increased over 1,000 percent since the late 1990s. A vial of the same insulin that was once sold for around $25 can now cost patients like Alec nearly $300, and many people need multiple vials per month to survive.

The pharmaceutical companies that sell insulin won’t disclose any details, but it is likely that this same vial is manufactured for just a few dollars. Which means that those companies are making huge profits and paying huge CEO salaries. The three insulin manufacturers have raised their prices in lockstep for many years now, prompting a class-action lawsuit and criminal investigations into collusion. Additionally, the insurance industry is also complicit in the drug pricing scheme.

For Alec, this meant that his insulin and supplies cost almost $1,300 a month. He and I together researched for months in advance about his health insurance options. They weren’t good. The best plan we found would cost him $450 a month for the premium with a whopping $7,600 deductible. That deductible meant he would be paying out-of-pocket for his medicine for many months anyway, so he decided to go without the plan until he could find a different job with benefits.

With the cost so high, Alec tried to ration his insulin. I have since learned that this is not uncommon. Globally, half of the people who need insulin can’t reliably get access to it. With 6 million people in the US insulin-dependent, and nearly 40 percent of Americans uninsured or facing high deductibles that leave their medicine costs uncovered, the crisis is occurring right here, too.

Endocrinologists here in the US report that as many as one in five of their patients are not able to afford their insulin. For many persons with diabetes, that means they land in the emergency room with diabetic ketoacidosis. For others, like Alec, they never get there. Just 27 days after his coverage under my insurance ended, I received the call no parent ever wants to get.

As you would imagine, my family and I are still grieving. But I’ve decided that sharing our story may help prevent someone else from going through what Alec did. There are a lot of proposals to increase access to affordable health coverage and to lower the price of medicines, including forcing drug companies to be transparent about their research costs and profits, and allowing Medicare to negotiate down the price it pays for prescription drugs. To me, they all boil down to one theme: Access to insulin, and other life-essential medicines, is a human right.

The inventor of insulin, Frederick Banting, believed that. When he was asked why he gave away his patent for $1, he replied, “Because insulin does not belong to me. It belongs to the world.” That spirit is being violated today, where there are thousands of GoFundMe pages devoted to people like Alec, desperately trying to cobble together the money they need for their monthly insulin.

There are a lot of good people working to change this, including US lawmakers. But it seems clear to me that significant movement toward universal access to essential medicines will only come when the affected patients and their loved ones help lead the way.

So I was happy to see that people with diabetes in Nevada were able to help push through a law that requires transparency in insulin pricing there. And that is why I support the patient group T1International’s demand that insulin manufacturers disclose the profits they are making off of each vial and reverse their unjustified price increases. That is why I shared Alec’s story at a recent demonstration led by Type 1 diabetes patients outside the headquarters of insulin manufacturer Eli Lilly and Company, demanding increased transparency and lower prices.

As I told the patients and activists gathered there, my Alec was the best son anyone could ask for. He was loved by so many and I am so proud to have been his mom for the short 26 years I had with him. But he should still be here. I should not have buried my son at 26 because he couldn’t afford the one thing in life that was created to keep him alive."

A Texas turkey farm employee is now under quarantine after he tested positive for the Ebola virus. Texas Prime Turkey Farm, the largest supplier of turkeys in the United States, has been ordered by the CDC to quarantine over 250,000 holiday turkeys. The CDC has confirmed 3,000 turkeys have tested positive for the virus since Friday’s incident.

According to investigators, long time employee Philip Canseco was seen vomiting in the facilities restroom three days prior to the incident on Friday. “I was passing by the restroom, when I heard somebody throwing up inside,” said one Texas Prime Turkey Farm employee. “I opened the door and looked inside and saw Canseco throwing up in one of the urinals. I asked him if he was okay, he said yes, and I left. I didn’t want to get close to him and get sick.”

Management confirmed that Canseco worked three full work days at the facility with flu-like symptoms, before passing out unconscious with a fever of 106°. Due to his symptoms, he was rushed to a local hazmat tent where he tested positive for the Ebola virus. The CDC reports an additional 7 coworkers are being quarantined and tested. However, they have not released those results as of yet.

The facility has been ordered by the CDC to burn their entire flock of turkeys, over 250,000. Texas Prime Turkey Farm is requesting permission from the state of Texas to send the shipment of incinerated turkey ashes to Veolia’s Port Arthur environmental waste facility. This facility has already accepted one shipment of Ebola waste from household goods where Thomas Eric Duncan had stayed. Duncan was the first man to die of Ebola on US soil.

Activists are protesting the shipments of contaminated Ebola waste to their community. “We feel every precaution should be taken to protect our community, our children and our elderly. We are not a dumping ground for the nations, or the world’s bio waste.”

Plant manager Mitch Osborne said on Saturday that even though no contract has yet been signed, the plant will likely receive the second shipment of contaminated Ebola waste. “It is a safe and sound process,” Osborne said. “I am not going to place my employees in harms way, or the community. The company is here to improve the environment and I believe we are doing a pretty darn good job of that. I believe we are doing the right and safe thing.”

A spokesperson for Texas Prime Turkey Farm said there is a good chance Ebola turkeys may have already shipped out to major suppliers for distribution. Each retailer will have to perform recalls individually if they feel they have received a contaminated shipment.

https://www.snopes.com/fact-check/social-insecurity/	president eisenhower once observed that a few texas oil millionaires wanted to abolish social security.	true	['social security']		David Mikkelson	['http://web.archive.org/web/20051124190902/http://www.eisenhowermemorial.org/presidential-papers/first-term/documents/1147.cfm']	http://web.archive.org/web/20051124190902/http://www.eisenhowermemorial.org/presidential-papers/first-term/documents/1147.cfm	http://web.archive.org/	"Dear Ed:1 I think that such answer as I can give to your letter of November first will be arranged in reverse order--at least I shall comment first on your final paragraph.

You keep harping on the Constitution; I should like to point out that the meaning of the Constitution is what the Supreme Court says it is. Consequently no powers are exercised by the Federal government except where such exercise is approved by the Supreme Court (lawyers) of the land.2

I admit that the Supreme Court has in the past made certain decisions in this general field that have been astonishing to me. A recent case in point was the decision in the Phillips case.3 Others, and older ones, involved ""interstate commerce.""4 But until some future Supreme Court decision denies the right and responsibility of the Federal government to do certain things, you cannot possibly remove them from the political activities of the Federal government.

Now it is true that I believe this country is following a dangerous trend when it permits too great a degree of centralization of governmental functions. I oppose this--in some instances the fight is a rather desperate one. But to attain any success it is quite clear that the Federal government cannot avoid or escape responsibilities which the mass of the people firmly believe should be undertaken by it. The political processes of our country are such that if a rule of reason is not applied in this effort, we will lose everything--even to a possible and drastic change in the Constitution. This is what I mean by my constant insistence upon ""moderation"" in government. Should any political party attempt to abolish social security, unemployment insurance, and eliminate labor laws and farm programs, you would not hear of that party again in our political history. There is a tiny splinter group, of course, that believes you can do these things. Among them are H. L. Hunt (you possibly know his background), a few other Texas oil millionaires, and an occasional politician or business man from other areas.5 Their number is negligible and they are stupid.

To say, therefore, that in some instances the policies of this Administration have not been radically changed from those of the last is perfectly true.6 Both Administrations levied taxes, both maintained military establishments, customs officials, and so on.

But in all governmental fields of action a combination of purpose, procedure and objectives must be considered if you are to get a true evaluation of the relative merits.

You say that the foreign policy of the two Administrations is the same. I suppose that even the most violent critic would agree that it is well for us to have friends in the world, to encourage them to oppose communism both in its external form and in its internal manifestations, to promote trade in the world that would be mutually profitable between us and our friends (and it must be mutually profitable or it will dry up), and to attempt the promotion of peace in the world, negotiating from a position of moral, intellectual, economic and military strength.

No matter what the party is in power, it must perforce follow a program that is related to these general purposes and aspirations. But the great difference is in how it is done and, particularly, in the results achieved.

A year ago last January we were in imminent danger of losing Iran, and sixty percent of the known oil reserves of the world.7 You may have forgotten this. Lots of people have. But there has been no greater threat that has in recent years overhung the free world. That threat has been largely, if not totally, removed. I could name at least a half dozen other spots of the same character.

This being true, how can anyone be so unaware of what is happening as to say that this Administration has conducted foreign affairs under the same policies as did the former Administration? As a matter of fact, if you will press any individual who brings to you all these strictures and comments, I venture that your experience will be the same as mine. That experience is that these individuals have no idea of what the ""foreign policy"" of the previous Administration was and what the present one is. They have heard certain slogans, such as ""give away programs."" They have no slightest idea as to what has been the effect of these programs in sustaining American security and prosperity. Moreover, they have no idea whatsoever as to comparative size of them now as compared to even two or three years ago.

You say that these critics also complain about the continuance of ""controls,"" presumably over our economy. There is nothing in your letter that shows such complete ignorance as to what has actually happened as does this term. When we came into office there were Federal controls exercised over prices, wages, rents, as well as over the allocation and use of raw materials. The first thing this Administration did was to set about the elimination of those controls. This it did amid the most dire predictions of disaster, ""run away"" inflation, and so on and so on. We were proved right, but I must say that if the people of the United States do not even remember what took place, one is almost tempted to regret the agony of study, analysis and decision that was then our daily ration.

You also talk about ""bad political advice"" I am getting. I always assumed that lawyers attempted accuracy in their statements. How do you know that I am getting any political advice? Next, if I do get political advice, how do you know that it is not weighted in the direction that you seem to think it should be--although I am tempted at times to believe that you are just thrashing around rather than thinking anything through to a definite conclusion? So how can you say I am getting ""bad"" advice; why don't you just assume I am stupid, trying to wreck the nation, and leave our Constitution in tatters?

I assure you that you have more reason, based on sixty-four years of contact, to say this than you do to make the bland assumption that I am surrounded by a group of Machiavellian characters who are seeking the downfall of the United States and the ascendancy of socialism and communism in the world. Incidentally, I notice that everybody seems to be a great Constitutionalist until his idea of what the Constitution ought to do is violated--then he suddenly becomes very strong for amendments or some peculiar and individualistic interpretation of his own.

Finally, I must assure you again that I am delighted to get your own honest criticisms, particularly if you will only take the trouble to lay down the facts on which you reach what seem to me to be some remarkable conclusions. But the mere repetition of aphorisms and political slogans and newspaper headlines leaves me cold.

I am sorry you are not going to be at Abilene.8 It would be easier to tell you these things than to write them--except that by this method I hope to make you do a little thinking rather than devote yourself just to the winning of a noisy argument. As ever

P.S. I attach a paragraph and a cartoon that came to me in the same mail as did your letter. At least it represents a different viewpoint.

Reaction to the attacks and expressions of support for the United States continue to be received.

What follows is a first-person account of a day at sea aboard one of the Navy's newest guided missile destroyers, USS Winston S. Churchill (DDG 81) in the days following the attacks. This account was in an e-mail sent home by one of Churchill's officers.

"" We have seen the articles and the photographs [of the attacks], and they are sickening. Being isolated as we are, I don't think we appreciate the full scope of what is happening back home, but we are definitely feeling the effects.

""About two hours ago the junior officers were called to the bridge to conduct Shiphandling drills. We were about to do a man overboard when we got a call from Lutjens (D 185), a German warship that was moored ahead of us on the pier in Plymouth, England.

""While in port, Winston S. Churchill and Lutjens got together for a sports day/cookout on our fantail, and we made some pretty good friends. Now at sea they called over on bridge-to-bridge, requesting to pass us close up on our port side, to say goodbye. We prepared to render them honors on the bridge wing, and the captain told the crew to come topside to wish them farewell.

""As they were making their approach, our conning officer ... announced that they were flying an American flag. As they came even closer, we saw that it was flying at half-mast. The bridge wing was crowded with people as the Boatswain's Mate blew two whistles — Attention to Port.""

Lutjens ""came up alongside and we saw that the entire crew of the German ship were manning the rails, in their dress blues. They had made up a sign that was displayed on the side that read ""We Stand By You"". Needless to say there was not a dry eye on the bridge as they stayed alongside us for a few minutes and we cut our salutes. It was probably the most powerful thing I have seen in my entire life and more than a few of us fought to retain our composure.

""It was a beautiful day outside today. We are no longer at liberty to divulge over unsecure e-mail our location, but we could not have asked for a finer day at sea. The German Navy did an incredible thing for this crew, and it has truly been the highest point in the days since the attacks. It's amazing to think that only a half-century ago things were quite different, and to see the unity that is being demonstrated throughout Europe and the world makes us all feel proud to be out here doing our job.

""After [Lutjens] pulled away and we prepared to begin our man overboard drills, the Officer of the Deck turned to me and said ""I'm staying Navy.""

DDG 81 is named in honor of Sir Winston Spencer Churchill (1874-1965), best known for his courageous leadership as British prime minister during World War II.

Back in Washington, D.C., in its daily accounting Monday, the Department of Defense has listed a total of 34 Navy personnel — 15 officers, 13 enlisted personnel, four DoN civilians and two contractors — have been confirmed killed in the Sept. 11 attack on the Pentagon by terrorists. The Navy personnel are part of the approximately 125 persons killed or unaccounted for as listed by the Department of Defense.

As recovered, remains are being transported to the Department of Defense mortuary at Dover Air Force Base, Del., where they will be formally identified. To date, 118 remains have been recovered. Meanwhile, search and rescue continue at the Pentagon.

“I don’t hear other candidates reminding Americans that Muslims killed Jesus. Is this yet another thing Hillary has conveniently forgotten? Lyin’ Ted Cruz says he’s a Bible man but he hasn’t mentioned it either – has he even read page 545??”

“The reason no one talks about the Muslims killing Jesus is political correctness, plain and simple. Well I’ve never worried about being political, and I’ve never worried about being correct, I just say what I think” said Trump.

Trump’s comments saw his popularity soar to new highs, and it now seems increasingly likely that come November, the White House will turn a hideous shade of orange.

Tonight on AC360°, Charles Ramsey – the man who freed Amanda Berry, Georgina DeJesus and Michele Knight, spoke with Anderson Cooper.

Ramsey tells Cooper that his neighbor of about a year was “cool, he was no freak of nature” but yesterday he heard a girl scream “like a car had hit her kid.” Amanda Berry told him “I’ve been trapped in here and he won’t let me out. It’s me and my baby.” Berry, he tells Cooper “was well-groomed. She didn’t look like she was kidnapped… That’s what threw me off.”

Ramsey says he doesn’t feel like a hero, and when asked about a rumored reward, he shows Cooper his paycheck and says “give it to them (the girls).”

Video link to the interview and rough transcript below. Please credit all usage to Anderson Cooper 360°

THIS IS A RUSH FDCH TRANSCRIPT. IT MAY NOT BE IN ITS FINAL FORM AND MAY BE UPDATED.

COOPER: Well, I just came back from interviewing Charles Ramsey just a short time ago. Here’s some of that interview.

(BEGIN VIDEOTAPE)

COOPER: And so you moved in about a year ago. You’d seen Ariel Castro around, right?

CHARLES RAMSEY: When I moved there, only because he was my neighbor.

COOPER: Right.

RAMSEY: You know what I mean?

COOPER: What was he like?

RAMSEY: Cool. He wasn’t no freak of nature. He was like me and you, because he talked about the same things you talk about.

COOPER: Right.

RAMSEY: You talk about you. You know what I mean? You know, regular stuff, bro.

COOPER: So yesterday, what happened?

RAMSEY: I’m going to tell it all. Around 3:00, I was on my porch and the mailman put his mail in my mail. I looked at it like here’s his mail when he come home. Couple of minutes later, he pulled up. He checked the mailbox, grabbed his paper. Before he went in the house, I said Ariel, here goes your mail. We just had the same conversation when I hand him the mail. He said, they can’t get it right. I said, damn postal service. That’s it.

He left. I jumped on my bike, went to McDonald’s. Came back home, I’m in my house, but I’m in the living room and I’m right by the front door, because I’m looking out the front door, and man, this girl screamed like a car had hit a kid, which made me, you know, stop eating, what the hell was that. You know, so when I got up, I saw this — my neighbor across the street, he run across the street and I’m, like — I’m thinking, where you going, because ain’t nobody next door because I just saw Ariel leave.

And I know ain’t nobody over there. Heard that girl scream and saw him run across the street, and I went outside and wondered what he was doing, and — Amanda said, I’m stuck in here, help get me out. So he — guy don’t know English that well or panicked, he just looked at me and it’s a girl. And that’s all he did. So here I come with my, you know, half eaten Big Mac and I looked and I said well, what’s up.

And she’s like I’ve been trapped in here, he won’t let me out, me and my baby. I said well, we ain’t going to talk no more, come on. I’m trying to get the door open, I can’t, because he torture chambered it some kind of way and locked it up, right? So I did what I had to do and kicked the bottom of the door, and she crawled out of it. She grabs her baby, which threw me off, all right, so fine. I got some girl and her kid.

COOPER: What did she look like? I mean, what was she wearing?

RAMSEY: Jumpsuit. She had a white tank top on, rings on, mascara. You know, she was well groomed. She didn’t look like she was kidnapped. That’s what I’m saying. That’s what threw me off. She was like I’m in here trapped. I’m like, well, you don’t look kidnapped so maybe you got a boyfriend problem. But I’m thinking I know who lives here and he’s 50 something. You can’t be the boyfriend problem. You know? It can’t be him. Maybe you’re dating his son.

COOPER: And you’d never seen her before?

RAMSEY: Bro —

COOPER: In the year that you had been there?

RAMSEY: Bro, that man, listen, never. That woman didn’t come out the house. The only kids that came out the house were two little girls. They played in the backyard. He had two dogs and my — where I live naturally is next door, my bedroom was upstairs so when I hear kids playing, I know it’s them. They did the same thing, play in the backyard for a couple of hours, go back in the house. Same thing every day.

The neighborhood knows them as his grandchildren. So no big deal. He had his grandkids over all the time, I thought.

COOPER: Amanda Berry then, what, asked to call 911?

RAMSEY: Mm-hmm. And I took her to my house. Now I’m nervous as hell so I’m fumbling with my phone, so I finally get it right. She can’t wait and I don’t blame her. So what I do was tell her go across the street and use their phone. Now we’re both calling 911. Now she gets through and I get through. She deal with a moron, me, too.

COOPER: You said there — what do you mean, a moron?

RAMSEY: Idiot.

COOPER: I heard the 911 call for her —

RAMSEY: Imbecile.

COOPER: And the woman kept —

RAMSEY: Shouldn’t have a damn job.

COOPER: The woman was like hang up and wait for the police.

RAMSEY: Really. How about stay on and I will talk to you until they get there?

COOPER: Right.

(END VIDEOTAPE)

COOPER: That’s Charles Ramsey. I’ll have more of my interview with Charles Ramsey after this break.

Let us know what you think. Follow me on Twitter right now @andersoncooper. So many questions still to be answered here.

Also ahead, we’re going to hear from a young woman who along with her friends once called 911 because they say they saw a naked woman in the suspect’s backyard. She says police thought they were joking, didn’t take it seriously. We’ll be right back.

(COMMERCIAL BREAK)

(BEGIN VIDEO CLIP)

RAMSEY: Heard her screaming, I’m eating my McDonald’s, I come outside, and I see this girl going nuts trying to get out of a house. So I go on the porch. I go on the porch and she says, help me get out, I’ve been here a long time. So you know, I figured it’s a domestic violence dispute. So I opened the door and we can’t get in that way because how the door is, it’s so much that a body can’t fit through, only your hand. So we kicked the bottom and she comes out with a little girl, and she says call 911, my name is Amanda Berry.

(END VIDEO CLIP)

COOPER: If not for the actions of Charles Ramsey and another neighbor who helped him, the three women may still be in that house here in Cleveland.

Here’s more of my exclusive interview with Charles Ramsey.

(BEGIN VIDEOTAPE)

COOPER: So you call 911.

RAMSEY: Sure did.

COOPER: How quickly did the police get there?

RAMSEY: You know what, they got there so fast because I said moron. Because I said hey, Amanda Berry is right in front of me right now. Here’s what she got on and I told him white tank top, blue sweatpants, nice tennis shoes, nice ponytail. What else? Oh, right. She’s panicking, idiot. Put yourself in her shoes. Like I said, Amanda Berry, that don’t ring no damn bells, you being a cop and all?

COOPER: But you — when you first saw her and she said the name Amanda Berry, did it —

RAMSEY: It didn’t — I didn’t know. Because I forgot. Bro, this is Cleveland. Since they haven’t found that girl.

COOPER: Right.

RAMSEY: And I guess stopped looking for that girl, we figured that girl was — met her demise.

COOPER: Right.

RAMSEY: So Berry didn’t register with me until I was on the phone like, wait a minute, I thought this girl was dead.

COOPER: What does it — what does it feel like to have been living next to this for a year?

RAMSEY: See, that’s why now I’m having trouble sleeping. See, up until yesterday, the only thing that kept me from losing sleep was the lack of money. See what I’m saying? So now that that’s going on, and I could have done this last year, not this hero stuff, just do the right thing —

COOPER: Do you feel like a hero?

RAMSEY: No.

COOPER: Because there’s a lot of people, they’re saying you’re a hero.

(CROSSTALK)

RAMSEY: No, no, no. Bro, I’m a Christian, an American, and just like you. We bleed same blood, put our pants on the same way. It’s just that you got to put that — being a coward, and I don’t want to get in nobody’s business. You got to put that away for a minute.

COOPER: Because you know how it is. There’s a lot of people who turn away.

(CROSSTALK)

RAMSEY: You have to have cajones, bro.

COOPER: Keep walking down on the street.

RAMSEY: That’s all what it’s about. It’s about cajones on this planet.

COOPER: Has the FBI said anything about a reward or anything? Because there was that — there was a reward for finding her.

RAMSEY: I tell you what you do, give it to them. Because if folks been following this case since last night, you been following me since last night, you know I got a job anyway. Just went picked it up, paycheck. What that address say? That say?

COOPER: I don’t have my glasses. I’m blind as a bat.

RAMSEY: 2203 Seymour. Where are them girls living? Right next door to this paycheck. So yes, take that reward and give it to — that little girl came out the house and she was crying. And I’m looking at her, right, I’m like your mama trying to help you, girl, shut up. I don’t know, right. And she’s like I want my daddy. And I said, who’s her daddy? She said Ariel.

COOPER: She said that.

RAMSEY: Yes. I said well, how’s that possible? Because you wouldn’t — if you got kidnapped, he was having sex with you? Oh, Jesus. That little girl is his? Now we want to hurt you.

COOPER: You felt that?

RAMSEY: Bro, this will be a different interview, I told you that, if we had known that. Man, I would be facing triple life.

COOPER: Wow. I’m glad it turned out this way.

Teachers are now installing digital devices after pupils sitting their GCSE and A-level exams complained that they were struggling to read the correct time on an analogue clock.

Malcolm Trobe, deputy general secretary at the Association of School and College Leaders (ASCL), said youngsters have become accustomed to using digital devices.

“The current generation aren’t as good at reading the traditional clock face as older generations,” he told The Telegraph.

“They are used to seeing a digital representation of time on their phone, on their computer. Nearly everything they’ve got is digital so youngsters are just exposed to time being given digitally everywhere.”

Mr Trobe, a former headmaster, said that teachers want their students to feel as relaxed as possible during exams. Having a traditional clock in the room could be a cause of unnecessary stress, he added.

He said that schools are trying to make everything as “as easy and straightforward as possible” for pupils during their exams.

“You don’t want them to put their hand up to ask how much time is left,” he said.

“Schools will inevitably be doing their best to make young children feel as relaxed as the can be. There is actually a big advantage in using digital clocks in exam rooms because it is much less easy to mistake a time on a digital clock when you are working against time.”"	Schools are removing analogue clocks from exam halls as teenagers 'cannot tell the time'	2018-04-24 00:00:00	['Camilla Turner', 'Education Editor', 'Lisanne Stock', 'Rachel Cunliffe', 'Anonymous Author', 'Ross Clark']	['teenagers', 'removing', 'digital', 'traditional', 'analogue', 'teachers', 'relaxed', 'clocks', 'pupils', 'trobe', 'youngsters', 'halls', 'exam', 'using', 'clock', 'tell', 'schools']	"Schools are removing analogue clocks from examination halls because teenagers are unable to tell the time, a head teachers’ union has said.

The National Toxicology Program of the Department of Health and Human Services warns that BHA is “reasonably anticipated to be a human carcinogen” (cancer-causing agent) .

According to the National Institute of Health, BHA in the diet has been found to consistently produce certain types of tumors in laboratory animals .

And the Office of Environmental Health Hazard Assessment of the state of California lists BHA under “Chemicals Known to the State to Cause Cancer or Reproductive Toxicity”.

Yet FDA regulations still permit its use as a fat preservative in food under the assumption it is “generally recognized as safe” in low doses .

Why BHA Matters

Here’s what concerns me. Dogs are a captive audience. They have no choice but to eat what we put in front of them.

The same potentially toxic substance added to a commercial dog food – and fed every day (twice a day) year after year is a different matter.

It’s that cumulative exposure that worries me. The additive effect of using any artificial preservative relentlessly — especially when it’s suspected of causing cancer.

Even though they may not remain as effective for as long, natural preservatives are considered to be safer.

That’s why today, the majority of dog food companies avoid the use of these synthetic “shelf-life extenders” altogether — and why you should, too.

When you read on a pet food label a particular fat ingredient has been “preserved with BHA”, you may want to stand aside.

There’s probably a safer alternative dog food within easy reach.

Baby Delaney's

Mom and Dad

May 4, 2001

The Lord is wonderful! Today was a great day. When

we went in for our 7-8:00 visit with Delaney the

doctor came out while we were scrubbing and told us

that there has been a change and he wanted to warn us

before we went into the room. My heart dropped! Then

he smiled and said she's doing so well right now at

staying stable that he took her off the ventilator

that she was on and put her on one that we start

surgery on her burns. This was the step we've been

waiting for. They put her on it at 10:30 this morning

and so far she's doing great! Your prayers and GODS

grace have gotten her this far so please continue to

keep Delaney in your prayers. Some people have asked

what her blood type is and how you go about donating

blood for her. Her blood type is A+, you can do a

direct donation if you are A+ or you can do a

replacement donation in her name. Just tell them who

it is for and that she is at Parkland Hospital,

Dallas, Texas. This should be all the information

they need. Around the Houston area you can donate at

the Gulf Coast Regional Blood Center or the Dallas

area at Carter Blood Centers. Scott & White will not

take replacements or directed units the blood you

donate there stays there for their hospital. You can

call 1-888-GVBLOOD to get a location near you. Thank

you all again. We are very BLESSED to have family and

friends like all of you. I have faith I will be

writing more good news tomorrow!!!!!!



May 6, 2001

Well today is Sunday and I am very sorry I didn't

update last night. We've had a busy weekend. Delaney

is still progressing very well. She is now at 55%

oxygen and holding her own. The burns on her face has

healed and the scabs have fallen off, they look great.

Of coarse where the burns were it is dark pink, but

I'm sure it will fade with time. The nurse told me

there are some areas that are healing up that they

thought would need skin graphs and probably won't now.

They are small areas but we'll take what we can get.

They said surgery next week some time towards the end

maybe Friday. One of the nurses said she's doing so

well that she can't see them waiting that long. She's

really going to need the prayers when surgery starts.

They said she will take a dive after a surgery and to

expect it. If she is burned 35% of her body and they

have to take skin from 15% of her body then that's 50%

that has to heal. Which of coarse is harder on that

little body. She has come so far and has had so many

people praying for her that I am very confident that

she will breeze right through it all. She's a strong,

tough and courageous little girl, her daddy and I are

very proud. Her sister and brother came down this

weekend and it was so wonderful to see them. We miss

them so very much. Caitlyn was able to talk to the

counselor at the hospital and she took Caitlyn in to

see Delaney. She did very well. There were rumors

around where we live that Delaney had to have both

arms amputated and Caitlyn heard about it, so she had

to see for herself that it wasn't true. Caitlyn is a

real trooper. Clayton, our 3 yr. old doesn't really

say or ask much. He says he can't wait for HIS

Delaney to come home. With all the prayer and our

trust in the LORD, it will happen real soon.



Thanks and GOD BLESS,

Deana and Deven



May 7, 2001

Today was a good day. She was doing so well that they

lowered her oxygen to 50% and decided to take her off

the paralyzing medication. We are not to sure about

this due to the fact she will be waking up and wanting

Mommy. We wont be able to hold her yet. This is

going to kill Mom. We saw her at the last visit and

she was moving her mouth and tongue, and made a few

sounds. We are wondering if she will be awake in the

morning. They plan on surgery Friday if all stays

well. This is going to be a trying time for her. We

will let everyone know if they change the date. Keep

the prayers coming and we will update you tomorrow.



Thanks, Deven



May 8, 2001

O.K. I think things are starting to go a little faster

than what we expected. Don't get me wrong we are

happy, we just were not expecting all that happened

today. Today Delaney was taken off another

medication(medication that kept her relaxed), her

oxygen level was lowered to 40% and she tried opening

her eyes. While the doc. was fixing her trac. she let

out a cry. Tomorrow she should be more alert. Thank

you everyone for all your prayers, support, and love.

Someone asked if Delaney can listen to tapes, she does

have a tape player in her room. GOD continues to

answer all our prayers and to him we give thanks for

Delaney's healing.



Love, Deven and Deana



May 10, 2001

We wanted to let everyone know that Delaney's surgery

is at 0730 Friday morning. They plan on grafting her

left arm and exploring her fingers to see what can be

saved. She opened her eyes a little and cried when a

friend of ours talked to her. She still doesn't move

around much which makes it easier on the nurses.

There is really not much more to pass on so we will

let ya'll know tomorrow.



Love, Deven & Deana



May 11, 2001

Well the first surgery is over and Delaney did very well. The

surgery took little over an hour but they only grafted her left

arm, left hand (top and palm), top of her left foot and they

did have to remove part of her pinky (down to the knuckle) and

part of her ring finger (just the tip) she still has her nail.

He said we'll watch that ring finger to make sure no more needs

to come off. He was real good about leaving even the littlest bit

if he thought there would be a chance for it to heal. She used

150cc of blood during the surgery and they were going to check her

blood count a little later to see if she needs anymore.

If she heals well and stays stable then we'll probably have the

second surgery next week. Then he will be grafting the chest and

some small places on her right leg and arm. We were pleased to

hear that he's almost certain that her breast buds were not burnt

and she would not have any problems with developement. We'll

cross that bridge when we get there. I can't thank everyone

enough for all the prayers and support Deven and I have received.

I truly believe that without the prayers things wouldn't have

gone this well for our baby. One nurse told me that in all the

years he's been there he has never seen a child that small with

burns as severe as Delaneys recover as quickly as she has. When

he told me that I knew the only reason why is because of

THE LORD JESUS CHRIST. We'll be going in and making short visits

throughout the day so if there are any changes I will inform

everyone tonight.



Thanks Again, Deana & Deven



May 14, 2001

We just don't know what to do with these good days but we will take them!

Today they had her off the resperatior and on a trac brace

( mask that fits over the trac hole, doesn't breathe for her just provides her with oxygen )

they have got her on 20 -30 minute trials. They also

took her off the morphine drip and give it to her as needed. She seems

to be doing very well with this. Her second surgery is scheduled for

Friday if all stays well. They unwrapped the grafted areas today, there

still mesh gauze on the grafts but the nurse said it looked good. They

will know tomorrow when they take the mesh off if the grafts stuck. She

will look around the room at us, moves her body a little, and she even

watched a little t.v. today. We are very proud of her progress but

they are still letting us know she can go down hill at any time. But

she is stronger than that! Everyone is very optimistic. Well it is

time to go and see her we will give her kisses from everyone.

Thanks for the prayers.



Love Deven & Deana



May 15, 2001

Today we've had a little set back. When they unwrapped the grafted areas

the foot, arm and the palm of her hand looked great, but the top of her

hand the the fingers did not take. The nurse said the skin graft did not

stick and it just moves all around. They will go in and regraft it on

friday when they do the chest and a little on the right arm the doctor

said. Also the area that they took the skin from (donor site) instead of

drying like it should her body is treating it like a second degree burn so

they are having to wrap and apply medication on both of her thighs where

they took the skin from. It's kind of a set back, which we were expecting,

but that didn't mean we wanted it to happen! We are still thinking positive

and pray the surgery on friday goes well. As far as her health they say

everything is going great. We want to thank everyone who has donated blood

and apologize if any of you got the run around at the hospitals or blood

centers. You would think they would make it easier to donate blood for

someone. We would like to send thank you cards to everyone could you

please e-mail me your mailing addresses.

GOD BLESS

Deven & Deana



May 17, 2001

Well there's a lot to tell everyone. Yesterday they took her off the

respirator and put her on the trac collar to see how long she could breathe

without assistance. She is still of the trac collar. They can't believe how

good she is doing. She is more alert and the nurses have fun with her at night.

They said she didn't fall asleep till 12:00 am. I got to hold her for the first time

today. It was an awsome feeling. She doesn't have much expression, but she

sure was rooting around wanting to nurse so in went the pacifer! Surgery is

tomorrow at around 0730. This surgery should be alot easier for her since she is

stronger and there is less grafting. They are still worried about her breast

buds being damaged and part of her ring finger needing to be removed. There have

been a few nurses say if we forget to come get her they are taking her home with them.

(those are fighting words!)

Also some things we have been told, now that she is doing a whole lot better,

is there wasn't much hope for her to have made it this far. Goes to show what

the POWER OF PRAYERS and the GOOD LORD can do.

We will let everyone know how surgery goes.

Thank you all so much,

Deven & Deana



May 19, 2001

It's Saturday and I'm sure a lot of you are wondering about the surgery

so here it goes...........They ended up having to graft a little more than

we expected. Her right foot (top), a strip around the top of her right arm,

chest, re-grafted the couple of areas on her left arm and finger, and they

did have to amputate her ring finger on her left hand to the first little

knuckle. So she has no fingernails on her pinky and ring finger. Trying to

ease the tension a little I said ""I guess when she has her nails done they'll

have to give her a discount!"" When we told Caitlyn and Clayton about it

Clayton just said ""OH!"" and Caitlyn said ""I don't care abount her fingers being

gone as long as I still have a sister."" I was pretty impressed. They miss

her so much. They put her back on the vintilator durning surgery and we had

planned on her being on it for atleast the whole day and some of the next,

but by the 5:00 visitation she was back on the trac collar and doing great.

Today when I went in for the 3:00 visit they had the trac out and she is totally

breathing on her own!!!! She cried and I could hear her. I feels like It's

been ages since I heard her cry. I just rubbed her head and told her to cry it's ok.

The only time she cries is when someone messes with her. Other times she just

stares at us and follows us with her eyes around the room. I keep trying to make

her smile so I can see those four teeth but she just won't do it yet. The nurses

told us she probably wouldn't smile for a while. "" When she's all better she'll

let you know"", they say. My mother-in-law was talking to the respitory doctor

and she was telling him how she was our little miracle baby and he said she's

a miracle baby three times over. He loves Delaney. He says she talks to him

all the time so he lets us know what she says. He has been so wonderful to

us and Delaney. They might take h er around in the wagon on Sunday. We'll see.

She looks like the Stay Puff Marshmellow Man. They have her all wrapped up.

It will all come off Monday or Tuesday so they'll be able to see how well the

grafts look. Well I have to go to visit her. I'll talk to everyone tomorrow.

Deana



May 22, 2001

I,m sorry I haven't updated in a couple of days but it's been something else

around here. Saturday Deven had to go back to work. It was killing him but we

have to pay the bills so he left and told me to call him after every visit. Nothing

really changed on Saturday. Sunday however there were many. They had Delaney

off the ventilator and on the mask, she was on the mask about two or three days and

when I went in to visit her Sunday they had taken the trac out and she was breathing

on her own. I was shocked because I didn't think they were going to do that

until they checked out the grafts to make sure they took. They seemed pretty

confident about everything so I just went with the flow. Then they told me they were

going to try her with a bottle and if she did well then I could try to nurse her.

I couldn't believe it. She took the bottle just fine and she didn't forget how to

nurse! Yesterday was more amazing! It's a good thing everyone is setting down

because when I got there for the 8:00 visit they had her all dolled up with a

bow in her hair looking all clean and the big bulky bandages off (she looked like a

little angel) her bright blue eyes were shining. The doctor came in and said

you know she's going to be moved down the hall tomorrow. I asked if he was joking

and he said no I'm not joking. I think my jaw fell to the ground because once

they get moved down the hall they get to go home after 2-3 days!!!! So were looking

at probably Saturday! Deven's mom started to cry from joy but I stood there in

total amazment. I haven't been able to cry, laugh, smile or anything . All I

can think is less than a month ago I didn't think I would have a baby anymore,

Deven and I were giving her to the LORD because we knew she was so bad and in

so much pain and in less than a month she's going home. It's just too much to

grasp all at one time. I know that little girl has seen JESUS and played with

the angels while her body healed there's no doubt about that. She is our little

miracle baby and GOD has something special planned for her.

Today, Tuesday, at the 8:00 a.m. visit they had the feeding tube out of

her nose and she's eating baby food (they even ordered some ice cream for

her today) and they took the cathadere out. All she has left to take out is

the I.V. and that will probably be today. She is taking all meds by mouth.

They are not going to move her out of ICU today like planned because there isn't

a room avalible but the nurse don't mind a bit. They want her to stay there.

All of this would not have happened without the wonderful prayers from everyone.

We just can't thank everyone enough. They unwrapped her left hand and arm today

and it was real hard to look at it. It looks pretty bad. To the nurses and doctors

it looks good but to me it was bad. I know it's all going to heal and she'll do

great in life but she's my baby and right now it's hard. All of the grafts took

very well so there will be no more surgeries any time soon. Plus today she got to

go on that wagon ride we've been waiting on! Deven came back last night and he was

here to take her on that ride. It meant more to him than anyone can imagine.

Thank You All for all the love and support. I will be staying here when she

gets out of the hospital for at least three weeks for intense therapy. She'll

have to go five days a week. Then it will start to tapper off there.

Thanks again.

Deana



June 2, 2001

O.K. I'm going to try this again. I have written

three e-mails and none have gone through to anyone.

For those of you that don't know already, Delaney is

out of the hospital. She is doing so well. She was

released a week ago this past friday. It was a real

shocker. They took her out of ICU on a wednesday and

put her in the acute care unit and by friday she was

released. This past Thursday we took her to the burn

clinic and the doctors just couldn't believe how she

looked. All we can say is it's the work of the LORD

no doubt!!!!! She is smiling, laughing, playing and

being as cute as can be. I know we have told everyone

thank you but we can't say it enough. If it wasn't

for all the thoughts, love and prayers I know she

wouldn't have done so well so fast. Caitlyn and

clayton are doing so well with her. At first Caitlyn

wanted to hide Delaney's hand and I told her we can't

do that, we have to let Delaney know it's o.k. and

nothing to be ashamed of. After a while of thinking

about it Caitlyn said ""Your right, she's alive and

that's all that matters."" I was so proud. Clayton

said her hand looked nasty and he wasn't going to

touch it. I told him it's o.k. he didn't have to. A

couple of days later he kissed it and told her he

loved her. Now none of it's a big deal to either.

When we do therapy on it of coarse Delaney screams so

they both come into the room and sing, dance and make

silly sounds to her to get her mind off what we're

doing. They are a big help. We are battling the

insurance company about thr right kind of therapy she

needs. They don't have a pediatric burn therapist in

the insurance group and want to send her to a plastic

surgeon. Monday and Tuesday we are going to Scott and

White to talk to them more about the insurance and

then we will be going back to Tyler for more therapy

there. I really like the therapist there. Plus we are

able to stay with Deven's parents. His mom is out of

school for the summer and she is loving having the

grandkids there. Poor Delaney has a long road ahead

of her. There is going a lot more surgeries and a lot

of therapy, but we'll get through it all just fine.

I'll tell you what, this has really made Deven and I

rethink how we want to live our lives with our

childern. Deven's going to cut down on work hours, if

there's a fair in town we're taking the kids, we're

going on vacations, there's so much we want to change.

It's going to be interesting. I'll let everyone know

how this next week goes.

Love, Deana



June 26, 2001

Just wanted to let everyone know how well Delaney is

doing. She is going to therapy everyday. Her burns are

healing very well. This past Friday Deven and I took

her to Dallas for a check-up and they were amazed at

how well she looked. They said she will have minimal

scaring. Everyday she wears her pressure garments.

These are to help smooth out the skin grafting and

help her heal even better. She wont crawl yet but we

are working on that everyday. She most likely will

have to have surgery on her left hand because the skin

is too tight and her fingers are curving downward. It

looks like her middle finger and ring finger are

trying to web together so that will also have to be

fixed. But we are hanging in there and could never had

made it this far without all of everyones support.

Thank you all so very much for continuing to keep us

in your prayers. God is soo wonderful and we will

never forget that and Delaney will grow up to know

that always. Thank you all very much.

Love,

Deana and Deven



July 10, 2001

Deven and Deana do not have access right now to a computer as they are

living with a family that does not have one. They are waiting on their

house being built and Deana continues to take Delaney every day back and

forth from Lampasas to Temple. We need prayers for Deana, Deven, Clayton

and Caitlyn now, as they are suffering from the aftershocks of this horrible

accident. Delaney continues to heal and progress well, but she absolutely

abhors her physical therapy and occupational therapy. We are told she

will not remember any of this, but when ones baby screams and cries when

her affected areas are touched and looks at her Momma like

""How could you do this to me?""

It has an affect on us all. They still have many long days ahead

with her therapy, but we know God will continue to meet the needs of

this precious family. Thank you for all you have done!

Baby Delaneys Grandmother, Karen Parrish



July 19, 2001

I just finished talking to Deana, Delaney's Mom and she said the

surgeon said he wants to do more skin grafting on her hand as it is causing

her thumb to pull in. They can't do that though until the hand is completely

healed. The most recent blessing is that she is no longer screaming and

crying when they do the therapy, she just kind of makes loud noises to tell

them to ""stop messing with me"". Ha! We still need prayer for two areas:

She has lost weight as she only wants bottles, no solid food and she isn't

sleeping through the night since the accident. We are taking Clayton and

Caitlyn to Springfield, Missouri on Saturday to see their Uncle Adam and

Aunt Sarah, which will give Deana and Deven a little break, as well as the

kids a few less trips to Scott and White. Thank you for your continuing

prayers, we truly appreciate them. Hopefully they will be in their house in

the next 3-4 weeks.

God Bless You All!

Baby Delaneys Grandmother, Karen Parrish



July 25, 2001

The doctor's have decided that she will have 3 surgeries when she is

completely healed. Two on her hand and one on the bend of her elbow. She

continues to thrive and has already outgrown her first body suit. I

mentioned that she only wants her bottle last update, but now she is wanting

only people food, not baby food. She has 6 teeth now and pushes all of her

food to the front of her mouth so she can chew it. One of the beautiful

things that has happened is Deana was worried about people's reaction to her

in the store....well, Deana can hardly get out of any store because people

stop and ask her what happened. Deana said when they stare......Delaney

breaks out in her smile and that eases the tension and then they usually ask

what her injuries are. It is a slow uphill walk, but God's faithfulness to

her cannot be denied. Thank you for your continued prayers.

We serve an awesome God!

August 2, 2001

Deven and Deana took Delaney to Parkland hospital for her monthly check

with them. Scott and White Hospital, who are their insurance provider

does not recognize Parkland as her health provider, so Deven and Deana

pay these visits out of pocket. These persons at Parkland are the true

burn specialists and have decided as of today Delaney needs surgery on

her hand by the end of the month. Her elbow also needs straightening,

however,they want to cast her arm and see if it will straighten with that

procedure. They did not anticipate this surgery this soon, but because she

is growing so fast, as only those little ones do, the surgery is indicated

now.Our prayer is that Parkland will have a short persuasion time with

Scott and White to have Delaney's surgery done by Parkland. This is so

important because they are the experts at Parkland and this is their field

of expertise. Deven and Deana also took Delaney by the ICU where she was

for the first 3 weeks, and the male nurse who admitted her was there this

time. He got tears in his eyes when he saw her and all of the other nurses said,

""They will never forget those blue eyes"".

It means so much to the nurses who minister to these critically

injured children to see them healing, smiling and growing.

Again, we say thank you for your prayers and concerns, because this is

what has held us all together the past 4 months. Deana and Deven are hoping

to be into their house in the next 3 weeks. Pray also that things will go

smoothly there, as anyone who has built a house knows the little hindrances

that have a way of creeping up.

Hi everyone. I'm at my moms and using her computer so I figured I'd update

everyone on Delaney. She's just as happy as can be. Always smiling, laughing

and keeping me on my toes. She hasn't let any of this slow her down.

We still go to therapy everyday. That does get a little hard on all of us

but we know how important it is so we make the best of it. It is getting a

lot easier. I know there were some people worried about me but I'm letting

everyone know that I am just fine. I'm not going to crack or break down and go

crazy like some might think and I don't need to be on medication. HA! I have

days that I break down and CRY along with Delaney when I'm doing therapy or

changing her garments because it hurts her therefore it hurts me! I think

it's only natural that I do hurt with her and I would be worried about someone that

didn't cry for their hurting child. I involve the other two children in

everything and tell them everything we're told from the doctors. They are

such a big help in therapy. They play and act goofy while the therapist are

working on her. She loves it. As far as the house is concerned, that is

something we started before this even happened to Delaney. We don't expect

anyone to help us out. That was something Deven and I started together and

we've had some help from our parents and a couple of friends. We are about

2-3 weeks away from being in it. So please don't think we're desperate and

need the help. We are fine where we are at right now. We are staying with

one of Deven's best friends and his wife and children. It is 6 miles from

our house so we work on it every evening and his buddy Clayton (who we're

staying with) has done all the electrical work and air conditioning for us.

Please don't anyone worry about us. Deven and I have a very strong, open and

loving marriage. We talk to each other all the time about how we are feeling

and things that are going on with our lives and family. Right now we are

just concentrating on our family and what needs to be done to make Delaney

all better. As far as other surgeries go, we went to Dallas yesterday

and the doctor that performed her other surgeries looked at her and they

are very concerned about her hand and elbow. He says they would like to do

surgery right away. They are afraid that her middle finger and little ring

finger won't grow with the rest of them because the scar is so thick. The

finger will not straighten out at all. Her elbow won't either. They put

her elbow in a cast hoping to straighten it out a little so they can wait

on surgery on the elbow until the scar matures. The finger can't wait and

needs to be done by the end of the month. They are going to try to talk

to the insurance about letting them do the surgeries in Dallas. We would

feel a lot better about that because they did such a wonderful job the

first time. Again please pray that we're able to go to dallas for her

surgeries. I will let everyone know what we find out and when it will all

take place. Thank you all again for all the wonderful e-mails, thoughts and prayers.

God Bless, Deana



August 9, 2001

Hi I just wanted to let everyone know that Delaney's arm looks to be doing

very well with the cast on. They removed the cast Tuesday and I was amazed at the

softness of the scars and how straight the arm was. After a while of leaving it

off you could tell it was wanting to drawl up again and was starting to get

hard again. They made her another cast that we can take on and off as

needed. Hopefully this will prevent her from needing surgery on that arm to

soon. The finger and hand still need surgery right away. We are still waiting

on the hospital and insurance co. to call. I put in an application at Shriners

to see if they can take a look at her. I've heard they do wonderful work.

I'll update as I get more information.

Thanks, Deana



August 22, 2001

Great news! Delaney has been preapproved by Shriners Hospital.

There is a Shriners Hospital in Austin, and they will drive out

to Lampasas and pick Delaney up for her therapy, or will pay gas

for Deana to drive her into Austin. We are hoping that she will

fully approved by September 7 when her next surgery on her hand is

scheduled. She has been wearing a cast on her left arm and not

only is the arm incredibly straight, but the cast is smoothing out

the burned areas! There is also a lotion called Demarkable made by

Beauty Control that is causing the scarring to smooth out and return

to normal color faster than anything they have used so far. Deana

and Deven should be moving into their house in the next two weeks.

God has truly worked miracles through this family and again, we

can't say enough......thank you for your prayers, and may God bless

each of you to overflowing measure.



September 3, 2001

They will spend their first night their tonight. 90% of the tile is in,

kitchen cabinets are in, someone donated the second commode for their

mudroom, Deana's sister and brother-in-law gave them 4 inside doors.

They are all very tired, but so relieved to be in their house.

We rejoice with them! Thank you all again for your prayers!



September 13, 2001

Just wanted to apologize for not updating recently.

Deven and I have been really busy lately. We have

finally moved into our home, just in time for

Delaney's first birthday Sept. 1. Delaney has been

doing soo well and she is sooo happy. She had surgery

today the 13th of Sept. The surgery went extremely

well. They took layers of skin from her groin areas

and cut the palm of her hand to put some skin in that

area. This will allow the skin to losen up and not be

soo tight. Her arm is in a cast as this procedure

begins to heal. Delaney was in surgery for 3 hours.

They did more than what they anticipated, but the

doctors say all went very well. Yesterday she started

to crawl again for the first time since the accident.

Since having this surgery I guess it will take some

time before she tries to crawl again. We are just sooooo

happy that she is doing soo well and is in good

spirits. We are very happy to finally be in our own

home. It is such a great relief. We do not have a home

phone yet. The phone company has to do some line work

first and we were told it could take up to a month. As

soon as we get phone service we will let everyone

know. Once again Deven and I wanted to thank everyone

for their tremendous support and prayers. Once we get

settled we will be sending out thank you cards. The

cards just dont say enough how much we thank everyone.

We will update as often as we can. GOD Bless everyone.

Thank you all soo much,

Deana and Deven Parrish and family



October 9, 2001

Delaney had her first visit at Shriner's in Galveston today.

They said she looked great and Deana could discontinue the every

day therapy at Scott and White in Temple. She has been doing this

since June! They gave her some new anti-itching medicine, as Delaney

has not had many full night sleeps because of the itching. They

have also placed her on a high fiber, high calorie diet because burn

victims lose muscle and bone the first year after the trauma. They

also fit her with a new Jobst garment and splint for her hand.

This is a huge answer to prayer for us because Scott and White was

NOT meeting her needs. In fact the last surgery they did was not the

correct procedure for burn patients today. However, this hospital

would not admit to a lack of knowledge for pediatric burn care.

Shriners will come and pick up Delaney and my daugher-in-law in Lampasas,

take them to Galveston, put them up in a motel for the night and

take them home the next day. They will have no more financial outlay!

Praise God, He does take care of His little ones! Thank you again for

all of your prayer and voices of inquiry and concern! God Bless You!.



October 11, 2001

Hi everyone,

Well there's a lot to tell everyone. I guess that's

what happens when it takes a month to get a phone line

put out in the boonies and no one provides the

Internet out here. Delaney is doing so wonderful. I know she's

my child but that has got to be the most strongest and

happiest baby I've ever seen. So many people can't

get past that smile of hers to even see that she's

burned. It is such a blessing. Another blessing is

that We took her to Shriners in Galveston on Tuesday

10/09/01 and they were the most amazing group of

people. We were there for 6 1/2 hrs. They showed me

what to do and watch for so I can do therapy at home

everyday instead of driving over an hour there and

back everyday. I only have to take her to see the

Drs. once a month in Galveston and they will come get

us the night before and take us back the day after and

pay for everything hotel and all. It was such a

blessing for them to accept her and do all of this.

Deven and I were starting to get a little worried

about all of it because we've been paying $800-$1000 a

month on co-pays, gas, food, meds and lotions.

Shriners pays for everything. I'm not gonna know what

to do with all the time I'm going to have. Yeah I do,

spend it all with my babies!!!! Deven and I feel like

a ton of bricks have been lifted off our shoulders. I

know it was everyones thoughts and prayers. Thank you

so much. I do have one more prayer to ask and that is

will you please pray (if your not already) that Deven

and I don't feel so much anger towards GOD. We are

both having such mixed feeling right now. I thank GOD

everyday that she is here and she's doing so well, but

five min. later I'm so angery at him I just want to

scream. I guess it's normal to feel this way but it

sure hurts to have this kind of anger built up inside

and I know it hurts him(GOD)as well. Thanks again,

Deana Parrish



February 14, 2002

Just wanted to let everyone know how Delaney is doing.

She is walking and into everything, she has turned

into a very strong willed little girl. Totally

different than the other two. She is a little bundle

of joy. Her scars are starting to heal, there are

some areas that are still pretty thick and red but

the doctors at Shriners said when we go back in three

months they should be almost healed. They really give

us so much hope for our darling. We actually look

forward to her visits. There is so much they already

have planned to do for her. As soon as the scars are

healed (not red) they will be able to go in and remove

the thick ones. One of the nipples still have not

come through. They said something is there, either a

breast bud or the nipple. If it is the bud and the

nipple is gone they said they will be able to tattoo

an areola on and put a nipple on. You won't be able

to tell the difference. They said the thickness of

the fingers and the amputated ones will slinder down

to almost normal. The coloring of the grafted areas

are pretty much the normal color of her skin. You can

still tell she's been burned, but if you see her from

a distance it's not the first thing you see. She is

still itching a lot. We try just about everything but

sometimes it does no good. That does get hard.

Shriners did tell us on our last visit (Feb.12) that

she doesn't have to wear her pressure garments

anymore. They said it is just so hard on her beca use

she hates them so much and I'll be able to massage her

so much more that we could do without. We were really

happy to hear that. She would cry when I put it on

and I'd still cry putting it on. Things will start

getting better now, I know they will. I again want to

thank everyone for continuing the prayers and cards

for her. I keep them all in a big box. I can't wait

for her to understand how many people were praying for

her. She now tells everyone hi! wherever we go. It's

really cute. Also if she's wearing a shirt that she

can lift up, she will flash you. We can't get out of

the stores without her flashing someone and then of

coarse I have to explain what happened to them. I

definitely don't discourage her from doing that.

She's acts like she's proud of her boo boos and wants

to show them off. Her sister and brother are doing

really well. They still talk about the day it

happened, but you can tell they're forgetting little

bits at a time. They love to explain to other kids

about what happened and what Shriners are going to do

for their little sister. They go into such detail

explaining, that the little kids look at them like why

did I even ask? It's pretty neat. I just let them

say whatever their little hearts desire. Well I'll

update again soon. Thanks for wanting to be kept

updated on her. If anyone doesn't want to be sent

these letters please let me know. I just send the

e-mail to everyone on our list from when we were at

the hospital. Thanks again.

COVINGTON, Ky. – Business owner Marty Boyer accidentally paid the electric bill for lights on the Clay Wade Bailey Bridge for five months.

Boyer was charged based on electrical poles across West Third Street from the Theatre House in Covington, a business he acquired in November. The poles supply electricity for lights on the Ohio River bridge, Duke Energy acknowledged Monday after Boyer made a ""plea for help"" on social media.

Boyer noticed in January the bill seemed too high. Plus, there were more meters than his business, a theatrical supply house, would require. He started calling Duke in January.

Frustrated by Duke's inaction, Boyer told Duke to turn off the meters across the street on March 19 not knowing what they powered. The lights stayed on at the Theatre House, but a Duke worker showed up the next day asking who turned the lights off.

""(The) lesson here: Want to get attention, turn off the lighting on the bridge,"" Boyer said.

The billing error – which was costing Boyer about $200 a month – persisted until it was brought to Duke Energy's attention Monday by The Enquirer.

Earlier Monday Boyer vented about his dilemma on Facebook, fed up with inaction from Duke customer service.

Duke Energy called the Theatre House owner Monday to apologize, said Sally Thelen, a company spokeswoman.

""We were very apologetic and acknowledged that we can do better,"" Thelen said.

The Kentucky Transportation Cabinet, responsible for the bridge lighting, was supposed to be billed.

Duke can and will do better, Thelen said. This will be a ""teachable"" moment, she said.

""Definitely there were some issues on our end about how we were handling instances of his billing,"" she said.

Boyer estimates he spent at least 25 hours trying to talk with employees to stop billing him for the bridge lighting since he first complained in January.

Boyer said he was told Duke couldn't find someone to bill at the Kentucky Transportation Cabinet. Duke asked him to call the Transportation Cabinet.

Everyone he spoke with made him retell the entire story about how he ended up paying the bridge's light bill.

""Everyone was like this would be on snopes.com, and I'm like, no this is real,"" Boyer said."

https://www.snopes.com/fact-check/bill-nye-vs-dolph-lundgren/	action star dolph lundgren has multiple scientific degrees.	mostly true	['']		Dan Evon	['https://timeline.wsu.edu/timeline/dolph-lundgren/', 'https://archive.is/ZNOw2', 'https://web.archive.org/web/20110814212807/http://dolphlundgren.com/about/biography.html']	https://web.archive.org/web/20110814212807/http://dolphlundgren.com/about/biography.html	https://web.archive.org/	"Hans Dolph Lundgren was born and raised in an academic middle-class family in Stockholm, Sweden. Despite an early interest in rock n' roll drumming and clowning around in high school comedies, Dolph decided to follow in his father's more cerebral footsteps and pursue an engineering degree. Dolph went through some hard times during his teenage years when Dolph's father, his precious career losing steam -- started taking out his frustration on his wife and oldest son. Both verbally and more so: physically.



Dolph feels that the physical abuse he suffered at the hands of his father later motivated him to pursue both contact sports and the dramatic arts. 'I still love my father, no matter what happened. There are many things about him I still admire. As a child, I was probably too much like him, very stubborn -- perhaps that's what he couldn't deal with', Dolph says. After having served in the Swedish Marine Corps for two years, Lundgren enrolled in the Royal Institute of Technology in Stockholm, studying the same subject as his older brother: Chemical Engineering. Dolph was still trying to prove something to his dad.



It was as a late teenager that Dolph first came in contact with the martial arts. An insecure and allergic younger child, Dolph enjoyed this opportunity to work out and getting stronger, proving that he could stand up to other athletic kids. 'I wanted to feel that I was somebody who could accomplish something on my own -- that I wasn't a loser like my dad used to tell me during his tirades', Dolph says. 'It is a known fact that boys with a troubled father-son relationship are drawn to physically challenging contact sports, like boxing, wrestling and karate. That was definitely me.'



After spending five years training harder than anybody else in the dojo, Dolph Lundgren was a world-class competitor in Japanese full-contact karate. He was also getting deeper involved with a samurai philosophy of life that since has become an important part of his persona – both on and off-screen.



After graduating high school a straight-A student, Dolph spent considerable time in the United States on various academic scholarships. He attended both Washington State University and Clemson University, studying Chemistry. 'My dad always told me that if I wanted to make something special with my life, I had to go to America', Dolph remembers. 'He said that in Europe, a man was usually stuck in his social position and didn't have the opportunity to advance. He was right.'



In the early eighties, Dolph graduated from The Royal Institute of Technology in Stockholm and completed his Master's Degree in Chemical Engineering on an exchange program with the University of Sydney in Australia. Graduating at the head of his class, Dolph was then awarded a Fulbright scholarship to the prestigious Massachusetts Institute of Technology in Boston, one of the world's top engineering schools. He was finally on his way to America.



A Fulbright scholar Dolph could now finally consider himself a 'success' with a bright future, perhaps as the CEO of some large corporation -- but somehow the academic world could not make him fully satisfied. He was soon to stumble on a profession that would. In the words of writer David Mamet: 'Nobody with a happy childhood ever went into show business...'



While preparing to move to Boston, the 25-year old PhD student met his definite physical match: exotic singer Grace Jones. The blonde Swede and the dark beauty fell in love and he decided to move in with her in New York City. Dolph took up modeling at the famous Zoli Agency to make some extra cash. 'A bit too tall and muscular for a model's size 40', Dolph also started working as a doorman at 'The Limelight', an infamous nightspot in Manhattan where one of his fellow 'bouncers' was Chazz Palmitieri – soon to find his own fame in Hollywood… Dolph was to begin at MIT a few months later. A friend's gave him some advice: 'Hey man, you sure look like you should be in the movies...and you can kick ass'. Dolph listened and started studying drama at the Warren Robertson Theatre Workshop in Manhattan, not knowing how quickly his life was about to change. 'My time in New York City opened up my adolescent Swedish eyes to a multitude of different people and lifestyles, mostly in the arts. I hung out with Andy Warhol, Keith Haring, Iman and Steve Rubell, danced at Studio 54 and studied acting with Andy McDowell and Tom Hulce.' Mostly based on his Scandinavian looks, within a year Dolph had received numerous film offers. His motion picture debut came in the James Bond feature A VIEW TO A KILL in 1985. 'I'm on screen for no more than ten seconds, if you blink you miss me...'. However, it was Dolph's memorable performance in ROCKY IV later that year that definitely got him noticed worldwide. After a nine- month audition process among 5,000 hopefuls, Dolph was chosen by writer-director Sylvester Stallone to be his fearsome Soviet opponent in the ring, Captain Ivan Drago.



Getting ready for the ROCKY IV Premiere, a still innocent twenty-something Lundgren moved to Los Angeles. 'I walked in to a Westwood movie theater as Grace Jones' boyfriend and walked out ninety minutes later as the movie star Dolph Lundgren. I was shell-shocked for years from the mind-boggling and daunting experience of being a student-athlete from tiny Sweden suddenly having to live up a new action-star persona', he remembers.



Despite many hardships, including breaking up with Grace, Dolph dug in and managed to build a solid career as an international action-hero and has since starred in more than thirty-five feature films. 'I was certainly thrown it at the deep end. Sometimes I feel it would have been better working as a waiter for a few years doing bit part and getting my feet wet at a more human pace', Dolph ponders. That wasn't in the stars for the big Swede. In the eighties and nineties, Lundgren played the classic action lead in such films as MASTERS OF THE UNIVERSE, SHOWDOWN IN LITTLE TOKYO co-starring the late Brandon Lee and BLACKJACK by Hong-Kong action legend John Woo. In the 90's Lundgren also turned in some memorable performances as the main villain to other action stars, most notably in UNIVERSAL SOLDIER opposite Jean Claude Van Damme, directed by Roland Emmerich and ""JOHNNY MNEMONIC opposite a young Keanu Reeves.



Throughout the years, Dolph has always stayed close to the martial arts: 'Karate and physical fitness have kept me reasonably sane in a very tough and sometimes insane business'. In 1997, after a three hours grueling technical examination and twenty consecutive full-contact karate bouts without rest, Dolph was awarded his Third Degree black belt by the World Karate Organization in Tokyo. 'My instructor told me to hire a video-crew and film it because, as he put it: you'll never do this again! Watching the footage years later I understand what he meant...' Dolph's previous martial arts accomplishments include being the captain of the Swedish National Karate Team and the individual champion of the Swedish, European and Australian Heavyweight Full Contact Divisions. 'Having said all that, I'm currently training hard to take my Fourth Degree examination and perform a Karate exhibition at the World Karate Championships in 2011. I tell you, it's not getting any easier….', Dolph confesses.



In addition to his Karate expertise, Dolph was selected by the U.S. Olympic Committee to serve as the Team Leader of the U.S. Olympic Pentathlon Team during the 1996 Atlanta Olympic Games. 'I starred in a film called PENTATHLON and worked closely with two US Olympic team members who really got me interested in the sport. I later got involved in trying to raise the sport's profile and to prevent one of the original disciplines from year 1896 to be dropped from the games all together'.



Both Sweden and the United States have a colorful history in Pentathlon with a young Lieutenant George Patton placing fifth in the 1912 Stockholm Games. Dolph sums up his Olympic experience: 'Entering the Atlanta Stadium at night -- next to my fellow US team members and ten thousand other athletes was one of the proudest and most humbling experiences of my life'.



While staying extremely busy in Hollywood, Dolph has also managed to raise a family. Dolph and his wife Anette, who he met in New York and to whom he's been married for fifteen years have two daughters, Ida (14) and Greta (8). The Lundgren family has lived in places as diverse as Los Angeles, New York, London and now recently in Marbella, Spain where Dolph's kids attend a British International school. 'We've decided to live away from Hollywood even if it may have had some negative influences on Dolph's career. Giving our children a more normal upbringing is much more important to us', his wife Anette says.



Anette is the person who gave Dolph the support to finally move behind the camera and become a director six years ago. Dolph was working on the screenplay with the director and one of the producers of a film. A week prior to principal photography the director suddenly fell very ill. 'He recommended for me to take over the picture', Dolph remembers. 'I was a bit stunned, so I asked my wife for her opinion. 'Go ahead and do it or you'll always regret not taking the opportunity'. Dolph took her advice and 'didn't sleep for a month', but he made the right decision.



Since then, Dolph has directed five feature films. His production company Thor Pictures is currently developing several projects, which he will produce, star and direct. His two latest projects are -- a feature he co-wrote and directed, COMMAND PERFORMANCE produced by Avi Lerner and Nu Image Films – and ICARUS, a neo-noir thriller, shot in Vancouver, BC.



'It takes a while to learn the ropes as a director-- especially since I don't have any formal film school training. My experience in front of the camera does give me a certain edge in my favorite part of directing: working with the actors', Dolph says.



Dolph is also a founding member of 'Group of Eight' an off-Broadway theatre group started in 1994.



In 2009 Dolph co-starred with fellow action star Jean-Claude Van Damme in UNIVERSAL SOLDIER REGENERATION, a sequel to the film that paired the two European actors back in the 90's. This summer, Dolph will appear on the big screen in THE EXPENDABLES -- a modern day DIRTY DOZEN action extravaganza written and directed by Sylvester Stallone. ' It's been terrific to work with Sly again and he has created very colorful character for me', says Lundgren. My role isn't the biggest in the picture, but proved to be a real challenge since Sly wanted my character to be very funny. I'm gonna make you the first Swedish comedian, he said!'.



Dolph co-stars with Sly Stallone, Jason Statham, Jet Lee, Mickey Rourke and Randy Couture with cameos by Bruce Willis and Arnold Schwartzenegger in a mid-August release.



Some day Dolph hopes to direct a period piece set in Sweden, 'I have a script I'm trying to get made that's one of my dream projects...', he says. 'I'd love to do something that's closer to my home country. When I appeared as a host of a Swedish TV-show early this year, the reception my countrymen gave me was fantastic. When I saw my kids who haven't spent that much time in Sweden, sitting in the audience savoring the moment -- it made me feel like all those years of struggle actually paid off!'



Dolph is generally very pleased and excited about his newfound directing career: 'As a director I feel there's a way to deliver on the expectations and still give the audience more than they bargained for on an emotional level. That's exactly what Clint Eastwood has done for years—he is one of my big role models. A man who went from television cowboy to one of the world's most respected actors and directors.'



'I'm just a bit younger than Mr. Eastwood so there's still time. As long as I keep working, learning and going to the gym...'



Shortly after ROCKY IV, Dolph Lundgren released his workout video, MAXIMUM POTENTIAL. After more than 25 years in show business, he is now finally working on his favorite project: fitness! Dolph is currently writing a fitness book for men and also developing a DVD workout series, personal training seminars, a personalized organic brand of vitamins and supplements, as well as a men's skin care product line.



For the past thirty years Dolph has stayed in great shape, both as an athlete and as an action star. 'My friends and fans have always been asking me for advice on training and nutrition, so I decided to put my own personal fitness regime down in writing', he explains. 'I guess the older I get still looking good -- the better the advertising for my products!' As Hollywood legend James Stewart once put it: It's not how good you are, it's how long you last...'



Dolph sums up his first twenty-five years in Hollywood:

'I've just tried to play my own game and treat everybody with respect. No matter who they are. That is something I'm proud of and I feel it will always pay off'.



Dolph Lundgren is married to Anette Qviberg-Lundgren, an interior decorator and fashion stylist. The couple and their two daughters currently reside in London, England and Marbella, Spain.

................................................................

The family of four was “destitute and attempting to maintain and limit the size of their family.”

A medication abortion, also known as the abortion pill, uses two different medications to terminate a pregnancy in its early stages, according to Planned Parenthood’s website. The procedure causes an abortion in 94 to 98 out of 100 cases when a woman is eight or fewer weeks pregnant, according to the organization. The abortion medication can be used in the first 10 weeks of pregnancy.

The lawsuit says Coons took the first medication at the Planned Parenthood clinic on San Mateo and was given instructions to take the second later.

The family returned to Boise, and the next day, Coons went to an emergency room with severe nausea. She was treated for dehydration and learned that her baby was fine and had a strong heartbeat.

A doctor there contacted Planned Parenthood and was told that Coons should take the next round of medication, which her attorney, John McCall, said she did. McCall declined to comment further on the lawsuit.

Days later, Coons spoke with Planned Parenthood staff who told her she should take a blood test to determine whether the medication worked. During that conversation, according to the lawsuit, Coons said she would like to have a second medication abortion if she was still pregnant.

The staff member told her she could receive a second procedure free of charge if she returned to New Mexico or she could visit a clinic in Idaho where she would have to pay for additional procedures, the lawsuit says.

By early March, a still-pregnant Coons told a Planned Parenthood staff member that she could not afford “a second round of the abortion protocol.”

................................................................

The lawsuit also says, “The fetus had now developed to somewhere around nine weeks. Ms. Coons could not morally sanction further action to terminate the fetus.”

Planned Parenthood then sent a letter to Coons warning that the medication she had taken can cause birth defects.

The couple’s son was born a month early “with jaundice and blood sugar issues.” And the family continues to worry that he “may carry a defect or injury into adulthood.”

“The defendant’s failure to properly supervise and administer the abortion service directly resulted in the failure of the pregnancy termination which resulted in injury to plaintiffs’ interests in family planning and their interests in financial planning for the future of their family,” the lawsuit says.

In addition to $765,000 in compensatory damages, the couple are seeking damages for breach of contract, unfair trade practices, violation of consumer protection laws and emotional distress, among other claims.

Named as defendants are two Planned Parenthood branches, the hospital in Boise where Coons sought treatment, and various medical personnel. It’s unclear where Ruiz and Coons live now.

The Planned Parenthood website says that in the “unlikely event that you are still pregnant” after the procedure, “you may need another dose of medication or to have an in-clinic abortion to end the pregnancy.”

In a statement, a spokeswoman for Planned Parenthood said she was unable to comment on pending litigation, and out of respect for patient privacy, she could not discuss specific patients."

Scallops, clams, mussels, and more

No. of described species: 10,000

First appearance: Lower Cambrian

Habitats: marine, estuarine, and freshwater

Shapes: mostly two-shelled; some worm-like

Feeding types: mostly suspension feeders; some detritivores

Bivalves are easily recognized by their two-halved shell. They can burrow into the sediment or live on the ocean floor. Some can even move around through the water by snapping their shell open and shut to swim. Not all bivalves still have a shell though; some have evolved a reduced shell or have completely lost the shell.

Throughout history, bivalves have been one of the most important marine animals to humans. They have been used for food, jewelry, decoration, even money.

Fossil record

The first occurrences of Bivalvia are found in Lower Cambrian deposits, but it is not until the Lower Ordovician that bivalve diversification, both taxonomic and ecological, explodes in the fossil record. This diversification continues unabated through the Phanerozoic, with relatively small losses at the end-Permian and end-Cretaceous extinction events. From relatively humble beginnings, they have diversified and expanded to become dominant members of most marine ecosystems.

Two extinct Cambrian bivalved groups include the Stenothecoida and the Siphonoconcha (Parkhaev 1998)  these may be nested within the Mollusca, but the absence of bilateral symmetry, enigmatic hinge structures, and shell composition places them outside of the Bivalvia as currently diagnosed.

One of the most interesting groups of bivalves, the rudists, went extinct during the Cretaceous-Tertiary mass extinction. These bivalves could be very large and often acted as the major substrate in Mesozoic reefs. Read more about rudists.

Life history & ecology

In most bivalves, the pallial cavity contains a pair of very large gills that are used to capture food particles suspended in the inhalant water current. The food is bound in mucus that is carried by cilia along food grooves on the edges of the gills to the mouth region. Here particles are sorted on the ciliated labial palps before they enter the mouth. The food then moves to the stomach, which is large and complex with sophisticated ciliary sorting mechanisms, and usually, a rotating hyaline rod which liberates enzymes into the stomach. Digestion is carried out in the large paired digestive diverticula (the stomach).

Many bivalves use their large foot to bury into the sediment on the ocean floor. They then extend a long siphon up to the surface to suck water in for filtering and breathing. You can often see these holes and the excurrent holes in mud flats at low tide. In many bivalve larvae or juveniles, a special gland, the byssal gland, can produce organic threads used for temporary attachment. In some groups, such as mussels, byssal threads permanently anchor the adults. A few groups of bivalves, such as oysters, are cemented permanently to the substrate.

Bivalves are hermaphroditic or have separate sexes. The eggs are typically small and not very yolk-rich. Fertilization is usually external, but in brooding species occurs in the mantle pallial cavity. For external fertilizers where the eggs and sperm are released into the water, the embryos often develop in the water column and go through both trochophore and veliger larval stages. Although morphologically similar to the gastropod veliger stage, phylogenetic analyses suggest that these larval stages are convergent and not homologous. Many other bivalves retain their eggs in the pallial cavity and suck in sperm with the inhalant water current. In some brooding bivalves the larvae develop in special pouches in the gills, or simply lie in the pallial cavity in others. Many brooding bivalves release their young as swimming veliger larvae while others retain them longer and release them as juveniles. Freshwater mussels (Unionoidea) have glochidial larvae that attach to fish as ectoparasites.

More on morphology

Bivalves are most easily recognized by their two shells (hence ""bi-valv-ia""). Their shells are comprised of a pair of laterally-compressed hinged valves and the pallial cavity surrounds the whole body.

The bivalve shell consists of two valves that are hinged dorsally, usually with shelly interlocking teeth (the hinge), and always with a horny ligament that connects the two valves along their dorsal surfaces and acts to force the valves apart. The interior of the valves contain scars of the various muscles attached to it, in particular the (usually two, sometimes one) adductor muscles that, on contraction, close the valves. The shell can also be internal, reduced or even absent as in shipworms (Teredo, Bankia).

Bivalves typically display bilateral symmetry both in shell and anatomy, but there are significant departures from this theme in taxa such as scallops and oysters.

Bivalves lack a head, radula, and jaws. Although the plesiomorphic feeding state for bivalves is probably deposit feeding utilizing long labial palps, the ctenidia provide an effective filter feeding mechanism in most taxa with numerous levels or grades of organization. In most bivalves, the mantle pallial cavity contains a pair of very large gills that are used to capture food particles suspended in the inhalant water current.

The visceral mass is primarily situated above the pallial cavity and continues ventrally into the foot. The intestine is irregularly looped and opens dorsally into the exhalant area. Also opening into this region are the paired kidneys and, when separate from the kidneys, the gonopores of the paired gonads. The heart typically lies below the center of the valves and consists of two auricles and a single ventricle that supplies both anterior and posterior aorta. The nervous system is made up of three pairs of ganglia. These innervate the musculature, mantle, viscera, ctenidia, and siphons.

The bivalve foot is modified as a powerful digging tool in many groups, while in those that live a permanently attached life (e.g., oysters), it is very reduced.

In most bivalves the two halves of the mantle are fused around the edges, with openings anteriorly for the foot and posteriorly for the exhalant opening through which the water is expelled from the pallial cavity. This exhalant also carries waste products and gametes. The inhalant opening, through which water is carried into the pallial cavity, is also posteriorly located in most bivalves, lying just below the exhalant opening. The mantle edge is also where contact is made with the external world and is, consequently where any sense organs are located. These are usually simple sensory cells but in some there are pallial eyes and/or sensory tentacles.

Systematics

Protobranchia

The protobranchs are mostly small-sized bivalves with the hinge typically composed of many small, similar teeth (taxodont condition). Notably, they include the so-called nut shells (Nuculidae). They differ from other bivalves in that their large labial palps are used in deposit feeding and the gills used only for respiration (most bivalves use their gills for filter-feeding). This group is entirely marine and the interior of the shell is nacreous in some families.

All protobranchs are shallow burrowers. One group, the Solemyidae, farm symbiotic bacteria in their gills for food and have a very reduced gut. There are about ten, mostly small-sized families in all. Many are found only in deep water.

Pteriomorpha

This important, entirely marine group comprises many of the most familiar (and delicious) bivalves: the scallops (Pectinidae), oysters (Ostraeidae), pearl oysters (Pteriidae), mussels (Mytilidae), and arcs (Arcidae), as well as about 18 other families. The hinge is taxodont (it has a few reduced teeth or is absent). A number of families have lost one of the adductor muscles (the monomyarian condition) and some have a nacreous shell interior.

Many pteriomorphs live as epifaunal animals being free-living, byssally attached, or cemented and have a reduced foot. The mussels seen on rocky shores in great numbers are an example of this type of lifestyle. Other pteriomorphs are shallow burrowers.

Scallops are interesting, as some species have primitive ""eyes"" which allow them to sense light variation. They often combine this with the ability to quickly flee from predators using jets of water squirted from between their shells.

Anomalodesmata

This rather diverse group includes the watering pot shells (Clavagellidae) and about a dozen other small families, some of which are found only in rather deep water. A few taxa are cemented to the substrate, but most are shallow burrowers and all are marine. One group of mostly deep-water families (collectively known as septibranchs) have the gills modified as pumping septa and feed on small crustaceans. The shells of some anomalodesmatans are nacreous and most have a simple hinge.

Rostroconchia

Rostroconches are an interesting extinct group of molluscs. It is thought that they are close relatives of modern bivalves. The larval shell was a single valve that transformed into a non-hinged, gaping bivalve shell as it grew. They probably evolved from helcionelloidean monoplacophorans in the Early Cambrian, underwent an extensive Late Cambrian and Early Ordovician radiation and survived until the Permian. Rostroconchs are thought to share common ancestry with the Bivalvia (Pojeta and Runnegar 1976; Waller 1998).

Heterodonta

This large group includes the majority of familiar burrowing bivalves: the clams, with more than 40 families including the very large family Veneridae; the cockles (Cardiidae), a family which includes the giant clams (previously Tridacnidae); mactrids or trough shells (Mactridae); and the tellins (Tellinidae). While most of the above groups are shallow burrowers, the heterodonts also include the deep-burrowing soft shelled clams (Myiidae), the ship worms (Teredinidae), and rock borers (Pholadidae). One family (Chamidae) are cemented and some members of the very diverse, mostly small-sized Galeommatoidea are commensals with a wide range of invertebrates.

The shells of heterodonts have a complex hinge comprised of relatively small numbers of different types of teeth and the shell is never nacreous. A few of their members live in fresh water (notably Corbiculidae and Sphaeriidae). The lucinids farm symbiotic bacteria in their gills which provide most of their food requirements.

Other important members of Heterodonta are the extinct rudist bivalves. These bivalves, once very important components of reef ecosystems, went extinct at the end of the Cretaceous period. Also included in the Heterodonta are the invasive zebra mussels of the superfamily Dreissenoidea.

Palaeoheterodonta

The Palaeoheterodonta includes the broach shells (Trigoniidae), marine living fossils; and the freshwater mussels arranged in two superfamilies: Unionoidea (Unioniidae, Hyriidae, Margaritiferidae), and Muteloidea (Mutelidae, Mycetopodidae and Etheridae). The shell interior is often nacreous and the hinge is composed of a few, often large, teeth. All are shallow burrowers. The freshwater mussels have glochidial larva that parasitize fish.

Brian Banks is a man on a mission.

After being wrongfully convicted of rape at 16 years old and spending 62 months in prison for a crime he didn’t commit, he’s sharing his story in the hopes of helping others.

In his upcoming Oxygen series, Final Appeal, Banks will attempt to educate the masses about the pitfalls that plague the current legal system. These problems often disproportionately affect black men.

While some may expect Banks to have a visceral reaction to very public allegations of sexual assault permeating headlines, we learned the former NFL player is just as serious about empowering sexual assault victims as he is about protecting the wrongfully accused.

“By the end of that day, I was being accused of kidnapping and rape.”

“In 2002, when I was 16 years old, I was on my way to USC on a full scholarship,” he tells theGrio.com in an exclusive interview. “I had one more year left to play high school football. I went to a known make-out spot at my high school with a girl who I’ve known since middle school, and we made out. We didn’t have sex. But by the end of that day, I was being accused of kidnapping and rape. I got arrested that very same day, July 8, 2002, and I did not come home until five years and two months later at the age of 22,” he said.

“Then I did an additional five years of strict custody parole. I had to wear a GPS tracking device on my ankle for five total years and register as a sex offender and all kinds of inhumane circumstances I had to deal with for an additional five years, post-prison. All for it to come to an end when the person who made these accusation up came forward and admitted she lied about everything.”

Answers never came

Banks’ accuser, Wanetta Gibson, never explained her true motives for making the false accusation.

“She recanted nine years later,” says Banks, still visibly rattled by a story he’s told dozens of times. “She was, in her words, ‘online on Facebook looking up friends from high school and saw how attractive I was and how much I had grown up,’ and she wanted to hook up,” he explained.

“We still really do not understand. She has pointed the finger at so many other people instead of at herself. She will tell you the initial lie grew and grew once others got involved. She blames a lot of other people when the blame falls on a number of people and a number of reasons why my wrongful conviction took place.”

After Banks’ conviction, Gibson won a $1.5 million judgment against the Long Beach Unified School District after suing them for being unsafe.

Consent is important, and so is justice

“I have been watching the news the last few months and all the headlines that have been coming out. The subject of force and the subject of consent and the subject of lying about it are two shi**y sides of the same stick. Supporting someone who has experienced being victimized like that and someone who has been wrongfully accused of doing that are both valid things to do,” he says.

Banks says he’s glad the #metoo movement has brought the subject of sexual assault to the forefront.

“I think where we are now and what this dialogue does is it opens up a discussion that needs to happen in our society, and that is about sexual assault, that is about consent, and that is about the process in which we go investigate these kinds of cases. I think it’s a discussion that needs to happen,” he explains.

“I think that people who have been sexually assaulted and want to speak up and seek justice for their experience should have the opportunity to do so. As someone who has been wrongfully convicted of rape, these are subjects I think we have to take our time with and be patient and investigate and make sure the right person is being held accountable.”

“These people… need to be prosecuted”

Following her recantation, Gibson was ordered to pay a $2.6 million judgment, including a $750,000 settlement to the LBUSD, plus attorney fees, interest and more than $1 million in punitive damages.

“The statute of limitations was expired for perjury. I would have absolutely pressed charges against her if I could. Part of my life was taken away because of her. But more importantly, you have to go after people like this because a person such as herself makes it harder for a woman who is raped to come forward confidently and share their story and hope something is done about what happened to them. They should be able to expect to be believed,” he says.

“For all the men and women who have been assaulted and for all the men and women who have been wrongfully convicted for these kinds of crimes, these people who make false claims need to be prosecuted.”

Some time ago I happened to read a discussion on Tony Isaacs’s Curezone, on the best treatment for breast cancer. The thread was started by a woman who had just been diagnosed with breast cancer.

Tony Isaacs’ partner Luella May suggested the forum member paint her breasts with iodine to combat the cancer and advised strongly against surgery and all other forms of conventional cancer treatments:

What does this mean? I can only mean that 98% were not cured – which means they died; look at this website, where it says: Chemo has a 97% fatality rate!

Some time later I read the same kind of unsettling statement concerning chemotherapy, this time posted on a discussion board of Breastcancer.org:

Where do these numbers come from??

The “2% chemo efficacy” comes from an Australian study into the contribution of chemotherapy to 5-year cancer survival, and the researchers claimed to have found that the average benefit of chemotherapy was about 2%. So: the study is about the contribution of chemotherapy to survival and not about survival of patients having chemotherapy.

For obvious reasons, this study has become immensely popular with alternative therapists and is quoted by them ad nauseam.

A rather strange phenomenon took place after the publication of this study: over time, the 2-3% contribution to survival had somehow become 2-3% plain survival – period. Some of these altmeds now actually claim the outcome of the study was that of all cancer patients receiving chemo, only 2-3% survive for more than 5 years.

In other words: chemotherapy kills an average 97% of cancer patients within 5 years.

Now, as these numbers sound totally weird – to say the least – we decided to find out if there was any truth in them.

What the study was about

The researchers stated as the aim of their study:

a literature search for randomised clinical trials reporting a 5-year survival benefit attributable solely to cytotoxic chemotherapy in adult malignancies.

So they wanted to know what the contribution was of chemotherapy to 5-year survival. There are many therapies to treat cancer: surgery, radiotherapy, hormonal therapy, immune therapy – and chemotherapy. The researchers wanted to know to what extent chemotherapy contributed to five-year-survival of cancer patients.

Of all 154,971 patients whose files were examined, in 3306 of these, 5-year survival could be attributed solely to chemotherapy.

In 98% of the patients, 5-year survival was due to a combination of factors, of which chemotherapy sometimes also was a factor and sometimes was not.

The researchers then extrapolated the outcomes to all cancers. The average 5-year cancer survival in Australia at the time of the study was 60%. On the basis of the extrapolation of the outcome of their study, the researchers estimated that the average contribution of chemotherapy to 5-year survival would be 2.3% in Australia and 2.1% in the USA.

Nowhere in the study does it say that only 3306 patients survived their chemotherapy and that consequently 151,665 patients died because of chemotherapy.

Leave out a few words and you get a completely different message.

The study design

The study was carried out in 2004, using data from 1998. A number of things can be said about the design of the study.

The researchers looked at a lot of cancers, but they didn’t look at all of them.

They did not differentiate between cancers for which chemotherapy is the primary treatment and cancers for which chemotherapy is only given as an adjuvant. This is the case in most solid cancers, for which surgery is the primary – and by far the most effective – treatment.

They did not include cancers for which chemotherapy is very effective, such as leukemia.

They did not include children’s cancers, some of which are highly responsive to treatment, e.g. Wilms’ tumour, with about 90% of patients surviving at least five years.

They did not differentiate between early stage cancers (tumour <1cm, no mets in lymph nodes), for which chemotherapy often is not even indicated, and late stage, incurable cancers which had already metastasized at the time of diagnosis, some even quite extensively.

They did not look at the effect of chemotherapy on life extension (median survival), which in my opinion they should have, since they included already incurable cancers in their study.

Correction for these factors would result in an average contribution of chemotherapy to 5-year survival of about 8%, based on the data from 1998.

Statistics: average and specific

It is important to keep in mind that a statistical average is always about middling, about the ‘mean.’ Statistics are never about the many deviations from the mean, such as your or anyone else’s specific situation.

A few examples:

1. Suppose the effect of chemotherapy on 5-year survival in leukemia is 60% and the effect of chemotherapy on 5-year survival of very early stage breastcancer is 0% (because: not indicated, therefore not administered). The average effect of chemotherapy on both cancers combined is 30% (60+0 : 2 = 30). But what does this overall average tell the individual patient regarding their prognosis? Well… nothing actually.

2. In a number of situations, depending on stage, grade and type of cancer, women with breast cancer are advised to take adjuvant chemotherapy, in order to destroy any (clinically invisible) micrometastases in their blood.

This kind of chemo improves the 10-year survival prognosis with an average 5 – 7%. The percentage is based on all women receiving adjavant chemo. If you don’t have micrometastases, the chemo will do nothing for your prognosis. However, for the women who do have them, the chemo may enhance their personal prognosis much more, sometimes as high as 20%.

3. Cancer with unknown primary tumour (CUP) has a very bad prognosis: average 5-year overall survival rate is about 10%. Yet there are cases known of patients who have been surviving for 14 years or more without any evidence of disease.

The big differences in the overall effects of chemotherapy on 5-year survival become obvious if we look at the tables in which the specific numbers are given for each particular cancer that was included in the study. In the 4th and 3rd column on the right you can see to what extent chemotherapy contributed to cancer survival. When chemotherapy was no factor in survival, the column shows a dash.

So… now what?

The data from the study are from 1998. We are now in 2009 and progress has been made in those years. There is better medication to diminish side effects of chemotherapy. There is new, sophisticated technology to assess which breast cancers are prone to metastasize and which are not, resulting in less women having to undergo chemotherapy. Scientists are working hard on similar tests for other cancers.

There are over 80 different kinds of chemotherapy. Some are sheer hell, but many are quite doable, including the one I had. Nevertheless: chemotherapy still is the ultimate cancer scare factor and the sooner we can do without it, the better. But it is not true that only 2-3% survive chemotherapy. It is not true that the average benefit of chemotherapy to 5-year survival is as low as 2%. And it is also not true that all chemotherapy is by definition completely and totally unbearable.

If we really want to get anywhere at all, then honesty about the facts, not manipulation, self-aggrandizing and scare mongering, should be the basis for discussion and decision making."	Is It True That Only 2 Or 3 % Of Cancer Patients Survive Chemotherapy?	2009-09-02 00:00:00	[]	['cancers', 'chemotherapy', 'chemo', 'survival', '5year', 'true', 'average', 'researchers', 'cancer', 'patients', 'survive', 'study']	"No, it’s not true: currently, the average cancer cure rate is close to 60%.
So: the study is about the contribution of chemotherapy to survival and not about survival of patients having chemotherapy.
In other words: chemotherapy kills an average 97% of cancer patients within 5 years.
Nowhere in the study does it say that only 3306 patients survived their chemotherapy and that consequently 151,665 patients died because of chemotherapy.
Suppose the effect of chemotherapy on 5-year survival in leukemia is 60% and the effect of chemotherapy on 5-year survival of very early stage breastcancer is 0% (because: not indicated, therefore not administered)."

Recently gas exploration is going in the desert of south east region of Saudi Arabia. This desert region is called Empty Quarter, which means in Arabic ""RAB - UL -KHAALEE""; this body has been found by ARAMCO exploration team. This proves what Allah SWT said in QURAN about the people of AAD nation and HOOD nation.



They were so tall, wide and very power full that they were able to pull out big trees just with the one hand. But what happen after when they become misguided and disobeys Allah SWT, Allah SWT destroyed the whole nation. ULEMA KIRAM of Saudi Arabia believes that this body belongs to AAD nation.



Saudi military took over this whole area. And nobody is allowed to go in this region except Saudi ARAMCO personnel's. Saudi government has kept it very secret but some military helicopters took pictures from air. And one of them he runs on internet here in Saudi Arabia.

Mirjam Heine Medical Student One to two percent of the main male population is considered as pedophiles. This means worldwide more than 57 million people. Therefore, pedophilia is not an irrelevant phenomenon we can ignore. It is unrelated to class status and educational level. The medical student Mirjam Heine explains how an appropriate approach to the unchangeable sexual orientation pedophilia might look like. She is mainly guided by the works of Prof Dr. Dr. Beier, the head of the institute for sexology and sexual medicine at the University Hospital Berlin and the prevention network “Kein Täter Werden” (meaning “don’t offend”). Hence, she also believes that no one is responsible for their sexual orientation, for their feelings, but that everyone is responsible for acting upon this sexual orientation. She also inquires how all of us can gain if we distinguish clearly between our feelings and our actions. Since pedophiles can’t change their sexual desires, they must learn to control them to not act upon them.

The important number of tombs and artifacts already discovered on the site suggests that it could have been the capital of an ancient empire, completely unknown to historians until now.

The site which was first noticed on satellite pictures taken in October 2013, using a newly developed ground-penetrating radar.

The images revealed many 90° angles and various common geographic figures over a 16 km2 area, leading the team of scientists to direct some archaeological excavations on the spot, starting in May 2014.

Over the last few months, many structures have been unearthed including what looks like a royal palace, a few temples, large rainwater reservoirs, workshops and dozens of houses.

Professor Walter Reese, in charge of the site, claims that the extent of the site and the superposition of various layers of constructions, suggests that it was occupied for 400 to 500 years, from approximately 470-80 AD, up until the 9th Century.

He believes that the city could have held between 20000 and 30000 inhabitants, making it the most important center of civilization in the Southern Pacific at the time.

“This was certainly the capital of a vast empire, that practised some sort of international trade” says Mr Reese. “The fact that we have discovered some bodies of various origins suggests that this state could have been a very influential throughout the Pacific islands and Southeast Asia. We have found many objects on the site that were obviously imported from other regions, like rice, flax or lacquer.”

The various artifacts gathered from the site suggest that the city flourished thanks to some form of control over various gold mining operations in Southern Australia.

The precious metal was purified and transformed by the hundreds of goldsmiths of the city before being traded for various other goods through an extensive network reaching as far as New Zealand, Indonesia, Malaysia, and even China and India.

Professor Reese believes that the city could have been abandoned after some climatic changes in the 9th Century brought a dramatic decrease in the level of rainfall, making the city unsustainable."

Steam Explosions, Earthquakes, and Volcanic Eruptions—What’s in Yellowstone’s Future?



Yellowstone, one of the world’s largest active volcanic systems, has produced several giant volcanic eruptions in the past few million years, as well as many smaller eruptions and steam explosions. Although no eruptions of lava or volcanic ash have occurred for many thousands of years, future eruptions are likely. In the next few hundred years, hazards will most probably be limited to ongoing geyser and hot-spring activity, occasional steam explosions, and moderate to large earthquakes. To better understand Yellowstone’s volcano and earthquake hazards and to help protect the public, the U.S. Geological Survey, the University of Utah, and Yellowstone National Park formed the Yellowstone Volcano Observatory, which continuously monitors activity in the region.

Each year, millions of visitors come to admire the hot springs and geysers of Yellowstone, the Nation’s first national park. Few are aware that these wonders are fueled by heat from a large reservoir of partially molten rock (magma), just a few miles beneath their feet. As this magma-which drives one of the world’s largest volcanic systems-rises, it pushes up the Earth’s crust beneath the Yellowstone Plateau.

Midway Geyser Basin in Yellowstone National Park appears otherworldly beneath stormy skies. In the background, steam vigorously rises from the hot waters of Grand Prismatic Spring, known for its rainbow colors produced by thermophilic (“heat loving”) organisms. Grand Prismatic is the largest hot spring in Yellowstone and the third largest in the world. This and other hydrothermal (hot water) features are among the main attractions for visitors to the park (inset photo). These features are fueled by heat from a large reservoir of partially molten rock (magma), just a few miles beneath Yellowstone, that drives one of the world’s largest volcanic systems. (Photograph courtesy of Robert Fournier; inset courtesy of Susan Mayfield.)

Stresses in the crust produce movements on faults, causing earthquakes to occur. Thousands of small quakes are recorded each year by the seismographic network of the Yellowstone Volcano Observatory (YVO), a partnership of the U.S. Geological Survey (USGS), the University of Utah, and Yellowstone National Park. Faults and fractures also allow surface water to penetrate to depth and become heated, rising again to produce hydrothermal (hot water) features, such as geysers. Steam and hot water carry huge quantities of thermal energy to the surface from the magma chamber below. Continuing up-and-down ground motions on the Yellowstone Plateau reflect the migration of both hydrothermal fluids and magma below the surface.

Ground motions, earthquakes, and hydrothermal activity are all current manifestations of volcanic activity at Yellowstone. In the not-so-distant geologic past, Yellowstone has produced many major volcanic eruptions, which have repeatedly reshaped its natural wonders.

Caldera-Forming Eruptions

The Yellowstone region has produced three exceedingly large volcanic eruptions in the past 2.1 million years. In each of these cataclysmic events, enormous volumes of magma erupted at the surface and into the atmosphere as mixtures of red-hot pumice, volcanic ash (small, jagged fragments of volcanic glass and rock), and gas that spread as pyroclastic (“fire-broken”) flows in all directions. Rapid withdrawal of such large volumes of magma from the subsurface then caused the ground to collapse, swallowing overlying mountains and creating broad cauldron-shaped volcanic depressions called “calderas.”

The first of these caldera-forming eruptions 2.1 million years ago created a widespread volcanic deposit known as the Huckleberry Ridge Tuff, an outcrop of which can be viewed at Golden Gate, south of Mammoth Hot Springs. This titanic event, one of the five largest individual volcanic eruptions known anywhere on the Earth, formed a caldera more than 60 miles (100 km) across.

The region’s most recent caldera-forming eruption 640,000 years ago created the 35-mile-wide, 50-mile-long (55 by 80 km) Yellowstone Caldera. Pyroclastic flows from this eruption left thick volcanic deposits known as the Lava Creek Tuff, which can be seen in the south-facing cliffs east of Madison, where they form the north wall of the caldera. Huge volumes of volcanic ash were blasted high into the atmosphere, and deposits of this ash can still be found in places as distant from Yellowstone as Iowa, Louisiana, and California.

Each of Yellowstone’s explosive caldera-forming eruptions occurred when large volumes of “rhyolitic” magma accumulated at shallow levels in the Earth’s crust, as little as 3 miles (5 km) below the surface. This highly viscous (thick and sticky) magma, charged with dissolved gas, then moved upward, stressing the crust and generating earthquakes. As the magma neared the surface and pressure decreased, the expanding gas caused violent explosions. Eruptions of rhyolite have been responsible for forming many of the world’s calderas, such as those at Katmai National Park, Alaska, which formed in an eruption in 1912, and at Long Valley, California.

If another large caldera-forming eruption were to occur at Yellowstone, its effects would be worldwide. Thick ash deposits would bury vast areas of the United States, and injection of huge volumes of volcanic gases into the atmosphere could drastically affect global climate. Fortunately, the Yellowstone volcanic system shows no signs that it is headed toward such an eruption. The probability of a large caldera-forming eruption within the next few thousand years is exceedingly low.

Lava Flows

More likely in Yellowstone than a large explosive caldera-forming eruption is eruption of a lava flow, which would be far less devastating. Since Yellowstone’s last caldera-forming eruption 640,000 years ago, about 30 eruptions of rhyolitic lava flows have nearly filled the Yellowstone Caldera. Other flows of rhyolite and basalt (a more fluid variety of lava) also have been extruded outside the caldera. Each day, visitors to the park drive and hike across the lavas that fill the caldera, most of which were erupted since 160,000 years ago, some as recently as about 70,000 years ago. These extensive rhyolite lavas are very large and thick, and some cover as much as 130 square miles (340 km2), twice the area of Washington, D.C. During eruption, these flows oozed slowly over the surface, moving at most a few hundred feet per day for several months to several years, destroying everything in their paths.

VOLCANIC HISTORY AND RECENT SEISMIC ACTIVITY IN THE YELLOWSTONE REGION

(Click the map for a larger version.) Yellowstone is home to one of the world’s largest active volcanic systems. Cataclysmic eruptions in the past few million years created huge volcanic depressions called “calderas.” The youngest, the Yellowstone Caldera, was formed 640,000 years ago. Since then, about 80 eruptions of rhyolite (thick, sticky lava) and basalt (more-fluid lava) have occurred. The caldera’s interior is largely covered by rhyolites, most erupted in the past 160,000 years. Large hydrothermal (steam)-explosion craters formed in the past 14,000 years are located near Yellowstone Lake and in major geyser basins. Recent earthquakes (1973 to 2002) were concentrated between Hebgen Lake and the Norris Geyser Basin and along faults.

Today, most of the landforms within the Yellowstone Caldera reflect the shapes of these young lava flows. Cliffs surrounding the Upper Geyser Basin near Old Faithful Geyser are the cooled steep flow fronts of once-slow-moving rhyolite lavas. Some narrow ridges and valleys on the Canyon-Norris road are corrugations on the surface of a 110,000-year-old rhyolite flow. These roughly concentric ridges formed as the thick, pasty lava slowly oozed northeastward, wrinkling its surface. Within the caldera, rivers and streams commonly occupy the gaps between individual lava flows, and springs emerge at the edges of flows.

Any renewed volcanic activity at Yellowstone would most likely take the form of such mainly nonexplosive lava eruptions. An eruption of lava could cause widespread havoc in the park, including fires and the loss of roads and facilities, but more distant areas would probably remain largely unaffected.

Since its last cataclysmic volcanic eruption 640,000 years ago, the Yellowstone region has had about 40 eruptions of slow-moving lava flows of rhyolite (a variety of molten rock that is thick and sticky). Some of these flows cover more than 100 square miles, and many are very thick, like this approximately 180,000-year-old rhyolite flow exposed at Obsidian Cliff. Although no lava has been erupted at Yellowstone for 70,000 years, future such eruptions are likely to occur. (USGS photograph by Robert Christiansen.)

Earthquakes

From 1,000 to 3,000 earthquakes typically occur each year within Yellowstone National Park and its immediate surroundings. Although most are too small to be felt, these quakes reflect the active nature of the Yellowstone region, one of the most seismically active areas in the United States. Each year, several quakes of magnitude 3 to 4 are felt by people in the park.

Although some quakes are caused by rising magma and hot-ground-water movement, many emanate from regional faults related to crustal stretching and mountain building. For example, major faults along the Teton, Madison, and Gallatin Ranges pass through the park and likely existed long before the beginning of volcanism there. Movements along many of these faults are capable of producing significant earthquakes. The most notable earthquake in Yellowstone’s recent history occurred in 1959. Centered near Hebgen Lake, just west of the park, it had a magnitude of 7.5. This quake caused $11 million in damage (equivalent to $70 million in 2005 dollars) and killed 28 people, most of them in a landslide that was triggered by the quake.

Geologists conclude that large earthquakes like the Hebgen Lake event are unlikely within the Yellowstone Caldera itself, because subsurface temperatures there are high, weakening the bedrock and making it less able to rupture. However, quakes within the caldera can be as large as magnitude 6.5. A quake of about this size that occurred in 1975 near Norris Geyser Basin was felt throughout the region.

Even distant earthquakes can affect Yellowstone. In November 2002, the magnitude 7.9 Denali Fault earthquake struck central Alaska, 1,900 miles (3,100 km) northwest of Yellowstone. Because this quake’s energy was focused toward the active Yellowstone volcanic and hydrothermal system, it triggered hundreds of small earthquakes there. The region’s hydrothermal system is highly sensitive to quakes and undergoes significant changes in their wake. Earthquakes may have the potential to cause Yellowstone’s hot-water system to destabilize and produce explosive hydrothermal eruptions.

EARTHQUAKES IN THE YELLOWSTONE REGION

The Yellowstone National Park region produces about 2,000 earthquakes each year. Most of these quakes are too small to be felt, but they reflect the active nature of the region, one of the most seismically active areas in the United States. The most powerful earthquake in Yellowstone’s recent history occurred in 1959. This quake was centered near Hebgen Lake, just west of the park, and had a magnitude (M) of 7.5. The Hebgen Lake earthquake killed 28 people-26 in a huge landslide triggered by the quake-and caused $11 million in damage (about $70 million in 2005 dollars). Numerous structures and roads in the region were severely damaged when hillsides collapsed, gaping cracks opened in the ground, and large blocks of rock were displaced. The Hebgen Lake quake caused widespread changes in Yellowstone-roads were closed throughout the area, some geysers stopped erupting, and others were newly formed or came back to life after years of dormancy. Also, the Old Faithful Inn was strongly shaken-pipes broke, a chimney collapsed, and the inn had to be evacuated. Although quakes of this magnitude are rare in the Yellowstone region, they are certain to occur in the future. To better understand this hazard and help protect the public, scientists of the Yellowstone Volcano Observatory (YVO) continually monitor the region’s seismic activity.

The owner of the house, then-70-year-old Mrs. Grace Miller, escaped only after kicking out her front door and leaping a 5-foot-wide ground crack as her house dropped into the lake.

Hydrothermal Explosions

The large magma reservoir beneath Yellowstone may have temperatures higher than 1,475°F (800°C), and the surrounding rocks are heated by it. Because of this, the average heat flow from the Earth’s interior at Yellowstone is about 30 times greater than that typical for areas elsewhere in the northern Rocky Mountains. As snowmelt and rainfall seep deep into the ground, they can absorb enough of this heat to raise the temperature of the ground water close to the boiling point. Geyser basins and other thermal areas in Yellowstone National Park are places where hot ground water has risen close to the surface. Research drilling at Yellowstone in the 1960s confirmed that the ground water beneath many of the park’s thermal areas is very hot. At Norris Geyser Basin, water temperatures as high as 460°F (238°C) were recorded at depths of only 1,090 feet (332 m).

Because the boiling point of water increases with increasing pressure and pressure increases with depth, deep water can be hotter than boiling water near the surface. If the pressure that confines this deep water is reduced quickly, pockets of water may suddenly boil, causing an explosion as the water is converted to steam. Such activity drives the eruptions of geysers, like Old Faithful, which are repetitive releases of plumes of steam and water. Rarely, steam explosions are more violent and can hurl water and rock thousands of feet. In Yellowstone’s geologic past, such violent events, called “hydrothermal explosions,” have occurred countless times, creating new landscapes of hills and craters.

A recent and notable hydrothermal explosion occurred in 1989 at Porkchop Geyser in Norris Geyser Basin. The remains of this explosion are still clearly visible today as an apron of rock debris 15 feet (5 m) across surrounding Porkchop’s central spring. In the 1880s and early 1890s, a series of powerful hydrothermal explosions and geyser eruptions occurred at Excelsior Geyser in the Midway Geyser Basin. Some of the explosions hurled large rocks as far as 50 feet (15 m).

Much larger hydrothermal explosions have occurred at Yellowstone in the recent geologic past. More than a dozen large hydrothermal-explosion craters formed between about 14,000 and 3,000 years ago, triggered by sudden changes in pressure of the hydrothermal system. Most of these craters are within the Yellowstone Caldera or along a north-south-trending zone between Norris and Mammoth Hot Springs.

The largest hydrothermal-explosion crater documented in the world is along the north edge of Yellowstone Lake in an embayment known as Mary Bay. This 1.5-mile (2.6 km)-diameter crater formed about 13,800 years ago and may have had several separate explosions in a short time interval. What specifically triggered these very large events is not firmly established, but earthquakes or a pressure release caused by melting glaciers or rapid changes in lake level may have been a significant factor.

These very large and violent hydrothermal explosions are independent of associated volcanism. None of the large hydrothermal events of the past 16,000 years has been followed by an eruption of magma. The deeper magma system appears to be unaffected even by spectacular steam explosions and crater excavations within the overlying hydrothermal system.

Although large hydrothermal explosions are a feature of Yellowstone’s recent geologic history, most explosions in historical times have been relatively small and have left craters at most a few yards across. For example, in early 2003, a long linear fissure appeared on a hillside above Nymph Lake, north of Norris Geyser Basin, venting steam and throwing bits of rock onto the surrounding hillside. Although most hydrothermal explosions in the park are small, their remains can be noticed by observant visitors and attest to the nearly continuous geologic activity at Yellowstone.

HYDROTHERMAL (STEAM) EXPLOSIONS AT YELLOWSTONE

Excelsior Geyser erupted in a series of violent hydrothermal explosions in the 1880s and early 1890s; one of these eruptions is shown in this colorized postcard made from a photograph. These were the largest such events to occur in the Yellowstone region in historical times. (Original photograph by F. Jay Haynes, 1888; date on postcard is incorrect.)

Geysers and hot springs are common expressions of a hydrothermal (hot water) system, but sometimes changes in “plumbing” result in large volumes of water suddenly flashing into steam, causing violent hydrothermal explosions. A large hydrothermal explosion can hurl water and rock thousands of feet and create new landscapes of hills and craters. In Yellowstone’s geologic past, hydrothermal explosions have occurred countless times. In 1881, Colonel Philetus W. Norris, Yellowstone National Park’s second superintendent, witnessed a spectacular hydrothermal explosion at Excelsior Geyser in the Midway Geyser Basin. He described the aftermath as follows: “The pool was considerably enlarged, its immediate borders swept entirely clear of all movable rock, enough of which had been hurled or forced back to form a ridge from knee to breast high at a distance of from 20 to 50 feet [ 6 to 15 m] from the ragged edge of the yawning chasm.” After a series of such explosions that ended in the early 1890s, Excelsior, once the world’s largest active geyser, became a quietly boiling hot spring. Except for several geyser eruptions in 1985, it has remained so ever since. A more recent hydrothermal explosion occurred in 1989 at Porkchop Geyser in Norris Geyser Basin. The remains of this explosion are still clearly visible today as a 15-foot (5 m)-diameter apron of rock debris surrounding Porkchop’s central spring. Much larger hydrothermal explosions have occurred at Yellowstone in the recent geologic past. The greatest concentration of hydrothermal-explosion craters lies around the north end of Yellowstone Lake. These craters owe their origins to spectacular explosions thousands of years ago.

Colonel Philetus W. Norris was Yellowstone National Park’s second superintendent (1877 to 1882). A decorated Civil War Union veteran, Norris enjoyed challenges, and his efforts were essential in putting the park’s management on a sound footing. (Photograph courtesy of the National Park Service.)

PREHISTORIC CALDERA-FORMING ERUPTIONS OF YELLOWSTONE

Eruptions of the Yellowstone volcanic system have included the two largest volcanic eruptions in North America in the past few million years; the third largest was at Long Valley in California and produced the Bishop ash bed. The biggest of the Yellowstone eruptions occurred 2.1 million years ago, depositing the Huckleberry Ridge ash bed. These eruptions left behind huge volcanic depressions called “calderas” and spread volcanic ash over large parts of North America (see map). If another large caldera-forming eruption were to occur at Yellowstone, its effects would be worldwide. Thick ash deposits would bury vast areas of the United States, and injection of huge volumes of volcanic gases into the atmosphere could drastically affect global climate. Fortunately, the Yellowstone volcanic system shows no signs that it is headed toward such an eruption in the near future. In fact, the probability of any such event occurring at Yellowstone within the next few thousand years is exceedingly low.

Volcanic ash, like this ash from the 1980 eruption of Mount St. Helens, is made up of tiny jagged particles of rock and glass. Even a light dusting of volcanic ash can pose a health hazard to people and animals and damage crops, electronics, and machinery. Heavy ash fall, such as that from a large caldera-forming eruption, would devastate the surrounding area and affected areas downwind.

How Big Were the Yellowstone Eruptions?

Explosive eruptions are best compared by recalculating the volume of erupted volcanic ash and pumice (see photos) in terms of the original volume of molten rock (magma) released (shown in this diagram by orange spheres). On this basis, the 585 cubic miles (mi3) of magma that was erupted from Yellowstone 2.1 million years ago (Ma) was nearly 6,000 times greater than the volume released in the 1980 eruption of Mount St. Helens, Washington, which killed 57 people and caused damage exceeding $1 billion. Even the 1815 Tambora, Indonesia, eruption—the largest on Earth in the past two centuries—was more than five times smaller than the smallest of Yellowstone’s three great prehistoric eruptions at 1.3 Ma.

HAZARDOUS EVENTS AT YELLOWSTONE

Scientists evaluate natural-hazard levels by combining their knowledge of the frequency and the severity of hazardous events. In the Yellowstone region, damaging hydrothermal explosions and earthquakes can occur several times a century. Lava flows and small volcanic eruptions occur only rarely—none in the past 70,000 years. Massive caldera-forming eruptions, though the most potentially devastating of Yellowstone’s hazards, are extremely rare—only three have occurred in the past several million years. U.S. Geological Survey, University of Utah, and National Park Service scientists with the Yellowstone Volcano Observatory (YVO) see no evidence that another such cataclysmic eruption will occur at Yellowstone in the foreseeable future. Recurrence intervals of these events are neither regular nor predictable.

How Dangerous Is Yellowstone?

None of the events described above—cataclysmic caldera-forming eruptions, lava flows, large earthquakes, or major hydrothermal explosions—are common in Yellowstone. Although visitors to Yellowstone National Park may never experience them, some hazardous events are certain to occur in the future. Fortunately, systematic monitoring of Yellowstone’s active volcanic and hydrothermal systems, including monitoring of earthquakes and ground deformation, is now carried out routinely by YVO scientists. This monitoring will allow YVO to alert the public well in advance of any future volcanic eruptions. Currently the ability to reliably predict large quakes or hydrothermal explosions, events more likely than a volcanic eruption, remains a challenge. However, changes in the patterns of ongoing seismicity or other indicators of possible geologic unrest are quickly reported to officials responsible for public safety in the National Park Service and other agencies.

Through continuous monitoring and research, YVO is greatly improving understanding of Yellowstone’s volcanic, earthquake, and hydrothermal hazards. The work of USGS scientists with YVO is only part of the USGS Volcano Hazards Program’s ongoing efforts to protect people’s lives and property in all of the volcanic regions of the United States, including California, Hawaii, Alaska, and the Pacific Northwest.

In my view this is a good thing. Science is our friend. Obama’s heart is in the right place. Nonetheless, the order raises a number of ethical and practical issues.

The term ‘behavioral sciences’ is a little broad. However, the executive order mentions the behavioral economics and psychology of decision making as an example of what is in mind. This indicates that what this order is really about is the implementation of ‘nudge’ policies. Some have objected to such policies on the grounds that they violate autonomy or dignity in some way. Perhaps that is right, although it appears to depend on the case at hand. As Cass Sunstein – who has been influential for the Obama administration’s stance on the importance of behavioural science – has pointed out, nudges are inevitable in policy making. A failure to take this into account ensures that the nudges in play will be unintentional rather than intentional. Further, considerations of welfare, autonomy, and fairness may very well support nudge policies in many instances.

This will depend heavily on the effectiveness of the nudge policy, which itself depends in part on the quality of the behavioral science. Given recent evidence that many results from experimental and social psychology fail to replicate, there might be reason to worry here. The executive order does not define what counts as an ‘insight’ from behavioral science. Is it the result of one study? A couple? Deployment of an insight that is nothing more than an experimental artifact could be damaging, or wasteful.

Suppose a genuine insight exists. Even so, implementing it is not straightforward. The executive order reflects thought on this matter, as it encourages executive departments and agencies to:

(i) identify policies, programs, and operations where applying behavioral science insights may yield substantial improvements in public welfare, program outcomes, and program cost effectiveness; (ii) develop strategies for applying behavioral science insights to programs and, where possible, rigorously test and evaluate the impact of these insights; (iii) recruit behavioral science experts to join the Federal Government as necessary to achieve the goals of this directive; and (iv) strengthen agency relationships with the research community to better use empirical findings from the behavioral sciences.

This seems like solid advice, although in practice – given the state of behavioral science – there is sure to be some trial and error in following it.

This is not a post on the ethics of horrible journalism, so I won’t comment overmuch on just how silly and paranoid the response to this directive has been from various conservative publications. Nor will I dignify the publications I have in mind with links. But it is worth noting that beneath the scaremongering you may see regarding this directive may be a legitimate concern. It is this: greater government attention to behavioral science data creates a motivation to collect and analyze and implement such data more generally. This is an issue much broader than the implementation of nudge policy-making, but it affects this policy-making as well. Since the relevant kind of data can be both collected and implemented in ways we would deem unethical, it is important that government collection and use of such data be highly transparent. The executive order makes provisions for a yearly report by the National Science and Technology Council that will summarize “agency implementation of section 1 of this order each year until 2019.” That’s some transparency, but arguably not enough – much more can be done to keep the public informed regarding the use of behavioral science in guiding policy. Ideally, the scientists assisting in this initiative would be given explicit roles in so informing the public."

Zuckerberg said the decision to shut down Facebook was difficult, but that he does not think people will be upset.

“I personally don’t think it’s a big deal,” he said in a private phone interview to a source close to a friend. “And to be honest, I think it’s for the better. Without Facebook, people will have to go outside and make real friends. That’s always a good thing.”

The Ass Press

Posted: 09/01/2012 6:00:12 PM PDT

Petersburg, KY — In a move that is shocking the nation, Missouri Representative Todd Akin has agreed to Bill Nye’s challenge for a debate in science. The announcement was made this afternoon at a press conference held at the Creation Museum in Kentucky. “I accept Bill ‘Lies’ the Science Guy and his challenge for a debate,” Akin told reporters. “He’ll quickly learn that the word of god will always win over the word of some guy.”

The Akin/Nye feud started with Akin’s recent statements regarding “legitimate” rape and homosexuality. Akin claims that science educator Nye has angered god with a Youtube video in which he says creationism “hurts kids”. He also claims that Nye is to blame for Hurricane Issac – the deadly storm currently heading towards New Orleans.

Nye was quick to respond to Akin’s comments during a live interview Thursday on the Smithsonian Channel. Nye called Akin “a f*cking idiot” for accusing him of personally starting Hurricane Issac.

“Look, these people, they’re f*cking retarded,” Nye said. “Rape can’t cause pregnancy? Breast milk cures homosexuality? I caused a hurricane by challenging creationism? Who can possibly take these people seriously anymore?”

Nye went on to say, “It used to be these Republicans didn’t believe in global warming or evolution. That was bad enough. Now they don’t even believe in egg + sperm = baby. Where does Todd Akin think babies come from? Does he think there are separate storks for people who were raped and people who weren’t? Hey look over there! It’s the rape stork. It drops it’s babies directly at the orphanage.”

That’s when Nye offered the challenge of a science debate with Akin. “So Todd I got an offer for you. You and me. Any time. Any place. Debating science mano-a-mano. I’ll bring the facts, and you bring the Vaseline. Because your ass is gonna f*cking need it when I’m done whipping.”

“This name calling by Bill just shows his true colors,” Akin told reporters. “That’s how all these atheists are. They anger god with their gays in the military, lesbians on the Supreme Court, all this promiscuity in Hollywood and in music and on the streets. Then we have this guy Bill Nye going around saying we can’t teach the word of god to our children! Of course this angers god and that is what is causing these hurricanes.”

Akin finished the press conference by agreeing to Nye’s challenge for a debate. “Bill Nye said any place, any time. Well I’m naming the Creation Museum in Kentucky, September 15th at noon sharp. I’ll be there to debate real, legitimate science. We’ll see if Bill has the guts to show up.”

Paul Horner who is an executive at NBC has already agreed to air the debate if Nye agrees to Akin’s terms. “This will be the debate of the century,” says Horner. “Forget about the Presidential debates, I wanna see Bill Nye versus Todd Akin.”

Nye has yet to respond. The Creation Museum is located at 2800 Bullittsburg Church Rd. Petersburg, KY 41080."

https://www.snopes.com/fact-check/politiqs/	a new harvard study has shown that liberals have a lower average iq than conservatives.	false	['Not Necessarily The News']		David Mikkelson	['https://iahymnewsnetwork.wordpress.com/2011/08/10/new-study-shows-liberals-have-a-lower-average-iq-than-conservatives/']	https://iahymnewsnetwork.wordpress.com/2011/08/10/new-study-shows-liberals-have-a-lower-average-iq-than-conservatives/	https://iahymnewsnetwork.wordpress.com/	"No, don’t go anywhere.

We need to talk. I’ll keep it brief.

Below is a fake news article I wrote around six years ago as a joke, trying to show a friend how easy it is to come up with an article that looks plausible and official At the bottom of the page, there is a message saying that this is bullshit, clearly and blatantly, just to make sure nobody took this seriously.

And yet, despite this article being the most poorly written piece of shit and probably the worst joke I have ever made, it has been taken so seriously that I have 256 comments awaiting approval, snopes has had to debunk it by noting the last paragraph, and I’ve had NUMEROUS cases of people sending this link to me as an argument.

This is a microcosm of a very serious problem.

We have a serious problem with fake news in this country, and if you have come across this page, you probably googled something to the effect of IQ and political views.

Please, stop.

If you keep googling things like this, you’re going to find what you’re looking for. You’re going to find one of those fake/fictitious news websites run by think tanks or fringe political groups, and you’re going to read what you want to hear.

Except, next time, you won’t come across this message. You won’t come across the disclaimer at the bottom saying this bullshit.

Because while I was just a kid trying to make a point, the other news sources are not. They are political groups who want more than anything to tell you what you want to hear and gull you to join their ranks.

You need to do better. You need to check sources, you need to confirm what people are saying is true, even when you agree with them.

Especially when you agree with them.

If you believe what people say because they look like they’re telling the truth, because you agree with them and you assume that they know what they’re talking about, then you are going to be brainwashed, you are going to be gulled, you are going to be fooled. They’ll lie to you more and more.

Save yourself, and help save everyone else from this epidemic. Don’t get gulled. Don’t become some liar’s follower.

Check sources, especially when you want the story to be right. If you see something you agree with, don’t be a fool and nod your head then move on like so many have with this page.

Stop, look at the source, follow the numbers, read some abstracts, figure out how they came to that conclusion and why. That way, if what someone says is true, you won’t just think it’s true, you’ll know it’s true. And if it’s not, you will have discovered a liar, and no matter how much you wish what they said were true, call them out — because the only thing worse than ignorance is willful ignorance.

Ask questions, think critically. We do not want a future run by liars and their followers.

That’s all.

And now, back to this.

A new study conducted at Harvard University shows that in America, Liberals have a significantly lower IQ than Conservatives. The study was conducted on 100,000 registered voters in 40 different states over the last twelve years, and has concluded its results.

The first part of the study lists the correlation between political beliefs and intelligence. Subjects of the study were chosen at random and requested to come to an unmarked van to take a test and answer some questions for a reasonable amount of money.

Of the 100,000 people, there were people from many doctrines, from conservative to liberal to marxist to fascist. Socialists came out on bottom, with an average IQ of 87. The second worst were Liberals and then Marxists, with 88 and 89 respectively. Conservatives received an average score of 110, which is significantly above average. However, the conservatives did not score the highest. The holder of second place were Communists with an average I.Q of 115, and the first place was apolitical people who did not follow any specific doctrine, who received a whopping score on average of 135.

IAHYM News attempted to interview President Barack Obama on the new find, but he refused to speak directly. Instead, while walking down the strange hallway, he told correspondent Joseph Ducreux that the study

was ridiculous and false, but failed to provide any reason as to why or

how the science of the study is at fault.

Hilary Rodham Clinton was also contacted, but she immediately hung up

the phone when she figured out that the study was being mentioned at all.

Other parts of the study included the daily activities of the various people based on their doctrines. Apparently, Liberals are five times more likely to commit a crime, steal or cheat on a test than anybody else except for Socialists, 52% of which have committed a major felony while being watched. Conservatives not only did not commit any crimes, but they actually prevented them, as the few events where a Conservative was threatened by a thief or mugger was hindered by a concealed handgun. Also, Communists are the most likely to commit rape or sexual assault, second to socialists.

The study was conducted in other countries as well, where 81% of Muslim Extremists admitted to following the Liberal doctrine and idolizing President Barack Obama. The study was conducted by a group of roughly 900 different scientists across the country over the past twelve years, each one taking on a little over a hundred people per person.

Reporting from New York City, this is John Bowling.

Oh yeah, and everything in that bullshit you just read is completely and totally false. There has been no such conclusive study, and all of the “Finds” are based on public paranoia.

Lawrence was scheduled to checkout this morning after 10 AM. At approximately 10:15 AM, a maid named Verna Del Sosa went to Lawrence’s room to clean and thats when Lawrence’s body was discovered on the floor. “I was shocked, I’ve never seen a dead body before”, says Del Sosa. Del Sosa immediately called for an ambulance but it was too late. According to the paramedics, it appears that Lawrence’s body laid lifeless on the hotel floor for several days.

An autopsy is scheduled to take place Thursday which will hopefully uncover the mystery of Martin Lawrence’s death. So far, foul play is not suspected but has not been ruled out. Martin Lawrence was anticipating shooting the third installment in the “Bad Boys” trilogy alongside long-time friend, Will Smith. Filming was supposed to begin next month in Miami, Florida.

Born April 16, 1965 in Germany to US military parents, Martin Lawrence began his career doing stand-up comedy which landed him his own HBO sitcom, Martin staring Tichina Arnold. Following the success of Martin, Lawrence took to the big screen and starred in many films such as Life, Bad Boys 1 & 2, Blue Streak, Big Momma’s House and many more.

He leaves behind three daughters and two ex wives, and several brothers and sisters. (source factory78) we don’t know how true this is.

That announcement was un- fortunate, for the reason that no publication of dimensions can be properly executed within so brief a period. Moreover, the new office now being opened in Kansas City has, since the Klonvokation, absorbed much of your Kligrapfs time. The Kknvokation, from beginning to end, was enthusiastic, livery pointed utterance was received with hearty applause. However, applause in print — especially in pointed argumenta- tive or impassioned address— has a tendency to diminish, rather than to enhance, the reader s interest, Hence the applause noted by the stenographers, in reporting the principal messages, has been eliminated, H.

""Oh, God, our Heavenly Father, we i . i ma- that we can call Thee Father, and we realize that the very name |.|< nds for us as we come to the Mercy Seat, because it is the joy and |.|. imurc and privilege of a father to provide for his children. We I Thee, our Heavenly Father, that Jesus Christ taught us this r< lationship we have with Thee. We recall how our earthly hthcrs cared for us in childhood; how they prayed for our welfare; in the stillness of the night, when we were awakened by a | .< luful dream and would cry out in terror and father's hand would I nd upon us and calm us and bring us peace and sleep again. We I .11 how our earthly fathers planned a home for us, a place where Id abide and enjoy that sweet relationship. Oh God, our we realize our needs as we come to Thee today. We pray for I i. ■ l)i\ inc Spirit to brood over us and give unto us a conscienceness I 1 1 1 v Divine presence as we meet here in this Klonvokation. We . i, m.i rhec, our 1 [eavenly Father, for the blessings of the past. We I I In c for the victory Thou hast given to us, thus far. We be- lli al Thou hast been leading us throughout the nation, and we i, , ■ . U j veri to Thee the praise and the glory. (t We thank Thee, our Heavenly Father, for our Imperial Wizard; we love him for his work's sake; a ad we have followed him through the months with our prayers. We have asked God to guide him that he might walk with Jesus Christ, as the two walked with Him on the way to Emmaus, when their hearts burned within them; and, our Father, we have prayed that the Klansmen of the nation might follow him as he walks with Jesus. Oh God, we pray for every blessing upon him. We ask that Thou wilt enable him to feel Thy Divine presence, and that each of us may realize that as we follow him in his leader- ship God is directing us in all our ways. We pray for Thy blessings upon his official family, that each member may be consecrated to God and to His service. We pray that the one passion in every soul may be that God shall be honored in this great movement, and that Jesus Christ may be crowned King of kings and Lord of lords in every heart and in every life. Oh, God, we pray, in the opening of this Klonvokation, that Thou wilt brood over us and make us to be silent in Thy presence, and that each man here may strip himself of every selfish ambition, every desire except the one desire to do the will of God throughout this Klonvokation. Oh, God, lead us, we pray Thee. ""And now, as we wait in Thy presence, we turn the listening ear and soul toward Heaven and humbly ask God to speak to us. Lord, speak to us as Thou didst speak to the Disciples in the upper chamber at Jerusalem. Give us the message Thou wouldst have us deliver to the nation, and through the nation to the world. Oh, God, save America, and through America save the world. Our Father, we pray now that Thou wilt make each of us to realize Thy presence and Thy blessings; and in every committee to be appointed and in all the work to be attempted, wilt Thou guide and direct and give us the victory in this Klonvokation and throughout life. We ask it all in Jesus' name, and for His sake, Amen."" Klansman Campbell continued: ""I have been requested to conduct the devotional exercises, and one request made of me is that I read the twelfth chapter of Romans. I am going to read from a new version, because I believe it gives to us a clearer meaning and new light upon this great chapter that will bring us closer to God. I am going to read from Weymouth's translation: i. I plead with you therefore, brethren, by the compassion of God, to present all your faculties to Him as a living and holy sacrifice acceptable to Him. This with you will be an act of reasonable worship. x. And do not follow the customs of the present age, but be transformed by the entire renewal of your minds, so that you may learn by experience what Clod's will tl that will wliitli \i ijoml ;tn<! In ;m! Hul .nnl (»r h i I . [| - |. For through the authority graciously given to me I warn every individual among Ly not to value himself unduly, but to cultivate sobriety of judgment in accordance b the amount of faith which God has allowed to each one. 4. For just as there are in the one human body many parts, and these parts have not till the same function, So collectively we form one body in Christ, while individually wc are linked to mother as its members. i, But since we have special gifts which differ in accordance with the diversified work omly entrusted to us, if it is prophecy, let the prophet speak in exact proportion to lith. 7 If it is the gift of administration let the administrator exercise a sound judgment li duties. H The teacher must do the same in his teaching; and he who exhorts others, in his I J [ation. He who gives should be liberal; he who is in authority should be energetic I ,!, rt ; and he who succors the afflicted should do it cheerfully. 9 Let your love be perfectly sincere. Regard with horror what is evil; cling to what | .irdil. 19, As for brotherly love, be affectionate to one another; in matters of worldly 1 „ . yield to one another. * Do not be indolent when zeal is required. 1 1 . Be thoroughly warm-hearted, The Lord's own servants, full of joyful hope, patient under persecution, earnest ind persistent in prayer. , .,. Relieve the necessities of God's people; always practice hospitality. I 4, Invoke blessings on your persecutors— blessings, not curses. i V Rejoice with those who rejoice; weep with those who weep. rf Have full sympathy with one another. Do not give your mind to high things, 1 , humble ways content you. Do not be wise in your own conceits. 1 I have read only a part of this matchless chapter for the reason . I, ,1 I have been asked to conduct a brief devotional service. I desire to for only a few minutes upon the Cross in Klankr aft— what it ns to me, or the significance of the Fiery Cross. There is one thing, only one thing in all Klandom, that symbolizes sacrifice; it is , | |( ] (< , y Cross— the Cross which in ancient times was the instrument uf torture and the symbol of ignominy and shame, which when touched I chi fingers of the Klansman 's Criterion of Character was transformed , a symbol of light and life and salvation. My brethren, I never m I n a Klavern and stand before a prepared altar where the Fiery I ... • looks clown upon me, its Holy Light blazing forth all the sacred I uljtions of the past, nor behold the blazing symbol mounting the lummil oi a hill or a mountain peak, nor behold it as it gives light 1, feci of K lansmen in parades through the streets of a great city, 1 do not wish that I myself and every Klansman in the nation Id cry with the Apostle Paul: 'I am crucified with Christ; never- .1,, 1, 1 i,,. ; V ri 001 I bui Christ livcth in me; and the life which I 1 1 now live in the flesh I live by the faith of the Son of God, who loved me, and gave himself for me.' To my mind this is the greatest utter- ance that ever fell from mortal lips. It emanated from the mind of the greatest scholar, the greatest intellectual giant that ever called phil- osophers and theologians to delve into the hidden mind to reveal truth that they might understand God's program for mankind. It came warm from the heart and hot from the lips of the most marvelous character, save the Master, that ever stamped his personality upon a guilty world. It came welling up from the soul of the mightiest preacher of righteousness that ever called the guilty people to their knees in penitence before God or ever published the unsearchable riches of Jesus Christ until men everywhere have heard of Him, whom to know is life eternal. It came warm from the heart of a man who lingered long upon Calvary, bathing in the shadow of the Cross — breathing in its mystery, ""I would that every Klansman in the nation could behold that Cross as Paul beheld it, and cry with him: 'God forbid that I should glory, save in the cross of our Lord Jesus Christ, by whom the world is crucified unto me, and I unto the world.' If every Klansman in the nation could say that with Paul, America would be safe for Amer- icans from this day to the end of time. ' 'That uplifted Fiery Cross calls me to a life of consecration to Christ and country and Klan, because of what Christ is to me. Jesus Chtist, our Criterion of character, means little or nothing to vast mul- titudes of men. The glory of His life and the deity of His person are not seen by all the multiplied millions of men; but those of us who have felt the sting and the stain and the blot and the bite and the bitterness of sin have come to Him for cleansing, and have found it. Yea, those of us who have been snatched from the hand of eternal burning by the hand that gives life, and gives it more abundantly, feel that we should exclaim with Paul: 'God forbid that I should glory save in the cross of Christ!' ""Brethren, I see in Jesus my individual sacrifice for sin, when He stretched Himself upon that cruel Cross and the nails were driven in His hands and feet, and He cried: 'Father, forgive them; for they know not what they do.' I was in His mind and heart that day, as much as if there were no other souls in all the world. And when He expired saying, Tt is finished/ He had me in His mind and heart, for He was my personal sacrifice for sin. ""Some years ago, a minister of the gospel, traveling through West- ern Missouri, stopped at a farm house. After the meal, he was invited bv the head of the house to come into a room for the i vening devoi ion. i i. observed that the chairs were arranged in a semi-circle, and that ,i hi i le girl of perhaps eleven years sat beside her father — holding his I, mi. I. The door opened and a beautiful girl of seventeen or eighteen i.n crs entered. She, too, sat down by the father, who immediately | id a chapter of Holy Writ and then led the little company in fervent 1 .1 iycr. Some weeks later the minister passed that way again and came itpuit the little country church, the grove of which was hlled with horses and buggies. He entered and beheld the minister speaking 1S a black casket to the grief-stricken audience. When per- mission was given for the people to look for the last time upon the In. .,( their departed fellow-citizen, the beautiful young girl arose I went softly and reverently to the casket. She endeavored to pick up i he hand that was stiff and cold in death, but could not. She then Mtltly removed the glove and kissed that scarred hand again and I tin and wailed out her soul. ( Oh, this hand, this hand,* she cried, i.- I love it, how I love it, the hand that was mangled to save iin how I love itV ""K kinsmen, with eyes of faith, may we, this afternoon, behold an- i hand — the hand that was mangled on Calvary's Cross for you I for me. And may we each exclaim in our hearts: 'How I love n how I love it!' Jesus paid our debt, and now we are free— He LI i hat we might live. 'Jesus is not only our great sacrifice, but He is the individual n iv in Heaven for every one who accepts Him as Savior. Each stands before the Court of High Heaven, before God and the tnjl Is, and we are guilty, every man of us, of high treason against thi I ing of kings and Lord of lords— and the penalty of our crime || death. My brothers, there is only one lawyer admitted to the bar i I >t vine Justice, only one who understands Divine Love. If you not committed your case into His hands, woe unto you! If ■ u have retained Him, He stands before the Court, pleads His own n i id. r as full satisfaction of the Law's demands and prays that you I freed. He has paid it all. ""I feci that I should consecrate my life to Him, to the Klan, to \in« i u .i and to all mankind— because He sacrificed Himself for me. ii us nie to be a witness for Him, a witness to His saving grace ►wcr. He wants me to be a co-worker with Him for the redemp- >l the world . i MiMiuii, ttiy time has nearly expired. However, in conclusion, K CO -iv that (lie uplifted Fiery Cross comforts the souls of all I,., ri V< N nil\ look upon it; and it enables them the better to do ill. it purl hi redeeming America and making it the Light House oi the world — it makes them more loyal and zealous in serving and sacrificing for the right. Keeping step with the Master and daily striving to emulate His example — this is the sacrifice, if sacrifice it may be called, which Klansmen offer that America and the world may be saved. Are you ready to lay all your consecrated power of manhood on the altar this afternoon as a token of love and gratitude to Him, and to say; 4 By the help of Almighty God, I determine that from this hour on I will so live that I can hand down to future generations the standard of what a real American ought to be; that I will seek to make America the first of all the nations to fulfill the will of God and to crown Jesus Lord of all?' ""Von Winkelried made an opening in the Austrian lines by rush- ing forward and embracing all the spears he could encirle with his arms and turning them into his own breast, until they bore him to the ground — thus opening the way for his comrades to rush forward to victory. Are you, my fellow Klansmen, willing to say that, if necessary, aT the darts of the enemies of America may pierce your hearts? I can say that, if necessary, the spears of our country's foes shall bury their sharp points in the heart of one son of America, that America mav be saved and that through America the world may be saved, Cf I imagine some one is saying: 'Preacher, there is so little that I can do — so little influence that I can exert.' Listen, Klansmen, we are going to accomplish this task in America when every man of us does his part— then, and not until then. 'An illustration, just here, to enforce the truth I am trying to rivet in your minds and hearts. Some years ago, at a summer resort, in a large hotel, which had an immense room used for dancing and at times for the orchestra to entertain the people as they sat about, a little girl sat down at the piano and began playing a tune, the only one she knew — 'Go Tell Aunt Bettie the Old Gray Goose Is Dead/ She played it with just two fingers, and kept on playing it until it got on the nerves of the people. They endeavored in every possible way to induce her to cease playing, but she continued thumping: 4 Go Tell Aunt Bettie the Old Gray Goose Is Dead,' A great musician strolled in, and said to the child: Tittle Miss, suppose you and I play a duet. You play down there, and I will play up here.' As his skilled fingers swept the keys, he let out of his heart a mighty compo- sition; the music rolled through the hotel and out to the veranda, and the people listened — sucfc richness of sound they had never be- fore heard. They entered the room, and listened with breathless silence until the music ceased. Turning i<> the audience, the musician 'Ladies and gentlemen, permit me to introduce the little Miss has furnished the entertainment.' Klansmen, you and I may play imperfectly upon the harp of What we send forth may be nothing but discords— like those mI nounding brass and tinkling cymbals. However, if we play our to the glory of God, the Great Musician will fill in the music • innot produce; the music from our harps will sweep through the -H i idors of Heaven, and it will entertain and uplift America and the mil And, by and by, we will stand before the arch-angels, intro- i I .is the Klansmen who furnished the music that attracted the i. in ion of America and made America safe for Americans and the i of civilization. ""I wonder how many men hete this afternoon are willing to put -I your hearts every selfish thought, every unholy ambition, 1 1 1. 1 10 empty yourselves that God may come in and speak to you. « ill who desire this blessing stand for a few moments in silent i , then I will briefly close the prayer. Do you want to do this Do you want to be remembered before the Throne of Grace? ■ vou want to say: 'Let God have His way in this Klonvokation, >i.l I. i ( rod be praised?'

""Mr. Chairman, Imperial Wizard, Officers of the Knights of the Ku Klux Klan and Gentlemen of this Kfonvo- kation: I have been asked to address you \ extending a welcome on behalf of Kansas City. I suspect that you think it a rather inconsistent attitude for me to take if you have been reading our daily press; but , gentlemen, I do not edit the newspapers of Kansas City. Were I to do so j I am sure that they would be in sympathy with Klan- kraft. ■ But since it seems to be the will of those who have charge of this Klonvokation that I must thus persecute you, I shall proceed to do it. ""Now, that is my business here today; but I want you to feel that I consider this one of the greatest pleasures I have experienced in my life. It is because I love Klankraft, and in my short address to you I want to talk to you not only as a man who welcomes you to the fair city on the Kaw, but as a man who is waging common warfare in behalf of the very things for which you stand. As we look back over the last six, seven, eight or nine months, we are constrained to feel that you as the representatives of this great body of men have much for which to be thankful. In the first place, men, the things that you have done in the last few months have made safe for Earl B. Mayfield the Senate of the United States. Also, you have made possible the fact that Hiram Wesley Evans, the Executive of this great body that is running into millions, is the most powerful man before the bar of public opinion in America today. And the best part of it is, men, this great Executive of Klanktaft is a God-fearing, honest, American citizen. And, speaking for him, he is proud to say that you men, the representatives of this great body, are God-fearing, honest citizens in the great political life of America today. ""I am pleased to welcome you men to Kansas City, representatives of this great body of men running into millions, whose ideals are known at the high dome of Heaven and whose lives are consecrated to live and die for the re-baptism of the Protestant faith that you might thereby make safe our national life. For this, men, you have] no apologies to make, and for this you will permit no man to apolo- gize for you. What a change the last few months have been in the old order of things! I can remember just a few months distant when we were read out, figuratively and actually speaking, of the national life of America. Why, it was only yesterday that an attempt was made to read us out of the Democratic party; and alter that attemm was made, the people thai represented thai greai political body in our 1 1 , ( j I life were crucifying the Klan on the altar of hope— but since Maine election, what a dreadful silence comes from the The politicians controlled, or they appeared to control, underfill political body of men who have made history for | , ., . It reminds me of the little boy who had hold of the electric I. ..... \ . and he could not drop it. It also reminds me of the story I icll you— and those of you who have heard me tell it before will i. . ■ pardon my repeating it. Little Georgie McCarron— some of you him. We call him 'Handsome George.' George loves to iJ so do I. We have experienced that wonderful delight in i . jgether. One time, while out in the Rockies hunting, look- up on the mountain side (we had been unable for several | to obtain cream for coffee), George said: , I can not drln I i ui Fee any longer unless I get some cream, and what am I going About that time, to our surprise, there was a little rustle on 1 1., mountain side, and here stepped forward a Bossey cow. George "" I have got it now.' He got a little tin pail, sat down on a stone a tmenced milking. About that time, the cow hit him with lil and he said: 'Dog gone you.'

When i had descended the mountain side, George untied the tail and ...I 'Why haven't I thought of this before?' That reminds me of (hi politicians who have tried to crucify the Klan, and in their mpi they say: 'Now, why haven't we thought of it before?' in, Kansas City is glad to welcome you.

""Mr. Chairman, Your Lordship and Fellow Klansmen: It Is with some embarrassment that I undertake to dis- charge the duty devolving upon me as a representative of the Klans- men of this great State, the State of Missouri. Nevertheless, I would not shirk the responsibility. I know that no words nor eloquence could express the delight and pleasure, not only of myself, but also of thousands of my fellow Klansmen, in welcoming and greeting so splendid a body of men— gathered here from all sections of our great nation. We know you have come with noble purposes and high aims, bent upon a real service in giving due consideration to the grave and important affairs appertaining to the best interest of our home- land and our Order. The preservation and maintenance of the splen- did heritage that is ours is worthy of our best thought and effort. It is ours by the unselfish services and sacrifices of those splendid and courageous men and women of the past, who thought and acted, not in terms of 'self,' but 'others,' making possible a nation of Free- men—a nation dedicated to the service of humanity, and thereby making possible the greatest civilization of all countries and all time. To maintain it, to preserve it, is the supreme duty of every loyal Citizen, true American and true Klansman; and God forbid that we should forget the price that was paid— in hardship, service and sacrifice— that we might be the beneficiaries of so rich a blessing. Your purpose justifies this gathering, and your presence indicates your interest in the great cause represented by our noble Order— the Knights bf the Ku Klux Klan. ; ""You are meeting on historic ground, at what was once the gate- way to the West— then big with prophecy, but now even greater, for the present is only the childhood of progress and achievement. ""Historically/ the importance of Kansas City cannot be over- estimated or overstated. Within the life of men still living, this point was the place to which all roads from the New England, Middle Atlantic and Southern States led. And from this point radiated to the great Northwest, West and Southwest those trails over which the sturdy and indomitable pioneers of our own generation wended their fearless way, facing the dangers and enduring the hardships that they might conquer the wilderness and plains country, that they might establish and build that civilization common to our nation— m behalf of humanity. This story has been immortalized in prose, verse and song; but from the gigantic services and sacrifices comes a splen ; did fruition, back to this point to be distributed to all sections of our country— those things essential to the maintaining and pre- serving of a great population undreamed of by those heroic frontiers- men. ""This gtv:n unsettled and unexplored region, a few short years .... has become the happy homes of millions upon millions of Amen- st manhood and womanhood; and It has made its contribution (1 only to the physical necessities of our teeming population, but ., the mental and spiritual side of our national life, so that no ■n affecting, in any way, the building of our glorious civiliza- ,, be understood and grasped apart from this historic center. in- almost the central position between the Atlantic and , i the Gulf and Canada, it becomes the very center of all that i .

AMERICANISM APPLIED By Governor Clifford Walker of Georgia ""Mr Chairman, and Klansrnen: We accept the evidences of the hospitality of this wonderful city and this great State in the same spirit in which it is tendered to us. Its importance Is magnified by reason of the cause which brings us here. My contribution to this evening s exercises will be a reminder that in the years of the recent past a new I aristocracy has been born-the aristocracy of service, service of our fellow men. In the days of our boyhood, we were told of an aristocracy of class, an aristocracy of wealth, an aristocracy of society. In these later years, this new aristocracy has been born . It has found expression in a series of new luncheon clubs, the Rotary, the Kiwams, the Civitan and others, whose motto, in different language, yet the same in sub- stance, is 'We serve, we build/ ""I suggest that the old orders, secret societies— the Masons, the Odd Fellows, Knights of Pythias, and others— must take into account, if they would prosper and be perpetuated, this new aristocracy that was written in the very mud sills of the foundation of the Uni- verse itself; the aristocracy that was articulated by that Master Ser- vant, that Prince of Peace, when He said: 'If any man would be first among you, let him be the last of all, and the servant of all. 'It is the spirit, expressed in the words of the poet An old man traveling a lone highway, Came at evening, cold and gray, To a chasm deep and wide ; The old man crossed in the twilight dim, The sullen stream held no fear for him, But he turned when he reached the other side, And builded a bridge to span the tide. Old Man,' cried a fellow pilgrim near, 'You are wasting your strength with your building here. You never again will pass this way, Your journey will end with the ending day. You have crossed the chasm deep and wide, Why build this bridge ar eventide?' But the builder raised his old gray head, 'Good friend, in the path I have come/ he said, 'There folio weth after me today, A youth whose feet must pass this way. This chasm which has been but naught to me To that fair-beaded youth may a pitfall be; Ik, too, must cross in the twilighi dim, Good friend, I am buiJ ling chii bridgi foi him ' bfdid must be that soul, and narrow the vision, of the Klansman , , , « his hour cannot hear the footfalls of the millions of American tnd girls who are following after us. So, for my contribution hour, I would suggest that, if our Order is to be perpetuated, ith the others, we must begin today to build the bridges across i jms that lie in the pathway of the American youth of tomorrow. 1 have time to suggest but two or three of these chasms. An abys- m ,| . |, ism is the chasm of ignorance, with its handmaidens— super- | prejudice and passion. I remind you that it is the tendency ns of a democracy to forget the blessings of government.

They were citizens of England, of Scotland, of Ireland, ,j i„ |.. ml u, and of the other Northern and Western States of Europe. h id their homes, their families, their loved ones, their friends, „,. .cries, their lodges, their churches.

Yet those forefathers, yours i ■ kft their homes and their firesides, their friends, their , their cities, their churches, they turned their backs upon , . i that was dear to them, and sailed across an unknown ocean I ,„ unl. nown land— a land of privation and suffering and sacrifice. I km been bold enough to come half way across this continent ou Klansrnen and Americans, today, why? did your forefathers leave their homes and loved ones, every- „ was dear to them, to cross the Atlantic and establish this V ls it to found a country wherein every inhabitant should |ti , n and not a subject, free from tyranny and oppression? Yes. Oid they come across the sea to build a nation wherein no citizen , hM | >( ,,, knee to king or czar or emperor? Where every man could i |p< ! according to the dictates of his own conscience? Yes. I | tblish a democratic form of government? Yes. All of that. ,11 j that, ray friends, you have heard since the days hildhood. ! come to suggest that the vision of those v , infinitely broader than all that. They saw ■ t | l( „ , , ss the seas a nation of real democracy; a democracy H |, and noi oJ form, a democracy of the individual and not „, , d racy wh< every embryi citizen, without ■ I respect to class or creed or condition, should have a fair chance in life; a land where every boy, every girl on the farm, in the shop, in ] the' store, however circumscribed in condition, however handicapped in position, however limited In opportunities, should have a fair chance— not only a legal right, but a fair chance—to step out into the limelight of real opportunity, to grow, to develop, to mature, physically, mentally, and morally, into full blown man- hood and womanhood. ""Now having suggested that, I come frankly and openly to ask you have we builded here such a nation as was in the minds and the souls of our forefathers? Have we builded. a State that even approxi- mates the vision of those forefathers? ""I am not here to sound a pessimistic note, I have no dark, no dismal, no depressing sentiments to express. We have builded here a great nation. Our schools and our colleges ate crowded, such as they are; we have improved wonderfully the highways of our nation,; we have established at least the foundation of modern health depart- ments in our State— wonderful progress, in a measure. Yet I cite to you the fact that in all the States with which I am acquainted, all uplifting and inspiring agencies are crying out for the very breath of ! life, and suffering growing pains, so much so that if they measure upj to pressing opportunities and advantages to the youth of the land>j they will have to double and then quadruple the proceeds for the main- tenance of every such institution. ""If the colleges of your State are sending forth hundreds ofgradl nates annually, I come to ask what of the ten thousands up in the mountains, and across the plains, who are crying out for such an opportunity? While at this hour we are here enjoying the enlighten- ment and elevating fellowship of this wonderful gathering, I am ask- ing you what of the masses on the outside? Your State, like mine, is graduating annually a few thousand from the accredited high schools' One-half of those graduates of the high schools will find M doors of our colleges locked to their entrance if they apply, becauj of a lack of room— dormitory space, equipment of laboratory and other appliances necessary for their entertainment and their education^ ""Ah, that is somewhat of a sad picture. But what of the oth half of the boys and girls of America who never have seen a colleg or a high school; those boys and those girls out on the farm, an in the store, and in the shops, whose only approach to manhood an to womanhood, whose only solution of the problems and of the bless* Ings and the comforts of life are through those one-teachcredcunpaintd ichooi houses, without pictures, withoui aughi to inspiri to the 1 ! | | lie tic, to the divine— those antiquated and antedated school and schools averaging from three to four and five months in if? I want to say in frankness that it will not do to conclude that or girl of today has the chance that his or her forefathers i he seas had in their minds and hearts for them in this democracy Hi. individual. It is true that occasionally you will find isolated ■. where boys or girls go away from home and wait on the I i ep books at night, and do a thousand other things, and by iwii effort finally succeed in educating themselves. I have not I of censure; I have the other extreme, the very extreme, and . in. ■ , admiration for them. It is true that Abraham Lincoln never I high school or a college. But I call your attention to the fact where, and somehow, Abraham Lincoln and his fellows of ;s had the spark of inspiration and of ambition kindled in ill Is. point is this: we have not measured up to even the shadow obligation, under the vision of our forefathers, until we have ,1. to the other half of the boys and girls who themselves have not 1 . 1 1 !.. of inspiration kindled in their souls, who have not waked Who have not found themselves, that opportunity. for acquiring I I is true that there are thousands of boys and girls who, if they I.m'.Ii schools and colleges at their front doors would not take I ; , of that opportunity. But that still does not answer our i non to the tens of thousands of boys and girls on the moun- lidi s, and on the sandy slopes and in the plains of this nation, I crying out for a chance— for a chance. If Daniel Webster / Cla y and Abraham Lincoln and John C. Calhoun illuminated of American history and illustrated American manhood, in hci j use somehow and somewhere the spark of ambition was i i heir souls, and their hands and their hearts were attuned i ion of progress and of development in their lives.

The answer is to educate the boys and girls of America. Consolidate your country schools, give them— every boy and every girl— entrance into a high class, nine months, high grade high school. In God's name, let us not penalize a boy or a girl simply because he or she happened to be born in the country. Give them the same chances that you give to the boy or the girl who happens to be born in the town or the city, ""The answer to all problems of America is education. Train the citizen to think straight, and all of our problems, civic and political, will be solved. Train men and women to think straight, and bol- shevism, radicalism and every other noxious ism will vanish away. Train the man to think straight, and he will treat his neighbor fairly. Moreover, he will never rest until his neighbor treats his neighbor fairly. When that system is carried out to its last analysis then the spirit of brotherly love, peace and good-will will prevail; it will overflow the boundaries of America; and we will go on and on until every nation on the globe permits the same spirit to dominate and to control; and then war will cease, and we will have the world for which we pray to God. ""In God's name, brethren, let us at this hour dedicate our lives to at least laying the foundation— of building the bridge acrosj the chasm of ignorance and superstitution and hatred and passion f this Klonvokation assembled. ""The next chasm, and one closely associated and aligned with it, is the chasm of isolation. We need to build better highways] better roads, in America. Build a modern highway, and every foot of land in miles of it will double in value. Your agricultural interest: 1 will prosper, business will be strengthened, your social fabric anc social life will be revolutionized. The light of civilization, of refine- ment, of education, will follow. By every appeal, every appeal td man, let me urge that all our people be given the supreme advantages of modern highway construction. Those highways are absolutely necessary before we can realize the ambition to give the modern con- solidated school and educate our people.

""But it is a far different thing, an infinitely different thing, when a Roman Catholic secretary of an over-indulgent president so manipu- lates the chicanery of politics that he will place in the center of every national war camp a Roman Catholic church, and drive outside of the border of that camp, on the back streets, in the back yard, on the alley-ways, every Presbyterian, every Methodist $n& every Baptist, and every other Protestant church, ""It is a far different thing when a gang of Roman Catholic priests takes charge of a national convention of a great political party, and orders that party to nominate a Roman Catholic for president — the^ equivalent of saying: 'You shall not nominate a Protestant for presi- dent of the United States.' ""It is a far different thing, fellow Klansmen, for the Roman Catho- lic Church to organise a secret, oath-bound society whose member- ship is limited to Roman Catholics, a society whose members vote like one man at the behest of a foreign leader, and then say that it will drive out of America any number of Protestants who see fit toi establish for themselves a secret and oath-bound organization that^ may, if they will vote like one man, preserve the integrity of Amer- ican democratic institutions. ""We have no light to make upon the Roman Catholic, no light upon the Roman Catholic Church, no fight upon the Roman Catholic creed, no fight upon the Roman Catholic religion. We are here to protect, as the fundamental of our American government, and the basis of our American Constitution, the right of religious freedom in America. ""Let me say with equal frankness and earnestness that this Organ- ization, as I see and understand it, has no fight to make upon the foreigner as a foreigner. Carrying you back again to the beginning of this nation, I remind you that our forefathers, every one of them, were foreigners. If you can, make proper provision for the labor con- ditions of this Union, and I admit it entirely proper and fair and wise that provision be made for labor and capital (they are togcthct- interested, and equally interested in the solution of that problem}] but if that problem permits, I have no objection i<> ;i reasonable nunv ■ des, of Norwegians or of any other type of those Northern m States of Europe coming into this country— if in coming rhcy intend to make one hundred per cent Americans.

Yet I do not be- ,Imi i h.i i as< ■ tided the pinna* le, the supreme high point of that conception. In my judgment, those forefathers saw here an asylum of democracy, of liberty, and of freedom — the seed corn of democracy and freedom for all the nations of the earth. Let me say in only terms of suggestion that if the democracy which I have feebly described to you — freedom of religion, freedom of speech, freedom of thought, freedom of worship, right to assemble, all the fundamentals of the American institutions of democracy — if such democracy is best for the boy and the girl of America, then as an American and as a Klans- man, I want to say to you that that form of democracy is also best for the boy and the girl in France, in Germany, in Japan and in China, and it is the hope of the world. It rests with the democracy of America to lead those nations into peace. ""My final suggestion, brethren, is that, although we have had a nation here for some hundred and fifty years, the democracy of America is still in the experimental stage. The eyes of the world are upon us, and upon our form of government. If democracy, true de- mocracy of the individual, is to reign in the other nations, thenwej must crown this government of ours with final success; and if it does succeed permanently, it will succeed upon the basis, the foundation stones, which I have indicated to you today. If there is to be peace on earth, if war is to be ended, and there shall be the reign of the Golden- Rule, then the leadership is in your hands and in mine as American citizens. ""I come with my final word to ask; What are you going to do about it? What did you come here for? On a frolic? To have a good time? Or did you come to get inspiration to serve your fellow men, for the making of better citizens, in this new empire of America? Down in a Southern State one of the great public utilities has a motto, a very popular and a very inspiring one: 'It is great to be a Georgian.' It is great to be a Georgian, and I know some of you will agree with me that it is great to be a Nebraskan, and it is great to be a Kansan,; and it is great to be a Texan. But, boys, I want to say to you in this hour of our nation's crisis, in this call for leadership that comes outM from all the nations of the earth, a man is indeed not a Georgian, he is not a Nebraskan, he is not a Texan, if he does not dedicate every thought and every service of his soul to the uplift of his people, and to the progress of his State.

' AMERICA AT THE CROSS ROADS By A Distinguished Klansman ""Mr, Chairman, Your Excellency, Klansmen, Americans: There is given to me the very great pleasure this afternoon of responding to the address of welcome which has been delivered to us by the Grand Dragon of Missouri in behalf of the Klansmen of Missouri and the Central West, I wish to say, at the very outset, that I do not hope to attain to the high levels of thought and eloquence of the man who has delivered us this remarkable and splendid address of welcome. I, however, do hope that I shall match him in the sincerity of my purpose, and in the earnestness of my heart, as I shall try to make vocal and articulate the feelings of the Klansmen who have come here from the various parts of the nation, as we try in this brief address to express the appreciation that we feel for the remarkable welcome that has been delivered. ""The Grand Dragon of the Realm of Missouri has called our at- tention to the fact that the city of Kansas City is known as the heart I of America. I am wondering if there is not a double significance in that slogan today. Is it not a fact that, in a very true sense of the word, this Klonvokation assembled here in this city is the heart of America? ""Are not the Klansmen, here gathered from our far flung battle lines, men who exemplify in life and character the great principles underlying our national civilization? And may it not be a fact, also, that out from this Klonvokation through all the arteries of our great; national life there will flow the life blood that will make our nation better, more nearly what God and its founders intended it should be? ""The Grand Dragon of the Realm of Missouri has said in his wel- coming words to us that we are at the gateway of the great West, a beautiful symbol. We are glad that we are here enjoying this great Central West. We are inspired by the broad stretches and by the beautiful scenery, and by the limitless opportunities; but I ask again, may not that slogan have a double and a deeper significance? Shall not this Klonvokation be a gateway to a larger service for humanity, to a larger service for America? Shall we not go out from this place] with enlarged hearts and deepened consecration to be better citizens of our great country, and to spread abroad these great principles ofl justice and liberty for which we stand?

""What do I find in regard to the churches of this country— tl faith of our fathers, that glorious faith? They gave it to us. Ho is it in America today, the faith of our fathers? Is it alive, virile, driving? Ah, my friends, I must confess to you that the faith of ouij fathers is today assaulted by a modern materialistic civilization that finds no place for God in His Universe. ""The faith of our fathers is, assaulted by a pseudo-ecclesiasticisd that would deny man the privilege of going direct to his Creator with his needs, and his prayers for help. We must come back again to the faith of our fathers'. The result of this carelessness on the part of the people of our nation in regard to the deeper things of life has closed the doors of thousands of Protestant churches; others, today, if not boarded up, are attended only by a handful of people, ministered to by discouraged shepherds. Men, in the old Book, for which we stand and whose teachings we revere, there is a statement that has never been contradicted, and which cannot be gainsaid. That state*] ment says that the nation that forgets God shall be turned into hell If you look up the derivation of that word 'hell' you will see that it means confusion, trouble and disorder. What is the condition o: America today, when last year more than io,ooo people were killec in this country by the hand of the murderer? What is the condition of America, when by actual statistics we have seventeen times as much crime in this country as they have in England? Men, I cannot but hi serious today as I tell you that in all history there has never beei} recorded a nation that succeeded and continued that forgot religion And there never will be such a nation. ""This Klonvokation must be a call to our knees, a call to prayed and a call to communion with God. We join with you Klansmen o the great Central West, and ask you to unite with us, that we shal go down from here with the faith of our fathers in our own hearuj and lives. ""What condition do we discover out in the broad stretches as Wl look at our schools. Schools! Klansmen believe in schools— -the) believe in one school, in a free public school. Klansmen believe tha if ail the children of this nation, of whatever creed, were educate! in one free public school there would be less rancor and discorj and misunderstanding between the various races and creeds withif our borders. We stand for one great public school system for all o( our people. 1 111 my friends, some of the criticisms that are passed upon our ,< hool in these days are justified. If we are to preach one , ublii school system for all people, then our school system must . i\ best system — measured by every standard that is good. I I., wl find in our school system today? I am afraid that many ducators have forgotten the real purpose of education. Our .h,I. have become a training ground of intellect and not a train- ud of patriotism and character.

Many of our, people do not even exercise their right of suffrage, with the result that a few tricky, scheming politicians often control whole sections of our nation. What is the great duty, then, of Klansmen in the political arena? What is the duty of every one of us?

""Therefore, upon us devolves the great responsibility of bringing home to the people their imperative duty before God— then, second an an informed and active electorate. ""What do we find as we look out over the homes of the nation? Ah, my friends, we know that the home is the chief cornerstone oi our' national life. The home has ever been the pride of America The influence of the father and of the mother upon their childred has been a guiding and molding influence as these children have gone out from the homes and into the active life of the country But what have we today in the homes of America? With shamed face I have to admit that there is the most flagrant disregard for the moj sacred obligations of life.

We will noj say to them that in their religion they are not as much in their right as we are; for our Constitution declares for them the right, as it declares for us, the right to worship God according to the dictates of con- science. We call our Roman friends brothers and say to them: *So long as you are about your prayers, and so long as you are aboufj your religion and your civic duties, we shall not quarrel with you— you shall be our brothers and our co-workers. But we wish to warn you that if you have a divided allegiance, if you owe allegiance toj any power foreign to America, then the united hosts of Klansmenl millions strong, will rise up and say to you, and it is our perfect! legitimate right to say this, that the seat of our government for Amer-j ica is on the Potomac, and not on the Tiber.' ""On those things we stand firm. And we shall also say with] equal frankness and determination that America has but one language,] that America has andmust have only one school, and that so long as the| keep their hands off those things that are American and do not in an] way try to make them un-American, just so long will we co-operate with them and call them our fellow-workers. ""I believe, my friends, that we are at the threshhold of a new day. I believe the Knights of the Ku Klux Klan is the instrument in t§ hands of Almighty God in bringing about the"" purposes that He del sires to accomplish. He has counted us faithful, putting us into this ministry, and I declare to you that, if we keep our heads, if we keep o\ hearts clean, if we keep our zeal at white heat, if we go on perfecting our plans and accomplishing our purposes, within one decaJ of today every fair-minded man and woman in America will than] the Knights of the Ku Klux Klan that they saved America in one her most awful crises, ""But I say to you with equal earnestness that if the Knights the Ku Klux Klan are recreant to duty, if we lose the vision that Go< Almighty has given us, if we allow ourselves to be sidetracked switched off into any by-paths, if we allow division or rancor to gel within our ranks, if we lose the high and noble purpose that haj called us together, then God Almighty will take the work He 1 ' given to us from our hands and give it to another. God's purpl will not fail, and cannot fail; but we will not be His servants in a< complishing this great purpose i£ we fail in our duty. Tf we stan« true and firm, He will bless us in our efforts.

We shall see our tning forward again to a proper appreciation of God and of ch, and of religion as a part of life, and a part of the daily H mm of every man. We shall see this nation coming forward to I valuation of a school system that will educate children not money making machines, but will educate them in the funda- I Christian character and integrity, and in truth.

""Brethren: We shall worship God in the red ing of a few verses from His Book, our Book, preceding the chapt* that was read yesterday, I want to start with the 32-nd verse of the 1: chapter of Paul's Letter to the Romans, then to read in conclusion tj first verse of the twelfth chapter: For God hath concluded them all in unbelief, that he might have mercy upon alj the depth of the riches both of the wisdom and knowledge of God! how i searchable are his judgments, and his ways past finding out! For who hath known the mind of the Lord? or who hath been his counselj Or who hath first given to him, and it shall be recompensed unto him again? For of him, and through him, and to him, are all things: to whom be glo forever. 1 Bestcch you therefore, brethren, by the mercies of God, that ye present yo bodies a Imtig sacrifice, holy, acceptable unto God, which is your reasonable servia ""In the few minutes that I shall use this morning in this devotion! service, I want to talk to you about spiritualizing the Klan. We wlj are Klansmen believe in our hearts that the Klan was spiritual in its in ception. We believe that it was raised up of God to meet a grea need in America, in a crisis hour. We believe that the Klan in us have, first of all, the spiritual vision. Born of God it is spiritua and, above every other work that it has to do, its work must j spiritual. ""The Klan is either Christian or it is not Christian- It is an oj ganization that is either building a temple unto the Most High Go a temple of service that shall last throughout the countless ages I eternity, or it is tearing down the work of Calvary. ""This must be our vision. Without vision the people peris! and without the spiritual vision the Klan shall perish from the earfl Its work must be spiritual. We are hearing much today about th Americanizing of America; but, brethren, I declare to you that Americ is not America unless it is Christian and the un- Americans can nevj become Americans unless they be Christianized.

H^ I taken a text this morning, I think it would have been the first ye* of the twelfth chapter of Romans. Paul is speaking about a livin sacrifice. If the world has ever needed men who are ready to la down their bodies, unreservedly and without question, for the cad of righteousness, that hour has approached. A living sacrifice- living sacrifice of selfish ambition. Oh that we might get away fror self— the thought of selfish gain or selfish position! A living saa fice in the name of Jesus Christ, for the building of His Kingdom I earth among men-this is what Paul is emphasizing. Such is hoi sacrifice, acceptable unto God. -No other service save that which is unselfish is acceptable! the sight of God. It must be an unselfish service, it must be, wi| out question, undying loyalty to Christ^to His cause, our cans. This alone will guarantee victory for our great Organization Rend( unto Caesar the things that belong to Caesar, and unto God the thirj that belong to God. But, brethren, it is utterly impossible for ! man to render to society the things that belong to society until I has surrendered his all to God. No man can claim merit within hid self. No man's hand is strong enough to conquer the enemy-sit No man can afford to stand alone. The only reason you and I h« for living— our only excuse for rubbing elbows with men-is tn we may render unto men, unto society, all that we, in the name Christ, owe them; and we owe society the righteousness Jesus Chi came to establish throughout the earth. * 'The Kian is of God, and the gates of Hell shall not prevail again it All the powers of night shall not hide its light, all the forces the enemy shall not penetrate its line; for 'if God be for us, wl can be against us?'

https://www.snopes.com/fact-check/gringo/	the word gringo came from mexicans overhearing american soldiers sing the song green grow the lilacs during the mexicanamerican war.	false	['Story Time']		David Mikkelson	['http://www.contemplator.com/america/lilacs.html']	http://www.contemplator.com/america/lilacs.html	http://www.contemplator.com/	"This ballad is based on a similar song, Green Grows the Laurel, that was popular in 17th century Scotland. The American ballad tells the story of an American soldier's love for a Mexican lass. Though I don't have the words for the earlier version, it evidently had a similar theme, albeit with different nationalities. There are countless versions of the song, I have included only two. One story of the songs origin speculates that Cowboys in South Texas loved to sing the song. Across the way, Mexicans, who could not understand the words, could only hear ""GREEN GROW"". So white Americans became known as ""Gringo"" by the Mexicans. However, other scholars date the term to the incursion of American troops in Mexico to search for Pancho Villa.

Green grow the lilacs, all sparkling with dew

I'm lonely, my darling, since parting with you;

But by our next meeting I'll hope to prove true

And change the green lilacs to the Red, White and Blue.



Green grow the lilacs reminding me of

The ones that I brought you with all of my love,

The gates of my country will open for you

And change the green lilacs to the Red, White and Blue.



Green grow the lilacs, Your favorite flow'r,

So sweetly perfuming - a sad parting hour.

Oh send me a message - That you love me too,

Let's change the green lilacs to the Red, White and Blue.



Green grow the lilacs, all sparkling with dew

I'm lonely, my darling, since parting with you;

But by our next meeting I'll hope to prove true

And change the green lilacs to the Red, White and Blue.

Green grow the lilacs, all sparkling with dew

I'm lonely, my darling, since parting with you;

But by our next meeting I'll hope to prove true

And change the green lilacs to the Red, White and Blue.

I once had a sweetheart, but now I have none



She's gone and she's left me, I care not for one

Since she's gone and left me, contented I'll be,

For she loves another one better than me.



I passed my love's window, both early and late

The look that she gave me, it makes my heart ache;

Oh, the look that she gave me was painful to see,

For she loves another one better than me.



I wrote my love letters in rosy red lines,

She sent me an answer all twisted and twined;

Saying,""Keep your love letters and I will keep mine

Just you write to your love and I'll write to mine.""

Karen White, 52, was sent to the jail despite the fact that she was a convicted sex offender and paedophile.

All her previous offences had been committed when she was a man – and White had not had gender reassignment surgery when she went to women-only New Hall Prison near Wakefield, West Yorkshire, where the sex assaults took place.

Karen White (pictured), 51, confessed to two counts of sexual touching during her time in jail

The case could lead to a review of the rules for dealing with transgender inmates in the prison system.

Yesterday White pleaded guilty at Leeds Crown Court to the historic rape of a woman in August 2003, when she was then called Stephen Wood.

Last month she also pleaded guilty at the same court to two counts of raping another woman between February and December 2016.

It was for these rape offences that White was remanded in custody to New Hall Prison.

And while locked up there she took advantage of living alongside women inmates to carry out further sex attacks.

White had not had gender reassignment surgery when she went to women-only New Hall Prison (pictured) near Wakefield, West Yorkshire, where the sex assaults took place

White admitted sex assaults on two inmates and denied sexually assaulting two others. All the incidents took place between September and November last year.

How many transgender prisoners are there in England and Wales? The latest figures showed there were 125 transgender prisoners in England and Wales up to the end of March 2017, an increase from 70 a year earlier. About 25 are thought to be in women's jails. At least 34 male-born inmates are living as women in four specialist sex offender jails for men, according to Freedom of Information Act requests. But prison governors say many have sought to be transferred to women's jails. Advertisement

She was transferred to HM Prison Leeds, a category B men's prison, after the jail attacks.

The sex assault offences she denied have been left to lie on file, as have a further rape allegation against the 2016 victim and a charge of controlling behaviour against her.

White had been living as a man called David Thompson before she began to identify as a woman.

She became Karen White and lived near Mytholmroyd in West Yorkshire. She was in transition when she committed the latest rape.

White is also awaiting sentence for stabbing a neighbour. Yesterday she appeared in the dock with her auburn hair in a ponytail, wearing glasses and walking with a stick.

Judge Christopher Batty adjourned sentencing until October 11 for the preparation of reports and to obtain victim personal statements.

While locked up at New Hall Prison, she took advantage of living alongside women inmates to carry out further sex attacks

'I'm going to have you assessed to see whether you are a danger,' he told her.

When White appeared before a district judge at Leeds Magistrates' Court in July, she claimed she had not sexually assaulted the female inmates because she is not attracted to women and suffers from erectile dysfunction.

Prosecutor Charlotte Dangerfield told the court the first assault in September happened when White stood close to another inmate, touched her arm and exposed herself.

For the second assault she made 'inappropriate comments about oral sex' and put the woman's hand on the 'defendant's left breast' so she could feel her padded bra.

Miss Dangerfield said the third alleged assault involved White pushing herself indecently against another prisoner, and on the fourth incident she allegedly kissed an inmate on the neck.

White pleaded guilty at Leeds Crown Court (pictured) to the historic rape of a woman in 2003

The court heard White was convicted in 2001 for two offences of indecent assault and gross indecency with a child and was jailed for 18 months.

She began identifying as a woman in 2014, but friends told the Sun she was not diagnosed with gender dysphoria - and was a drag artist, rather than transgender.

It was also claimed she has an ex-wife and son, and was helped by a transgender group in Manchester before being referred to a gender identity clinic in Sheffield.

A spokesman for the Prison Service said: 'We apologise sincerely for the mistakes which were made in this case.

'While we work to manage all prisoners, including those who are transgender, sensitively and in line with the law, we are clear that the safety of all prisoners must be our absolute priority.'"

Now that you're back, you should be sufficiently chilled out as you're listening to the Callin' Oates emergency hotline. The Hall & Oates-infused phone number hit our Twitter stream this afternoon, and we tracked down the creators of this Daryl & John project to see how and why it was built. Turns out that while it may not have been built pro bono by a H&O mega-fan for the community, it's still a pretty good story.

It's from ""Go Solo"" fan Michael Selvidge (@selviano), who recently joined cloud communications company Twilio, and his high school buddy Reid Butler (@rbutlersf). The San Francisco-based company requires that all new employees build an app, whether they're working in marketing, design, or systems. Selvidge, who formerly worked PR part time for Twilio before coming on as a full time employee, knew that he'd have to build something, but lacked an idea. He told me, ""I thought, 'If only there was a pun that would work with this...' Then 'Callin' Oates' hit me, and that cinched it.""

With the idea secure, Selvidge and Butler built and launched the hotline this weekend, mixing a bit of PHP and links to public URLs on Dropbox to create a simple interactive voice response system. The custom 1-719-26-OATES number costs $1 / month, and Selvidge found it via an online phrase search. Twilio's obviously helping out here, but any user can build a custom app on the Twilio API, and even with viral success like this, you'd just be out a ""couple hundred bucks."" Today alone, the first day it's gotten any serious visibility on the web, it's received over 34,223 requests as of 5:00 PM EST. And, if we're decent judges of the '80s revival in modern culture or the need for instant Hall and Oates fulfillment, the @CallinOates hotline should continue growing just fine.

He told the attendant that he wasn’t an American and that he preferred another doctor help if possible. Unfortunately, he was the man’s only hope.

As he approached, he could see that the man was barely managing to breathe and going in and out of consciousness. What the doctor did next may seem normal to people where he comes from, but here it was simply disgusting. He leaned over the man and asked him if he believed in God. “Yes,” the man answered, “Jesus Christ is my Lord and Savior.”

At that point, Kohmeni informed the flight attendant that he could only “give the man the comfort of knowing Allah will give him the chance to redeem himself in heaven,” but that he couldn’t help save him. The attendant reminded him that he was a doctor and that he was in the United States, not Syria.

The plane instead made an emergency landing in Pittsburgh, where the man was taken by ambulance to Mercy General, where he was pronounced dead. The doctor in the ER said “simple CPR” would have saved his life.

Dr. Khomeni was taken into custody by the Pennsylvania State Police for willfully endangering the life of his patient. Trooper Donald Deekman told us that in their state, the doctor assumed the man as a patient when he raised his hand and subsequently left his seat. Not treating him is a felony. “It will be up to the DA to charge him with felony murder,” said Deekman, “we knew he’d broken the law so we arrested him.”

Two cell-phone recordings of the incident were recovered by officials who said they should be processed and released by the end of the day. Khomeni’s lawyer says he can’t possibly be held accountable for a law in a state he was flying over in a country he’s not a resident of. The nuances are too extreme.

The Pennsylvania DA said in a statement that “ignorance of the law doesn’t exclude you from it.”

Either way, this “doctor” let a man die because he wasn’t a Muslim and because “Allah wanted to judge him.” That’s basically what he said. He wanted to murder the guy for loving God. Hopefully, they charge him with murder and hang him in the town square for all to see.

A popular home air freshener may be to blame for several fires. The Glade plug-in air freshener has already been recalled by SC Johnson. Seven On Your Side's Tappy Phillips takes a closer look at this and other potentially dangerous air fresheners.

It's a warning for consumers: The Consumer Product Safety Commission says the 'Glade Extra Outlet Scented Oil Air Fresheners' may cause fires, and now the commission is now looking into potential fire dangers from all air fresheners. If you went shopping for the Glade plug-in air freshener that features an extra outlet, you probably found an empty shelf. The voluntary recall of 2.5 million 'Glade Extra Outlet Scented Oil Air Fresheners' was announced Friday by the manufacturer, SC Johnson, and the Consumer Product Safety Commission. Both say the air fresheners have been recalled because the manufacturer found a loose connection inside the extra outlet, which could pose a fire hazard. Ken Giles, CPSC: ""The misassembly causes an electrical problem that could lead to a fire."" So far, the CPSC says the plug-in has caused no injuries but... Giles: ""Consumers should unplug it right away."" So just how safe are other plug-in air fresheners? The CPSC showed us scores of reports from consumers, chronicling fire hazards associated with plug-in air fresheners from various manufacturers. Doing our own searching, we found two instances where air fresheners are suspected in house fires. Karen Myers, Fire Victim: ""The flames were just... it was so hot. I've never seen anything like it."" Karen Myers is talking about a fire she discovered in her kitchen, where she had plugged in an air freshener. Myers: ""It just ignited and went up. And it was all the way going up to the ceiling."" Karen's air freshener was not a Glade, but a Wallflower, made by the White Barn Candle Company. Myers: ""I think we were very lucky... but everybody should know they're not going to be so lucky."" We spoke to another homeowner, who said he also used a 'Wallflower,' but wasn't as lucky as Myers. His house was destroyed by fire. Richard Wolfson, Fire Investigator: ""It was at the junction where the outlet and air freshener were located."" Rich Wolfson was hired by the homeowners insurance company to investigate this fire. He says he tested the wiring and looked at the fire pattern and concluded that the air freshener was the most likely cause. Wolfson: ""There was no evidence of failure of the outlet itself."" The CPSC says some fires attributed to air fresheners may be caused by faulty electrical wiring. But at least one fire investigator says it's better to be safe than sorry. Wolfson: ""If there is a problem with this, we want to save lives. This could be a potential hazard for homeowners."" Despite repeated calls, the White Barn Candle Company didn't respond to our request for a comment. If your air freshener has shown any signs of fire, including scorching or melting, you should report it to your local fire department and they will investigate. If you have a 'Glade Extra Outlet Scented Oil Air Freshener,' unplug it immediately and call their recall line at 800-571-0920, to get a refund or replacement.

Binatang bin Goncang wins ""Worst Job in Singapore"". Wildlife Reserves Singapore (WRS), which runs the Singapore Zoo,has set up a bank of sperm and animal tissue in order to help preserve species.



The thankless task of collecting the sperm falls to Mr. Binatang's, starting his rounds at 4 a.m. ""We start so early in the morning because a lot of the animals have 'morning glory' when they wake up, and it's easier to collect the sperm.



Wearing rubber gloves and carrying a cooler box filled with ice and tupperware, Mr. Binatang, 25, told us that he'd just graduated from Singapore Polytechnic with a diploma in life sciences. He liked nature and animals, and thought that the Singapore Zoo would be the perfect place to work.



""I never thought I'd be giving an orang-utan a hand job every morning,"" he said somewhat ruefully. ""And he is the worst, he expects to be kissed first. ""As we approached the orang-utan enclosure, we saw the Zoo's most famous resident lying casually on his back, hands behind his head, and sporting a huge erection.



Applying the massage oil onto his gloves, he lingered outside the enclosure before entering and knelt before the orange beast. About 2 minutes' worth of squelching noises could be heard before Mr.Binatang emerged again.



Next the tiger enclosure, the big cats were sprawled lazily on the grass verge, in a somewhat half-hearted manner as he put on a fresh set of gloves and entered the enclosure. ""Here, kitty, kitty,kitty...""



Moments later, he emerged with several tupperware full of viscous fluid.



""Isn't it dangerous?"" we asked.



Mr. Binatang was silent for a while.



""They know I'm not there as an enemy,"" he finally said, a glazed, faraway look in his eyes.



Worked his way round the zoo, finished his rounds at 3 pm in the afternoon. Carrying out his duties with the tapirs, the rhinoceros, giraffe and the gorillas, amongst others. ""Each animal is different,"" he said, removing his gloves, now speckled with traces of polar bear spunk.



""The chimpanzees always want to be hugged afterwards. The elephant is the most tricky because of the size of its thing... sometimes I have to use both my arms to tug on it.""



""As you can expect it's really affecting my sex life. I can't help it. Each time my wife initiates sex, these ejaculating hippos keep floating through my mind.""



How long will he stay difficult to know, but deputy assistant director Lai Jee Seow thinks it is important to continue.



""It's because the animals have gotten too used to Binatang coming over every morning to pull them off,"" said ""Many of them now can't be bothered to engage in real sex.""

A vaccine for type 1 diabetes developed by Finnish researchers will be tested on mainly Finnish human subjects in late 2018, researchers announced on Tuesday.

The scientists first found that the prototype works effectively and safely on mice, and now say

that the vaccine could be in mainstream use within eight years if the coming rounds of tests prove successful.

The vaccine will first be given to a group of 30 healthy men during the first phase of the clinical trials, followed by a group of some 150 children if all goes well. After two successful rounds the vaccine can be considered safe and effective against viruses. The final round of vaccinations, intended for a group of some 4,000 children, should tell researchers whether the vaccine specifically prevents type 1 diabetes.

Virus likely culprit

A virus may be behind a significant proportion of type 1 diabetes cases, which are especially common among children. Professor Heikki Hyöty from the University of Tampere and Professor Mikael Knip of the University of Helsinki have worked on the pathology of diabetes from more than 20 years, and say they are confident that an enterovirus that attacks the pancreas to destroy insulin-producing cells is the root cause of type 1 diabetes.

If the vaccine proves effective in humans, it could do much to minimise suffering as well as expenses.

""It is estimated that the additional cost of care for one child with diabetes over their lifetime is about a million euros,"" Knip says. ""This vaccine could prevent at least half of new cases, which amounts to some 250 million euros in annual savings.""

Enteroviruses are the most common type of infectious virus in humans; they cause a wide variety of health problems from the flu and eye infections to meningitis and heart inflammation.

Humanity last beat back an enterovirus via vaccination when polio was all but eradicated in the late 1980s.

US funding, biotech co-op

The team of researchers sought funding for their vaccine trial for four years, with no European benefactors stepping up.

Eventually American biopharmaceutical company Provention Bio agreed to fund the trial in full. The company has raised just under 25 million euros, most of which will go towards seeing the vaccination trials through. Investors include companies, individuals and funds.

Professors Hyöty and Knip founded a company of their own, Vactech, in 2001. They are part-owners of the firm, which has given Provention Bio the green light to use and manage their enterovirus vaccine. Vactech owns shares in Provention Bio.

""The only way to change years of university study into a working vaccine is through business cooperation,"" says Hyöty. ""Human trials are so expensive that only a large enough international company with enough room for risk management to be prepared in case the vaccine is found wanting.""

Finland suffers highest rate of type 1 diabetes

Type 1 diabetes may be more common in Finland than anywhere else in the world. Some 500-600 children contract it each year, which is also the largest relative figure worldwide.

The number of type 1 diabetes sufferers has multiplied by six since the 1950s. It is only in the recent decade that incidence growth has plateaued. There are some 45,000 people in Finland who suffer from type 1 diabetes, and nearly half a million people who carry some form of diabetes."

To make audience data even more meaningful for businesses, we’re updating the way Page likes are counted by removing memorialized and voluntarily deactivated accounts from Pages’ like counts. This change ensures that data on Facebook is consistent and up-to-date.

Removing inactive Facebook accounts

There are two primary benefits to removing voluntarily deactivated and memorialized Facebook accounts from Pages’ like counts:

Business results : Removing inactive Facebook accounts from Page audience data gives businesses up-to-date insights on the people who actively follow their Page and makes it easier for businesses to find people like their followers through tools like lookalike audiences.

Consistency : We already filter out likes and comments generated by deactivated or memorialized accounts from individual Page posts, so this update keeps data consistent.

What to expect

Over the coming weeks, Page admins should expect to see a small dip in their number of Page likes as a result of this update. It’s important to remember, though, that these removed likes represent people who were already inactive on Facebook.

Going forward, any accounts that are voluntarily deactivated or memorialized will be removed from a Page’s like count. If a deactivated account is reactivated, the account will be re-added to a Page’s like count.

Everyone benefits from meaningful information on Facebook. It’s our hope that this update makes Pages even more valuable for businesses."

""It's blank; it won't accept anything when I type."" ""Are you still in WordPerfect, or did you get out?"" ""How do I tell?"" [Uh-oh.

Can you move the cursor around on the screen?"" ""There isn't any cursor: I told you, it won't accept anything I type."" [Ah--at least she knows what a cursor is. Sounds like a hardware problem. I wonder if she's kicked out her monitor's power plug.] ""Does your monitor have a power indicator?"" ""What's a monitor?"" ""It's the thing with the screen on it that looks like a TV.

Well, that's interesting. I doubt she would have accidentally turned it off, and I don't want to send her hunting for the power switch because I don't know what kind of monitor she has and it's bound to have more than one switch on it.

But I could still fantasize: ""A power outage? Aha! Okay, we've got it licked now. Do you still have the boxes and manuals and packing stuff your computer came in?"" ""Well, yes, I keep them in the closet."" ""Good! Go get them, and unplug your system and pack it up just like it was when you got it. Then take it back to the store you bought it from."" ""Really?

I see a cute dinosaur who does seem to be missing an appendage, but few kids would notice and I doubt any would see something sinister, but the mother on the other hand…

Jessica Eckerdt of Queen Creek, Arizona bought a cake for her son’s sixth birthday. She picked the dinosaur from a selection of cake patterns. When she brought the cake out to sing to her son, though, she noticed something weird: the dinosaur had three legs. Oh, and she thought the icing wrote out “666.”

“I was extremely shocked and upset to see a demonic symbol written clear as day on my six-year-old son’s birthday cake. What was supposed to be a whimsical dinosaur became something very distasteful. I was extremely surprised at Costco for allowing such an inappropriate joke be sold to an unsuspecting victim.” Source: Inquisitr.com

Now, she and some right-wing sources are convinced that it’s either of the devil or a bad joke. One piece of evidence, they claim, is that the Costco is located in Superstition Springs. Another, according to them, is that Costco has 666 stores. They actually have 672, now. Maybe they had 666 when the cake was made, but regardless, it sounds good.

Now, Costco has pulled that particular cake pattern off the shelves but we’re the weirdos for even considering that Confederate flags might be inappropriate in, oh, all settings.

Here’s the video:

Some (but not all) Christians claim that 666 is the number of the beast, which comes from the Book of Revelation in the New Testament. Eckerdt could be a general nut or she could suffer from a phobia called hexakosioihexekontahexphobia, which is the fear of 666. Too bad she had to ruin her son’s birthday over her phobia or superstition. Too bad there are enough people around who buy into it to make it a national story and to make Costco pull a completely innocent cake off the shelves.

Reviewed by Dr. Mike Murphy The toxic compounds in chocolate are theobromine and caffeine, which are classified as methylxanthine alkaloids. Theobromine is the primary chemical involved in chocolate toxicity in small animals. Dogs and cats are exposed to chocolate especially during the holiday season. Because of their small body size relative to human beings, ingestion of a fairly small amount of chocolate may cause toxicity. As little as 4 ounces of baking chocolate or 1 pound of milk chocolate could be fatal if ingested by a dog weighing 10 pounds or less. Dogs will readily eat a toxic dose of chocolate. Ingestion of the rich smelling cocoa bean landscaping mulch also can be a cause of methylxanthine toxicity. The relative amount of theobromine contained in various chocolate compounds is described in the table below. CHOCOLATE PRODUCT THEOBROMINE CONTENT (mg/oz) Cocoa bean landscaping mulch 300-1200 Cacao beans 400-1500 Cocoa powder 400-550 Unsweetened baking chocolate 450 Semi-sweet baking chocolate (chips) 135-260 Milk chocolate 60 Hot chocolate beverage 12 White chocolate 1 Theobromine is absorbed from ingested chocolate products slowly, reaching peak levels in the blood about 10 hours after ingestion. Initial clinical signs are seen 2 to 4 hours after ingestion, and include restlessness, panting, vomiting, urinary incontinence, diarrhea and increased heart rate. Over time, the body temperature rises, arrhythmias of the heart occur, and the muscles become rigid. Finally, seizures and coma occur, followed by death. Treatment involves decreasing further absorption of theobromine from ingested chocolate. Induction of vomiting only is beneficial if the animal is seen within 2 hours of having ingested the chocolate and if seizures have not begun. Chocolate products may coagulate into a ball in the stomach, preventing their expulsion or movement through the intestinal tract. Supportive care that will be provided by the veterinarian includes administration of intravenous fluids, medications as needed for heart abnormalities and seizures, and maintenance of normal body temperature. Because chocolate products generally are high in fat, secondary pancreatic disease may occur. Prognosis for dogs with chocolate toxicity is good if the animal is treated by the veterinarian within 2 to 4 hours of their having eaten a toxic dose of chocolate. Prognosis is guarded if heart abnormalities or central nervous system signs, such as tremors, muscle rigidity, or seizures, develop. Potential chocolate poisoning is an emergency.

Who the hell are they surveying is what I want to know!

Loading...

According to a newly released Gallup survey, Clinton has topped the list of America’s most admired woman for the 15th year in a row, and the 21st time ever.

In the poll, 12 percent of respondents said that Clinton was their top pick, with Michelle Obama in second place with 8 percent. German Chancellor Angela Merkel and television personality Oprah Winfrey tied for third with 3 percent of the votes each, and talk show host Ellen DeGeneres rounded out the top five with 2 percent of votes.

The survey, conducted Dec. 7 through 11, has been run every year since 1946.

This year’s Most Admired Man was President Barack Obama, who garnered 22 percent of respondents votes. The year’s second most admired man is President-elect Donald Trump, with 15 percent of votes. Trailing in third is Pope Francis with 4 percent, followed by Sen. Bernie Sanders in fourth with 2 percent of votes, and Rev. Billy Graham rounds out the top five with 1 percent support.

Graham has been in the top 10 every year since 1955.

According to The Washington Post, Clinton has enjoyed a relatively high public approval rating for the majority of her 25 years on the national stage. However, her favorability rating dropped dramatically during her two attempts at the White House.

In 1998, as first lady during the Monica Lewinsky scandal, Clinton saw a favorable rating of 64 percent. However, at the end of her first run for president in 2008 (against then-Senator Barack Obama), her approval rating dropped to 44 percent (and her disapproval rating shot up from 28 percent in 1998 to 54 percent).

Then, in 2013, after spending time as the Secretary of State, Clinton reached her highest yet favorability rating of 67 percent (coupled with a 26 percent unfavorable rating). Her second attempt at the presidency once again plummeted her approval score. As of August, her favorability rating stood at 41 percent, while disapproval of Clinton rose to an all-time high of 56 percent.

https://www.snopes.com/fact-check/army-implements-mandatory-divorce/	the army is instituting a mandatory divorce policy to improve readiness.	false	['actually funny satire', 'army implements mandatory divorce', 'duffel blog', 'satire']		Kim LaCapria	['http://www.duffelblog.com/2013/03/army-implements-mandatory-divorce-policy-to-improve-readiness-lower-costs/']	http://www.duffelblog.com/2013/03/army-implements-mandatory-divorce-policy-to-improve-readiness-lower-costs/	http://www.duffelblog.com/	"FORT KNOX, KY – In an effort to increase soldiers’ interchangeability and world-wide assignment eligibility, the Army has announced that married individuals will no longer be considered for enlistment, and all active-duty married soldiers must divorce their spouses within thirty days or be subject to administrative separation in accordance with AR 600-8-2.

Dependents must return to their home of record at their own expense.

“What we’re seeing is an awful lot of dependents in the Army community, who – let’s be honest – contribute nothing to military readiness,” said Army Secretary John McHugh to reporters. “They distract our married soldiers from putting the mission first, and they suck up a huge amount of resources.”

McHugh pointed to Army spouse and family wellness programs like the Family Readiness Group, the MyCAA spouse-education program, Army Community Services, and the Army Family Action Plan, which cost the Army roughly $475 million a year to maintain. “In addition, you have the DEERS system and the DoDDS school system, which cost a fortune, plus the massive costs involved in providing healthcare, exchange and commissary services to dependents. There’s also the higher cost-of-living allowances and all the other allotments to which married soldiers are entitled.”

But there’s also the elephant in the room: the spiraling cost of married soldiers’ housing.

“Unlike single soldiers, who live in on-post barracks and often live two to four per room, which is more space than anyone really needs anyway,” said McHugh, “married soldiers enjoy lavishly opulent housing accommodations at government expense, with one, sometimes two bathrooms, a full kitchen, even a backyard in most cases. You can’t tell me that a family of five NEEDS a three-bedroom house. In this time of fiscal austerity, it’s a luxury that we can no longer afford.”

Army leaders applauded the move, calling it “long overdue.”

“This is more than I could have ever hoped for. Finally, we can put our soldiers wherever we need them without having to worry about their do-nothing families causing problems for us,” said one USAREUR command sergeant major, who had previously called for the ending of all command-sponsored overseas tours. “Seriously, I can’t tell you how many times I had some whiny soldier ask to leave the field or return early from a deployment because their wife had another baby, or she crashed her car and wound up in the hospital, or their kid had a seizure or something. Plus, housing has always been an issue at OCONUS duty stations in Europe, where we just don’t have the housing facilities to accommodate families, and oftentimes have to put married soldiers up in off-post government-leased apartments, which is a huge expense. Now that these married soldiers are going to become geo-bachelors, we’ll have a lot more flexibility in our billeting options.”

The move will likely generate intense backlash among married soldiers who will be affected by the policy change. “The simple fact is, these soldiers joined an all-volunteer Army,” McHugh said. “If the Army wanted its soldiers to have families, they’d have been issued one.”

However, the reaction among married soldiers was sharply negative. “If this doesn’t just beat all,” said SFC Gregory Martineau, of 1st Battalion, 508th Infantry, 4th BCT, 82nd Airborne Division, an eighteen-year Army veteran who is married with four children. “I’ve never regretted my service until now.”

Martineau would have been eligible to retire in two years, but now will separate with no retirement benefits because he’s unwilling to comply with the new policy. “If I wanted to join a service branch that craps all over families, I’d have joined the Marines. At least they’re up front about it.”"	Army Implements Mandatory Divorce Policy To Improve Readiness	2013-03-14 07:00:40-04:00	['Posted By']	['divorce', 'family', 'policy', 'wanted', 'mchugh', 'soldiers', 'army', 'housing', 'married', 'cost', 'families', 'readiness', 'improve', 'theres', 'mandatory', 'implements']	"“What we’re seeing is an awful lot of dependents in the Army community, who – let’s be honest – contribute nothing to military readiness,” said Army Secretary John McHugh to reporters.

https://www.snopes.com/fact-check/alexandrias-genesis/	a mutation known alexandria's genesis turns people into 'perfect human beings' who exhibit purple eyes six months after birth.	false	"[""alexandra's genesis"", 'daria', 'purple eyes']"	2015/02/06	Dan Evon	['http://outpost-daria-reborn.info/fanfic/purple_eyes.html']	http://outpost-daria-reborn.info/fanfic/purple_eyes.html	http://outpost-daria-reborn.info/	"Purple Eyes and Other Interesting Anomalies

If you have read any of the statistics of my Daria-based fan fiction characters or any of my stories about those characters, you will have noticed that three of my characters (Raven, Rebecca, and Zia) have deep purple eyes. It's not because they wear contacts in order to hide their real eye colors. It's because of a genetic mutation called ""Alexandria's Genesis.""

The Origins of the ""Genesis""

""Alexandria's Genesis,"" as it has been called since the 1960s, is a genetic mutation generally found in women of Euro-American (a.k.a., Caucasian) descent. This mutation can be traced as far as the Middle Ages in Northern Europe. The first known record of ""Alexandria's Genesis"" was written in the year CE 1330 (Common Era).

A woman named Alexandria Augustine came into the world on April 29, CE 1329 in London, England. At the time, she appeared to be normal, but her parents soon noticed that her eyes were changing from the blue eyes Alexandria had at birth to the purple eyes she would have by her first birthday. The parents were startled by this dramatic change. They took her to their priest, thinking that a witch did this to their child, and that the priest might be able to ask God to change the eye color back. The priest told the parents that it was not the work of the devil, but a myth come true. This particular priest had heard a story about a race of people who had purple eyes. These humans were thought to have come from Egypt after a mysterious light flashed in the sky during a moonless night thousands of years ago. The purple-eyed humans also had very fair skin, and were thought to be spirits because of their appearance. The so-called ""spirit people"" eventually went north and vanished without a trace. The priest told her parents not to worry, for they had a special child in their hands and they should take good care of her.

Eventually, Alexandria grew up to be a very beautiful woman, got married, had four children (all four were girls, and all four also had the mutation), never got sick, and died at the age of 150 of natural causes. It is this discovery that helped to name the genetic mutation when the gene was discovered in 1968.

The Characteristics of ""Alexandria's Genesis""

The first characteristic of people with ""Alexandria's Genesis"" is their eye color. When someone is born with this genetic mutation, the eyes are either blue or gray at birth. At six months, the eyes begin their transformation from the original color to purple. This process is completed by the person's first birthday. A second process, where the eye color deepens, starts as soon as the first is completed. This slow process continues until the onset of puberty. By then, the eye will have become a dark purple, a deep purple, a royal purple, or a violet-blue color, and will be that color for the rest of their time. These changes do not affect the person's eyesight, though. If anything, the eyesight is, and remains until death, 20/20.

Speaking of puberty, those who have the mutation will never grow any facial, body, pubic, or anal hair during this stage of growth. In fact, the only hair they will ever have is what is on their heads, in their ears and nose, their eyebrows, and their eyelashes. Women also have an added bonus beyond never having to shave: never buying tampons or pads. It turns out that females born with ""Alexandria's Genesis"" never menstruate in their lives. They are fertile, however, and can go through the same things that women without the mutation can go through every month. Beyond these differences, those with the mutation go through puberty as normally as everyone else does.

Below are all of the characteristics of ""Alexandria's Genesis.""

Clear, silver-like purple eyes (after 1st birthday; deepen in color until onset of puberty)

No facial or body hair growth beyond what was already there at birth

Dark brown or black hair

Shimmering white skin that resist tanning and burning

Lack of menstruation cycle (in women)

Highly evolved immune system (has been known to resist every disease known to man so far)

Appear 5-20 years younger (after the age of 21, the aging process slows down greatly; it stops completely between the ages of 40-50)

Long life span (ranges from 130-170 years)

Perfect vision

Never overweight (their metabolism prevents the gaining of too much fat [a.k.a., partial lipodystophy])

Well-developed and proportioned bodies

Found mainly in women of Euro-American descent

Women are the primary carriers of the mutation

Children born from mothers with the mutation are also carriers

Mutation remains active generation after generation

Mutation grows stronger generation after generation

Interracial Children of the ""Genesis""

An interesting aspect of this mutation is that if it passed on to a child whose mother or father is not of Euro-American descent, the child will receive all of the qualities of those who have the gene. The only quality that changes is the skin color; it is lighter than those without the gene are, but it is not as light as the parent with the mutation is. So far, this gene has shown up in children whose mother or father was Hispanic, Asian, or Arabic. If these children were to marry someone within their own race, their offspring would also develop the same characteristics. The most startling aspect of the biracial ""Genesis"" children is that they take on a more Euro-American appearance. Not much more is known about these children beyond these initial findings.

Another Interesting Development

In ten percent of the population that has ""Alexandria's Genesis,"" there is another characteristic of this mutation that is increasing on a yearly basis: the processing of human waste… or lack thereof.

As it turns out, in some of these people, the mutation is actually causing the digestive system to produce no waste. No one has found out how this is possible, but most scientists have a theory that may explain this increasing phenomenon.

The digestion process goes through its normal procedure until the digested product enters the large intestine. It is there, scientists suggest, that the large intestine absorbs everything and uses the product to keep the body in top shape. This makes the bladder completely useless, and leaves the small intestine and rectum as just an opening. It is not much of a theory, since very little is still known about ""Alexandria's Genesis.""

Conclusion

There are questions about this genetic mutation that remain unanswered. The biggest question left unanswered is where ""Alexandria's Genesis"" actually first appeared. Many researchers are looking into the myth of the ""spirit people"" of Egypt in order to find out if this mutation really did exist several thousands of years ago. If that is indeed the case, the next question to be answered is if this mutation is of Earth origin… or of a different place."

This lion king (pictured above) is a queen. And she’s not the only one.

Five lionesses in Botswana have grown a mane and are showing male-like behaviours. One is even roaring and mounting other females.

Male lions are distinguished by their mane, which they use to attract females, and they roar to protect their territory or call upon members of their pride. Females lack a mane and are not as vocal.

But sometimes lionesses grow a mane and even behave a bit like males. However, until now, reports of such maned lionesses have been extremely rare and largely anecdotal. We knew they existed, but little about how they behave.

Now, Geoffrey D. Gilfillan at the University of Sussex in Falmer, UK, and colleagues have reported five lionesses sporting a mane at the Moremi Game Reserve in Botswana’s Okavango delta.

Gilfillan started studying these lionesses back in March 2014, and for the next two years he focused on recording the behaviour of one of them, called SaF05. She had an underdeveloped mane and was larger than most females.

“While SaF05 is mostly female in her behaviour – staying with the pride, mating males – she also has some male behaviours, such as increased scent-marking and roaring, as well as mounting other females,” says Gilfillan.

“Although females do roar and scent-mark like males, they usually do so less frequently,” he says. “SaF05, however, was much more male-like in her behaviour, regularly scent-marking and roaring.”

Jessica Vitale

A likely explanation is an increased level of testosterone as these lionesses mature, says Luke Hunter, president and chief conservation officer at the global wild cat conservation organisation Panthera.

In lions, testosterone directly affects the development of manes. Castrated males, for example, lose their ability to produce testosterone and promptly lose their mane, too.

In 2011, a captive lioness called Emma at the National Zoological Gardens of South Africa developed a mane. Tests revealed high levels of testosterone due to a problem in her ovaries, and once they were removed she reverted to a typical lioness.

The idea that testosterone is implicated in the Botswana lionesses is also backed by observations of their reproductive success, says Kathleen Alexander at Virginia Tech in Blacksburg.

“While some of the maned lionesses were observed mating, none of them became pregnant, suggesting they are infertile, a known consequence of high levels of androgens such as testosterone in females,” she says. “The behavioural changes suggest this is likely the case.”

Hunter suspects this explanation applies to the animals studied by Gilfillan and his colleagues. “Given all five known maned females come from the Okavango region, there must be a genetic component in this population underlying the phenomenon,” he says.

“I don’t think this is anything to be concerned about,” says Hunter. “Although the females are apparently infertile, they otherwise appear to live long, healthy lives. And from a conservation perspective, there is nothing to suggest the pattern is increasing or will ever be anything more than a rare, local phenomenon.”

No one seems to be studying the exact genetic and hormonal causes of this phenomenon at the moment. “I guess there are just one or a few genes altered,” says Vincent Savolainen at Imperial College London, who had a student briefly work on the possible causes. “I believe some masculinised genes have been documented in domesticated cats – it would be good to look into this, especially given that the cat genome is available as reference.”

Could the masculinised females in fact be a boon to the pride when it comes to competing with other prides? It’s possible, it seems.

Gilfillan says he once saw SaF05 bring down a zebra. “A neighbouring pride stole the zebra from SaF05, but in return SaF05 killed two of their cubs.”

Cub-killing behaviour is rare in females but common in males.

Open Letter to Bill Timmins, President Aladdin Casino and Hotel http://www.michaelmoore.com/words/index.php?id=93

Bill Timmins President Aladdin Casino and Hotel Las Vegas, NV

July 20, 2004

Dear Mr. Timmins:

I understand from the news reports I've read that, after Linda Ronstadt, one of America's greatest singers, dedicated a song to me from your stage on Saturday night, you instructed your security guards to remove her from the Aladdin, which they did.

What country do you live in? Last time I checked, Las Vegas is still in the United States. And in the United States, we have something called ""The First Amendment."" This constitutional right gives everyone here the right to say whatever they want to say. All Americans hold this right as sacred. Many of our young people put on a uniform and risk their lives to defend it. My film is all about asking the questions that should have been asked before those brave soldiers were sent into harms way.

For you to throw Linda Ronstadt off the premises because she dared to say a few words in support of me and my film, is simply stupid and Un-American. Frankly, I have never heard of such a thing happening. I read that you wouldn't even let her go back up to her room at your hotel! Are you crazy? For crying out loud, it was a song DEDICATION! To ""Desperado!"" Every American loves that song! Sure, some people didn't like the dedication, and that's their right. But neither they nor you have the right to remove her from your building when all she did was exercise her AMERICAN right to speak her mind.

Of all the things that go on in Las Vegas, this is what creates the need for serious action? What about the other half of the crowd at the Aladdin who, according to the Las Vegas Sun, cheered her when she made her remarks? Did you throw them out, too?

I think you owe Ms. Ronstadt an apology. And I have an idea how you can make it up to her -- and to the millions of Americans you have offended. Invite her back and I'll join her in singing ""America the Beautiful"" on your stage. Then I will show ""Fahrenheit 9/11"" free of charge to all your guests and anyone else in Las Vegas who wants to see it.

Mr. Timmins, as the song ""Desperado"" says -- ""Come to your senses!"" How can you refuse this offer? I await your reply.

Yours, Michael Moore Director, ""Fahrenheit 9/11""

=============================================== Response ===============================================

July 21, 2004

Attention: Michael Moore,

In response to your letter dated July 20, 2004: You are correct that I had security remove Linda Ronstadt from Aladdin Casino and Hotel where the fun never ends and everybody wins. How very interesting to learn you are such a fan of Ms. Ronstadt.

You questioned where I live and surprisingly knew Las Vegas is in the United States. You should visit it sometime. There are thousands of wonderful 'All You Can Eat' buffets.

There are also a lot of casinos who's owners don't **** around. I am aware of the First Amendment and you have the right to talk about your hatred of America but once you are on my property and you are upsetting my guests, you will quickly learn about my rights.

I can't remember if it was Jesus or George W. Bush that said, ""Freedom is a two-way street."" Ms. Ronstadt learned this long before I had her thrown out of my casino. You question my actions? If you come onto my property and upset my guests, you will receive the same, if not worse, treatment than Ms. Ronstadt received. I am sure your mere presence would upset my guests.

You claim you film, ""...is all about asking the questions that should have been asked before those brave soldiers were sent into harms way."" I think you film does nothing but aid the enemy and hurt our troops. You have betrayed our troops, our leader and America. I have no respect for you or your vision of what America should be.

I paid Ms. Ronstadt to entertain my guests, not divide them. The half that did not leave probably thought the verse you mentioned, ""Why don't you come to your senses"" was addressed to you. Maybe she should have dedicated her song, 'You're No Good' to you. I would have asked her back, had she done that.

Regarding your request for me to apologize to her, have you and her on my stage singing anything about this Country and then playing your piece of **** film is ludicrous!

One of my workers is currently throwing away every complaint letter from brainless followers of you, claiming they will never visit my Casino. I could not be more pleased to know my casino and hotel will always be void of the kind of people who support you. Meanwhile, my hotel has been quickly booked solid for the rest of the year with true Americans who love this Country and support our efforts overseas.

They will see a framed copy of your letter and my response in the lobby to ensure they begin their experience with a laugh.

Sincerely,

Bill Timmins President Aladdin Casino and Hotel Las Vegas, NV

My Dear Mr. Moore: I cannot tell you how disppointed I was to find that MY viewpoint was NOT included in YOUR movie. What country do you live in? Last I checked, Hollywood was still part of the United States, and we have something called THE FIRST AMENDMENT. Do I not have an equal right with you to have MY viewpoint screened? What kind of brown-shirted jack-booted stunt are you trying to pull? But now the deed has been done, there is no way to remake the movie. There really is no way to make amends. Perhaps I would be willing to settle for 10% of the take if accompanied by a simple apology. With all (and I do mean ALL) due respect, Your baseball-capped Michigan truck-driving nemesis, Skinny Phil

But neither they nor you have the right to remove her from your building when all she did was exercise her AMERICAN right to speak her mind. Private property rights. I don't have to permit Michael Moore to come into my home and if a guest here starts spouting his antiAmerican BS, I am at liberty to throw that person out too. The audience paid to see her sing, not to hear her preach politics. She knows that this has been the response in the past. Only this time it got press. In the future, Republicans and Christians will be aware of her bigoted sentiments. The casino faced a riot on their hands. There have been riots at concerts over less inflammatory things. Shut it down. The theater has a serious liability on their hands when things turn ugly.

UK office workers are today being advised to use caution when writing 'away from office' auto reply email messages because of a new email security risk first discovered at a meeting of industry group The Corporate IT Forum - tif.

tif., a blue-chip membership association representing 120 of Britain's largest organisations with over 3.6 million employees worldwide and 1.3 million desktop computers is issuing the warning after it emerged that criminals are able to discover the personal details, and in some cases the home addresses, of staff through cross-referencing the information contained in 'away from office' email messages.

The advisory is being issued by tif. in an effort to make Britain's office workers more aware of the potential risk and to give them a few simple guidelines to follow to ensure the practice does not escalate any further.

The 'away from office' function, a part of everyday life for many office workers, can be set to send automatic replies from an e-mail account saying that a person is, for example, away on holiday between certain dates. The function is especially popular among businesses that need to inform clients and customers of absences and ensure that enquiries are re-directed to another member of staff.

The new practice involves criminals buying lists of so-called 'spam' email addresses, now readily available over the internet, and sending mass mailings with the intention of gaining 'away from office' replies with details of holiday absences. Using online directories such as www.192.com or www.bt.com, would-be burglars can cross-reference the information contained within the automatic email replies, such as name, telephone number and business address, to find out the personal details and even the home address of the sender.

tif., whose membership includes 47% of the FTSE 100 and collectively spends £20 billion each year on IT, also warns that people with unusual names, and especially those living in smaller towns, are particularly vulnerable to this new practice as uncommon names can be tracked down more easily. Furthermore, tif. members urged company bosses to think twice before revealing their status in an 'away from office' email signature. Job titles can give a would-be burglar a good idea of a possible haul and a managing director being away from home or out of the country can make a tempting target.

Chief executive of tif, David Roberts comments: ""You wouldn't go on holiday with a note pinned to your door saying who you were, how long you were away for and when you were coming back so why would you put this in an email? Email is the most popular form of office communication but many people forget that the information contained in these messages can get into the wrong hands. There's no reason why this threat should become common practice but employees and businesses should act now to stop it - there are a few simple precautions we should all take to help nip this in the bud.""

tif. has issued a series of simple recommendations for office workers to follow and for businesses to incorporate into their email policies.

tif. Recommends

Advice comes on behalf of tif.'s Information Security Group.

Do's

Keep messages as bland as possible. Say that you are currently 'unable to deal with this query' or that you are 'out of the office on business'.

Redirect enquiries to a colleague's business telephone number so someone else can assess the enquiry and verbally inform the caller of a period of absence.

If you have an important sounding job title, think very carefully about whether you want to reveal your job title to a wide audience.

Be very careful with giving away alternative contact details, only include them if the person concerned has agreed.

Always prepare for your absence and pre-warn key contacts personally of your holiday.

PITTSBURGH — A longtime newspaper cartoonist who says his work has been banished from the editorial page lately because of ""political differences"" with his editors says he's been fired.

Rob Rogers tweeted Thursday he's been fired after 25 years as the Pittsburgh Post-Gazette's editorial cartoonist. The paper has declined to run many of his cartoons in recent months.

Keith Burris became the paper's editorial director in March. Burris did not immediately return a call and email seeking comment. A message left with publisher John Block wasn't immediately returned.

Block told The Washington Post last week the matter ""had little to do with politics"" or Trump but primarily involved the editing process.

Flute, a Swiss citizen, had traveled far and met a great many people, but never had he encountered the likes of Remus. There was something irresistible about this tall, sturdy American whose eyebrows cut straight across his face in one thick stroke and whose wardrobe—charcoal-gray suit, white shirt, black tie, gray fedora—never varied no matter what the season. Languages, physics, politics, women—if there was a subject worth talking about, Remus could discuss it with acumen. Unless, of course, the subject was himself.

Riding bicycles through sun-swept Swiss villages, skiing in the Alps or just strolling beside Lake Geneva, Remus made Flute forget for a moment that his friends in the European scientific community were being ripped away from their research to build bombs for Adolf Hitler. And what the American taught him! The day after Christmas, at Flute's laboratory in Zurich, Flute spent hours diagramming atomic chain reactions. Then Remus took the pencil, sketched a diamond and proceeded to explain the American sport of baseball. Remus had played a lot of baseball, and Flute could see that he cared deeply about the game.

Flute didn't keep that sketch. Remus took it and, perhaps, sent it off to Washington with Flute's scribbled formulas. Such was Remus's obligation, and Flute understood that anything he told Remus might well end up on President Roosevelt's desk in the White House. Flute was, after all, the code name that the Office of Strategic Services (OSS), the forerunner of the CIA, had given to Dr. Paul Scherrer, director of physics at the Federal Institute of Technology in Zurich and a pioneer of atomic energy research. Remus was an OSS spy whose task was to assess Nazi Germany's progress toward building an atomic bomb. Remus's real name was Moe Berg, and just three years earlier he could have been found on most any summer day seated holding his catcher's mitt in the Boston Red Sox bullpen, telling stories to the relief pitchers.

There was a protean quality to Moe Berg. He graduated with high honors in modern languages from Princeton in 1923 and then summered in Brooklyn, playing shortstop for the Dodgers. That October, he was off to Paris to study experimental phonetics at the Sorbonne. Over the next few years his time was divided between baseball and Columbia Law School in New York. He graduated and passed the New York State bar exam, but instead of signing up full time with a law firm, he devoted 13 more years to baseball, spending most of them as a third-string catcher.

His best year was 1929, when his batting average (.288) and RBIs (47) were career highs. That season he caught 106 games for the Chicago White Sox and allowed only five stolen bases. Besides a strong arm, Berg had fast reactions and shrewd judgment. The best White Sox pitchers, Ted Lyons and Tommy Thomas, always requested Berg as their batterymate. ""In the years he was to catch me, I never waved off a sign,"" said Lyons, a Hall of Fame righthander.

When World War II began, Berg was first a U.S. goodwill ambassador in Latin America and then a spy in Europe, where, as Remus, he met Flute. They seemed an unlikely pair, but perhaps they really weren't. For Moe Berg could get along with anyone, if only for a time. ""Marvelous!"" he would say, adjusting his fedora. ""Wonderful!"" And then one of the most extraordinary characters in baseball or any other profession would vanish.

""Moe was a mysterious man,"" says Charles Owen, a baseball researcher and Berg specialist. ""He'd be among friends, they'd turn, and he was gone. People who hadn't seen him in years would be talking in a group, and there he'd be.""

After the war Berg received occasional CIA assignments, contracts from consulting firms and scraps of legal business. None of it seemed to make him any money. ""Moe was indifferent to the practical side of things,"" wrote his older brother, Samuel Berg, of Newark, a physician who died in 1990. For 25 years the sober, hardworking Dr. Sam put a free roof over the head of his prodigal brother. ""He was happy that he lived the life he loved, not caring about tomorrow or about where he would get the wherewithal,"" said Dr. Sam of Moe, ""and you know, there is much to be said for such a life.""

The real business of Moe Berg's days was reading the newspaper. ""There is a majesty about the printed word. There is life to it. I consider a newspaper my friend,"" he said, according to Moe Berg: Athlete, Scholar, Spy by Louis Kaufman, Barbara Fitzgerald and Tom Sewell. Berg took this rather literally. Every day he purchased a collection of U.S. and foreign papers—he read a dozen languages—and woe to the man who touched a paper before Berg had finished with it. Rage would cloud Berg's black eyes, and he would refuse to look at the paper again.

Newspapers contained information on all subjects, and if you knew something about everything, you could adjust to anyone. This was Berg's genius. He brought such warmth, such attentiveness, such life to people that he was beloved. Nobody ever really knew Moe Berg, but dozens of people considered the times they spent with him to be some of the best of their lives. ""He was magical,"" says William Fowler, Institute Professor of Physics Emeritus at Cal Tech and the 1983 Nobel Prize winner in physics. ""I'd go to Physical Society meetings in New York, and between sessions we'd all get together and be talking nuclear physics, and I'd look up and there'd be Moe, just listening, taking it all in. We always gave each other a big hug. I'd have to say, though, that most of what I found out about Moe came from reading about him.""

When Chicago Tribune sportswriter Jerome Holtzman, traveling with the Cubs or White Sox, arrived in New York in the 1960s, a call would come up from his hotel lobby, without fail, 10 minutes after he checked in. ""Moe knew my schedule,"" says Holtzman. ""He stayed with me whenever I was in New York. We always went to the ballpark together and came back together. He'd sit next to me in the press box. I was delighted. I didn't want to stay three days alone. So if they hadn't given me a room with twin beds, I'd change rooms. We'd lie awake at night, and he'd tell me stories about countesses he'd known. He was a real ladies' man, though I never saw him with a woman.""

I.M. Levitt, director emeritus of the Fels Planetarium at Philadelphia's Franklin Institute, met Berg one day in the '30s when Levitt narrated a show at the planetarium and Berg came up afterward to ask some questions. Occasionally thereafter Berg would stay with Levitt and his wife at their home as he passed down the Eastern seaboard. At night they played a game in which Levitt would choose a word in the dictionary and Berg would have to give its derivation and meaning. ""He never missed once,"" says Levitt.

""He was very reserved,"" said Dr. Sam, ""as far as divulging his personal affairs with others."" What Dr. Sam could be sure of was that every evening his brother was in town he would come home, bathe—he always took three baths a day—put on a black kimono and, seated beneath a cardboard sign that said I WOULD RATHER BE A POOR MAN IN A GARRET WITH PLENTY OF BOOKS THAN A KING WHO DID NOT LOVE READING, read newspapers well past midnight. In 1964 Dr. Sam asked Moe to move to their sister Ethel's larger house, about 10 blocks away, because Moe's accumulated papers no longer left any room for Dr. Sam's patients.

During all that time Dr. Sam never knew that Moe had been an atomic spy in Europe, never knew that Moe had been awarded the Medal of Freedom (and had refused it) and never could fathom why a simple game like baseball could provide a life's diversion for a man of so many talents. ""[Moe] not only played with but was friendly with the famous like Wagner, Cobb, Faber, McGraw, Ruth, Foxx and many others,"" Dr. Sam wrote. ""They were his heroes, and he gloried in the association, the Great American Game.... Even in his waning career in the bullpen or coaching, it was his life."" Another time, despairing about Moe's absorption in baseball, Dr. Sam said, ""All it ever did was make him happy.""

Bernard Berg and his wife, Rose Tashker, came to America from the Ukraine. In 1894 Bernard arrived in New York and found work ironing in a Manhattan laundry. When Rose arrived two years later, Bernard had put aside enough money to open his own laundry on the Lower East Side. He had higher ambitions than living in a cold-water tenement, though, and began studying at the Columbia College of Pharmacy at night. By the time his third child, Morris, was born, in March 1902, Bernard was a pharmacist.

As a four-year-old, Moe tossed apples and oranges with anyone who was willing. Four years later Bernard moved his family to the Roseville section of Newark, where he opened his own pharmacy and Moe played his first organized baseball. The Bergs were Jewish, so to qualify as a member of the Roseville Methodist Episcopal Church team, Moe adopted the slightly less ethnic pseudonym of Runt Wolfe. Sometimes he tossed the ball around with a brass-buttoned patrolman named Hibler. The policeman would put aside his derby and then sweat like a thresher as the slender boy, standing one manhole—20 feet—down the street, yelled, ""Harder, Mr. Hibler! Harder!""

For 30 years Bernard Berg worked 15 hours a day, seven days a week. Sam became a doctor, and Ethel a schoolteacher. Baby Moe, it was understood, would be a lawyer. While he was at Barringer High School, a Newark newspaper reported that Moe, an all-city third baseman, ""has an arm like a whip and is a steady batter."" He graduated at 16, and after a year at New York University, he transferred to Princeton.

Most Princeton undergraduates of that time came from wealthy Protestant families and had gone to prep school. As the son of Jewish immigrants, Berg walked the periphery of Princeton society. ""Moe was a loner,"" says his former classmate Donald Griffin. ""He was a scholar of distinction, and the social aspects of undergraduate life did not concern him."" Berg studied Latin, Greek, French, Spanish, Italian, German and Sanskrit, and he graduated 24th in a class of 211.

His college baseball career was equally distinguished. He started for the Tigers for three seasons, and as a senior he was the star shortstop on a team that won 18 straight and handed Holy Cross's great pitcher Ownie Carroll one of his two college losses. (Berg had one of Princeton's three hits against Carroll and scored the game's only run.) Positioned toward the bottom of the batting order because he was a plodding runner, Berg hit .337. He and second baseman Crossan Cooper developed a clever method of exchanging signs with an opposing runner on second: They yelled back and forth in Latin. (Later, Berg and Lyons, a Baylor graduate, would do so in Greek.)

As a senior Berg took a course in elementary linguistics. He wanted to go on to the Sorbonne to study philology and, especially, experimental phonetics. When he graduated in June 1923, he had two job offers: one from Princeton to teach Romance languages and the other from the Dodgers to play the remainder of the season for $5,000. He had also been admitted to Columbia Law School. Berg was torn. He loved baseball and, besides, the Dodger money could be his ticket to Paris.

Finally he followed his heart, which took him south to Philadelphia, where the Dodgers were playing the Phillies. Berg singled in a run in his first major league game, to the delight of a clump of recent Princeton graduates in the stands.

After this snappy debut Berg's first summer of professional baseball was more of an ordeal. Over 49 games he hit .186. Then he was off to Paris. His French was so impressive that his tuition at the Sorbonne was waived. The Dodgers didn't sign Berg for 1924, and it wasn't until after he hit .311 for the International League's Reading Keys in '25 that he returned to the majors. In November, Chicago White Sox owner Charles Comiskey bought him from Reading for $50,000 to play shortstop. What Comiskey got was a law student.

Berg had decided to use his baseball earnings to pursue his law degree in the off-season. When he asked for permission to report to the White Sox after spring training in 1926, in order to finish the semester, Comiskey agreed. By May, when Berg reported, rookie Bill Hunnefield had won the shortstop job. The White Sox finished fifth, and Berg hit only .221 in the 41 games he played.

Over the following winter Comiskey's patience with Berg's studies dwindled. ""My dear young man,"" the Old Roman wrote to Berg when Berg proposed skipping spring training again, ""The time has come when you must decide as to the profession you intend following."" Berg appealed to a dean at Columbia Law and was granted a leave of absence for the rest of the academic year.

Behind Hunnefield, he played in only 35 games in 1927, hitting .246. Mike Gonzales, an opposing scout, watched Berg play and filed the terse, damning dispatch that would become Berg's signature: ""Good field. No hit."" The unofficial word was that Berg could speak a dozen languages and couldn't hit in any of them.

One afternoon late in the season, a batter's swing connected with the hand of Sox catcher-manager Ray Schalk, breaking it. Then a foul tip split one of backup catcher Buck Crouse's fingers. Shortly after that, third-string catcher Harry McCurdy fractured his finger. From the bench Schalk bellowed, ""Get me another catcher. Class C, Class D, I don't care, get me a catcher!""

""What do you mean, Class C, Class D?"" came a low, even voice. ""You've got a big league catcher sitting right here."" It was Berg speaking. He was referring to first baseman Earl Sheely, who had caught in the minors. Schalk, however, thought Berg was talking about himself and sent him into the game. Berg had never caught before, but he performed flawlessly. ""Now, I'll tell ya, Moe Berg was as smart a ballplayer as ever come along,"" said Casey Stengel. ""Guy never caught in his life and then goes behind the plate like Mickey Cochrane.""

Berg caught in nine more games that year and in 73 games in 1928. In 1929, after he graduated from Columbia Law, Berg became the White Sox's starting backstop. ""Being allowed to catch is the best break I've ever had,"" Berg said.

That May he learned that he had survived New York State's brutal bar exam. He dined out alone the night the results were published, ordered a bottle of wine and drank a toast to his parents. The Manhattan law firm of Satterlee & Canfield hired him to do international contract litigation during the off-season. When journalists asked him about it, he said, ""I don't want to be known as a ballplayer who read a book, and I don't want to be known as a lawyer with a bat on my shoulder. I practice law in the winter and I play ball in the summer, and I am careful to keep the two separate in my life.""

In the spring of 1930 he tore ligaments in his knee when he caught his spikes in the dirt. Berg became so slow that, in Stengel's estimation, ""a turtle could beat him to first base.""

It would have been the perfect time to make a permanent transition to the law, but Berg did no such thing. He played 20 games for Chicago in '30, 10 for Cleveland in '31, and then he joined the Senators. Shirley Povich wrote in The Washington Post, ""The average mental capacity of the Washington Ball Club was hiked several degrees by the acquisition of the eminent Mr. Moe Berg."" Bernard Berg was disgusted. Standing outside the pharmacy one day, Dr. Sam tried to reason with him. ""Look, Pa,"" he said, ""we are in a depression, and Moe is making good money. Many of his Princeton classmates are janitors or are borrowing money from Moe.""

Bernard spat on the sidewalk and said, ""He's just a sport. He doesn't have a profession."" Bernard died in 1941, never having attended a baseball game. The black tie that Moe wore every day for the rest of his life was to honor his father.

Baseball was as fascinated by Berg as he was by the game. ""Moe was really something in the bullpen,"" an anonymous teammate told The Sporting News in 1972. ""We'd all sit around and listen to him discuss the Greeks, Romans, Japanese, anything. Hell, we didn't know what he was talking about, but it sure sounded good.""

Still, people wondered. ""Most people in baseball passed bons mots about him,"" says Joe Cascarella, a teammate of Berg's on his next team, the Red Sox, in the late '30s. ""What was this man doing playing baseball? Very puzzling. He was very, very closemouthed about any of his activities. It was hard to press him.""

Berg just liked to play. ""I seek no other man's shoes,"" he once said. ""Even grandmothers should experience the pure excitement of covering home plate with an ape charging home, cleats flying high.""

There was more to it, though. At heart Berg was a sybarite, and baseball was a steady job that paid well, permitted extensive travel, put him in contact with a vast variety of people and left most of each day free for reading, bathing and adventure. ""It left him time to do what he did best, and that is read,"" says Levitt. ""He wasn't, tied down."" Berg traveled with two suitcases, one filled with clothes and baseball equipment, the other with books and periodicals. When the Senators played at home, Berg liked to skip up to Baltimore, where his favorite poet, Edgar Allan Poe, was buried. Berg had memorized many of Poe's verses and would stand beside the grave and recite them.

Berg's twin personas, the ballplayer and the intellectual, gave him a special cachet, and so his friends included Catholic nuns and Will Rogers, the postmaster general and the Marx brothers. For contemporary baseball writers, Berg provided material beyond their dreams, and they shamelessly embellished the exploits of ""beetle-browed barrister Berg, the linguist who says 'Il fait chaud' to umpires.""

""During an evening's walk,"" wrote Arthur Sampson in the New York Herald, ""[Berg] will point out' planets, discuss politics, law, economics, music, art, drama, literature [and] current events with specialists in any of these fields.""

It was true, at least, that Berg enjoyed an evening's stroll, but most likely he was arm in arm with an attractive young woman. He was a man of striking good looks, 6'1"" and 185 pounds. In Washington he was a regular at black-tie embassy parties, where the Strauss waltzes, free meals and well-bred foreign women agreed with him. ""Moe generally lived at the Wardman Park [Hotel] and never had to buy a meal as he dined at all the embassies, where he talked their languages and kissed the hands of more women than Valentino,"" said Thomas, the White Sox pitcher, to the authors of Moe Berg: Athlete, Scholar, Spy. Berg never married, but he did share a New York apartment before the war with a high-society pianist. Eventually she married someone else. ""I think [Moe] was kind of happy that she got married,"" wrote Dr. Sam. With women, as with all people, for a brief spell he was extremely attentive. Then he was gone.

Travel was always invigorating to Berg. He first went to Japan with Lyons and Dodger outfielder Lefty O'Doul in 1932. Baseball was just catching on in that country, and the three men gave pitching, catching and hitting clinics together at six Japanese universities. Berg studied some Japanese before he left the U.S. and kept it up on the way over. He learned enough to flatter his hosts and to needle the irrepressible O'Doul. In a restaurant one day Berg wrote some Japanese characters on a napkin and handed it to a waitress, who recited phonetically, ""O'Doul is ugliest mug I have ever seen. He is also lousy ballplayer. Some day he will get hit with fly ball and get killed.""

""They loved him in Japan,"" wrote Lyons in a letter to Ethel Berg. The feeling was mutual. Berg wrote his family that he had never enjoyed anything as much as visiting Japan.

When Berg returned to Washington, he set an American League record by catching in 117 consecutive games (from 1931 to 1934) without making an error. (The record lasted 12 years.) Hall of Fame pitcher Walter Johnson, Berg's manager with the Senators, said that ""barring Bill Dickey and Mickey Cochrane, Berg has caught as well as any man in the American League.""

In 1934 he was back in Japan. A team of American All-Stars that included Babe Ruth and Lou Gehrig was invited to tour the country, and Berg was asked to come along. When he boarded the Empress of Japan in Vancouver on Oct. 20, he carried a contract to write travel pieces for the Boston American, and a small 16-mm Bell and Howell movie camera. It was a highly successful trip. In the American, Berg marveled at the Japanese love of baseball. He posed with geisha girls, impressed his teammates with his Japanese and made a speech to students at Meiji University. ""I someday hope that our innocent junket through Japan will serve to bring the countries whom we represent...closer together,"" he said. Meanwhile, Berg quietly performed his first known act of espionage.

He was seeing very little action on the field during the tour, and one day it was scarcely noticed that he failed to show up for the game. Instead, he walked to St. Luke's International Hospital, one of the tallest buildings in Tokyo, carrying some flowers. In the reception area he asked to see the daughter of the U.S. ambassador, who had just given birth. Berg was directed to the seventh floor, but he rode the elevator to the top floor, climbed to the roof and, from beneath his clothes, withdrew the movie camera. It was a powerful instrument, and as he panned across the refineries and factories of Tokyo and the shipyards of Yokohama, he also recorded an image of Mount Fuji, more than 55 miles away. Finished, he left the bouquet on the roof and departed. Eight years later, when General Jimmy Doolittle's bombers raided Tokyo, their targets were plotted by referring to Berg's film.

During the remainder of the trip Berg talked baseball with anyone who approached him, advised Mizuno on the manufacture of baseball gloves (there was a sudden demand) and enthralled Tokyo reporters, who wrote about him with glee. Today there is a Moe Berg collection at the Japanese Baseball Hall of Fame, and his biography, long out of print in the U.S., continues to sell in its Japanese translation. For Berg, fanatic loyalty to his country never displaced the warm feelings he had for the Japanese.

In 1935 Berg joined the Red Sox, his fifth and final team. Stouter now, he would never again bat more than 141 times in a season. But as usual he was prized by the ball club and by reporters. (He caused a mild sensation one day when he showed up for work and a copy of David Hume's An Enquiry Concerning Human Understanding fell out of his wad of newspapers.) Getting along with owners was one of' Berg's specialties. One owner told the journalist Taylor Spink, ""I tried to cut his salary one year, and Moe wrote me such a nice letter that I felt ashamed and gave him a raise instead.""

In the late '30s the radio quiz show Information Please was one of the country's most popular programs. A panel composed of New Yorker literary critic Clifton Fadiman, poet and wit Franklin P. Adams, New York Times columnist John Kieran, pianist Oscar Levant and a guest competed to answer trivia questions. In 1939 Kieran invited Berg to appear. He dazzled listeners with his erudition. He knew what the Willy/Nicky correspondence was, and he could identify poi, soy, loy and oy. The show received 24,000 letters. Judge Kenesaw Mountain Landis, the commissioner of baseball, wrote Berg: ""You did more for the image of baseball in half an hour than I have since I became commissioner.""

Berg was immediately invited for a return engagement, and then a third. The following spring, on the Red Sox's barnstorming trip north from spring training, Berg's teammates created a new pastime. Whenever the team bus entered a sizable town, someone would cry out, ""Information please!"" and Berg would dutifully offer up the local history, listing the date of the town's founding, its most famous citizens, its principal industries and other pertinent facts. This was just one of the ways Berg entertained his colleagues. Another was to listen to a couple of sentences spoken by a stranger and then try to identify not just the person's home state but his hometown.

Berg worked as a coach for Boston in 1940 and 1941. During that time the Atlantic Monthly asked him to write an article on pitchers and catchers. His piece appeared in the September 1941 issue. After the war, Berg met another contributor to the Atlantic, Albert Einstein, at Princeton. ""Mr. Berg,"" exclaimed the scientist after a brief recital on his violin, ""you teach me baseball, and I'll teach you mathematics."" He paused a moment and then added, ""But let's forget it. I'm sure you'd learn mathematics faster than I'd learn baseball.""

Berg's life was pleasant enough, but a war was going on, and the patriot in Berg could not abide the notion of another cozy summer at Fenway. In 1941, after much lobbying by Berg, his friend Nelson Rockefeller, then the coordinator of the Office of Inter-American Affairs, offered him a position as a goodwill ambassador. Berg requested his unconditional release from the Red Sox. Soon he was packing his bags for Brazil.

Berg's job was to tour U.S. bases in Latin America, handing out Softball equipment, books and fishing tackle to both soldiers and local citizens. The region was rife with pro-Axis political sentiment, so Berg was also sending back to Rockefeller memos marked SECRET AND CONFIDENTIAL that evaluated potential dangers to the U.S. from fascists in Central and South America and offered suggestions on wooing neighboring countries to the U.S. side. Working without precise orders, Berg enjoyed himself immensely, picking up, among other things, news of Mussolini's failing health, a middling proficiency in Portuguese and plenty of women in Rio. Rockefeller wrote him in April 1943, ""Only someone with your experience and knowledge of international as well as human problems could have handled this situation with such tact and effectiveness."" By summer Berg was over in Europe.

General Wild Bill Donovan, the father of the OSS, created a bohemian intelligence operation staffed by a sparkling group of amateurs that included lawyers, professors, businessmen, lotharios, Arthur Schlesinger Jr., Julia Child and members of Murder Inc. Donovan wanted daring men and women who liked adventure and could keep a secret. In many ways, Moe Berg was the ideal OSS agent.

Donovan initially found Berg appealing probably because of his linguistic skills. Berg took an oath of secrecy, was issued a revolver and a capsule of cyanide, and was given a variety of assignments in Italy, Switzerland and Sweden. Easily his most significant work was in atomic counterintelligence. The British were confident that Hitler's scientists were nowhere near completion of an atomic bomb, but Donovan and Lt. Gen. Leslie Groves, head of the Manhattan Project—the U.S. bomb effort—wanted their own confirmation. In preparation, Berg had immersed himself in nuclear physics. This enabled him to attend a lecture given in 1944 in Zurich by the leading German atomic scientist, Werner Heisenberg. Berg had orders to kidnap or assassinate Heisenberg if a German atomic bomb project was flourishing. Masquerading as a student, Berg listened to Heisenberg's talk, which had nothing to do with weapons production. Afterward, Berg strolled about gathering information and ultimately decided to let Heisenberg be.

A recently declassified memo written in 1946 by Colonel Howard Dix to recommend Berg for the Medal of Freedom says that Berg's attendance at the meeting ""yielded the most important information snatched from under the cloak of secrecy which the Germans maintained on this subject. This and other information sent back by Mr. Berg and obtained by him while under continual risk of exposure and retaliatory action, was used in guiding, the U.S. operation in this field and in determining...the pressures to be placed upon U.S. scientists for rapid progress towards ultimate completion of the Manhattan Project.""

Berg's other intelligence work was eclectic. He interviewed scores of European scientists. He helped confirm that the Germans did not have a sophisticated bacteriological warfare program. He worked on codes, translated documents and sent in reports on Axis glider factories, radar, optics, and radio-controlled missiles. He arranged for prominent scientists to escape to the U.S., most notably Antonio Ferri, Italy's great aeronautical engineer. When news of Ferri's arrival in Virginia in 1944 reached President Roosevelt, he said, ""I see Berg is still catching pretty well.""

Some CIA scholars hold his work in considerable esteem. ""He sent back reports that were much fuller and humanly more revealing than was customary for intelligence agents,"" says Thomas Powers, whose book Heisenberg's War will be published by Knopf early next year. ""Berg was interested in what was going through a man's mind. He could be very imaginative in the ways he'd find people and talk to them. And no man ever knew more languages and said less in them.""

When he was first told that he was a likely recipient of the Medal of Freedom, Berg requested permission to tell people what he had done to merit it. He was told that this was classified information. He then refused the medal on grounds that it would ""embarrass"" him, and he took most of his secrets to his grave. After he died, Ethel Berg wrote to the government and claimed the award. The medal is now in the Baseball Hall of Fame in Coopers-town, N.Y.

Charlie Wagner, an old Red Sox teammate, saw Berg shortly after he returned home from the war. ""He seemed like he knew what he was doing but was a little off-center,"" says Wagner. The last 25 years of Berg's life were marked by increasingly erratic behavior. At first it was hardly noticeable. Berg began carrying an umbrella on sunny days. But then he'd always had his own sartorial ideas. Various disappointments in the next few years, however, exacerbated matters.

Before leaving for Europe, Berg had invested what money he had in a pair of companies: Novelart, a stationery manufacturer, and Novelview, which made films. When he got back in 1946, he found that not only had both firms gone under, but his partner in the two companies had run off, leaving him without assets and responsible for a healthy sum of back taxes. It took years for Berg to settle with the IRS, and the acrimony involved deflated his spirits.

The CIA left him despondent, too. Berg liked spying as well as anything he'd ever done, including playing baseball. When the OSS was disbanded by President Truman and replaced by the CIA, the tenor of American intelligence changed, becoming more bureaucratic. There wasn't much room for a colorful improviser like Berg. He received occasional CIA assignments that had to do with atomic intelligence in Europe. Most often, however, when Moe arrived at Dr. Sam's house and asked if there was a letter for him from the government, the answer was no.

Berg had always, somewhat compulsively, filled hotel stationery, small notebooks, even paper napkins, with jottings, but at this point the habit became obsessive. He holed up for a spell in a Washington hotel and filled about 500 pages of letter stationery with a complex plan for revising the U.S. intelligence network in Eastern Europe.

Berg dabbled in other things. Rockefeller briefly made him president of Equity International Company in Dover, Del., but office life didn't agree with him, and he was forced to resign. He took on occasional legal chores, yet never worked for a firm again. Mostly he was a vagabond.

Sometimes it was Levitt who put Berg up for a night or two. Other times it might be Joe DiMaggio or Berg's old Princeton teammate Cooper. ""I said to come on over and have dinner and spend the night with us,"" related Cooper. ""He came, he had dinner, spent the night and stayed six weeks."" Berg traveled with only a razor and toothbrush in a ditty bag. At night he washed his clothes in the sink and hung them over the bathtub to dry.

People were sympathetic and baffled. Some lent him money or bought him clothes. ""I can't understand why, with his abilities, he would be impoverished,"" says Levitt. The answer was that Berg never tried to earn a living. ""He didn't want to live his life scurrying for a train every day,"" says Holtzman. ""He lived his life the way he wanted to. He beat the game.""

Berg attended meetings of the American Philosophical Society, read all day in used-book stores, went out for dinner with people and often let them pay the check. Berg drank Bloody Marys in blowsy bars with reporter Jimmy Breslin, dined out with Stengel and Groves, and chased about town with an entourage that included sports editor Harry Grayson, sportswriter Murray Olderman and various Runyonesque characters, including a horseplayer named Andy and a tough guy from the Bronx named Tony.

Berg's primary base of operations remained baseball. He owned a lifetime major league pass and was a regular in the Yankee Stadium press box, where he watched the game and ate from the spread set out for the reporters.

In the late 1960s, now past 60 years of age, Berg met the publisher Sayre Ross of the Sayre Ross Company. ""He came to me in a black tie and baggy pants,"" says Ross. ""I later learned that he had this huge hernia he never attended to. I kept insisting, 'Let the Army hospital do it,' and he kept saying, 'To hell with them. I won't let the Army do anything for me.' One morning he arrived at my office at 8:45 a.m. I walked in, and he was sitting there. He had seven newspapers from all over the country. 'Look,' he says, 'I don't want anybody to touch them.' That was the beginning of Moe Berg's stacks."" Over the next few years Berg came to Ross's every day that he wasn't traveling. He never paid a dime of rent or did much of anything but fill the office with piles of newspapers, flirt with Ross's secretaries and, when Ross needed them, provide the telephone numbers of people like Stengel and DiMaggio. Ross loved having him.

Berg's behavior in his last few years became so strange that Dr. Sam concluded that he was senile. After Dr. Sam asked him to leave his house, Moe shared Ethel's Newark house.

By all accounts Ethel Berg was a harridan. Like her brothers, she never married. She despised Dr. Sam, managing to live about 10 blocks from him for 50 years without exchanging so much as a greeting. Later, when she learned that Dr. Sam was cooperating with Moe's biographers, she rejected their request for an interview and told them she would sue if her name appeared in the book. Instead, she published her own book—more a collection of Moe's papers, slightly annotated—titled My Brother Morris Berg: The Real Moe. She loved her baby brother, but she wore on him as she did on everyone else. ""There were times that Moe had to board elsewhere for weeks at a time to get away from the aggravation and tension,"" wrote Dr. Sam. ""But Moe had no money, so he had to make the best of things with Ethel.""

Berg was in reasonably good health for a man of 70 when, in a hurry to get to the bathroom one day, he accidentally fell against the corner of a table, jabbing his midsection. He lay in bed for days until Ethel forced him to go to the hospital. Berg died three days later of internal bleeding. His last words to his attending nurse were a question: ""How did the Mets do today?""

Bernard and Rose Berg are buried in a Newark cemetery. According to Owen's research, the urn containing Moe's ashes was interred with his parents, and his name was engraved on their tombstone. He didn't stay there long, though. Ethel had the urn exhumed and took it with her to Israel. She buried the urn herself somewhere outside Jerusalem. She died in 1987, so the final mystery of Moe Berg's life is that nobody knows where he is.

But instead of doing it for money, Antarctic dolly-birds are turning tricks to get rocks off their menfolk.

Stones are essential for penguins to build their nests. A shortage has led to the unorthodox tactics.

""Stones are the valuable currency in penguin terms,"" said Dr Fiona Hunter, a researcher in the Zoology Department at Cambridge University, who has spent five years observing the birds' mating patterns.

Prostitution is described as the world's oldest profession. But Dr Hunter is convinced it is the first time it has been seen in animals.

Penguin partners

All of the female penguins Dr Hunter observed trading sex for stones had partners.

Penguins stick to the same mate, she said, but none of the males twigged what was happening.

""There was no suspicion on the part of the males. Females quite often go off on their own to collect stones, so as far as the males are concerned there is no reason to suspect.""

She added: ""It tends to be females targeting single males, otherwise the partner female would beat the intruder up.""

Dr Hunter and Dr Lloyd Davis of the University of Otago watched the penguins at work on Ross Island, about 800 miles from the South Pole as part of a Antarctica New Zealand programme.

Tricking their prey

On some occasions the prostitute penguins trick the males. They carry out the elaborate courtship ritual, which usually leads to mating.

Having bagged their stone, they would then run off.

""The courtship display is a head-bowing display,"" Dr Hunter said. ""It usually starts with the male, who bows his head and looks out the corner of his eye.""

She said she does not think the female penguins are doing it just for the stones.

""The female only takes one or two stones,"" she said. ""It takes hundreds to build the nest to get their eggs off the ground.

""I think what they are doing is having copulation for another reason and just taking the stones as well. We don't know exactly why, but they are using the males.""

She said the female penguins could also be testing potential future mates, in case their existing partner died before the next mating period.

The single male penguins appeared to have only their own pleasure as a motive.

The action takes place during a three-week mating period starting in late October.

The most stones Dr Hunter saw a single female taking was 62, although she said she suspects her final total was higher.

The number of prostitute penguins is quite low, she said.

""It's probably only a few percent,"" she said. ""I was watching opportunistically, so I can't give an exact figure of how common it really is.""

Other animals have been seen trading food for sexual favours but only within a partnership."

UPDATE: January 10, 2017 – The question remains, where is Eric Braverman? As I covered 11 days ago, below, no one has been able to get in contact with the former Clinton Foundation CEO since October 22nd. That’s when Wikileaks released an email in which John Podesta named him as a possible mole within the Clinton Foundation. The mainstream media continues to ignore the story.

And is he really missing? I just spoke with his father, Stanley Braverman, who told me, “It’s nonsense, ma’am, it’s not true,” before hanging up on me. Note how easy it would be for his dad to disprove it. Instead, he just denied it and hung up.

Snopes reports, “New Haven, New York City and Washington D.C. police have no record of a missing person with his name, nor is Braverman listed on NamUs, a national database of missing persons maintained by the Justice Department.”

Emails from The Stream to Braverman, Yale University, where he teaches one course, the FBI, and his “husband” Neil Brown received no substantive response. The Free Thought Project had no luck getting information from the university.

In Custody? Laying Low? Seeking Asylum?

Braverman had been hired by Chelsea Clinton to clean up corruption within the foundation, but was forced out by longtime Clinton insiders. The right-wing blogosphere has speculated that the FBI has him in protective FBI custody to protect him from the Clintons or that he’s lying low at the Clintons’ request, in order to avoid being subpoenaed to testify against the organization. Others speculate that he has sought asylum in the Russian embassy.

While the rightwing blogosphere is boiling over with theories, the mainstream media isn’t covering the story.

While the rightwing blogosphere is boiling over with theories, the mainstream media isn’t covering the story. CNN is running around the clock coverage of the congressional investigation into Russia allegedly hacking into Podesta’s emails and the DNC’s emails, but has not mentioned the possibility Braverman might have leaked Podesta’s emails to Wikileaks.

Wikileaks founder Julian Assange said a disgruntled Democratic insider gave him the emails, not the Russians.

Braverman isn’t the only one at the Clinton Foundation who Podesta thought could be a mole. In an email exchange with an ally, Podesta said, “could be doug or ira,” referring to Doug Bales and Ira Magaziner.

Still Missing

Since my previous article came out, the only mention of Braverman’s disappearance by the mainstream media has been Politico’s derisive reference to the story as fake news. At least Snopes revised their entry on the story, changing the status from “fake” to “unknown,” with a link to my article.

The date to watch is Thursday, January 19th. That’s the Yale class Braverman teaches, “Innovation in Government and Society,” begins. We’ll know whether he is missing or not depending on whether he shows up to teach. But don’t expect to see a New York Times journalist there. They’re too busy covering the congressional hearings about the claim that the Russians hacked the emails and gave them to Wikileaks.

December 29, 2016 – Eric Braverman, the Clinton Foundation CEO from 2013 until 2015, has apparently been missing since October. His absence has fueled speculations in the blogosphere but so far has been ignored by the media.

Some speculate, with good reason, that Braverman may have gone into hiding after an email mentioning his name was released by Wikileaks on October 22 of this year. In the March 2015 email exchange, Center for American Progress President Neera Tanden told Clinton campaign manager and confidant John Podesta there was a mole within the Clinton Foundation. Podesta in his reply told Tanden the mole was Braverman.

Braverman had abruptly resigned from the Clinton Foundation shortly before this email exchange took place. And then, after the email exchange was made public by Wikileaks, Braverman vanished from the public eye.

This seems like a story that someone might want to report.

The last evidence of Braverman’s public activity was October 12, when he posted his last tweet on Twitter. (Usually he tweets about once a month. His “husband,” Neil Brown, hasn’t tweeted since August, although he rarely tweets.) I left a voicemail on Braverman’s personal phone and sent him an email, but received no response. He is still listed as a lecturer at Yale University and, contrary to some reports, there is a record of his lectures going back several years. I contacted the press office and Braverman’s department at Yale and received no response.

Braverman, the Podesta Leaks and the Clinton Foundation

Craig Murray, a former British ambassador to Uzbekistan and a close associate of WikiLeaks founder Julian Assange, told The Daily Mail that Podesta’s emails were leaked to the organization by a disgruntled insider, not the Russians. Consequently, there are suspicions it may have been Braverman. (Though some of the Podesta emails are dated after Braverman’s tenure with the foundation, if he had Podesta’s password, he could still have accessed his email after leaving.)

Politico ran a long story about Braverman’s ouster in 2015. Based on email correspondence released by Wikileaks, Braverman was apparently hired by Chelsea Clinton to clean up the corruption in the foundation, but then forced out of the foundation by longtime Clinton loyalists; sources say Podesta made him a target.

In 2011, Podesta’s leaked emails show that Chelsea was aggressively calling for an internal investigation. For example, former President Bill Clinton had raised over $1 billion though the foundation to rebuild 100 villages in India, but only $53 million was spent on the project. Also, Braverman resigned at the time Hillary was arranging one of her notorious “pay to play” deals with foreign leaders: a $12 million contribution from the king of Morocco in exchange for giving a speech.

#Where’s Eric: Did Braverman Request Asylum From the Russians?

So far Braverman’s apparent disappearance has only been discussed by bloggers and fringe websites, which often mix the fact that he has gone silent with other unconfirmed claims. For instance, the site WhatDoesItMean.com reported that Braverman requested asylum in Russia on October 23. The information apparently came from a Russian blogger, who reported it in a rambling blog post on LiveLeak.

That’s pretty thin evidence. Moreover, WhatDoesItMean.com is known for posting questionable news stories. The left-leaning, myth-debunking site Snopes labeled the news site’s account of Braverman as false, but based its judgment on the fact that website publishes false stories. Aside from this circular argument, Snopes provides no independent evidence for its judgment. I contacted the Russian embassy and received no response. So at the moment, the claim that Braverman requested asylum from the Russians is an unconfirmed rumor.

#Where’sEric: Could Braverman be in FBI Protective Custody?

There are also rumors that Braverman is in FBI protective custody, perhaps in exchange for testifying against the Clintons. Sources within the FBI have said it is likely there will be indictments handed down over the Clinton Foundation’s pay-to-play schemes. Senior FBI officials told CNN that the investigation into the Clinton Foundation had never ended and is still ongoing. According to The Daily Caller News Foundation, that probe now involves as many as five FBI bureaus across the country: New York, Little Rock, Washington, D.C., Los Angeles and Miami.

Would the FBI have hustled Braverman to safety once it was known Podesta had pegged him as a mole? This theory seems plausible, given what we know. But there is still no independent evidence of it.

All Questions, No Answers

If Braverman is in hiding to protect his life, is it because he leaked the Podesta emails to Wikileaks, and/or is he preparing to testify against the Clintons? The one thing we know is that Braverman has disappeared from the public eye, and that neither he, his “husband” Neil Brown, nor his family, nor his Yale employers, has made a single public statement to dispel the speculations.

Last year our world was immersed in crises, with prominent leaders offering us a nightmarish vision of a society blinded by hatred and fear. This emboldened those who promote bigotry, but it inspired far more people to campaign for a more hopeful future. Salil Shetty, Secretary General of Amnesty International

Nevertheless, the organization found that a growing movement of both first-time and seasoned activists campaigning for social justice provides real hope of reversing the slide towards oppression.

The report, The State of the World’s Human Rights, covers 159 countries and delivers the most comprehensive analysis of the state of human rights in the world today.

“The transparently hateful move by the US government in January to ban entry to people from several Muslim-majority countries set the scene for a year in which leaders took the politics of hate to its most dangerous conclusion,” said Salil Shetty, Secretary General of Amnesty International.

“We saw the ultimate consequence of a society encouraged to hate, scapegoat and fear minorities laid bare in the horrific military campaign of ethnic cleansing against the Rohingya people in Myanmar,” said Salil Shetty.

World leaders abandon human rights, igniting protest movements globally

“The specters of hatred and fear now loom large in world affairs, and we have few governments standing up for human rights in these disturbing times. Instead, leaders such as al-Sisi, Duterte, Maduro, Putin, Trump and Xi are callously undermining the rights of millions,” said Salil Shetty.

“The feeble response to crimes against humanity and war crimes from Myanmar to Iraq, South Sudan, Syria and Yemen underscored the lack of leadership on human rights. Governments are shamelessly turning the clock back on decades of hard-won protections.”

Signs of regression cited in the report include clampdowns on rights to protest in France, and attempts to roll back women’s rights from the USA to Russia and Poland.

With the report launching in Washington D.C., Amnesty International warned that President Trump’s backward steps on human rights are setting a dangerous precedent for other governments to follow.

“Defenders of human rights around the world can look to the people of the United States to stand with them, even where the US government has failed. As President Trump takes actions that violate human rights at home and abroad, activists from across the country remind us that the fight for universal human rights has always been waged and won by people in their communities,” said Margaret Huang, executive director of Amnesty International USA.

Regressive policies have inspired many people to join long-standing struggles, and the report details many important victories that human rights activists helped to secure. These include lifting the total abortion ban in Chile, achieving a step towards marriage equality in Taiwan and securing a landmark victory against forced evictions in Abuja, Nigeria.

A vast Women’s March centered on the USA and with offshoots around the world showcased the growing influence of new social movements, as did the #MeToo phenomenon and Latin America’s “Ni Una Menos” – which denounced violence against women and girls.

“The indomitable spirit of the women leading powerful human rights movements reminds us that the desire for equality, dignity and justice will never be extinguished. There is a palpable sense that protest movements are on the rise globally. If governments stand against such movements, they will erode their legitimacy,” said Salil Shetty.

Free speech takes on colossal importance in the renewed battle for human rights

Governments think they can declare open season on human rights activists. They may shut down our newspapers, undermine judges and jail activists, but we refuse to be silenced. Salil Shetty

The willingness of prominent leaders to tout “fake news” in order to manipulate public opinion, coupled with attacks on institutions that act as checks on power, show that free speech will be a key battle-ground for human rights this year, said Amnesty International.

“In 2018, we cannot take for granted that we will be free to gather together in protest or to criticize our governments. In fact, speaking out is becoming more dangerous,” said Salil Shetty.

Hundreds of activists were killed last year as authorities sought to silence campaigners and muzzle the media, the report said. The biggest jailors of journalists were Turkey, Egypt and China – where Nobel laureate Liu Xiaobo died after being imprisoned for criticizing the government. With governments shamelessly pursuing human rights activists, Amnesty International faced threats to its work in Hungary as well as the unprecedented arrests of its staff in Turkey.

“Governments think they can declare open season on human rights activists. They may shut down our newspapers, undermine judges and jail activists, but we refuse to be silenced. If the legendary Chinese activist Liu Xiaobo taught us anything, it is that we must speak truth to power precisely when it seems impossible to do so,” said Salil Shetty.

Hate on the march as people targeted for their identity

The report emphasized the need for people to continue to speak out against the kind of hate-filled rhetoric seen in xenophobic slogans at a nationalist march in Warsaw, Poland, a white supremacist rally in Charlottesville, USA, and sweeping crackdowns on LGBTI communities from Chechnya to Egypt.

This was underscored by the vilification of refugees and migrants from the very highest levels of government. While the Trump administration made headlines for its anti-refugee rhetoric, the report says they were not alone in pursuing xenophobic policies.

“Donald Trump’s policies may have marked a new era of human rights regression but they are not unique. If you look across from Australia to Hungary, leaders have long treated refugees and migrants as problems to be deflected, not as human beings with rights who deserve our compassion,” said Salil Shetty.

Governments must address the burning injustices fueling protest movements

The report also notes that millions of people worldwide are facing increasingly precarious access to basic goods and services such as housing, food and health care. Amnesty International warned that unless governments tackle the underlying causes of poverty and inequality then there is huge potential for even greater unrest.

“Across the world people are being forced to live an intolerable existence because they are being denied access to adequate food, clean water, health care and basic shelter. If you take away these human rights, you breed despair with no limit or end. From Venezuela to Iran, we are witnessing the formidable spread of social discontent,” warned Salil Shetty.

Instead of trying to silence people when they speak out, governments should address their concerns, said Amnesty International, and start by loosening restrictions on the media, civil society and other key checks on power.

“We are witnessing history in the making as people rise up and demand justice in greater numbers. If leaders fail to discern what is driving their people to protest, then this ultimately will be their own undoing. People have made it abundantly clear that they want human rights: the onus now is on governments to show that they are listening,” said Salil Shetty."

https://www.snopes.com/fact-check/devos-family-campaign-contributions/	betsy devos and her family contributed millions of dollars to the campaigns of republican candidates.	true	['betsy devos', 'campaign contributions']	2017/02/08	Dan Evon	['https://www.opensecrets.org/news/2016/12/betsy-devos-big-giving-relatives-family-qualifies-gop-royalty/', 'https://www.washingtonpost.com/news/politics/wp/2017/02/07/the-devos-vote-is-a-bad-case-study-for-the-power-of-campaign-contributions/']	https://www.opensecrets.org/news/2016/12/betsy-devos-big-giving-relatives-family-qualifies-gop-royalty/	https://www.opensecrets.org/	"It’s no secret that Betsy DeVos, President-elect Donald Trump’s pick to lead the Education Department, is a political fundraising juggernaut. Her contributions to candidates and school choice causes around the country have been all over the news since she was named the nominee.

More consequential, though, are the depth and breadth of contributions by her family — by birth and by marriage — going back decades. The donations have helped make the clan a pillar of the Republican Party, immensely influential in steering GOP politics and causes.

Since 1989, Betsy DeVos and her relatives have given at least $20.2 million to Republican candidates, party committees, PACs and super PACs, according to an OpenSecrets.org analysis. (A tabbed spreadsheet is here.) Amway, the multilevel marketing giant now known as Alticor that earned much of the family its wealth, gave another nearly $3.6 million to the party prior to 2002. And that’s just at the federal level — family members have given hundreds of millions more to state and local level politics and to nonprofit groups, think tanks and media outlets championing their favored conservative causes.

*At the federal level since 1989

In the 2016 cycle alone, the family had given at least $10 million as of late October to a host of GOP candidates and committees. Much of that — $4.4 million — went to super PACs: those supporting the White House bids of Sens. Marco Rubio and Ted Cruz as well as former Florida Gov. Jeb Bush and businesswoman Carly Fiorina, and the Koch brothers-backed Freedom Partners Action Fund and the super PAC started by Republican strategist Karl Rove, American Crossroads; the latter two groups helped support numerous Republicans in tight House and Senate races.

Betsy herself, along with her husband, Dick DeVos, Jr., has contributed more than $7.7 million to federal candidates, committees and parties since 1990, including almost $4.8 million to super PACs. DeVos and her husband ramped up their gifts significantly in the 2016 cycle, setting a new personal record of about $2.7 million. None of that, however, went to Trump or his supporting super PACs.

Not so for her brother, Erik Prince, co-founder of controversial private security contractor Blackwater (now known as Academi). He made two donations to Make America Number 1, a super PAC that backed Cruz and then Trump; Prince’s $150,000 in gifts came after Trump had become the Republican party nominee. Since 1990, he and his ex-wives have given $519,546, including $175,309 in 2016.

Betsy DeVos voiced her thoughts about her family’s abundant political giving in a 1997 piece in Roll Call, in which she wrote that she had decided “to stop taking offense at the suggestion that we are buying influence. Now I simply concede the point. They are right. We do expect some things in return. We expect to foster a conservative governing philosophy consisting of limited government and respect for traditional American values.”

The definition of “traditional American values” is in the eye of the beholder, of course.

It was Dick Jr.’s father, 90-year-old Richard “Rich” DeVos, Sr., who first established the family as a force in conservative fundraising. The elder DeVos, who co-founded Amway, which his sons have helped lead in various capacities, and owns the NBA’s Orlando Magic, has an estimated worth of $5.1 billion, according to Forbes. He’s a past president of the Council for National Policy, a secretive network of conservative leaders of which he was an early funder.

*At the federal level since 1989

This cycle, he and his wife, Helen, also contributed their highest-ever cash totals, donating almost $2.9 million – the first election cycle they have crested $1 million since 1998. Overall, the elder DeVoses have given nearly $6.8 million in federal elections since 1990.

These are big numbers, relatively speaking. On the Center for Responsive Politics’ list of top individual donors for 2016, Rich and Helen DeVos came in at No. 61 and Dick and Betsy DeVos at No. 65. Family members also made the list in previous election cycles – Dick and Betsy were 53rd in 2014. The Richard DeVos family ranked 54th in 2010.

More broadly, Amway’s employees and PAC combined also rank highly among organizational donors: They placed 19th in 2004 and fourth in the nation in 1994.

A web of nonprofits



Help us keep government accountable by making a donation today.

Savvy political players like the DeVoses don’t engage only in direct electoral action. Through organized giving by its various foundations and strategic involvement in the institutions that receive their money, the DeVos family has leveraged extensive influence in nonprofit networks structured around their pet causes.

Most DeVos giving in this sphere is done through five foundations: the Richard and Helen DeVos Foundation; the Dick and Betsy DeVos Foundation; the Daniel and Pamella DeVos Foundation; Cheri DeVos’ CDV5 Foundation; and the Douglas and Maria DeVos Foundation. (Daniel, Cheri and Douglas DeVos are all siblings of Dick Jr., Betsy’s husband.) According to one analysis of foundation tax records, the DeVos family donated more than $90 million in 2013 altogether and around $94 million in 2014 — with nearly half going to groups involved in education.

The DeVos family’s philanthropic efforts have a more social conservative bent than those of, say, the Koch brothers; for years the DeVoses have provided generous grants to religious-based organizations and — in particular — religious schools. Still, they have found common ground with the Kochs on a number of issues. Regular attendees at Koch network biannual donor meetings, the DeVoses have provided substantial support to the Koch-seeded charitable arm of their Americans for Prosperity, a very active dark money group; the FreedomWorks Foundation, which is connected to another dark money outfit that originated with one started by the Kochs; and the Mercatus Institute, a “market-focused” research center at George Mason University that has received funding from the Kochs since the 1980s.

And the family has actively fought to sweep away restrictions on money in politics with substantial contributions to nonprofits that litigate against such limits. Those include the Center for Competitive Politics and the James Madison Center for Free Speech, a nonprofit set up by Citizens United attorney James Bopp and Sen. Mitch McConnell (R-Ky.) that consistently funnels nearly the entirety of its funds to Bopp’s firm each year. Bopp has taken a broadsword to campaign finance restrictions nationwide, mounting legal challenges to them at the federal, state and local levels.



Betsy DeVos may have married into the DeVos dynasty, but her own family has its own strong ties to the conservative movement. Her father, Edgar Prince, helped Gary Bauer create the Family Research Council, an influential conservative group. And along with her siblings, Betsy sits on the board of the Edgar & Elsa Prince Foundation, a major donor to groups that include the Education Freedom Fund, the Heritage Foundation and the Alliance Defense Fund.



Trump’s pick holds strategic advisory positions with a number of nonprofit organizations that lobby to varying degrees on education issues, including Jeb Bush’s Foundation for Excellence in Education. But her baby is the American Federation for Children a 501(c)(4) “dark money” group that promotes school voucher programs and charter schools across the country. AFC has significantly increased its efforts in recent years: It told the IRS that it made just $250,000 in political expenditures in 2009, a figure that increased to over $1 million by 2010 and nearly $1.7 million by 2011. In 2014, the number dropped a bit to just over $1 million.

But that year, AFC and its affiliated organizations boasted spending $4.5 million between the primary and general elections on 242 races in nine states — without ever disclosing its donors. It reported that pro-school choice candidates — mainly governors, state legislators and other non-federal politicians — won in 92 percent of the general election races it targeted, distinguishing AFC, with Betsy DeVos as its chair, as a powerhouse in the movement.



And AFC’s efforts go far beyond direct involvement in political contests. Among other activities, it has funneled money into other “dark money” groups that support contenders for state supreme court seats deemed likely to be friendly to policies advocated by AFC that could be legally challenged.



The Education nominee also heads All Children Matter, a political committee that lobbies for school choice. Started with seed money from DeVos’ Advocates for School Choice, the predecessor to AFC, All Children Matter has been funded by millions from the DeVos family over the years, but has also received substantial sums from the Walton family (of Walmart fame) and other high profile conservative donors. Though DeVos was not personally named in the case, All Children Matter has millions in outstanding fines for election law violations dating back to 2008 — a record amount that is nearly a decade past due. Betsy DeVos led the group at the time of the violations — in fact, she is the only person who has been listed on All Children Matter’s leadership page since 2006.

Supporting the bench



Megadonors tend not to focus their contributions only on those in the majors; they direct some of their investments to minor leaguers, too, as well as those who might have a more direct local impact on their concerns. The Grand Rapids, Mich.- based DeVoses are no exception, giving extensively in state and local elections. They’ve contributed, for instance, a combined $9.5 million to the Michigan Republican Party in the last 20 years.

According to National Institute on Money in State Politics data, Betsy DeVos has given over $1.9 million in state and local elections since 1996, a total that pales in comparison to her husband Dick’s $40.2 million. To be fair, the lion’s share of that sum was the nearly $35.4 million that he gave to his own 2006 gubernatorial campaign.

In that contest, DeVos family members (including the candidate) accounted for three of his top four donors. But DeVos, who was challenging Democratic incumbent Jennifer Granholm, fell short in the general election by a 56-to-42 percent margin.

Overall, Dick DeVos’s siblings have cut large checks at the state and local levels. Doug DeVos, the current president of Amway, has donated almost $2.8 million in these elections with his wife, Maria, according to the National Institute on Money in State Politics. Dan, a sports executive and the current chairman of the Orlando Magic, has contributed a little less than $2.4 million with his wife, Pamella. Their sister, Cheri DeVos, a former Amway vice president, has given more than $1.25 million to state and local political causes.

State-level advocacy organizations have also drawn significant DeVos largesse. For example, eight DeVos family members together gave an even $2 million to Protecting Michigan Taxpayers, a group that sought (unsuccessfully) in 2015 to repeal Michigan’s prevailing wage law, which ensures state construction contractors pay union wages to their workers.

But if the family has adopted a second state, it’s Florida. DeVos ownership of the Magic dates back to 1991, and family members have donated to a number of Florida politicians and advocacy organizations. In 2008, when the group Florida4Marriage sponsored an amendment to the state constitution that would limit the definition of marriage to a heterosexual union, Dick DeVos contributed $100,000, making him the second-highest donor to the effort. The measure passed — but it was later struck down by the Supreme Court’s 2015 decision in Obergefell v. Hodges.

Robert Smalls was born a slave on April 5, 1839, in Beaufort, South Carolina. His mother, Lydia Polite, was a slave who worked as a nanny, and the identity of Robert Smalls’s father is not known, but Smalls had distinct mulatto features.3 Owned by John McKee, he worked in his master’s house throughout his youth and, in 1851, moved to the McKees’ Charleston home. Smalls was hired out on the waterfront as a lamplighter, stevedore foreman, sail maker, rigger, and sailor, and became an expert navigator of the South Carolina and Georgia coasts. In 1856, he married Hannah Jones, a slave who worked as a hotel maid in Charleston. The couple had two daughters: Elizabeth and Sarah. A third child, Robert, Jr., died of smallpox as a toddler.4 The Smalls lived separately from their owners, but sent their masters most of their income.5

During the Civil War, the Confederate Army conscripted Robert Smalls into service aboard the Planter, an ammunitions transport ship that had once been a cotton steamer. On May 13, 1862, a black crew captained by Smalls hijacked the well–stocked ship and turned it over to the Union Navy. Smalls became a northern celebrity.6 His escape was symbolic of the Union cause, and the publication of his name and former enslaved status in northern propaganda proved demoralizing for the South.7 Smalls spent the remainder of the war balancing his role as a spokesperson for African Americans with his service in the Union Armed Forces. Piloting both the Planter, which was re–outfitted as a troop transport, and later the ironclad Keokuk, Smalls used his intimate knowledge of the South Carolina Sea Islands to advance the Union military campaign in nearly 17 engagements.8

Smalls’s public career began during the war. He joined free black delegates to the 1864 Republican National Convention, the first of seven total conventions he attended as a delegate.9 While awaiting repairs to the Planter, Smalls was removed from an all–white streetcar in Philadelphia on December 30, 1864. In the following months, his celebrity allowed him to lead one of the first mass boycotts of segregated public transportation. A city law finally permitted integrated streetcars in 1867.10

At the war’s conclusion, Smalls received a commission as brigadier general of the South Carolina militia. He then purchased his former owner’s house in Beaufort, but he was generous to the economically devastated McKees.11 Having received a rudimentary education from private tutors in Philadelphia during the war, Smalls continued his studies after settling in Beaufort.12 He embarked on business ventures, opening a store and a school for black children in 1867. He also published a newspaper, the Beaufort Southern Standard, starting in 1872.13 Smalls’s impressive résumé and his ability to speak the Sea Island Gullah dialect enhanced his local popularity and opened doors in South Carolina politics. He joined other prominent black and white politicians as a delegate to the 1868 South Carolina constitutional convention. Later that year, Smalls won his first elective office: a term in the state house of representatives. From 1870 to 1874, he served in the state senate, chairing the printing committee.

In 1874, redistricting gave Smalls the opportunity to run for the U.S. Congress in a southeast South Carolina district with a majority–black constituency (68 percent of the population). In Smalls’s hometown of Beaufort, African Americans outnumbered whites seven to one.14 In an uneventful campaign, Smalls defeated Independent nominee J. P. M. Epping—a white man who ran on a “reform” platform opposing the Radical Republican state government—with nearly 80 percent of the vote. Smalls received a position on the Agriculture Committee in his freshman term, a key assignment for his farming constituency and thus a boost to his efforts to prepare for the potentially formidable opposition to his re–election.

Despite the Democratic majority, Smalls’s first term was one of his most active and fruitful. For his coastal constituents, he obtained appropriations to improve the Port Royal Harbor that passed with little debate, owing to a letter from the Secretary of War presented as evidence.15 Smalls also sought other internal improvements, including compensation from the federal government for its use of Charleston’s military academy, the Citadel, since 1865.16

Smalls spoke openly in defense of his race and his party. In June 1876, he attempted unsuccessfully to add an antidiscrimination amendment to an army reorganization bill. His amendment, which would have integrated army regiments, required that race would no longer affect soldiers’ placement. The following month, Smalls addressed a bill to redeploy federal troops in the South to patrol the Texas–Mexican border. Smalls argued against transferring federal troops stationed in his home state, warning that private Red Shirt militias—South Carolina’s version of the Ku Klux Klan—would make war on the government and freedmen. Advocates of the troop transfer argued that the corrupt Republican government in South Carolina brought on the violence and that it remained a state issue. Smalls disagreed, noting that the federal presence would help “cut off that rotten part all round South Carolina so as to let the core stand. It is those rotten parts which are troubling us. We are getting along all right ourselves.”17

While touring the state with Republican Governor Daniel Chamberlain during the 1876 campaign, Smalls attended a rally in Edgefield, South Carolina, where Red Shirt leader and former Confederate General Matthew Butler overran the meeting and threatened Smalls’s life. Though the Republican entourage escaped unharmed, a sympathetic observer noted the ease with which Butler and his Red Shirts moved through the town: “Even in Mexico Gen. Butler’s command could only be regarded as a revolutionary army, but in South Carolina they are called ‘reformers.’” Smalls’s opponent, George D. Tillman, who hailed from a prominent Democratic family, exacerbated tensions. The New York Times referred to Tillman as a “Democratic tiger, violent in his treatment of Republicans, incendiary in his language, and advising all sorts of illegal measures to restrain Republicans from voting.” During the campaign, Smalls described Tillman as “the personification of red–shirt Democracy” and the “arch enemy of my race.”18 Despite heading the militia to break up a strike in the middle of the campaign, Smalls escaped the Democratic tsunami that swept South Carolina local elections, barely defeating Tillman with 52 percent (19,954 votes).19 Polling places were spared much of the Red Shirt violence, primarily because Governor Chamberlain requested federal troops to stand guard.20 Tillman later contested the military presence, hoping a Democratic Congress would rule in his favor. Defending himself in the final session of the 44th Congress, Smalls called Election Day in South Carolina “a carnival of bloodshed and violence.”21

Smalls arrived in Washington for the 45th Congress (1877–1879) to receive his position on the Committee on the Militia and face Tillman’s challenge to his election; however, he was unable to get to work. The following July, the Democratic South Carolina state government charged Smalls with accepting a $5,000 bribe while chairing the printing committee in the state senate. Smalls arrived in Columbia on October 6, 1877, to face trial. On November 26, he was convicted and sentenced to a three–year prison term. Republican newspapers cried foul, accusing Democrats of targeting the “hero of the Planter” because of his success as a black Representative.22 After three days in jail, Smalls was released pending his appeal with the state supreme court. He returned to Washington to face Tillman’s contested election challenge before the Democratically controlled Committee on Elections. Though the committee ruled in Tillman’s favor, just before the end of the second session on June 20, 1878, Smalls retained his seat because the whole House never considered the findings. Though his triumph over Tillman was a symbolic victory for House Republicans, Smalls’s preoccupation with his criminal case and the defense of his seat left him little time to legislate during the short third session.

Smalls’s chances in the 1878 election were slim. South Carolina black politicians faced a deadly threat from the white supremacist–controlled government. Sea Island observer Laura Towne noted in her diary: “Political times are simply frightful. Men are shot at, hounded down, trapped and held til certain meetings are over and intimidated in every possible way.”23 The final blow to Smalls’s campaign was his unresolved conviction, which Tillman—who returned as his opponent—used to defeat him. Though Smalls received a majority of the black votes in the district, the small number who braved the fierce intimidation were unable to prevent the Democratic sweep.24 Tillman took 26,409 votes (71 percent) compared to Smalls’s 10,664 votes (29 percent).25

An 1879 resolution to his criminal case allowed Smalls to concentrate on returning to politics. Although the state supreme court rejected his appeal, Democratic Governor William Simpson pardoned him on April 29, 1879—acting on assurances from the U.S. District Attorney that charges would be dropped against South Carolinians accused of violating election laws in 1878.26 Smalls, nevertheless, remained optimistic about Republican politics in South Carolina. “Robert S. is very cheerful, and says that the outrageous bulldozing and cheating in this last election is the best thing that could have happened for the Republican Party,” observed Laura Towne, “for it has been so barefaced and open that it cannot be denied.”27 Smalls still controlled the Beaufort Republican Party, and he remained popular among the town’s substantial black population. By 1880, Smalls resolved to take back his seat from Tillman. However, his allegiance to the Republican Party made it increasingly difficult for Smalls to rally black voters to his side. Issues that wedded black voters to the GOP—primarily fears of returning to slavery—were fading in light of black disenchantment with local Republican corruption scandals. The state party also was in chaos, as the South Carolina Republican convention was unable to nominate a state ticket. Smalls’s attachment to the disorganized and disgraced state party proved to be the strongest point of attack for Democratic opponents. Red Shirt intimidation, which had become routine in recent elections, complicated matters.28

Smalls failed to defeat Tillman in a violent campaign, garnering only 15,287 votes, or 40 percent; however, he contested the election, hoping to capitalize on the slim Republican majority in the 47th Congress (1881–1883). His case came before the Committee on Elections on July 18, 1882. Using Edgefield, South Carolina, as a case study, Smalls won the support of the committee by testifying that his supporters had been frightened away from the polls.29 In an attempt to prevent Smalls from taking the seat, House Democrats sought to avoid a quorum by deserting the House Chamber when his case came to a vote on July 19, 1882. Their plan backfired, however, as the House seated him, 141 to 1 with 144 abstentions.30 Smalls returned to his appointments on the Agriculture and Militia committees. While his victory was yet another blow to southern Democrats, the curtailed term again left him little time to legislate.

By 1882, South Carolina Democrats had gerry–mandered the state so that only one district retained any hope of electing a black candidate. The new district’s lines demonstrated the legislature’s intent; completely ignoring county lines, the district contained one–quarter of the state’s substantial black population (82 percent of the district’s population was black).31 Smalls sought the nomination but was opposed at the Republican convention by longtime black politician Samuel Lee and Smalls’s congressional friend and ally Representative Edmund Mackey. Smalls deferred to Mackey—a sympathetic white man whose wife was mulatto—to maintain unity in the party. However, Mackey died suddenly on January 28, 1884, shortly after defeating Lee—who ran as an Independent candidate—in the general election. Lee had taken a federal patronage position in Alabama, leaving Smalls the best chance at the seat. He won a special election without opposition and took his oath of office on March 18, 1884.32 Smalls resumed his position on the Committee on the Militia and received an appointment to the Committee on Manufactures.

Smalls continued earlier attempts to secure federal debt relief for South Carolinians who lost their property due to nonpayment of wartime taxes, justifying the relief by pointing to the free services and the welcome federal soldiers had received in places like Port Royal; however, the House rejected his proposal.33 Smalls was more successful with a bill regulating the manufacture and sale of liquor in the District of Columbia. He offered an amendment that would guarantee the integration of restaurants and other eating facilities in the nation’s capital. After parliamentary debate about the germaneness of the amendment, it was added to the bill, which passed the House though it died in the Senate Committee on the District of Columbia.34 In the 1884 election, Smalls’s victory over Democrat William Elliott was unexpectedly easy. Though both candidates expected a violent campaign, the election was relatively quiet, with Sea Island blacks coming out to support their favorite son. Smalls was appointed to the Committee on War Claims in the 49th Congress (1885–1887), made up of a safe Democratic majority. Encouraged by his recent victory, black state senators nominated Smalls for an open seat in the U.S. Senate in December 1884. Although he lost to Democratic Governor Wade Hampton, 31 to 3, his nomination was a symbolic protest of white supremacy.35

In his first full term since he was a freshman, Smalls gave one of the more impassioned speeches of his career, asking Congress to approve a $50 per month pension for Maria Hunter, the widow of General David Hunter. Hunter was one of the first white Union commanders to raise African–American regiments in the Civil War and was known for issuing an order to free slaves in Florida, Georgia, and South Carolina. But, Hunter was also controversial for his slash–and–burn strategy during several Shenandoah Valley campaigns, as well as for his inattention to defendants’ rights in the trial of conspirators in President Abraham Lincoln’s assassination. Democrats argued against permitting the pension. Smalls admonished his colleagues: “Can it be that there is a secret or sinister motive either personal or political? … Can it be that this is your revenge for all his patriotic conduct?”36 Though the private bill passed both the House and Senate, President Grover Cleveland vetoed the measure, claiming the Widow Hunter’s case was best handled by the Pensions Bureau. Smalls also steered through the House a bill that allowed for the redemption of school farmlands outside Beaufort that had been owned by the federal government since the Civil War.37 He also submitted a resolution requesting relief funds after a flood in 1886 destroyed crops and homes in his district. The House refused to appropriate funds, despite Smalls’s appeal that the state government would not furnish relief money until late in the year. Smalls also failed in a bid to make Port Royal a coaling station for the U.S. Navy.38

Smalls faced a challenge from within his own party for re–election in 1886. African–American rival Henry Thompson attempted to capitalize on the growing competition within the black community between dark–skinned blacks and mulattos. Thompson’s radical position proved less of a threat for the nomination; however, black voters divided in the general election, with the “darker delegation” voting against Smalls.39 The split in the black vote made Smalls vulnerable to Democratic attack. “Elections,” Smalls lamented to the Washington Post, “are all in the hands of Democrats.”40 His foe, Democrat William Elliott, returned to defeat him with 56 percent of the vote in an election in which black disfranchisement was routine.41 Smalls contested his loss. Despite more than 800 pages of testimony and support from powerful Republican Representatives Henry Cabot Lodge of Massachusetts and Robert M. La Follette of Wisconsin, a House weary of handling the South’s racial problems declined to seat Smalls, with a vote of 142 to 127 on February 13, 1889.42 Accepting the inevitability of his loss, Smalls had already stepped aside to allow a younger politician, Thomas Miller, to run for his seat in 1888.

Smalls remained an active and popular politician, managing to win the chairmanship of the Republican state convention in 1890.43Although he was favored for the post of sheriff in Beaufort County, Smalls made another bid for the U.S. Senate, but he received only one vote from the state legislature.44 He also attempted to return to the House in 1892 but lost a four–way race for the Republican nomination, which Representative George W. Murray secured en route to a general election victory. After his wife Hannah died in 1883, Smalls married Annie Wigg on April 9, 1890. They had one son, William Robert, in 1892, before Annie’s death in 1895.Smalls benefited throughout this period from GOP patronage. In 1889, Republican President Benjamin Harrison appointed him the collector at the port of Beaufort. He held the post until Republicans lost the White House in 1892. Smalls regained the appointment in 1898 from Republican President William McKinley. Over time, his duties as collector became more onerous in the face of racism and segregation in Beaufort. He was forced to step down in 1913 after the White House again transferred to a Democrat. Smalls died of natural causes in his Beaufort home on February 22, 1915.

""Justice has been served,"" said the 95-pound mother of three and grandmother of six, as she sat in her wheelchair, aided in her breathing by an oxygen bottle. ""Now Iím going to sue every fool in the federal government for ignorance, stupidity, and just plain general incompetence. Iím an American, and I wonít be treated like this."" The problem began last month as Gordon was attempting to board an airplane at the R.J. Squirrel Airport in Frostbite Falls, Minnesota.

Here they were letting guys who looked just like terrorists walk through without searching them, and then they pull me aside and tell me theyíre going to search me? I donít think so."" According to one witness, Bud Cort of Cuyahoga Falls, Ohio, one guard, ""who weighed about 300 pounds, looked like he was drunk, and had his shirt out, told this woman she couldnít board the plane unless they searched her. He was really rude. Thatís when the trouble started."" Videotapes showed that Gordon ran the guard down with her motorized wheelchair, then sat on top of the screaming man while spinning her chair in circles. ""Doofus was so fat he couldnít get up,"" said Gordon with a giggle. One guard who attempted to pull Gordonís wheelchair off of the screaming man from behind was hit over the head with an oxygen bottle and knocked unconscious. A third guard, who approached Gordon from the front, was also left dazed on the floor. Witnesses said she was cackling, ""Put your hands on an old lady, will you?"" as she bashed both guards. The tape also showed a fourth guard attempting to grab Gordonís wheelchair. Gordon removed a knitting needle from her purse and stabbed him in his left buttock. ""What a wimp,"" she told reporters. ""He started screaming and grabbing his butt and running like a puppy that someone kicked."" ""It was amazing,"" said another witness, Scott Ryan, also of Cuyahoga Falls, a professor of music at Ohio Express University and author of Yusef Islam: Cat Stevens Declawed. ""The whole crowd just stood there cheering and clapping. I mean, she was whupping butt."" A fifth guard that attempted to grab Gordon had the seat of his pants set on fire with a cigarette lighter than had escaped detection. ""He just went whoosh across the concourse, screaming and slapping at all these flames flying out of his rear,"" said Ryan. A sixth guard did finally manage to get Gordon in a body hug. ""I think that was the wrong thing to do,"" said another witness, who declined to be identified. ""She just grabbed him by his greasy hair with one hand and cracked him across the jaw with her skinny fist. And down and out he went."" After all this, Gordonís chair was still sitting on top of the first guard. The tapes clearly showed her leaning over and yelling, ""Apologize to me, you fat sumbitch, or when Iím done with you youíll just be a greasy spot on the floor!"" As the crowd roared, the guard cried, ""Iím sorry, Iím sorry! Uncle! I wonít do it again!"" Finally, Gordon surrendered without further incident, and was taken to jail and released on her own recognizance. ""We didnít have any choice,"" said an unidentified officer of the court. ""Over 200 people showed up to support her. I think if we had demanded bail, there would have been a riot."" Over 20 lawyers offered to defend her for free.

The American Civil Liberties Union criticized the city’s condition as a violation of free speech rights.

“The First Amendment protects Americans’ right to boycott, and the government cannot condition hurricane relief or any other public benefit on a commitment to refrain from protected political expression,” said ACLU of Texas Legal Director Andre Segura. “Dickinson’s requirement is an egregious violation of the First Amendment, reminiscent of McCarthy-era loyalty oaths requiring Americans to disavow membership in the Communist party and other forms of ‘subversive’ activity.”

The city’s website says that it is accepting applications from individuals and businesses for grants from money donated for hurricane relief. The application says that by signing it, “the Applicant verifies that the Applicant: (1) does not boycott Israel; and (2) will not boycott Israel during the term of this Agreement.”

The city appears to be enforcing a recently passed Texas law that requires all state contractors to certify that they are not participating in boycotts of Israel. While the ACLU does not take a position on boycotts of foreign countries, the organization has long supported the right to participate in political boycotts and has voiced opposition to laws and bills and that infringe on the right to boycott.

The Supreme Court ruled decades ago that political boycotts are protected by the First Amendment, and other decisions have established that the government may not require individuals to sign a certification regarding their political expression in order to obtain employment, contracts, or other benefits.

On October 11, the ACLU filed a federal lawsuit challenging a Kansas law on behalf of a high school math teacher who is being required by the state to sign to certify that she won’t boycott Israel if she wants to take part in a teacher training program.

In July, the ACLU sent a letter to members of Congress opposing a bill that would make it a felony to support certain boycotts of companies doing business in Israel and its settlements in the occupied Palestinian territories.

President Donald Trump’s policies mark “a new era of human rights regression,” the head of Amnesty International announced in Washington, D.C. this morning, where the non-profit group that tracks the state of human rights in the world released its annual report.

Salil Sheety, who has been the group’s Secretary General since 2010, accused Trump of “hateful” politics and being a threat to human rights across the globe.

“President Trump takes actions that violate human rights at home and abroad,” the group reports.

He put Trump in the same group as the barbaric leaders of Egypt, the Philippines, Venezuela, Russia and China who Sheety said, “are callously undermining the rights of millions.”

“Donald Trump’s politics may have marked a new era of human rights regression but they are not unique,” said Shetty. “The specters of hatred and fear now loom large in world affairs,” he continued, “and we have few governments standing up for human rights in these disturbing times.”

Add your name to millions demanding Congress take action on the President’s crimes. IMPEACH TRUMP & PENCE!

Along with Trump’s treatment of women’s rights, LGBTQ rights and his “politics that were discriminatory or otherwise contradicted international human rights principles,” Shetty singled out Trump’s travel bans aimed at Muslim-majority countries as a “transparently hateful move.”

Shetty added that the bans, some which have survived court challenges, “set the scene for a year in which leaders took the politics of hate to its most dangerous conclusion.”

The report also cites Trump’s views on immigration and immigrants as examples of these hateful new policies. Those include his plan to build a wall along the US-Mexico border, increased detention of asylum seekers and their families, increased immigration and customs enforcement, penalties against “sanctuary cities” and “prioritized deportation of migrants.”

The report also sheds light on human rights abuses such as the termination of the Central American Minors program last August, which had allowed those under 21 to flee violence in Central America if their parents already had achieved legal status in the U.S.

It notes that more than 17,000 unaccompanied children and 26,000 people who were caught illegally enting the U.S. at the Mexican border between January and August “were detained for months, many without proper access to medical care and legal counsel.”

The report notes that since September the Trump administration has worked to end the Deferred Action for Childhood Arrivals (DACA) program, placing 800,000 individuals brought to the U.S. as children at risk of being deported.

Trump then worked to stop the passage of the Dream Act to allow those who had DACA status to meet requirements to maintain their eligibility and get full legal status.

The report also cites Trump’s efforts against women’s rights which it reports were ‘broad and multi-faceted.”

“President Trump’s administration,” continues the report, “overturned politics that required universities to investigate sexual violence as gender discrimination and suspended equal pay initiatives that had helped women identify whether they were being paid less than male colleagues.”

Attacks on women’s reproductive rights were “particularly virulent,” states the report.

That includes attacks on funding for Planned Parenthood, a government issued rules exempting employers from promotion health insurance coverage for contraception, and the introduction of the “global gag rule” which prohibits financial assistance to “any hospital or organization that provides information about safe, legal abortions.”

The rights of gay people were also reduced, marginalized or eliminated in many cases under Trump. The report, in particular, cites the marginalization of transgender people, including the elimination of guidelines that protected them in school, gave them access to public facilities and Trump’s effort to ban them from the military.

The group also raises a red flag about Trump’s treatment of both domestic and foreign nationals accused of terrorism crimes, charging that the president “flouted the presumption of innocence in a series of posts on Twitter in which he called for the death penalty.”

Trump also ended “impunity for the systematic human rights violations” of detainees at the prison in Guantanamo and elsewhere, and opened the door to a renewal of torture methods that had been banned under President Obama and the renewal of secret detention programs by the CIA.

The report also points out that programs to stop mistreatment of minorities in the U.S. were rolled back, as the number of killings by law enforcement rose.

“African Americans – who comprised 13 percent of the population – represented nearly 23 percent of victims in 2017,” states the report.

The mistreatment of the mentally ill, the use of non-lethal weapons by police that turns out to actually be very lethal and the rise in gun violence and mass murders are all detailed in the new report, while funding for government studies of how to deal with gun violence was lowed or killed off.

The use of the death penalty also rose in the U.S. under Trump, with more states executing prisoners than had happened in years.

“During the year,” notes the report, “four inmates were exonerated of the crimes for which they were originally sentenced to death in the states of Delaware, Florida, Arkansas, and Louisiana, bringing to 160 the number of such cases since 1973,”

The report criticizes what it termed the “feeble response” by world leaders like Trump to human rights issues, and what it called “the willingness to tout ‘fake news’ in order to manipulate public opinion.”

This was also the year that Trump changed America’s foreign policy to eliminate human rights as a factor in relationships with other countries.

In fact, we saw Trump embrace, meet with and praise many dictators and authoritarians who abused the democratic system to stay in power while damaging relationships with longtime allies who are true democracies and do work to provide human rights to all.

Through changes in trade politics, refusal to keep commitments to address the global climate crisis and in other ways, Trump embraced big business at the expense of individual citizens.

This 400-page report from Amnesty International details much of this horror story, which unfortunately continues to grow worse by the day, week, month and year under Trump.

SCHOLASTIC APTITUDE TEST (SAT)



INTRODUCTION The Scholastic Aptitude Test (SAT) is dreaded by high school juniors and seniors because a single SAT urday morning can ruin the rest of their lives! This article describes my system for getting extraordinary raw scores on this challenging test. Rather than fight the test, I use the SAT's difficulty to my advantage, leveraging down to a new, elite level of distinction: Answering all questions incorrectly ! On 2003 April 5th, a Saturday, at the age of 33, I threw away my dignity, mocked my Ivy League education, disgraced my Master's degree, and proved, in just over three hours, that humans can do things ""The System"" didn't anticipate. Things didn't turn out exactly as planned, but it was a crazy experience!

THE SCHOLASTIC APTITUDE TEST (SAT) The Scholastic Aptitude Test (SAT) is a test of mathematical and verbal intelligence. This test was created by the College Entrance Examination Board (CEEB), and was administered for the first time in June 1926 to 8,040 people. In the 2000-2001 test year, more than 2.1 million people took the ""SAT I: Reasoning Test"" as part of the admission process for more than 1,000 institutions of higher education, 80 percent of the national (U.S.) total. All references to ""SAT"" in this article refer to the ""SAT I: Reasoning Test"". What does the SAT stand for? (From College Board literature) ""Originally, SAT was an acronym for the Scholastic Aptitude Test. In 1993, the test was renamed the SAT I: Reasoning Test. At the same time, the former Achievement Tests were renamed the SAT II: Subject Tests. SAT has become a simple way of referring to the SAT I: Reasoning Test.""

The College Board has a page describing the fascinating history of the SAT: http://www.collegeboard.com/about/newsat/history.html The SAT is given seven times a year at thousands of testing centers throughout the world. Unless there are special circumstances, the test is given on a Saturday, starting at approximately 9:00 A.M. in each time zone. Cheating on the SAT! In the United States there is a three-hour time zone difference between the East Coast and the West Coast. At one time this created a SAT cheating opportunity: Professional test-takers on the East Coast would steal or memorize test materials, and relay this information to student test-takers on the West Coast. One business apparently flew students to the West Coast to take advantage of this possibility. These days, with Infra-Red ports on calculators and wristwatches, hands-free earpieces and digital video on mobile phones, cheap wireless cameras that can be planted anywhere in a room or on a person, I'm sure there must be someone out there who had a whole support team helping him through the test! Wouldn't it be hilarious to have an Internet chat room or instant messaging group helping one through the SAT! The transcript would be damaging evidence, though. Undoubtedly other people have simply exited the test room with the test booklet and answer sheet, worked on the test with a group of smart friends and a dictionary, and returned discreetly, perhaps with some sort of distraction. It would be ironic for cheaters to get admitted to Harvard and one day learn the school motto: ""Veritas"" (Truth).

The testing part of the SAT lasts a total of exactly three hours. There are seven timed sections: (1) 30-minute Verbal (2) 30-minute Verbal (3) 30-minute Math (4) 30-minute Math (5) 30-minute Equating Section (Verbal or Math) (6) 15-minute Verbal (7) 15-minute Math

The 30-minute sections can appear in any order. Test proctors need to indicate when to start and stop for all sections, so it is necessary for all test-takers in a testing room to encounter each of the two 15-minute sections at the same time. For my test group, both 15-minute sections occurred in the final 30 minutes of the three-hour testing period. The following table describes various properties of the sections: Verbal Sections: ================ * 75 minutes total (30 min + 30 min + 15 min) * 78 questions total: 40 Critical Reading (5-choice) 19 Analogies (5-choice) 19 Sentence Completion (5-choice) Math Sections: ============== * 75 minutes total (30 min + 30 min + 15 min) * 60 questions total: 35 Standard (5-choice) 15 Quantitative Comparisons (4-choice) 10 Student-produced responses (NO-choice) Or, by question type: 44 Arithmetic and Algebraic Reasoning 14 Geometric Reasoning Equating Section: ================= * 30 minutes total * Used to test new questions, and compare editions of the exam * Does NOT count toward final score * Is NOT explicitly identified to test-takers, and looks exactly like an ordinary Verbal or Math section; thus, taken with the same seriousness as ""real"" sections







CALCULATING THE TEST SCORE Two Divisions: Math and Verbal The SAT has two divisions: Math and Verbal. A score report has performance statistics for the math division, and performance statistics for the verbal division. Three Statistics for each Division Performance on each division of the SAT is described by three statistics: (1) Raw Score; (2) Scaled Score; (3) Relative Percentage;

Almost all statements regarding ""SAT Score"" are implicitly referring to the Scaled Score. (1) Raw Score Raw Score is an integer (whole number) that is calculated for each division of the test. Applying the following rules to the set of answers for a division of a test will yield a number (potentially non-integer) that will be the basis of the Raw Score: (a) Ignore each blank answer (often called an ""omitted question""); (b) Ignore each incorrect answer for math questions requiring ""student-produced"" (non-multiple-choice) responses; (c) Add one point for each correct answer; (d) Subtract 1/4-point for each incorrect answer for multiple-choice questions having 5 choices; (e) Subtract 1/3-point for each incorrect answer for multiple-choice questions having 4 choices;

The Raw Score is the number computed directly above rounded to the ""nearest integer"". Mathematical Detour: All Possible Fractional Values The calculation of the integer Raw Score involves rounding a potentially non-integer value to the ""nearest integer"". It so happens there are twelve (12) cases of the fractional part: FRACTIONAL PART EXAMPLE ROUNDING =================== =============== ============ 0/12 = 0.0 (0-(0/4)-(0/3)) None 1/12 = 0.083333... (1-(1/4)-(2/3)) Down 2/12 = 0.166666... (1-(2/4)-(1/3)) Down 3/12 = 0.25 (1-(3/4)-(0/3)) Down 4/12 = 0.333333... (1-(0/4)-(2/3)) Down 5/12 = 0.416666... (1-(1/4)-(1/3)) Down 6/12 = 0.5 (1-(2/4)-(0/3)) Up <-- Look! 7/12 = 0.583333... (2-(3/4)-(2/3)) Up 8/12 = 0.666666... (1-(0/4)-(1/3)) Up 9/12 = 0.75 (1-(1/4)-(0/3)) Up 10/12 = 0.833333... (2-(2/4)-(2/3)) Up 11/12 = 0.916666... (2-(3/4)-(1/3)) Up If J is an integer, (J + 0.5) is equidistant from two integers: J and (J+1). Obviously the CEEB needs to specify what to do in this special case -- and it must be deterministic (so random rounding and alternate rounding cannot be used). One candidate convention, called ""Banker's Rounding"", rounds to the nearest EVEN number (e.g., 0.5 --> 0; 1.5 --> 2; -11.5 --> -12). Another convention is to round to the nearest integer, and round UPWARD for the ambiguous case of (J + 0.5). (e.g., 0.5 --> 1; 1.5 --> 2; -11.5 --> -11) This is what the ""FIX"" function does for 0.5 on scientific calculators ({2nd,FIX,0,0.5,=} --> 1). This is the convention used by the CEEB, as described by this quote: ""If the resulting [raw] score is a fraction, it is rounded to the nearest whole number -- 1/2 or more is rounded up; less than 1/2 is rounded down."" Keep in mind that rounding up for 1/2 is not the definition of ""nearest whole number""; this quote is merely describing the convention used by the CEEB.

Verbal Division Raw Score Range The Verbal Division has three question categories: ======================================================================= Question Type Questions Min Raw Score Max Raw Score ======================================================================= Critical Reading : 40 : -40/4 = -10 --> -10 : +40 Analogies : 19 : -19/4 = -4.75 --> -5 : +19 Sentence Completion : 19 : -19/4 = -4.75 --> -5 : +19 ======================================================================= (NOTE: All questions are five-choice types.) These three raw scores are reported on the printed score report. Note that (-10-5-5) = -20, whereas (-78/4) = -19.5 --> -19. Which method is used to compute the raw score for the verbal division? Who knows! But it could make a significant difference in scaled score. Math Division Raw Score Range The Math Division has two question types: ======================================================================= Question Type Questions Min Raw Score Max Raw Score ======================================================================= Arithmetic and Algebraic Reasoning : 44 : -10 : +44 Geometric Reasoning : 14 : < -1 : +14 ======================================================================= These two raw scores are reported on the printed score report. I am not sure how the 35 five-choice, 15 four-choice, and 10 student-response questions are distributed between these two categories, so I cannot show the calculations. Again, I am not sure if these two raw score values are added to yield an overall division raw score, or if all questions for the entire math division are considered together as in (0-35*(1/4)-15*(1/3)-10*0) = -13.75 --> -14 for computing the scaled score. (2) Scaled Score The Scaled Score is intended to be a measurement of ability on an absolute scale. In principle, the Scaled Score enables the objective comparison of test-taker abilities throughout the history and future of the SAT, regardless of variations in the difficulty of each edition of the test. A Raw Score is converted to a Scaled Score through a statistical process called ""equating"". Equating may involve correlating performances between different questions, and to the same questions or similar questions on past editions of the SAT. If the equating process works, and Scaled Scores are an absolute measure of ability, then Scaled Scores for a particular edition of the SAT do not depend on the relative performances of test-takers for that edition. The Scaled Score is a multiple of 10 in the range 200 to 800. FIGURE: An example conversion of Raw Score to Scaled Score (based on example data published by the College Board). According to these example curves, one actually needs to get at least seven questions wrong (approximately) in each division to have a chance at the lowest possible scaled scores. Is it true that you get a 200 on the SAT just for signing your name? (From College Board literature) ""Theoretically speaking, if you just sign your name and don't complete the answer sheet, you would get a score of 200. That's because we don't report scores that are lower than 200. In reality, if we received an answer sheet that wasn't filled out, it would be considered an automatic request to cancel scores and no scores would be reported.""

I believe that the first sentence in the quote above is not correct, because it is possible for the conversion curves to yield scaled scores higher than 200 on each division for raw scores of zero (as would result from leaving all answer bubbles blank). Although I think the quote is ambiguous, I take it to mean that leaving all answer bubbles blank on the entire answer sheet (not simply all math or all verbal answers) would result in scores not being reported. (3) Relative Percentage The Relative Percentage is an integer between 1 and 99 that indicates, for each test-taker, the percentage of test-takers who earned a lower score. The percentages are based on: ""the most recent scores earned by current-year college-bound seniors who took the test at any time during high school."" Relative Percentages are given for the nation and state. Relative Percentage (Number Of Test-Takers with a Lower Score) Fraction = ------------------------------------------ (Total Number of Test-Takers) Relative Percentage = Max( 1, Min( 99, Round(100*Fraction) )) Lowest Percentile People who get the lowest possible scaled score should get a relative percentage of ""0"", since it is impossible for any other student to have a ""lower score"". But ""1"" is the lower limit on the CEEB's relative percentage value. Highest Percentile People who get the highest possible score could, in principle, have a relative percentage anywhere in the range 0 (nobody did worse), to 99.999... (almost everyone did worse). It cannot reach exactly 100.0 percent, given the definition, but rounding could round up to 100. However, the CEEB limits are 1 percent to 99 percent.

Math Score + Verbal Score = Combined Score Adding the Scaled Score for the math division to the Scaled Score for the verbal division yields a combined score. Because each of the two Scaled Scores is a multiple of 10 in the range 200 to 800, the combined score is a multiple of 10 in the range 400 to 1600. If a person fills out an SAT answer sheet with all required personal and site- specific information, but doesn't answer a single question (i.e., ""omits"" all questions), the person receives a combined score that can be as low as 400, but is likely to be significantly higher (e.g., 470) based on the raw score to scaled score conversion curves for that test edition. It seems inevitable that every person who takes the SAT will contemplate what it must take to ""get a sixteen-hundred"" (1600). For some, it might be the only chance to get admitted to an elite school. For most, it's an urban legend. In 2002, the average scores on the SAT were 504 verbal and 516 math, a cumulative score of 1020. FIGURE: The World Almanac 2003; p.240; Table: SAT Mean Verbal and Math Scores of College-Bound Seniors, 1975-2002 Some universities specify an ""average SAT combined score"" in their admission application materials. It may not be legal for public colleges and universities to establish minimum SAT combined score requirements, but private institutions, like corporations, can set whatever standards they wish. Score ""Recentering"": An Attempt to Establish

Standard Scores Since the SAT was first administered in 1926, there have been over 20 different sets of scales used to convert raw scores in to scaled scores, all in an effort to better describe the abilities of people who take the test. The most dramatic change in score calculation for the SAT in recent decades is described by the following quote from the College Board: ""In April 1995, the College Board recentered the score scales for all tests in the SAT Program to reflect the contemporary test-taking population. Recentering reestablished the average score for a study group of 1990 seniors at about 500 -- the midpoint of the 200-to-800 scale -- allowing students, schools, and colleges to more easily interpret their scores in relation to those of a similar group of college-bound seniors."" One effect of recentering is that scores are apparently ""inflated"" relative to scores before 1995. For example, what would have been a 1490 cumulative (V+M) score before 1995 is now called a 1600, the maximum possible score. Put another way, a score of 1600 today could correspond to a score as low as 1490 for scales prior to 1995. All scores, down to the lowest, are inflated relative to historical counterparts. The following page has a table that shows the effect of recentering on cumulative (V+M) scores: http://www.collegeboard.com/sat/cbsenior/equiv/rt027027.html The following is a fascinating research paper published by the College Board on the theory and motivation for the recentering process: sat_recentering.pdf [380 KB] If you read the research paper mentioned above, one gets a sense of the difficulties faced by the College Board in establishing a standard. One can find scandal in the paper if one is looking for it, and it is easy to see how this complicated problem and associated solution could be regarded as more of an art than a science. High Intelligence Quotient (IQ) Organizations Many high-intelligence organizations believe that there is enough correlation between pre-1995 SAT scores and IQ to use those scores alone as a qualification standard for membership. For example, an SAT combined score of 1250 (1974-1994 SAT editions) correlates with a Stanford-Binet IQ of 132, the top 2% of humanity, and thus qualifies a person for Mensa. In 1994, the SAT exam was greatly modified: antonym questions were eliminated, the verbal section contained a greater emphasis on reading, non-multiple-choice questions were added to the math division, and it became permissible to use electronic caculators for the math sections. In 1995, CEEB started computing and reporting SAT scores according to the ""recentering"" scale, as described in the previous section. Because of score inflation, and total lack of ability to differentiate performance beyond a moderately high level, SAT scores could no longer be correlated to IQ with sufficient range or precision to serve as a basis for admission to high-intelligence organizations.

Almost no high-intelligence organization accepts any post-1994 SAT combined score as a basis for admission. However, the Graduate Record Exam (GRE) general test is currently accepted by many high- intelligence organizations for admission. Tests for the general population are designed to magnify differences centered around average intelligence, so only a small fraction of the questions can be allocated to differentiate between high levels of intelligence. Thus, specialized IQ tests are required to accurately assess high intelligence. The following are links to Mensa sites: American Mensa : http://www.us.mensa.org Mensa International : http://www.mensa.org According to Mensa literature, ""Mensa meetings are anything but dull!"" Perhaps you will meet Marilyn Vos Savant, who is listed in the Guinness Hall of Fame for the world's highest recorded IQ (228). For information about organizations with truly staggering IQ requirements, follow these links: http://members.shaw.ca/delajara/criteria.html http://www.eskimo.com/~miyaguch/#societies Mensa is at the LOW end of the spectrum. The Giga Society only accepts people in the 99.9999999 percentile of human intelligence ( 1 / Billion, thus ""Giga""), which corresponds to an IQ of 196. Using the CIA's ""The World Factbook 2002"", and extrapolating to today's date (2003/4/28), the world population is roughly 6,297,263,466. For a Binomial probability distribution, the mean is N*p, and the variance is N*p*(1-p). Thus, one would expect the Giga Society to have 6.3 members, give or take 6 members. It now has at least 5 members. I look at various IQ tests from time to time, and I am usually unimpressed with the ""intelligence"" being tested. Here are sample verbal questions from one ""unofficial"" IQ test: [1] 9 : 361 :: Tic-Tac-Toe : ____ [2] Roosevelt : New :: Truman : ____ [3] 5,280 : Mile :: 43,560 : ____ [4] 753 : 776 :: Rome : ____ [5] Horse and Donkey : Mule :: Question mark and Exclamation point : ____ Just for fun I decided to measure Google's ""IQ""! Acting as Google's proxy for the IQ test, I found the following plausible answers: [1] ""Go"" : A Go board has 19 x 19 = 361 places to move, and Tic-Tac-Toe has 9 places to move; [2] ""Fair"" : Truman had a ""FAIR Deal"", and Roosevelt had a ""NEW Deal""; [3] ""Acre"" : There are 43,560 square feet in an acre, and there are 5,280 feet in a mile; [4] ""Olympics"" : The Olympic games were founded in 776 BC, and Rome was founded in 753 BC. [5] ""Interrobang"" : An ""interrobang"" is a character that is a composite of the question mark and exclamation mark. How silly is that?! A mule is a ""composite"" of a horse and a donkey. I seriously considered completing an IQ test using only information yielded via Google searching (i.e., ignoring my own knowledge), and paying for it to be scored, and then publicize Google's ""IQ"". Of course, any online article describing questions missed by Google-brain will eventually be assimilated by Google. It's interesting to think of static information as a given. Suppose all of humanity were wired directly in to Google. Suddenly, the novelty of trivia and languages vanishes. Just as ""human calculators"" were made obsolete by mechanical calculators, future advances in technology may make other traditionally valued forms of intelligence obsolete. I happen to believe that the future belongs to video games and infotainment. If there weren't so many cheaters and paid ""farmers"" around, I'd say that one's ""level"" in EverQuest (EQ) could be correlated to this new prioritized variety of ""intelligence"". ... Ha! Had you going there! Or am I just creating plausible deniability for a controversial idea? Huh[insert interrobang here]









REGISTERING FOR THE TEST The SAT is given seven times each year. Although you must register (enroll) with the College Board before a specific deadline to be assured the opportunity to take the SAT on a specific date, there is a chance that you will be able to simply show up at a designated test center on the morning of a test and sign up to take the SAT. There is no guarantee that the site will have spare test booklets and answer sheets, so it's a bit of a gamble. Here are several fees that may interest a person planning to take the SAT I: (1) ""SAT I: Reasoning Test"" : $26 ============================== This is payment for the test. Included in this price is the option to have up to four official score reports mailed to college and university admission programs of one's choice. (There is a charge for each additional score report if more than four are requested. Score reports are only official if mailed directly from the College Board.) (2) ""Student Answer Service"" : $ 6 ============================== This is an optional report that shows you an enumerated list of questions, and whether your response was: correct (+), wrong (-), or omitted (O). Maybe this product exists to address possible paranoia about the Raw Score calculation. (3) Detailed Answer Report : $15 ============================== This product is only offered on certain test dates. This report shows the actual questions on the exam, your responses, the correct responses, and an analysis of your apparent strengths and weaknesses, which, in principle, could be used as a basis for deciding how to prepare for taking the test again.

There are many other interesting products, like ""Rush Reporting"" to get your official SAT scores mailed to colleges and universities sooner, ""Additional Score Reports"" when you are applying to more than four institutions, and a fee for a personal online peek at your scores a full ten days before they are put in the mail, etc. Perhaps the College Board will eventually offer more exotic products: (1) T-Shirts, bumper stickers, vanity plates, baseball caps, coffee mugs, greeting cards, playing cards, paper weights, bobble heads, flags, and web sites, all depicting your score report in a handsome way that is sure to grab attention. (2) A score report tattooed on your ass or forehead, or burned in to your retina with a laser for a lifelong visual affirmation of your intelligence. (3) Score reports containing ""printing errors"". The College Board won't come right out and say what the nature of those errors might be, but will hint that such errors are often favorable, in logarithmic relation to your ""donation level"". (5) Professional photographers will capture one's test-taking experience on four hours of digital video, followed by a helicopter ride to the official ""SAT Award Ceremony"" at the College Board compound on a remote tropical island paradise. After receiving a trophy, and shaking hands with some of the educational researchers who devised the latest batch of SAT questions, you will tour their secret underground facility, witness giant machines grading thousands of exams per second, and, after a few drinks, you become an honorary employee of the College Board, and have the authority to grade some poor soul's SAT by hand! Of course this situation must be ""contained"", which means, umm, total erasure of all those involved, nuclear vaporization of all test centers, and installing Xa'Kel-6 as provisional leader of the Earth people.

Online registration for any College Board exam starts at their web site: http://www.collegeboard.com After navigating a few menus, I started the registration process for the ""SAT I: Reasoning Test"". FIGURE: Starting the SAT registration process. The first phase is ""signing up"" with the College Board, which just involves sharing basic information about oneself. When one has finished with this process, the following confirmation appears: FIGURE: ""Sign Up"" Confirmation As you can see, I have selected the nickname ""Tensai"", which in Japanese translates to both ""Genius"" and ""Natural Disaster"". This is perfect for my test-taking persona. I recently noticed that ""Tensai"" is an anagram of ""SAT ein(s)"", or ""SAT 1"" in German. Coincidence? Or destiny! In the following you can see that I elected to order the ""Student Answer Service"": FIGURE: Ordering the ""Student Answer Service"". The registration process includes many questions about one's high school career, and it's hard to resist thinking that the College Board secretly uses this information as part of their ""equating"" process, but that's how my paranoid, cynical mind works. As you can see, I decided that I wanted to hear from colleges, universities, and government scholarship programs that are interested in ""students like [me]"". My persona has a terrible cumulative average and class rank: FIGURE: Some questions about my ""high school career"". FIGURE: That's what they call ""making the grade!"" True Story: I received an award for ""perfect attendance"" when I was in high school!

The questionnaire seems to go on forever. Eventually I encountered questions about my club participation, awards, etc, but the highlight was the list of sports: FIGURE: I like sports that involve weapons and fighting.

I heard that dropping out of Harvard in the first year is the path to total domination of the computer industry. It is time I started dominating instead of being oppressionated!

Nothing says ""success"" more than getting admitted to your alma mater a second time. Don't do this if you have defaulted on all of your school loans or if you are on the run from the authorities. I printed the admission ticket. It is required on test day.







TEST PREPARATION The beauty of my special test-taking system is that it requires significantly less preparation than other test-taking systems. Perhaps the best way to learn how to fail is to learn how to succeed. The College Board offers a handy manual to the SAT I: www_college_board_taking_sat.pdf [538 KB] However, I have discovered that failure favors the unprepared mind, and so I did not read this manual before taking the test.







TEST DAY Make sure you have the following items with you before you go to the test center: (1) SAT Admission Ticket (Photocopy or Printout okay) (2) Approved Photo ID (e.g., Driver's License or High School ID) (3) #2 Pencils (Mechanical or wood pencils) (4) Sharpener (5) Approved Calculator

FIGURE: SAT Admission Ticket FIGURE: The #2 Pencil (unvarnished wood) I used to take the test. FIGURE: Pencil sharpener and approved calculator that I used for the test. (Pencil shavings are from the test. Bidding starts at $600.) A person taking the test requires a ""#2 pencil"" (""#2"" refers to the hardness of the graphite). A mechanical pencil, or a regular pencil and a sharpener, can be used. An eraser is handy not only for modifications, but also for removing the inevitable graphite smudges that appear when part of the answer sheet is in contact with the table. I haven't used pencils in almost a decade, and I didn't have pencils or a sharpener in my apartment, so I bought pencils and a sharpener at a local 24-hour Rite-Aid store two hours before the test. The SAT materials include a single test booklet with all questions and an answer sheet with a single fold to form a ""four page"" form. FIGURE: The four panels of an answer sheet. The answer sheet is dominated by little ""bubbles"" that can be filled in using a pencil, and later optically scanned by computers. For many years, the building selected to serve as the UCI ""test center"" has been Rowland Hall, formerly known as Physical Sciences I (PS1). FIGURE: UCI, Rowland Hall, site of SAT Exam at the UCI ""test center"". FIGURE: UCI, Rowland Hall, Room 104 : Test room FIGURE: UCI, Rowland Hall, Room 104 : View from my assigned seat Fun Fact: Most SAT proctors are teachers from the high schools where the test is administered. Fun Conspiracy Theory: Teachers at prestigious prep schools will get their students in to Harvard, even if it means testing administration (cough) irregularities!

The following is a rough record of how the SAT was administered at the UCI test center on April 5th, 2003. This is just from my memory, so it isn't very precise. 8:00 A.M. . . . 8:15 A.M. Arrive at the test center and claim a slip of colored paper that will admit you to the testing room. 8:15 A.M. . . . ~9:00 A.M. ( 1) Walk to the testing room ( 2) Get in line to sign the attendance sheet ( 3) Sign in, and go to an assigned seat ( 4) Administrators handle any same-day registrations ( 5) Final person count ( 6) Administrators carefully read the exact words from a booklet, instructing test takers in advance of receiving any testing materials ( 7) Put all belongings under desks and chairs ( 8) Sign the little colored slip of paper that admitted you to the testing room ( 9) Administrators count test booklets and answer sheets several times (10) Administrators warn test-takers to not open the test book or write anything on the answer form until they are instructed to do so. Then they describe the duration of the test, time announcement policy, and breaks. (11) Test booklets and answer sheets are handed out simultaneously. (12) The administrators guide everyone through the process of filling out personal information on the answer form, such as name, Social Security Number, birth date, etc, and other data such as the test center name and ID number, and unique code numbers that appear on the test booklet. ~31 minutes (1) Section #1 : Explanation (2) Section #1 : Begin work (3) Section #1 : Work (30 minutes) (4) Section #1 : Stop work ~31 minutes (1) Section #2 : Explanation (2) Section #2 : Begin work (3) Section #2 : Work (30 minutes) (4) Section #2 : Stop work ~7 minutes (1) Close test booklet and answer form.

(2) Write out a designated paragraph in script handwriting that basically says that you agree to test policies (3) Fill in another code number from the test booklet (4) Wait for your testing materials (question booklet and answer form) to be collected (5) Administrators give instructions for test takers to ""cancel"" their scores, either by signing something before they leave, or going online within a couple of days. (6) When test materials have been collected from everyone, the test booklets and answer sheets are counted repeatedly. (7) If everything adds up correctly, miscellaneous questions from test takers are answered. (8) Everyone is dismissed at once. (9) The Administrators erase the blackboard, pack up all documents, turn off the room lights, and leave the room. ~12:00 PM (noon) Have lunch and try to forget the whole thing!







MY TEST-TAKING EXPERIENCE This section describes some of my impressions of this test-taking experience. The Math Sections were Easy for Me I thought I solved all math problems correctly on paper (pages of test booklet). (It turns out I may have made a mistake on one problem. See conclusion.) After solving each math problem, and noting that the solution corresponded to an existing option, I selected the MOST ABSURD alternative answer. Since this test date did not offer a detailed question and answer reporting option, I cannot share this extra humorous touch with the public. For the ""student-produced"" responses, which cannot subtract points from the raw score, I simply wrote a sequence of numbers that encodes my name: C O L I N P F --> 3, 15, 12, 9, 14, 16, 6; I think this will show up in my ""Student Answer Service"" report. (2003 May 26th: I received my ""Student Answer Service"" report, and I learned that one of my ""random"" answers turned out to be a correct answer! Note to self: I'm an idiot!) Sometimes, for particularly tricky math problems, I felt a little pang of regret that my mission prevented me from proving that I actually knew the correct answers. The Calculator was Handy For several math problems the calculator came in handy. Sometimes it seemed easier to simply add up a bunch of numbers rather than work out a formula that would yield the answer. The Verbal Sections were Difficult for Me The verbal division of the SAT is dominated by ""Critical Reading"" subsections. Each Critical Reading subsection has several sets of Critical Reading questions. Each set of questions begins with a passage having several paragraphs, followed by questions that refer to the passage. Many questions refer to specific lines of the passage using line numbers. The passages are extracted from existing literary sources, such as articles, novels, scientific papers, short stories, and journals. The passages are not manufactured by the College Board researchers. The topics of the passages are very diverse; essentially random. The College Board points out that the opinions expressed in the passages do not reflect the opinions of the College Board. In principle, presenting a test-taker with various types of written material (scientific, fictional, historical, journalistic, etc) seems like an ideal way to gauge how the test-taker might perform in an environment that involves exposure to the same degree of literary diversity. My gripe with the ""Critical Reading"" questions is with the questions themselves. It is my opinion that the questions, in general, involve subjective factors and implicit assumptions that often make them impossible to answer in a rational manner. It is possible that people with the same subjective influences and implicit assumptions do well in college, because college faculty belong to the same dominant species of irrationality. So, the value of the verbal section of the SAT as a predictor of performance in college might be quite high. However, the side-effect of optimizing a test to better predict success in college is that truly objective minds might be punished for not keeping up with the latest delusions. The following questions are typical of the types of questions found in the Critical Reading subsections: ""Which of the following would be the most appropriate title for this passage?"" ""The author of this passage would likely agree with which of the following statements:"" ""Which of the following best describes the author's opinion about XXXX ?"" ""According to the passage, the American Indian notion of time involves which of the following concepts:"" ""The author of Passsage #1 would most likely have which of the following opinions regarding statements made by the author of Passage #2:""

While trying to figure out the answers to Critical Reading questions I am convinced that I fully understand the passages, the questions, and the meanings of all multiple-choice options, and yet there are times when there doesn't seem to be a basis for selecting an answer. Maybe I should take the SAT on a date when the detailed ""Question and Answer"" service is offered. Then I could debate concrete examples with people and decide if there really is a kind of verbal intelligence that helps people answer these questions in a consistent and rational manner. Or maybe I will comprehend the principles of this variety of intelligence and decide that I am better off without it! Thankfully, my test-taking strategy involves choosing the wrong answers, which made some of the trickier verbal questions much easier. Sometimes the best answer was hard to identify, but the absurd answers were very easy to spot. In 2005, multiple-choice questions will require students to identify sentence errors, improve sentences, and improve paragraphs. I'm glad my future doesn't depend on someone's ""improvement"" aesthetic! A 25-minute written essay section will also be added to the SAT, which means that the arbitrary forces of subjectivity on the overall verbal score may be taken to an entirely new level. It is very difficult for me to imagine grading criteria for these essays that would transcend personal opinions about writing style. I've heard of cases in which a single essay earned radically different grades from different college professors -- and sometimes radically different grades from the SAME college professor, who unwittingly grades the same essay twice at different times. Three Hours of Test-Taking is Exhausting The SAT requires sitting at a desk for exactly three hours of actual problem solving, filling in up to approximately 165 bubbles with a #2 pencil. When one adds in the time spent writing down personal information, filling in other bubbles, and listening to instructions, the whole experience lasts about 3.5 hours. Something about the need to not screw up over a prolonged period like this is really fatiguing. I was grateful for my inspiration to bring a cold bottle of Pepsi and a bottle of orange juice. Still, near the end of the exam I wished I had a third drink, and maybe a chocolate chip cookie! [Make mental note, in case there's a ""next time""! :-O] To answer all math questions, you have an average of 75.0 seconds per question to read, compute, and completely fill in the answer bubble. For the verbal sections the pace is a little bit faster, at 57.7 seconds per question. This seems generous, but to me it felt like I was racing the clock for all sections of the test, finishing each section with very little time to spare. So, the pace of the test kept me feeling a little bit harassed. As the test wore on, I became increasingly distracted by the thought of how tedious it was to repeatedly locate bubbles and fill them in. I almost laughed out loud at various times during the test I definitely passed through some kind of mental barrier as a result of this experience. Up to this point, my relationship to exams was based on the strong desire to get every question correct. My educational career lasted 20 years. Assuming an average of 8 distinct courses each year, and two major exams per course, that's 320 exams! When you add in the CTBS, NMSQT, PSAT, SAT (I), AT (SAT II), AP, GRE, GRE subject test, departmental qualifier, etc, that's at least ten more major exams. I have been conditioned to try very hard to determine correct answers. So, in this latest experience, when I worked very hard to determine the correct answer for each question, and then proceeded to pick the exact WRONG answer (in fact, the most RIDICULOUS answer), I had a very strong emotional reaction. For a while I worried that this new peculiar feeling of freedom was in fact insanity; I was finally making the transition to madness. But after a few minutes of settling in to the routine of NOT filling in the correct answers, and beginning to crave this new sense of accomplishment, I started to think of how radically different my mental state was from that of the high school students in the same room, taking the same test. An earlier show of hands indicated that most of the students were taking the SAT for the first time. So, I think it's very likely there were some people in the room who were terrified. For better or for worse they were confronting destiny. Meanwhile, I was confronting silliness. The difference in perspective seemed so extreme that there were moments when I shook with desperately suppressed laughter. I did not laugh aloud or smile conspicuously, but the instinct to laugh was as powerful and as involuntary as a case of hiccups. I admire people who devote themselves to improvement, and I know very well how stressful it can be to have success depend on a relatively short personal demonstration, but humor draws its strength from fear, and the kind of anxiety surrounding the SAT is so familiar, and yet so meaningless, that one can only laugh or become depressed. From the very beginning of the test to the very end I felt euphoric. I was having complex emotions I couldn't describe. This experience was far more rewarding than I had imagined.







MY TEST SCORES The Torture of Waiting for Scores I was surprised how bothered I was waiting for my score report, especially considering the fact that I am not a high school student, and I am not facing deadlines. Still, I was checking my mailbox daily, and I even figured out when the postal worker delivered mail (4 PM for me), and I checked at the earliest possible time each day. All day long I was distracted by the anticipation of getting the score report. I wrote an e-mail to the College Board and learned that score reports were sent with first-class postage. (I bet they get that question all the time!) But most people don't have to wait nearly as long to find out their scaled scores. About ten days after the test date, scores are available online for a charge of $13. On the first Monday three weeks after the test date, scores are mailed out to test-takers and any specified institutions via first-class mail (usually 5 full business days to arrive at points in the US). Starting on the date the scores are mailed, the online scores for that test date can be accessed without paying a fee. FIGURE: Looking at my SAT scores online. Unfortunately, the online report does not indicate the raw scores. Still, it is reassuring that my scaled scores and percentages are at the minimums. (NOTE: Contrary to popular opinion, one is likely to have to get at least one question wrong on the test to result in the lowest scaled scores possible. Blank tests are interpreted as requests to cancel scores, but even if they were given scaled scores, such scores would likely be significantly greater than the minimum scaled scores of 200.) FIGURE: I love how the advice avoids making any significant promises: Tensai can look forward to checking his mailbox for big fat envelopes. Oh, brother! The Envelope... Finally, on May 6th, eight days after the College Board claims score reports are mailed out, I received the following: FIGURE: Envelope containing my destiny. But check out the date stamped by the postage meter: FIGURE: April 24th? I suspected(*) a conspiracy! (*...Thanks, Christopher, for ""clearing up"" a suspected conspiracy! [See e-mail section] Or is it ""covering up""...?!) Failing at Failure: Total Humiliation! Opening the envelope, eager with anticipation, I find the following report: FIGURE: Printed score report. The first part is reassuring: FIGURE: Scaled scores and percentiles. But, OH NO! I actually answered two questions correctly on the test!! FIGURE: Two questions correct, with no question omitted. Ugh, I have failed to achieve total failure! That is pathetic. But somehow this seems like a fitting outcome -- and it is a wide-open invitation for competition. I can't believe I accidentally answered two MATH problems correctly! I was preparing myself for the disappointment of getting a few VERBAL questions wrong, er, I mean correct, but MATH?!...How? Sabotage! ;-) ""Student Answer Service"" Report A few weeks later I received the ""Student Answer Service"" report, which told me a little more about which questions I answered correctly by accident: FIGURE: ""Student Answer Service"" report. The two ""+"" signs indicate questions I answered correctly: FIGURE: Two questions answered correctly (""+"") in mathematics. As you can see, one correct answer was in the ""Student-Produced Responses"" section. It's impossible to get negative raw score points for these questions, so it would have been better to simply leave all 10 answers blank -- but instead I encoded my name (COLIN P F... --> 3,15,12,9,14, 16, 6...), and it appears that ""9"" was a correct answer! As for the other geometric reasoning question, I'm guessing I simply answered it correctly by accident.







CONCLUSION I am confident that I am one of the few people in the long history of the SAT to answer practically every question incorrectly. Getting a score of 1600 is more of a challenge, but my goal was novelty! ""It is better to have answered incorrectly than never to have answered at all!""

In 1994, the introduction of the ""student-response"" math questions made it impossible to lose points on some questions, which represents a blow to the goal of extremely wrong performance. In 2005, the introduction of the written essay section, replacing a section of multiple-choice questions, will deprive test-takers of the current negative point potential. This experiment grew on me as time passed by, and now I am thinking of other funny angles, like asking Princeton Review or Kaplan if they would be interested in being able to make the claim that a person who participated in their SAT preparation course improved his test score by 1200 points! FIGURE: ""Could my future get any brighter?!"" -- Colin P. Fahey, immediately after taking the SAT I at the UCI test center I want it to be known that I think the SAT is a reasonable test. I also believe that the College Board web site and e-mail notifications are very good resources for high school students on their way to college. Some aspects of the SAT are bizarre, and perhaps competition in the standardized testing business would be good for consumers (students and institutions), but I can't think of any particular improvements that would be big enough to justify entering the market.

responsible for choosing dark blue print (on black) for the

third function labels, should die a slow and painful death.

Maybe that print is readable in a bright classroom, but not

The Relative Percentage is an integer between 1 and 99

Which, as any math person knows, doesn't make any sense.

Intuitively, nobody is entitled to a 100 or 0, because nobody

gets a better score or worse score than everybody. But a little

thought about the definition of rounding tells you that it makes

perfect sense to give a 100 to the top 0.5% of test takers.

And of course a 0 to the bottom 0.5% -- a group that certainly

includes Colin Fahey!

The most fun fact about ""SAT eins"" and Germany is that a private

television channel is named like that. They are the only one who show

star trek, also they kinda specialised in soccer coverage. It's name

probably a reverence to the satellite ""Sat 1"" which covers most of

Europe with lots of television programs. They have a beach ball as sign.

The following e-mail mentions some of the ""loose ends"" that I was privately wondering about when I finally decided to put my article online: (E-MAIL MESSAGE)

--------------------------------------------------------------------------------



Found out about your website from the blog, What The Heck?!

(www.whattheheck.com). I'm just a tad disappointed you beat me to the

same idea.



Couple things I thought I'd point out. For those two ""wrong"" answers you

have in the Geometric Reasoning, let's not forget that standardized tests

often find out they make mistakes and place multiple correct answers, or

accidentally program the computer to accept a wrong answer instead of the

correct one. Something like that may have happened here, and everyone got

a bonus question or two. You may have utterly failed after all.



What's really interesting, I think, is that in the breakdown of each type

of question, you are listed in being in the fifth percentile of all

students in each category, despite nearly pulling off the anti-perfect

test. Maybe I'm being a tad too incredulous here, but does this mean that

about one in every 20 people taking the SAT are screwing up every question

in a given section? I'd love to see what scores rank in what percentiles.



Also, don't trust any postmark run on red ink - those are personal postal

meters, and you honestly can alter those to say whatever date you want.

Government agencies actually cannot accept one of those as a postmark date

(I know, for I work in one). Of course, the College Board is not a

government agency, but still, you see my point - they are not reliable.



Anyhow, thanks for the illuminating and hilarious take on the SAT.



(E-MAIL MESSAGE)

I was also surprised that your calculator always rounds up.

I tried both the US-manufactured calculators I own and they do the same.

Although, perhaps the fix function is different from rounding. There was no

'round' function on my calculators; only 'fix'.



I checked various programming languages (C, perl, python) and they all round

to nearest even integer. So, hrm. Maybe it's just different in the U.S.

After all, you guys still use the imperial measuring system! =D

Hi,



I took the SAT at the same center as you at UCI, matter fact I saw you

there lol. Anyways you seem to be a bright guy doing the whole AI

tetris, next October when I take the SAT I again you take the test

with me and Text message me all the answers of the math portion while

I do the verbal. I'll cover all costs. LOL. Funny site I enjoyed

sharing it with friends. Take care

Haha yah feel free to post my message on your site. Actually when I

saw you I thought you were one of the people from the sat prep

institutions trying to take the SAT so you are up to date on what

they are testing. Like a ""cracking"" the test if you will. Some

people were planning to sit next to you to copy off you thinking

you're the SAT master, I wonder how their scores turned out, lol.

Anyways seems your getting a lot of hits on the website that is

great. I plan to apply to UCI in fall, and since you seem to know

it well you can show me around sometime. Take care.



The following person corrected my error regarding the ""postmark"" conspiracy. This is really great information: (E-MAIL MESSAGE)

Hi, loved the whole concept... One of those things that you think

of - and find brilliant in theory, but think, ""Naw, too silly to

actually do.""



Thank God someone has the guts to chase the nightmare.



Anyway, my point in writing: Your postmark problem. That isn't

a ""postmark"". Note under the eagle, it says meter and is followed

by a serial number. That is the imprint of a Pitney Bowes postage

meter, and April 24 would be the date (probably, see * below) that

the postage was applied to that particular envelope. In all

likelihood, some poor schmuck (or a small team of poor schmucks)

working in a mailroom had to apply these marks to _hundreds of

thousands_ of these envelopes, depending of course on how many

locations process the mailing of scores. Clearly, they would want

to get a head start on prepping envelopes. And can you blame them?



* You can set PB postage meters _ahead_ to any date, but you can't

backdate them.



Hope this helps. Keep up the brilliance. Or, I guess, the

lack thereof.



Follow-up after my request to quote the message above: (E-MAIL MESSAGE)

--------------------------------------------------------------------------------



Oh, and a clarification (and some more useless information): Pitney

Bowes postage meters can, in theory, be backdated, but you would

need either a) a series of codes available only to certain PB

technicians and administrators, or b) to break open the dater, run

it backwards manually, reassemble it, and hope that it still

functions. To do so, as you can guess, would violate several civil

and criminal statutes, not the least of which would be Mail Fraud.

Episcopate of the Discordian Society,

By the powers confered to him by Malaclypse the Younger, KSC

Omnibenevolent Polyfather of the Virginity in Gold, High Priest



In the name of the Discordian Movement:

------------------------------ -><- -------------------------------

To: Colin Fahey



Dear (X) Sir, ( ) Madam, ( ) Possum,



It has come to Our ears that your individual person transported

itself, on the day 52 of the Season of Discord, anno 3169, to the

Rowland Hall, University of California, Irvine, in order to take

the test known as SAT 1 with the intention of answering incorrectly

to all the questions.



Though We could not understand why you did not question the answers

instead of the opposite, We believe you did achieve a notable

performance in the Way of Confusion. Moreover your personal

testimony of the experience suggests that your soul was touched by

our Lady of Discord, as is apparent in this excerpt :

-------------------------------------------------------------------

I definitely passed through some kind of mental barrier as a result

of this experience. [...] So, in this latest experience, when

worked very hard to determine the correct answer for each question,

and then proceeded to pick the exact WRONG answer (in fact, the

most RIDICULOUS answer), I had a very strong emotional reaction.

For a while I worried that this new peculiar feeling of freedom was

in fact insanity; I was finally making the transition to madness.



But after a few minutes of settling in to the routine of NOT

filling in the correct answers, and beginning to crave this new

sense of accomplishment, I started to think of how radically

different my mental state was from that of the high school students

in the same room, taking the same test. [...] Meanwhile, I was

confronting silliness. The difference in perspective seemed so

extreme that there were moments when I shook with desperately

suppressed laughter. I did not laugh aloud or smile conspicuously,

but the instinct to laugh was as powerful and as involuntary as a

case of hiccups.

-------------------------------------------------------------------

We believe you were personnally contacted by Our Lady Eris through

your pineal gland at this very moment.



Therefore, by Our Official Capacity of Great Pasha, Episcopate of

the Discordian Society, for your Act of Faith in Holy Confusion and

Subsequent Enlightenment, We appoint you as:



Erisian Avatar or Assimilated,

House of Apostle of Eris for the Eristocracy and Cabalability



Arise !



Receive Our Most Complascent and Psychotic Congratulations.

POSTSCRIPT HAS THIS BEEN DONE BEFORE? After more than 128,000 visitors to this web page I have received only two e-mail messages claiming that ""friends"" attempted the stunt described in this article before my own attempt in April, 2003. CLAIM #1 : ""A high school student took the SAT in the 1960s, got all questions wrong, then took the SAT again and answered all questions correctly and was admitted to Berkeley."" CLAIM #2 : ""A high school student took the SAT in 1989, getting all questions wrong. This student was admitted to Harvard."" I have made efforts to get in direct contact with the ""friends"" to eventually get proof of their accomplishments, but I have not received any responses. I have changed some of the comments in this article to leave room for the possibility of other people having done the same stunt before me, and I would actually be a little surprised to learn that I was in fact the first to get such an extreme negative raw score, but so far I have not received any direct claims from people, or any supporting evidence. I WILL GLADLY REPORT SIMILAR ACCOMPLISHMENTS I will gladly report any past or future accomplishments similar to my own. However, I will ask for various forms of evidence before I make any reports on this page. If you plan to register for the SAT to attempt this stunt, be sure to order the optional ""Student Answer Service"" if it is available for the particular test date. PROOF THAT GETTING A TERRIBLE SAT SCORE DOESN'T RUIN ONE'S LIFE Several months after getting almost the worst possible raw score on the SAT, I was invited to pursue a Ph.D. in Computer Science at UCI. Ironically, I had to take the GRE General Test again (since my 1992 scores are too old), and I scored a 1410 on the computer adaptive test version with only a week of casual preparation. Am I a hyprocrite? Wasn't the thesis of this SAT article something like ""sticking it to 'The Man'""?! I'm too stupid to know, but in a few years I might be Dr. Hypocrite, and perhaps even Professor Hypocrite. All praise The System and its mysterious ways!

Love them or hate them, beards have become the latest trend in male fashion. For those of us that love wearing a beard, there are plenty of social media websites to illustrating an unconditional love for facial hair.

However, a new study has shown that beards are basically filled with more bacteria than the inside of a toilet. According to KOAT Albuquerque, several anonymous men allowed a microbiologist to swab their beards for bacterial testing. A few of the beards contained standard stuff while others revealed fecal matter. While the microbiologist recommended a good beard scrubbing and regular hand-washing to diminish the amount of germs, he didn’t explain how a man’s beard could end up with poop in the first place.

So the next time you see someone with a long and gorgeous beard, remember there is a good chance it has fecal bacteria crawling through it.

59-year old Karim Najibullah, a Ford Motor Company executive from Dearborn in Michigan, and his 27-year old Saudi wife Aliyah, spent the last two weeks visiting her family in the city of Abha, located in the south-western part of the kingdom.

On Wednesday, the couple was invited to a wedding reception where several members of the royal family were also present, including Prince Khalid bin Abdullah Al Saud, a famous horse and camel breeder with a herd including some rare specimens worths over 2 million riyals ($533,300) each.

During the reception, Prince Khalid attempted to negotiate the purchase of Mr. Najibullah’s wife by offering several of his prized animals, but the American repeatedly declined the prince’s offers.

When the couple attempted to take their plane back to U.S. this morning, they were arrested by the Saudi police. Mr. Najibullah was taken into police custody, while the whereabouts of his wife remain unknown.

The Minister of Justice and President of Supreme Judicial Council, Sheikh Walid bin Mohammed Al-Samaani, justified the arrest and called for an exemplary sentence against Mr. Najibullah.

“The Prince was extremely generous, offering 45 camels worth at least 30 million riyals ($8 million) for a woman that was hardly worth a quarter of that.”

Refusing any demand from a member of the royal family is a serious crime for Saudi citizens, but only 7 Americans have ever been sentenced for such crimes. According to Sheikh Al-Samaani, the accused didn’t simply refuse, but “insulted and defamed the prince and the kingdom”

“Not only did he have the arrogance to rudely decline, but he didn’t even thank the prince for his benevolence and generosity. This is an insult to the crown.”

Mr. Najibullah faces some extremely serious accusations and could be sentenced to harsh corporal punishment, including public lashings, lengthy jail terms, and even death.

The U.S. State Department confirmed that an envoy has been dispatched to Riyadh to attempt to negotiate his liberation, but did not give more details."

Founder, Webmaster, & Editor, In5D.com

Time is actually speeding up (or collapsing). For thousands of years the Schumann Resonance or pulse (heartbeat) of Earth has been 7.83 cycles per second, The military have used this as a very reliable reference. However, since 1980 this resonance has been slowly rising. Some scientists believe that it is rising faster than we can measure seeing as it is constantly rising while measuring.

This is from a member of the Physics Forum:

“The universe is expanding; interstellar distances are becoming greater and greater. How does the relationship between space, time, and the speed of light compensate for this? Changes in interstellar distances are measurable. The speed of light is constant and is measurable. But what about Time itself, can changes to time be measured? Or is that a paradox within itself? How can we measure a potential change in Time itself if it is changing while we are trying to measure it? For example, hypothetically speaking, if you are trying to measure how much a yard stick is decreasing in length against a second yard stick that is also decreasing in length at the same rate as the first one and if everything else around you (including yourself) was shrinking at the same rate than you would never confirm that such a change actually did occur. So if we look at the relationship between space, time, and the speed of light; if space is measurably expanding and the speed of light is still constant, can Time be speeding up? No wonder they say, “the older you get, the faster time goes by”, if they only new. Humanity continually strives to make its vehicles, technologies, and processes faster yet we never seem to have enough time or wish we had more time, doesn’t that make you wonder.”

More and more frequently people are suggesting that time is speeding up. We hear people saying things like “I never seem to have enough time to get everything done anymore” or “where has the time gone to”. The years are certainly flying by faster than ever and there is a scientific reason why time is speeding up. There are also a number of reasons why we are changing so rapidly and it is all related to time speeding up. Human beings are becoming more consciously aware and people are being drawn towards spirituality and personal development in greater numbers than ever before. Why is this happening?

Scientists discovered many years ago that the earth gives off a pulse. This pulse or frequency which has been likened to a heartbeat has been stable at approximately 7.8 cycles per second for thousands of years. However, since around the year 1980 the earth’s heartbeat began to speed up. The most incredible thing is some scientists believe the earth will actually stop rotating when this pulse reaches 13 cycles per second. When the earth stops rotating on its axis it is believed that it will remain still for around 3 days and then start spinning in the other direction. This will cause a reversal in the magnetic field around the earth but what will happen after this point is unclear. At this point you are thinking one of two things. Either you are thinking this sounds pretty amazing or you simply cannot believe it. I’m kind of in the middle myself, I think it’s hard to believe but I’m prepared to keep an open mind. Since I have become interested in spirituality I have seen wonderful things happen in my life and because of this I believe almost anything is possible.

It is due to this increasing pulse rate that we feel as though time is speeding up. Why do we “feel” as though time is moving faster than it used to be? The reason is what we once perceived to be a period of 24 hours now feels like only 16 hours. Our clocks still move in seconds, minutes and hours and still click over a full day in 24 hours but due to the earths increased heartbeat, we perceive it to be only two thirds as long or a perception period of merely 16 hours.

As far fetched as all this may seem, a number of reports suggest that we will reach this critical mass or zero point when the earth stops rotating, very soon. From my research into this phenomena and the changes I can see happening in my body and mind as well as what I see happening around the globe, I believe as do many others that we are now moving into the 4th dimension. The fourth dimension is where our thoughts will manifest almost instantly. This period of life on earth is where our good and bad karma will come back to us almost immediately. This is why so many people, although perhaps unaware as to why, are becoming consciously aware and turning towards spirituality and away from materialism and greed. We are feeling the urge to not only do the right thing for our own body and mind but we are more willing to help others than ever before in history.

The growth rate in awareness is off the charts. What once took years of reading, learning and watching to become more spiritually aware may now only take a year or even months. There is so much more information than ever before on spirituality available in books and on the internet that is serving to accelerate our learning and helping us move away from the darkness of fear and towards the light of love. As we feel the need to change our direction in life and release our bad habits we are starting to meet others who feel the same way and collectively we are helping each other. We are realizing that we are part of something greater than our individual self and this further accelerates our spiritual evolution.

We are leaving the Age of Pisces, a destructive and oppressive period and moving into the Age of Aquarius, a period of love and peace. This is a difficult time for many people as they struggle to come to terms with what is happening around them and what is happening to their mind and feelings. The key is to let go and trust in this natural process of change and not to fight your feelings. As we move closer to the fifth dimension and as time speeds to an all time high, our thoughts, feelings and intentions will manifest into our reality in the twinkling of an eye. What this means effectively is that those of us living with thoughts of fear and trepidation, will manifest just that into their lives causing untold pain. However, those of us feeling happy and positive will manifest only love and joy into their lives. It’s all about choice, and it’s your choice to make, nobody can make it for you.

As we continue through this exciting period of history the entire world will change along with everyone in it. Eventually we will be forced to release our fears, there is no other way. Fear will cease to exist and the greatest causes of fear, being time and money, will no longer be a part of our existence. This is an exciting period to be alive so I’m going to go with the flow and enjoy the ride, I hope you’ll join me.

Gregg Braden on the Photon Belt and Schumann Resonance

Gregg Braden is currently traveling around the United States and in the media, telling of the scientific proof of the Earth passing through the Photon Belt and the slowing of the Earths rotation. At the same time there is an increase in the resonant frequency of the Earth (Schumann Resonance). When the Earth stops its rotation and the resonance frequency reaches 13 cycles we will beat a zero point magnetic field. The Earth will be stopped, and in 2 or 3 days it will start turning again in the opposite direction. This will produce a reversal in the magnetic fields around the earth and so forth.

Geophysical Condition #1: Earth’s Rising Base Frequency

Earth’s background base frequency, or “heartbeat,” (called Schumann resonance, or SR) is rising dramatically. Though it varies among geographical regions, for decades the overall measurement was 7.8 cycles per second. This was once thought to be a constant; global military communications developed on this frequency. Gregg Braden found data collected by Norwegian and Russian researchers on this; it’s not widely reported in the US. (The only reference to SR to be found in the Seattle Library reference section, is tied to the weather, and Science acknowledges SR as a sensitive indicator of temperature variations and worldwide weather conditions, Braden also believes the fluctuating SR may be a factor in the severe storms, floods, and weather of recent years.)

Geophysical Condition #2: Earth’s Diminishing Magnetic Field

While earth’s “pulse” rate is rising, her magnetic field strength, on the other hand, is declining. According to Professor Bannerjee of the University of New Mexico, the field has lost up to half its intensity in the last 4,000 years. And because a forerunner of magnetic polar reversals is this field strength, Prof. Bannerjee believes that another reversal is due. Braden believes that because these cyclical Shifts are associated with reversals, Earth’s geological record indicating magnetic reversals also marks previous Shifts in history. And, within the enormous time scale represented, there were quite a few of them.

Possible Outcomes

1. Time will appear to speed up as we approach Zero Point. A 24 hour day will seem to about 16 hours or less. Remember the Schumann Resonance (or “heart beat” of Mother Earth) has been 7.8 cycles for thousands of years, but has been rising since 1980. It stops at 13 cycles.

2. Zero Point or the Shift of the Ages has been predicted by ancient peoples for thousands of years. There have been many shifts including the one that always occurs every 13,000 years at each half of the 26,000 years, Procession of the Equinox.

3. Zero Point or a flip of the magnetic poles will probably happen soon, within the next few years.

4. It is said that after Zero Point the Sun will rise in the west and set in the east, approx. Past occurrences of this change have been found in ancient records.

5. The Zero Point flip will probably introduce us to the 4th dimension. Here, everything we think or desire will instantly manifest. This includes love and fear. Our INTENTION will be of utmost importance.

6. Most technology that we know will cease to operate. Possible exceptions could be technology based on so called “Zero Point” or free energy.

7. Our physical body is changing as we approach Zero Point. Our DNA is being “upgraded” to 12 strands. A new light body is being created. We are becoming more intuitive.

In5D Addendum

Gregg Prescott, M.S.

Editor, In5D.com

I have been tracking the daily Schumann Resonance on In5D News and have recently seen it as high as 8.90.

You can find the daily Schumann Resonance here. It is on a Russian website and is translated into English. Just click the “Frequency” link on the left hand side of the page.

As Mother Earth rises in frequency, she presents us the opportunity to do the same with her. Try to find the time to connect with nature or to meditate while consciously making that same connection.

A friend of mine gave me a great idea to do while meditating: Envision that you are hugging the entire planet. Send Mother Earth as much love as humanly possible and you will make that connection!

Sending you all infinite Love & Light,

Gregg

Saturday 30 May 237632 Shares

ELEPHANT BUTTE LAKE, NM: The dead body of the elusive Sasquatch was recently discovered on a northern shore at Elephant Butte Lake on Wednesday by a camper and his wife. The campers, who wish to remain anonymous, are from Albuquerque, NM and have heard of the reports of recent sightings of the Bigfoot in the Monticello area at Elephant Butte Lake.

The campers described the creature as being between 8 and 8.5 feet tall, and between 600 to 800 pounds in weight Covered with black hair, and possessing broad, muscular shoulders. Slim waist. Long legs. Arms reaching the knees. Ape-like hands (no opposable thumb). Palms and base of feet hairless. Feet very large (18 to 24 inches long) with five toes.

The camper, an avid outdoorsman and hunter, told the Sierra County Sheriff Investigators that ""I was skeptical about all the recent stories I heard of Bigfoot here at The Butte, but after actually seeing one in the flesh, it scared the hell out of me!"" he admitted.

He did state to this reporter that the creature had a compound fracture of its right leg and cause of death may have been due to infection. We must also report that the remains were removed under tight security by the military to an undisclosed location.

What does the SAT stand for?

Originally, SAT was an acronym for the Scholastic Aptitude Test. In 1993, the test was renamed the SAT I: Reasoning Test. At the same time, the former Achievement Tests were renamed the SAT II: Subject Tests. SAT has become a simple way of referring to the SAT I: Reasoning Test. In 2004, the ""I"" and ""II"" were dropped, and the test became the SAT Reasoning Test, or more commonly, the SAT. The SAT II: Subject Tests became the SAT Subject Tests, or just Subject Tests.

What are the similarities and differences between the SAT and the PSAT/NMSQT?

Both the SAT and the PSAT/NMSQT measure verbal and math reasoning skills. The PSAT/NMSQT contains questions from actual SATs but it is designed to be slightly easier than the SAT. The PSAT/NMSQT also measures writing skills, with multiple-choice questions like those on the SAT Subject Tests in Writing, and like those that will be on the new SAT in March 2005. The PSAT/NMSQT is two hours and 10 minutes, whereas the SAT is a three-hour test. The SAT is used for college admission, but PSAT/NMSQT scores are not sent to colleges. The PSAT/NMSQT Score Report gives you personalized feedback on areas in which you could improve, along with specific advice on how to improve. Taking the PSAT/NMSQT gives you a chance to qualify for scholarship and recognition programs and is a good way to practice for the SAT.

Is it true that you get a 200 on the SAT just for signing your name?

Theoretically speaking, if you just sign your name and don't complete the answer sheet, you would get a score of 200. That's because we don't report scores that are lower than 200. In reality, if we received an answer sheet that wasn't filled out, it would be considered an automatic request to cancel scores and no scores would be reported.

Back to top

Are some SAT tests more difficult than other ones?

All editions of the SAT are developed using the same test specifications. Even if there are tiny differences in difficulty from test to test, a statistical process called ""equating"" ensures that a score for a test taken on one date or at one place is equivalent to a score for a test taken on another date or in another place. The rumors that the SAT in one month, say in October, is easier, are false.

Back to top

Are all SAT questions multiple-choice?

All of the SAT is multiple-choice except for 10 student-produced response math questions. These questions ask you to fill in or ""grid-in"" your own answers using a special section of the answer sheet. . In March 2005, the new SAT will contain a 25-minute written essay. Read more about the new SAT.

Back to top

What's the difference between the SAT and Subject Tests?

The SAT is a three-hour test that measures verbal and mathematical skills. SAT scores are used for college admission purposes because the test predicts college success. The Subject Tests are one-hour, primarily multiple-choice tests in specific subjects. Subject Tests measure knowledge or skills in a particular subject and your ability to apply that knowledge.

Back to top

How many times can you take the test?

You can take the test as many times as you want. Your score report shows your current test score, in addition to scores for up to six SAT and six Subject Test administrations.

Back to top

What test should I take first, the SAT or the Subject Tests?

Most students take the SAT in the spring of their junior year and again in the fall of their senior year of high school. Most students who take Subject Tests take them toward the end of their junior year or at the beginning of their senior year. Because Subject Tests are directly related to course work, it's helpful to take tests such as World History, Biology E/M, Chemistry, or Physics as soon as possible after completing the course in the subject, even as a freshman or sophomore, while the material is still fresh in your mind. You'll do better on other tests like languages after at least two years of study.

Back to top

Will the SAT Subject Test in Writing still be offered after the new SAT is introduced?

When the new SAT is introduced in March 2005, all students will be required to take a test with a writing section. For this reason, the Subject Test in Writing will no longer be offered after January 22, 2005. Read more about the new SAT.

Which test should I take?

To find out which test(s) you should take, contact the colleges you are interested in attending or use our College Search to determine admissions requirements and deadlines. Most colleges require the SAT I for admission and many other schools require both the SAT and Subject Tests for admission purposes or placement. Additionally, some colleges require specific Subject Test tests while others allow you to choose which tests you take. It's best to check directly with the school. If you're uncertain about your readiness to take a specific Subject Test, see Which Subject Test to Take.

Why do I have to take the SAT and why is it required by so many colleges?

You may have to take the test because it is an admission requirement of the college you are interested in attending.

Many colleges require the SAT for admission because it is a standard way of measuring a student's ability to do college-level work.

The SAT is the best independent, standardized measure of a student's college readiness. It is standardized across all students, schools, and states, providing a common and objective scale for comparison. High school grades are a very useful indicator of how students perform in college, yet there is great variation in grading standards and course rigor within and across high schools.

Remember, too, that the SAT in only one of a number of factors that colleges consider when making admission decisions. Other factors, like your high school record, essays, recommendations, interviews, and extracurricular activities, also play a role in admission decisions.

Back to top

What do my SAT scores tell college admission staff about me?

Your SAT scores can tell admission staff how you compare with other students who took the test. That's because all scores are reported on the 200-to-800 scale. For example, if your verbal and math scores were about 500, which is the average score, then college admission staff would know you scored about as well as half of the students who took the test.

Back to top

Can the SAT really show how well I'll do in my first year of college?

No test can accurately predict with 100 percent certainty what your grades will be in college. That's because many factors, including personal motivation, influence your college grades.

However, colleges admissions offices use SAT scores to help estimate how well students are likely to do at a particular college. For example, a college looks at the SAT scores, high school grade-point average (GPA), and college grades of its freshman class. The college finds that students who scored between 450 and 550 on the SAT and maintained a ""B"" average in high school are the students who perform well at its school. Knowing your SAT scores and high school GPA helps the college make a decision about how likely it is that you'll do well at the school.

Back to top

Why does the SAT have the kinds of questions that it does?

The SAT measures verbal and math reasoning abilities. These abilities relate to some of the things you need to know to be successful in college.

The SAT was designed with questions that reflect or show your reasoning abilities, not just the amount of information you've accumulated during school. As an example, many math items can be answered by using complex equations, but they can also be answered correctly if you can reason through the problem. Reading passages don't just test that you can read but require extended reasoning in order to answer the questions related to the passage. This means that you have to be able to make inferences, assumptions, and interpretations based on the passage provided, in order to understand what the author is trying to say.

Back to top

Why don't the questions on the SAT ask about the things I'm learning in my high school courses?

The SAT measures verbal and math reasoning abilities that you develop over years of schooling and in your outside reading and study. The test is designed to allow you to demonstrate your abilities in these areas regardless of the particular type of instruction you've received or textbooks you've used. These important abilities — understanding and analyzing written material, drawing inferences, differentiating shades of meaning, drawing conclusions, and solving math problems — are necessary for success in college and life in general. This doesn't mean that the SAT is irrelavent to your course work, however. In March 2005, the new SAT will align more closely with the type of skills being taught in the classroom and necessary for college success. Read more about the new SAT.

Back to top

Who comes up with the questions?

Test Development Committees comprised of educators and subject-matter experts determine the test specifications and the types of questions that are asked, including topics and areas that should be covered. Internal test developers write the questions, which are then submitted to another test committee, made up of high school and college faculty and administrators, which reviews the test questions and makes recommendations for improving them, if needed. Some test questions are also submitted by high school and college teachers from around the country.

Back to top

Why do some of the questions on the SAT seem so tricky? Are you trying to ""catch"" me?

The test questions are not designed to be tricky! But there are some difficult questions that require careful attention and figuring out. Many have incorrect answers that look good at first glance or that will seem correct if you don't pay attention. But the questions are not designed to ""catch"" you.

Back to top

Why can't I have more time to take the SAT?

Much effort is made so that most students are given enough time to attempt every question on the test. But even if more time were given, not all students would be able to answer all the questions.

Studies are done to find out whether most students have enough time to attempt to answer all the questions in each test section. These studies show that time limits are appropriate if all students taking the test answer 75 percent of the questions in each section and if 80 percent reach the last question in the section. Based on studies like these, the time limits are appropriate for the majority of the students.

Students with Disabilities may request extended time for taking the SAT.

If coaching for the SAT doesn't help, why are there so many test prep companies?

While trying to learn ""tricks"" to answer the question will not help you, there are things you can do to prepare for the test. The best way to prepare for the SAT is to take challenging academic courses and work hard in school. It's a fact that students who have taken challening academic courses and have earned good grades receive, on average, higher scores than students who have taken fewer academic courses and have lower grades.

We recommend these basic ways to prepare:

Take the PSAT/NMSQT.

Spend time going over sample questions.

Review the directions, learn to pace yourself, and study the types of questions in the SAT I.

Take the sample SAT Reasoning Test provided in Taking the SAT Reasoning Test, which is available in the SAT Preparation Center or in your high school-see your school counselor for a copy.

According to the Olympia police department, 37-year old Laura James was “visibly intoxicated and behaving erratically” when she showed up for work this morning.

Due to a lack of replacement teachers, she was still allowed to teach her class but rapidly went out of control.

Olympia police spokesman, Lieutenant Robert Emery described the incident during a press conference held a few hours later.

“The children said she was screaming and talking in gibberish while drawing symbols on the board. She then started stripping off her clothes and throwing them around.”

The students became agitated and scared by their teacher’s erratic behavior and some of them tried to leave the classroom.

The naked teacher then turned very aggressive and started grasping and biting students while howling and growling loudly.

Lt. Emery says the children were only saved by the rapid intervention of another teacher who intervened and was able to subdue Ms. James.

“Several witness accounts suggest she was in a psychotic state and was convinced she was some type of predatory animal. It’s a miracle that she was stopped before anyone was killed.”

Laura James now faces a total of 23 criminal charges, including aggravated assault, child endangerment, criminal neglect, and indecent exposure.

If found guilty on all charges, she faces a maximum of 65 years in prison and a fine of $85,000.

Her lawyers have already announced her intention to plead “not guilty”, claiming that Ms. James has mental problems and cannot be considered responsible for her actions.

Trump: The Capitol a 'Living Monument to the American People'

Rep. Luis Gutierrez turned and left the State of the Union address Tuesday, just as Republicans broke into a ""USA"" chant.

President Donald Trump had just finished mentioning the Statue of Freedom atop the Capitol building, which he then called a ""monument to the American people.""

In that section of remarks, Trump also praised veterans in wars from the Revolution, through World War II and today, mentioning sites like Saratoga, N.Y., Yorktown, V.A. and the Pacific theater.

As half of the gallery broke into a ""USA"" chant, Gutierrez (D-Ill.) could be seen exiting his aisle seat and walking out of the chamber.

A Democratic member patted Gutierrez on the shoulder as he passed.

In a statement, Gutierrez - who announced his retirement this year - called Trump's speech ""well-delivered [considering] whoever translated it from Russian did a good job.""

Gutierrez also ripped Trump for what he considered the administration's mistreatment of Puerto Rico, saying that Trump is treating it like a ""s***hole country.""

""For the life of me, I can't figure out when democrats became so... anti-middle America,"" Deputy White House Press Secretary J. Hogan Gidley said.

President Donald Trump had just finished mentioning the Statue of Freedom atop the Capitol building, which he then called a ""monument to the American people.""
As half of the gallery broke into a ""USA"" chant, Gutierrez (D-Ill.) could be seen exiting his aisle seat and walking out of the chamber.
In a statement, Gutierrez - who announced his retirement this year - called Trump's speech ""well-delivered [considering] whoever translated it from Russian did a good job.""
Gutierrez also ripped Trump for what he considered the administration's mistreatment of Puerto Rico, saying that Trump is treating it like a ""s***hole country."""

“Students should have the right to attend any college they wish – tuition free – and that includes the Electoral College,” Cortez told a town hall crowd. Democrats in the audience cheered her proposal. “Of course, I don’t, like, really know how things actually work in the real world.”

Hillary Clinton has called for the Electoral College to be torn down. Cortez disagrees. “I’ve never known anybody who attended the Electoral College, but I’m sure it’s a nice campus. Those who teach there probably love their jobs. We just need to make it more accessible to more students. Free tuition will do just that.”

Cortez admitted she didn’t even know in which state the Electoral College was located. “One thing I do know, is that student debt is making slaves out of college students. And that’s not right.”

Speaking of Hillary, she and husband Bill announced today they’ll be going on a tour in the coming months, including stops at college campuses. And yes, a stop at the Electoral College is on their itinerary.

https://www.snopes.com/fact-check/adolf-hitler-smashing-the-nucleus/	adolf hitler said that the only way that the nazi party could have been stopped was if it were destroyed in its infancy.	mostly true	['adolf hitler']	2017/02/13	Dan Evon	['https://zuriz.wordpress.com/2013/10/06/smashing-the-nucleus/', 'http://archive.org/stream/Die-Reden-Hitlers-am-Reichsparteitag-1933/DieRedenHitlersAmReichsparteitag1933193427Doppels.ScanFraktur#page/n21/mode/1up']	https://zuriz.wordpress.com/2013/10/06/smashing-the-nucleus/	https://zuriz.wordpress.com/	"Most readers will be familiar with Hitler’s infamous quote, regularly presented to reinforce the notion that fascists must be physically smashed when they’re still small:

“Only one thing could have stopped our movement – if our adversaries had understood its principle and from the first day smashed with the utmost brutality the nucleus of our new movement“.

The first time I heard these words was in Bash the Fash, a 1994 song by the anarcho-punk band Oi Polloi. I have since been confronted with it countless times at political talks, in anti-fascist pamphlets, and so on. My reply is the same every time: Hitler was a crafty politician but no great historian.



The fact that the quote only ever appeared in anti-fascist agitprop and an exact source was never produced made me wonder. Some websites claimed that Hitler “wrote” these words in 1934, but they did not specify where. Others attributed them to a speech given at the August 1939 party rally in Nuremberg, yet no available documents of that event (which was dedicated to revving up the armed forces for the imminent war) contained it.

For some time, the earliest source I could find was David Edgar’s 1976 play about the National Front, Destiny. At the end of the play, a voice meant to be Hitler’s is heard delivering it in English language. After a pause, the voice states: “Hitler, Nuremberg, third of September 1933.”

Finally, I found a scan of Die Reden Hitlers am Reichsparteitag 1933, a 1934 book that contained complete transcripts of all speeches given by Hitler at Nuremberg in the previous year. It turned out that he had employed a variation of the infamous phrase.

Find below my translation and marvel at the Führer’s social-Darwinist wisdom:

“And so, in 1919 I established a programme and tendency that were a conscious slap in the face of the democratic-pacifist world (…) [We knew] it might take five, ten or twenty years, yet gradually an authoritarian state emerged within the democratic state, and a nucleus of fanatical devotion and ruthless determination formed in a wretched world that lacked basic convictions.

Only one danger could have jeopardised this development – if our adversaries had understood its principle, established a clear understanding of these ideas, and not offered any resistance. Or, alternatively, if they had from the first day annihilated with the utmost brutality the nucleus of our new movement.

Neither was done. The times were such that our adversaries were no longer capable of accomplishing our annihilation, nor did they have the nerve. Arguably, they also lacked the understanding to assume an entirely appropriate stance. Instead, they began to tyrannise our young movement by bourgeois means, and, by doing so, they assisted the process of natural selection in a very fortunate manner. From there on, it was only a question of time until the leadership of the nation would fall to our hardened human material. (…)

The more our adversaries believe they can obstruct our development by employing a degree of terror that is typical of their nature, the more they encourage it. Nietzsche said that a blow which does not kill a strong man only makes him stronger, and his words have been confirmed a thousand times. Every blow strengthens our defiance, all persecution reinforces our single-minded determination, and the elements that do fall are good riddance to the movement.”

I’m not aware what source David Edgar used for his play (and my attempt to contact him elicited no response), but it’s interesting that his variation did not contain the first part of Hitler’s statement – i.e. the notion that the Nazi movement would have remained marginal had it been ignored by its opponents. I say interesting because that was the ‘tactic’ employed, for instance, by Austrian Social Democracy in the face of early fascist assemblies and disturbances in 1919. Evidently, it did not work.

‘Physical force anti-fascists’, on the other hand, like Hitler’s second point for obvious reasons. However, the two have to be read together and in context. Hitler’s ‘advice’ reflects his conviction that battle inspires the fittest warriors to great deeds, that the weak naturally fall by the wayside, and that the thugs always emerge on top. It doesn’t offer any profound strategical or historical insight.

The ‘original’ quote found on countless German leftist websites seems to be a translation of David Edgar’s version into German. It even contains the verb stoppen – an anglicism that Hitler would have scarcely used in a formal speech.

In any case, I would argue that anti-fascists should base their tactics on a concrete assessment of the situation at hand. Naturally, these may involve physical force – but sometimes, completely different tactics may be necessary. What anti-fascists should not do is peddle a dogma based on a bowdlerised Hitler quote.

Ultimately, though, fascism needs to be countered politically – i.e. by fighting for a positive alternative to the capitalist societies that are its breeding ground. Only the demise of the global system of competing nation-states will eliminate their kind for good.

Hitler’s was not the only radical völkisch movement in Germany at the time. Even anti-fascists had succeeded in smashing the nucleus of the NSDAP, they would have still faced a massive cesspit that had formed in the ruins of a failed revolution: the Stahlhelm, the Deutschvölkischer Schutz- und Trutzbund, the Thule Society, the Deutschnationale, the Freikorps units, and many more. For all his self-assurance, the Führer was unaware of how lucky he was to emerge as the main contender.

https://www.snopes.com/fact-check/melania-trump-wear-jacket-visiting-children-separated-families/	"first lady melania trump wore a jacket with ""i don't really care do u?"" emblazoned on the back on her way to visit immigrant kids."	true	['family separation', 'immigrant children', 'melania trump', 'trump administration', 'zara']	2018/06/21	Kim LaCapria	['https://www.cnn.com/2018/06/21/politics/melania-trump-border-visit-immigration/index.html', 'https://www.instyle.com/news/melania-trump-i-really-dont-care-zara-trench']	https://www.cnn.com/2018/06/21/politics/melania-trump-border-visit-immigration/index.html	https://www.cnn.com/	"McAllen, Texas (CNN) First lady Melania Trump touched down in McAllen, Texas, Thursday for a publicly unannounced and hastily planned trip to get a firsthand look at the crisis affecting immigrant families at the US border.

""I want to thank you for your hard work, your compassion and your kindness,"" the first lady said at a roundtable briefing at Upbring New Hope Children's Shelter, with doctors and medical staff, social workers and other experts on hand.

""She wants to see what's real,"" the first lady's spokeswoman Stephanie Grisham told CNN during a news briefing en route to Texas, explaining Trump's decision to visit.

Trump becomes the first member of the President's inner circle to personally witness the situation that has captured the country's attention. Something else that grabbed attention: the jacket the first lady donned as she left Washington.

She wore an olive green jacket, which said on the back: ""I really don't care. Do U?"" in white graffiti-style lettering. Trump was not wearing the jacket when she landed in McAllen.

The $39 jacket is last season Zara.

The first lady's team said there was no hidden meaning behind the sartorial choice.

""It's a jacket. There was no hidden message. After today's important visit to Texas, I hope the media isn't going to choose to focus on her wardrobe,"" Grisham said.

Touring in Texas

The facility opened to the first lady was of course selected keeping in mind press would be accompanying her. Other such facilities around the country have denied access to Democratic lawmakers and media.

While photos and audio from the unfolding crisis on the border have shown tender age children crying for their parents, Trump, CNN and other members of the media were at a facility with children aged 12-17. The portion of the trip designed to show a family processing facility was canceled due to severe flash flooding in the area.

Upbring New Hope Children's Shelter, part of Lutheran Social Services of the South, is a Department of Health and Human services-overseen facility, which operates with the assistance of HHS funding.

Trump was greeted by Upbring CEO Dr. Kurt Senske, who outlined Upbring's five markers of success: safety, life skills, health, education and vocation. The facility opened in 2014 and currently houses 55 children. Of the children -- 27 boys and 28 girls -- approximately 10% arrived in the United States with their families and have since been separated.

Trump, during a roundtable with officials, asked how often the children speak to their families by telephone, how they are emotionally cared for on arrival and on average how long they stay at the facility before being placed elsewhere.

The first lady stopped to visit with children in three separate classrooms during her tour.

""Where are you from?"" she asked several of the kids, along with ""How old are you?"" and ""Have you made friends?""

The children answered, some via a teacher translating from Spanish to English.

The children are ""usually distraught"" when they arrive, Trump was told by officials, but ""when they see the environment, they start relaxing.""

Basic needs are taken care of -- showers, clothing, food, medical care.

""The first 24 hours are crucial,"" a staff member told the first lady.

How children are processed

JUST WATCHED Melania Trump weighs in on immigration Replay More Videos ... MUST WATCH Melania Trump weighs in on immigration 00:59

An administration official briefing the media before the visit said most children at an HHS-funded and regulated facility such as this one remain there for approximately 58 days, receiving medical, dental, vision and psychological care, as well as what the official described as the ability to be inside a ""safe and happy environment.""

The official emphasized the predominant mission at this stage of the process, for unaccompanied children is to place them back with appropriate sponsors. Those sponsors can be their parents, if the parents are not involved in the judicial or criminal process or they can be other approved family members already living inside the United States.

If neither of those options is possible, which is the case in about 10% of the unaccompanied children, they are placed with vetted foster families or volunteers.

All of this information was something the first lady wanted to learn in person, said Grisham, who told the media Trump informed her staff -- and her husband, President Donald Trump -- that she had decided she needed to see for herself the family intake and unaccompanied children facilities.

The facilities have dominated the news for days on end, causing heated political battles from the White House to Capitol Hill, ricocheting around the world in an uproar of disbelief and consternation.

A readout of the trip from the White House on Thursday night included this statement from the first lady:

""Today's visit impacted me greatly. I was very impressed with the center and the hardworking staff and leadership there -- and thank them for all of their hard work. The children were eager to learn and were kind and in good spirits. Spending time with them reinforces the fact that these kids are in this situation as a direct result of adult actions. It is my hope that Members of Congress will finally reach across the aisle and work together to solve this problem with common sense immigration reform that secures our borders and keeps families together.""

How it came together

"" 'I'm headed down to Texas,' "" is what Grisham said the first lady told her husband, and ""he was supportive.""

Grisham confirmed the trip would have taken place whether or not the President had signed an executive order on Wednesday intended to stop the separations.

""This was 100% her idea,"" said Grisham of Trump's decision to travel to McAllen, making clear the first lady is not on a mission assigned by the President nor is she acting as his emissary. ""She wanted to come down.""

The first lady intends to inform the President of what she sees.

""She will continue to update her husband,"" said Grisham, confirming what was reported first Wednesday by CNN, that the first lady had been lobbying the President behind the scenes, encouraging him to stop the separation of children as swiftly as possible, either via legislative process or executive power.

The latter was ultimately the route the President chose, in a stunning reversal of his previous rhetoric.

""As with many topics she will continue to give her husband her opinions,"" Grisham said.

Like most of the country, the first lady has been watching media reports about children taken from their parents and placed in holding facilities.

It is unclear what, exactly, Trump intends to accomplish from this visit to Texas, outside of seeing firsthand what is happening.

Since becoming first lady, Trump has said she wants to champion helping children, yet has been for the most part vague about how exactly she intends to accomplish her goal. In May, Trump unveiled her ""Be Best"" platform, which outlined three predominant avenues of focus: health and well-being; kindness and safety online, and highlighting the effects of the opioid crisis on children and families."

Introduction A lunar eclipse occurs when the Earth comes between the Sun and the Moon and the Earth's shadow passes over the Moon. This phenomenon can be seen by any observer on Earth for whom the Moon is above the horizon. Lunar eclipses occur at the time of a Full Moon, but not every Full Moon, because the Moon has to be near one of the nodes of intersection between its orbit and the ecliptic plane. The Earth umbra is larger than the whole Moon. So, one will observe either a total eclipse by the umbra (which can be well observed), a partial eclipse by the umbra and penumbra, or a total or partial eclipse by the penumbra only, depending on where the centre of the earth's shadow is with respect to the disk of the Moon. The duration of a lunar eclipse is much longer than a solar eclipse, and can take as much as six hours. The Earth umbra is larger than the whole Moon. So, one will observe either a total eclipse by the umbra (which can be well observed), a partial eclipse by the umbra and penumbra, or a total or partial eclipse by the penumbra only, depending on where the centre of the earth's shadow is with respect to the disk of the Moon. The duration of a lunar eclipse is much longer than a solar eclipse, and can take as much as six hours. In practice, the lunar eclipse conditions are modified due to the refraction of the Sun's rays by the Earth's atmosphere. This refraction (of 35 minutes of arc) allows some light to penetrate the cone of the geometric umbra. So even during total lunar eclipse, the lunar disk is not completely dark. This grazing light is more absorbed by the Earth's atmosphere in the blue and yellow portions of the spectrum, giving a particular reddish light during total lunar eclipse. Next article: Science of Eclipses >

Science of Eclipses The study of the Earth's shadow projected on the Moon allows us to deduce that the Earth is spherical. The Ancient Greeks worked this out. Using lunar eclipse timing, as far back as 3rd century BC Aristarchus from Samos estimated the lunar diameter. Using Eratosthene's previous measurement of the Earth's diameter, he deduced the Earth-Moon distance. Hipparcos (150 BC) and Ptolemeus (2nd century AD) improved with impressive precision the measurements of the lunar diameter and Earth-Moon distance. In the 17th century, in order to improve longitude determination, absolute cartography made use of lunar eclipse phenomena, which were observable simultaneously from different points. Today, during lunar eclipses, laser ranging measurements can be made with great accuracy using reflectors placed on the Moon during the Apollo and Lunakhod missions. This has allowed more precise measurement of lunar acceleration and the slow down in the Earth's rotation. Analysis of the refracted light of the Earth's atmosphere during lunar eclipses has also made it possible to show that atmospheric ozone is confined to a layer between 50 and 80 km above the Earth's surface. < Previous article: Introduction Next article: Eclipse Conditions >"	ESA Science & Technology - Lunar Eclipse Overview		[]	['technology', 'earths', 'esa', 'science', 'overview', 'earth', 'eclipses', 'shadow', 'moon', 'penumbra', 'lunar', 'total', 'eclipse', 'umbra']	"Lunar Eclipse OverviewIntroduction A lunar eclipse occurs when the Earth comes between the Sun and the Moon and the Earth's shadow passes over the Moon.

The latest PR coup for Pope Francis has seen him hire famous and revered children’s author JK Rowling to rewrite the Bible.

It is hoped the author, most famous for her Harry Potter series, can make it more accessible and believable for a new generation of Catholics and Christians.

While the specifics of the rewrite are not yet known, it is believed Rowling is tasked with producing a compelling tale that young Catholics and Christians can engage with. Figures such as Dementors and other popular creations may take the place of less realistic Biblical creatures such as unicorns and the leviathon.

“We are very happy Miss Rowling has agreed to the rewrite, we keenly await the first draft,” a Vatican insider told WWN.

Rowling’s selection has raised some eyebrows, but the decision by Pope Francis to select the wildly popular author is mainly due to commercial concerns.

“The sales of the Jesus Christ action figure have dropped by over 200% in the last 10 years, we are in need of new, compelling and toy-friendly characters…like the dinosaur in Toy Story,” a source close to the Pope told WWN.

“Our revenue streams are shrinking so the more Hollywood-esque the better,” the source concluded.

Rowling has thus far remained tight lipped on her vision for the Bible and its merry band of characters, but a number of Hollywood producers are in discussions to turn it into a movie.

In the last century, many Christian leaders have offered revisions on the interpretations of many of the Bible’s passages, but Rowling is expected to take a more drastic approach.

“Judas is probably going to wear a leather jacket and JK is toying with the idea of a nervous twitch or even an eye-patch. Also, why have one book when can have more? She is thinking of splitting it up into 9, maybe 10 books” the author’s publicist shared with WWN."

This is the grand finale. I really want to stick it to Steven one last time. And I wanted to make sure he was going to have plenty of time to contemplate what has happened to him and why.And he’ll have the time while on hold, waiting for countless automated services and operators… See, the first thing I did was cancel all his credit cards by calling in and saying they were stolen. Same with his cell phone. Same with his online DVD membership. Same with his gym membership. I went online and changed the password to our bank account and changed the pin number to our ATM cards. I canceled Steven’s car insurance and reported his car stolen. I put an ad in a newspaper with Steven’s work phone, saying he had a fabulous 750 square foot studio apartment in Soho available for a steal--$300/month and to call him 24/7—can only imagine the message overflow! I made sure the post office will now forward all of Steve’s mail to an old folk’s home. And I signed him up for dozens of magazine subscriptions, such as “Guns and Ammo,” “Girls and Corpses,” “Creative Knitting” and “Boy’s Life,” to be sent to his office and I checked the “bill me later” box.These past 14 days, I’ve done everything to make Steven’s life a living hell. It’s definitely been cathartic but I also realize I haven’t had much time to simply work all of this out in my own mind. To really absorb what’s happened to me. So I’m sure I’ll still be sad sometimes. But at least I’ll know I never took it sitting down.I want to thank all of you for your support during my campaign against a cheating husband. It’s been an emotional rollercoaster and I’m just trying to make the best of it. So often, people are hurt by the infidelity of a loved one, and there’s no easy way to mend that pain. The last two weeks was only meant to embolden those betrayed to speak out, stand up for themselves, and find the strength and self-confidence to move on.I hope this blog helps anyone who’s ever been hurt, humiliated or scorned. Helps anyone who has invested feelings in someone and then had them turned upside down and inside out. Hopefully, through my campaign, there are people who now better understand how much pain, anguish and grief is involved when you decide to hurt someone by being unfaithful. Also, if you think someone is cheating on you, I definitely recommend the private investigator my brother used, Vinny Parco from Intercontinental Investigations. He’s a real straight shooter – he showed me what I needed to know but he did it with real sensitivity and compassion. I think he has a show on Court TV. But no matter how you found out, I hope that those who have been hurt can at least live vicariously through me.I’m signing off for now… but one final word: next time you’re tempted to cheat, think once, twice or however many times it takes – and if you need to, think of that girl Emily.

WASHINGTON, DC – A senior U.S. general has confirmed that the military has secretly drawn up plans to round up large numbers of privately-owned firearms from American gun owners.

Gen. James M. Scott of the U.S. Air Force confirmed that the Pentagon received a series of formal directives from the White House between November 7 and December 13 to begin plans for a massive nationwide operation to confiscate guns using a series of federal databases compiled over the last few decades.

Scott spoke with Duffel Blog reporters in a parking garage in northern Virginia.

Scott also confirmed that a certain four-star general who heads the U.S. Transportation Command was intimately involved in the planning. General Scott would not reveal the general’s name out of concerns for his safety.

The plan, known in the military as Operation PREAKNESS, combines a series of tactics developed for house sweeps and room clearing in Iraq and Afghanistan, which Scott admitted had been used as test-runs for the U.S.

“If we can confiscate millions of firearms in a country where we don’t speak the language or understand the culture, the U.S. should be easy,” Scott told Duffel Blog. “I just feel sorry for that poor Osama fellow we had to kill to justify the whole thing.”

According to Scott, the actual planning for Operation PREAKNESS was initiated in early 2009 and developed in conjunction with the United Nations, Senator Dianne Feinstein, and several other liberal organizations such as the National Organization for Women, Planned Parenthood, Greenpeace, the American Federation of Labor, and the National Rifle Association, which is apparently a front for all the previous groups.

While there was initially some concern about the constitutionality of using the military on American soil, page 2131 of the ObamaCare Act actually amends the Posse Comitatus law to allow the military to disarm private citizens at the direction of the Secretary of Homeland Security. Objections by then-CIA Director David Petraeus were quietly silenced in November.

A test-run for PREAKNESS was actually conducted in early December in Clinger, Pennsylvania. A joint platoon of Army Rangers and UN Peacekeepers, working with select state and local officials and using imagery collected by the Google Street View Car, quietly went door-to-door and managed to collect all the firearms from Clinger owners.

The few owners who did complain were initially transported to Fort Leavenworth in Kansas to explain their case before a special international tribunal, before being sent to the National Center For Gun Control in Guantanamo Bay, Cuba.

A follow-on operation using just the UN Peacekeepers is planned later this week for any owners missed in the previous sweep, although the Peacekeepers have confirmed they will be using a post office truck to infiltrate the area."

MILWAUKEE, Wisconsin (CNN) -- As the nation mourns the tragedy of the space shuttle Columbia, the families of the seven astronauts who were killed struggle with their losses and remember their loved ones. Daniel Salton, the brother of astronaut Laurel Clark, shared memories of his sister with CNN Anchor Paula Zahn Sunday.

ZAHN: I know you were tracking your sister's return yesterday. And as I understand it, it was many minutes before you truly understood what was going on.

SALTON: Yes. It was -- I had no idea that -- I had not watched the landing. I did not realize that, when they lost communication, that wasn't normal. When it went on for a long time I just thought that they were in some kind of blackout zone. And it took me a good 10 minutes to finally realize what had happened, and it was a shock. I couldn't believe it.

ZAHN: I don't think anybody in the country could believe it. Where were you?

SALTON: I was here in my house. I was sitting in my computer room on the computer. And so I was running between -- after a few minutes I was trying to check the TV and the computer and just trying to figure out what was going on.

ZAHN: I understand the computer was a bit of a lifeline between you and your sister, and she fired off an e-mail to you a couple of days ago. Can you share with us what she was trying to tell you?

SALTON: It was an e-mail to all of her family. ... It was a very special e-mail for us because it was the last real communication we had directly from her. And she just talked about how thrilled she was to be up there, the view from up there, how great it was seeing different sites, being able to see on her very first day Wind Point in Wisconsin, which is where Racine is, and seeing something familiar there. Also different places around the world.

And then getting into how blessed she felt to be serving her country and getting to do the medical experiments, working with scientists around the world and how thrilling it was. And really helping to share with us a little bit of what she was going through ... what it was like to eat in space and how she was acclimating to it, and that she was having fun. And I think it was -- it was great to get that at the end.

ZAHN: How passionate was she about the science that was being done on this mission?

SALTON: Well, any time you talk to her actually it's what you ended up talking about usually. It's what she wanted to talk about. It's what she really cared for.

She was -- being a medical doctor, I think it's what she really got out, and what she was excited about the space program is what they were able to do in the microgravity research. And she was very into it and loved to talk about it. So I think she was very excited about it.

ZAHN: Were you part of any calls the president made to members of the family affected by this tragedy?

SALTON: I think that the president called the people who were down in Houston. I had -- my sister Lynn was in Houston and my brother-in-law John Clark and Ian were there, of course. And he talked to them. So we are heading to -- I'm sorry. They were in Florida at Kennedy Space Center in Florida. And I think that's where he talked to them.

We are heading to Houston after this. Well, sometime in the next day or two, where we're going to be with family and hopefully there will be a memorial service. I think there's a plan to having a memorial service there that we plan on attending.

ZAHN: I know you mentioned your sister's husband. Without violating your privacy, are you able to share with us anything this morning about how your sister's 8-year-old son is doing and her husband?

SALTON: Well, we're very thankful that one of his brothers, Dave Clark, was able to get down to Houston. And my brother John Salton, was able to get down there to Houston last night to help out. And so they're there now and helping out any way they can. And we'll be hearing from them later as to what the plans are, when the rest of us should come down and how it will all work. And I'm just thankful that they were able to get there.

ZAHN: You've said so much this morning about what drove your sister to the excellence that she accomplished in her life. Just a final thought on what else you want people in America to know about the sacrifice she made and how serious she was about serving her country.

SALTON: Well, Laurel was a very intense person who would set goals and would go for them. And I think that that's a great role model for kids today, to know that the goal-oriented stuff that they talk about, that the counselors at school tell you about, it works. It gets you places. You can do great things for humanity if you just set some small goals and always go for the next thing and set your sights higher.

When you reach that goal, go for the next thing. And that's what she did. And we're all very proud for what she was able to do. And we certainly all hope that NASA keeps going and continues on with its research. I think it's very important for humanity to keep this going."

It’s not a political statement and I didn’t do this because someone dared me to do it. Just don’t like Facebook. Gives me the willies. Sorry. — Elon Musk (@elonmusk) March 24, 2018

Today, Musk announced that he has reached out to Facebook and offered to buy every share of the company, effectively making him the sole owner of the social media platform. Musk was speaking to a gathering of SpaceX and Tesla investors and told the group even though he has deep misgivings about the site, he’d “do humanity a favor” and buy it.

“I’ve got some cash to burn, so if Zuck wants to make a deal, he knows where to find me,” Musk told investors. “I’d make him a fair offer.”

Musk then showed a PowerPoint presentation that detailed in great length what his plan for Facebook would be.

“You know, when I told some close confidantes about this idea of mine, they all wanted to know what I’d do with Facebook,” Musk explained. “And as much as I know people like to use it as the Internet’s premier ex-girlfriend or boyfriend stalking platform, I think I have much better solution, and I mean better for the species, if not our entire planet.”

Musk showed the investors in the room an animated video that detailed his plans for Facebook. The video shows a SpaceX Falcon rocket blasting off into the sky. At one point the two solid boosters fall off and glide on a precise path down to the landing pad. Both rockets land perfectly square, and one ends up resting gently on a big red button labeled “DELETE.”

“And you can see that the second side booster would end up pressing the delete button,” Musk said. “Which would send a proton torpedo down the exhaust port of Facebook’s headquarters, triggering a chain reaction that should destroy the platform.”



Cheers erupted in the room. Chants of “Fuck Zuck! Fuck Zuck! Fuck Zuck!” reverberated throughout the building, growing so loud it drowned out the sound of the ocean’s waves at every beach on the planet. Musk stepped away from the podium he was speaking from, raised his arms in the air in triumph, and took in the adulation from everyone in the room.

They pretend to be patriotic Americans, but immediately turn on their own the moment they don’t get their way.

REAL patriots love this country no matter what, and will always work to make it better.

Grammy-nominated recording artist Lana Del Rey is not a real patriot.

Sure, she’s featured the American flag as a backdrop to many of her concerts in the past.

But because her candidate didn’t win the last presidential election, she’s now banning the Stars and Stripes.

The 32-year-old model-turned-singer told Pitchfork that she feels “uncomfortable” and “less safe” as an American living under President Trump.

As for using the American flag at her concerts:

“I definitely changed my visuals on my tour videos. I’m not going to have the American flag waving while I’m singing ‘Born to Die.’ It’s not going to happen.

“I’d rather have static.

“I feel less safe than I did when Obama was president.”

I say, if she’s going to boycott the flag, we BOYCOTT HER!

Rick was born in 1962 to Dick and Judy Hoyt. As a result of oxygen deprivation to Rick’s brain at the time of his birth, Rick was diagnosed as a spastic quadriplegic with cerebral palsy. Dick and Judy were advised to institutionalize Rick because there was no chance of him recovering, and little hope for Rick to live a “normal” life. This was just the beginning of Dick and Judy’s quest for Rick’s inclusion in community, sports, education and one day, the workplace.







Dick and Judy soon realized that though Rick couldn’t walk or speak; he was quite astute and his eyes would follow them around the room. They fought to integrate Rick into the public school system, pushing administrators to see beyond Rick’s physical limitations. Dick and Judy would take Rick sledding and swimming, and even taught him the alphabet and basic words, like any other child. After providing concrete evidence of Rick’s intellect and ability to learn like everyone else, Dick and Judy needed to find a way to help Rick communicate for himself.







With $5,000 in 1972 and a skilled group of engineers at Tufts University, an interactive computer was built for Rick. This computer consisted of a cursor being used to highlight every letter of the alphabet. Once the letter Rick wanted was highlighted, he was able to select it by just a simple tap with his head against a head piece attached to his wheelchair. When the computer was originally first brought home, Rick surprised everyone with his first words. Instead of saying, “Hi, Mom,” or “Hi, Dad,” Rick’s first “spoken” words were: “Go, Bruins!” The Boston Bruins were in the Stanley Cup finals that season. It was clear from that moment on, that Rick loved sports and followed the game just like anyone else.







In 1975, at the age of 13, Rick was finally admitted into public school. After high school, Rick attended Boston University, and he graduated with a degree in Special Education in 1993. Dick retired in 1995 as a Lt. Colonel from the Air National Guard, after serving his country for 37 years.







The Beginning of Team Hoyt







In the spring of 1977, Rick told his father that he wanted to participate in a 5-mile benefit run for a Lacrosse player who had been paralyzed in an accident. Far from being a long-distance runner, Dick agreed to push Rick in his wheelchair and they finished all 5 miles, coming in next to last. That night, Rick told his father, “Dad, when I’m running, it feels like I’m not handicapped.”







This realization was just the beginning of what would become over 1,000 races completed, including marathons, duathlons and triathlons (6 of them being Ironman competitions). Also adding to their list of achievements, Dick and Rick biked and ran across the U.S. in 1992, completing a full 3,735 miles in 45 days.







In a triathlon, Dick will pull Rick in a boat with a bungee cord attached to a vest around his waist and to the front of the boat for the swimming stage. For the biking stage, Rick will ride a special two-seater bicycle, and then Dick will push Rick in his custom made running chair (for the running stage).







Rick was once asked, if he could give his father one thing, what would it be? Rick responded, “The thing I’d most like is for my dad to sit in the chair and I would push him for once.”







The 2009 Boston Marathon was officially Team Hoyt’s 1000th race. Rick always says if it comes down to doing one race a year he would like it to be the Boston Marathon: his favorite race.







2013 was going to be Dick and Rick's last Boston Marathon together, but they were not able to finish due to the bombings. They vowed to be back in 2014 to finish ""Boston Strong"" with all the other runners, which they did; stopping many times along the 26.2 distance to take photos and shake hands of the many well wishers, and finishing with several of the runners from their Hoyt Foundation Boston Marathon team.

PRESIDENT-elect Donald Trump continues to fill out his cabinet more and more each day, and today he has picked someone he feels is the perfect candidate for Secretary for Women’s Rights; comedian and TV star Bill Cosby.

“I get confused, hiring men as secretaries” tweeted Trump, in a rare moment of honesty.

“But when I do, I just pick the best people. Really. Ask anyone. Just the best people. So when I was told that I would have to elect someone that would handle all the matters relating to women and women’s rights in this country, I immediately knew there was one man for the job, Cliff Huxtable himself”.

Trump, who has come under fire for hiring controversial far-right Breitbart News executive chair Steve Bannon as his chief strategist and for considering renowned creationist Jerry Falwell Jr as his Secretary of Education, is adamant that Cosby will be ideal for the position despite his recent run-ins with the law.

The head of the enormous – and deadly – Sinaloa Cartel issued the threat via his son as he’s currently in hiding from Mexican authorities after escaping from jail earlier this year.

The message was sent via encrypted email to ISIS leader Abu Bakr al Baghdadi, but details were leaked to a Mexican blogger who has close ties with Sinaloa cartel members.

The Sinaloa Cartel, The Revolutionary Armed Forces of Colombia (FARC) and Los Zetas are the three main cartels moving drugs across Mexico and the rest of the world. Recently, all three had expanded their operations to the Middle East, where demand for party drugs like cocaine and MDMA has grown among oil rich princes and businessman.

But the rise of the Muslim fundamentalist organisation known as Islamic State has seen many shipments destroyed by ISIS fighters. It seems that drugs don’t form part of their notion of the idealized Muslim State.

Extracts leaked from the email read as follows:

“You [ISIS] are not soldiers. You are nothing but lowly p*ssies. Your god cannot save you from the true terror that my men will levy at you if you continue to impact my operation.”

“My men will destroy you. The world is not yours to dictate. I pity the next son of a wh*re that tries to interfere with the business of the Sinaloa Cartel. I will have their heart and tongue torn from them.”

El Chapo’s organization join a long list of criminal enterprises to declare hostility towards ISIL. We told you recently how the mafia had threatened ISIS. And even LA gangs the Bloods and Crips have united to fight ISIS.

Your move, ISIS…

New York City, the most pro-abortion city of America, just placed a giant image of Satan on the Empire State Building, in order to convince people to worship and revere “Mother Nature,” which is really just a deceptive way of getting people to worship the devil. The image is specifically that of the Hindu goddess Kali, who is no different than Satan, for “the things which the Gentiles sacrifice, they sacrifice to devils, and not to God” (1 Corinthians 10:20). Here is the image:

According to one report:

Artist Android Jones designed the fierce portrait of Kali, who is the Goddess of Time, Change, Power and Destruction, to make the point that Mother Nature now more than ever needs a fierce avatar to fight the dangers of pollution and extinction.

Kali is a demonic demon, who compels her followers to commit mass murder. Just to demonstrate this to you (especially for those who think that Hinduism is a religion of peace), in 19th century India there was a cult dedicated to the worship of Kali, called the Thugees. The film, Indiana Jones and the Temple of Doom, portrays the Thugee cult as a murderous group that commits human sacrifice:

The reality is that there was indeed a Thugee cult in India and they did commit mass human sacrifice by the millions, but not by putting people in lava, rather they would strangle their victims to death. According to the Guinness Book of Records the Thuggee cult was responsible for approximately 2,000,000 deaths. Two million people! This is a major holocaust and it was done by Hindus for the cause of Kali, the very satanic demon whose face is on the Empire State Building. America is making itself as an offering to the devil, and do not think for a second that God is not angry. For “The foolish shall not stand in thy sight: thou hatest all workers of iniquity.” (Psalm 5:5)

Now lets compare now to 1950s America. Here is a photo (thank you Fabio Emozione) of Christian crosses upon the buildings, including the Empire State Building, of New York City:

For too long Christianity has been watered down in our modern day as a pacifist faith with no inclination of fighting evil. But is the Church here to be weak and useless? This shocking and riveting two disk DVD set lecture series, passionately shows how Christianity is not here to be feeble, but for warfare, to be militant against tyranny and the forces of darkness.

You will not be dissatisfied after watching this lecture, and Bible studies will forevermore never be the same again.

Woman Buried Alive, Funeral Goers Hear Screams From The Grave – A 34 year old woman in now recovering from a most bizarre scene, one you only hear about in the movies.

A Chicago family was grieving the loss of their son, as they said their final goodbye’s at his funeral. Police say it was unlike anything they had ever seen before. Reports say that approximately 15 minutes after the body of the man was laid to rest, the family of the deceased began to hear screams.

“We decided to stay for a bit after the funeral, to let it all sink in. When all of a sudden we heard screams, but we could not figure out where they were coming from,” said one family member who wished to stay anonymous. “We realized it was coming from under the grave where we just laid my brother. We ran and got help.”

Police say when firefighters arrived, they received permission from the family to dig up the freshly dug grave. As they did, the screams became louder and louder.

When they reached the coffin, they pried it open, to find 34 year old Linda Lynch inside.

Police say it was a twisted plot. The coffin of the man, who was supposed to be buried, was wheeled to the back and his body was quickly removed after the service by the funeral director, Harold Lynch, at Thomas Hite Funeral Home, who had attempted to murder his 34 year old estranged wife.

Lynch had drugged his wife with arsenic and hid her in the funeral home, perfectly timing it with the scheduled burial. The young man who was scheduled to be buried was found wrapped in a blanket in the funeral home basement.

Lynch’s wife is currently hospitalized in stable condition undergoing an intense detoxification process. Lynch is being held on a $200,000 bond and faces attempted murder charges. The Chicago family has properly buried their son.

SPF bicentennial, the Police march “Polis Repablik Singapura March” has been updated with new lyrics and is now known as the “Singapore Police Force March”. The lyrics of the SPF March is written by Dr Norshahril Saat who served his national service with the SPF. The SPF March was first played at the Graduation Parade at Home Team Academy on 18 January 2020. The Singapore Police Force March has retained the melody of the PRS March as a tribute to its rich heritage and unifying qualities. The revised lyrics reflect the SPF’s contemporary needs and challenges, and embody the Police core values and the vision. The march serves to remind officers why they serve and what the SPF stands for. The march is played at police ceremonial events and sang by trainees during their training, which aims to create a sense of belonging, instil pride and promote the Police core values. The lyrics to the SPF March are inspired by SPF’s vision: A Force for the Nation – To make Singapore the safest place in the world. The first two verses reflect the Force’s core values of courage, loyalty, integrity and fairness, and how these values have strengthened the Force’s mission to prevent, deter and detect crime. Verse 3 demonstrates officers’ sense of duty towards Singapore and the Force as well as their enduring commitment towards the Force’s vision of making Singapore the safest place in the world. The chorus underscores the strong teamwork and camaraderie amongst officers and the importance of unity among officers in our policing mission, thus the phrase “let us close our ranks”. ---- History of the Polis Repablik Singapura March The Polis Repablik Singapura (PRS) March was composed as a ceremonial song to be played at all Police parades and at the National Day Parade, to represent the Force’s history and traditions and uplift the morale of officers. The march was composed by our first local Director of Music, Inspector Ridzwan Salmy Bin Mulok, after Singapore gained independence in 1965. It has remained the official Police march ever since.

The incident marks a serious escalation in the tensions that have roiled Tijuana in recent weeks as thousands of migrants from Central America have amassed there with hopes for entering the United States. President Trump has vowed to seal off the Mexican border in recent days and pushed to keep any migrants in Mexico as they await the immigration process.

Border Patrol officials said they used the tear gas after migrants threw objects at them. The gas was used to “dispel the group because of the risk to agents’ safety. Several agents were hit by the projectiles,” the agency said in a statement.

The dramatic images of the clash were already being used by the various sides of the immigration debate. Backers of Trump’s crackdown said the events showed the need to secure the border, while some critics said they were disturbed to see tear gas used on the group, which included some children.

As Mexican authorities tried to move the migrants away from the border, gridlock was occurring at what is one of the world’s busiest international crossings.

U.S. Customs and Border Protection closed northbound and southbound access, as well as pedestrian access, to the port of entry around 11:30 a.m. Sunday. At 3:45 p.m., authorities reopened pedestrian access. By 6 p.m., all northbound and southbound vehicle crossings were opened.

Extra Border Patrol personnel were deployed to the San Ysidro port on Sunday “in preparation for multiple planned demonstrations on both side of the border,” according to a statement from U.S. Customs and Border Protection on Sunday afternoon.

“As the demonstrations on the Mexican side reached the border area, some members of the demonstration split off to head toward multiple locations along the border,” the statement read. “Some attempted to illegally enter the U.S. through both the northbound and southbound vehicles lanes at the port of entry itself. Those persons were stopped and turned back to Mexico.”

The port was closed “to prepare for the possibility that additional groups would also break off from demonstrations for a possible attempt or attempts to rush illegally through the port of entry,” according to the statement.

The move came as hundreds of Central American migrants who have been gathering in Tijuana pushed past a blockade of Mexican police standing guard and rushed toward the border.

The migrants carried hand-painted American and Honduran flags and chanted: “We are not criminals! We are international workers!”

A small clash occurred late in the morning when migrants tried to run around Mexican federal police, leaving one officer with a cut on his lip.

A helicopter circled overhead when a small group of men and teenage boys ran past Mexican police to a small hole in the border fence.

U.S. authorities appeared to deploy tear gas and a flash bang, which makes a loud noise but does not fire a projectile, at a group of people who were trying to get through a section of the border fence.

Some at the fence could be seen throwing rocks.

At one point before noon, Border Patrol authorities fired what appeared to be a flash bang and launched tear gas at a group of people trying to make their way through a fence. Some mothers ran under a train, clutching their crying children. Photos from the scene showed children in the area where the tear gas landed.

Shortly after noon, the skirmishes appeared to be calming down. A woman used a bullhorn to spoke through the fence to U.S. Border Patrol agents, trying to persuade them to let in migrants.

“We don’t want war, we don’t want killing,” she said across the line. In response, Mexican federal police in riot gear pushed people away from the fence.

At least three helicopters circled the area. Traffic was backed up along Interstate 805 into National City and Bonita.

Around 1:30 p.m., a large Homeland Security bus was ushered past the border barricade.

The additional personnel at the border included Customs and Border Protection officers, U.S. Border Patrol agents and Air and Marine agents recently sent to the region.

San Diego police also readied on-duty officers Sunday afternoon to respond to the border division if needed.

None of the migrants managed to cross the border into the U.S.

More than 4,700 Central Americans have been living crammed together in a Tijuana sports complex.

State authorities say by the time it is over, as many as 9,000 Central Americans will have arrived in Tijuana with the hope of crossing to the United States.

Many of them are from Honduras, a country beset by violence and poverty, and came with the intention of seeking asylum in the United States.

U.S. Secretary of Homeland Security Kirstjen Nielsen said in a statement the department “will not tolerate this type of lawlessness and will not hesitate to shut down ports of entry for security and public safety reasons. We will also seek to prosecute to the fullest extent of the law anyone who destroys federal property, endangers our front-line operators, or violates our nation’s sovereignty.” Homeland security will maintain “a robust presence” along the border and continued “close contact with Mexican authorities,” according to the statement.

The Coalition for Humane Immigrant Rights, CHIRLA, an immigrant rights organization in California, condemned the use of tear gas against immigrants at the border.

“It is a despicable act on the part of the Trump administration and CBP officials to attack defenseless women and children firing tear gas, a chemical agent, at them,” Angelica Salas, executive director for the organization, said in a statement. “These are human beings who are reaching a point of desperation because their asylum claims are being processed at a snail’s pace or not at all.”

On Sunday morning, before the border closed, President Trump used his presidential Twitter account to blame Democrats for allowing border crossings, and suggested that Mexico and “originating countries” should prevent caravans from reaching the border, or forming at all. Such caravans, he wrote, are “a way they get certain people out of their country and dump in U.S. No longer.”

Less than 24 hours earlier, Trump had reiterated threats on Twitter to close the southern border — threats that have alarmed many in Mexico, since cross-border trade is a mainstay of the Mexican economy.

In his tweet, Trump also said migrants would not be allowed into the United States “until their claims are individually approved in court.”

Others would “stay in Mexico,” he added, without elaboration.

Would be very SMART if Mexico would stop the Caravans long before they get to our Southern Border, or if originating countries would not let them form (it is a way they get certain people out of their country and dump in U.S. No longer). Dems created this problem. No crossings! — Donald J. Trump (@realDonaldTrump) November 25, 2018

....All will stay in Mexico. If for any reason it becomes necessary, we will CLOSE our Southern Border. There is no way that the United States will, after decades of abuse, put up with this costly and dangerous situation anymore! — Donald J. Trump (@realDonaldTrump) November 24, 2018

Mexico’s incoming leadership denied a report that it had agreed to a Trump administration proposal requiring asylum seekers arriving at the southwest border to wait in Mexico as U.S. authorities consider their claims for safe haven.

The Washington Post reported Saturday that Trump had won the support of the government of Mexican President-elect Andres Manuel Lopez Obrador — who takes office on Dec. 1 — for a plan mandating that asylum seekers at the border remain in Mexico as their claims move through the U.S. immigration system.

Later Saturday, however, Olga Sanchez Cordero, Mexico’s interior minister-designate, denied that Mexico had agreed to host people seeking U.S. asylum as their cases awaited judgment.

“There is no agreement of any sort between the future Mexican federal government and the U.S.,” the incoming interior minister said in a statement.

Sunday’s confrontation became become a part of the national immigration debate. Trump’s weekend tweets, as well as the border incident, quickly elicited responses from Washington Democrats on weekend talk shows.

Sen. Amy Klobuchar (D-Minn.) interviewed on ABC’s “This Week,” was dismissive of the president’s efforts to blame Democrats for the failure to enact comprehensive immigration reform, saying Trump himself had “gut-punched” such efforts.

Klobuchar said the Trump administration “should have been working with these Central American countries a long time ago” to curb mass flight from violence and poverty.

Rep. Elijah Cummings (D-Md.), the incoming chairman of the House Oversight Committee, said on NBC’s “Meet the Press” that he does not support a potential deal where asylum-seekers coming through Mexico would stay in Mexico until their court date in the United States.

“That’s not the law,” he said. “They should be allowed to come in, seek asylum, that’s the law.”

Others said Sunday’s event support Trump’s policies.

“This makes the president’s point: That these are people who are willing to not just defy immigration law in an abstract sense — crossing a border where nobody is looking — but actually rush the border in the full light of day,” said Mark Krikorian, executive director of the Center for Immigration Studies.

Critics said they were troubled that federal authorities would use tear gas against mothers and children seeking asylum.

“What we saw at the San Ysidro border crossing should horrify the whole country; it was simply inhumane,” said Cristóbal J. Alex, president of Latino Victory Fund. “His administration has gone from locking children in cages to firing tear gas at toddlers and mothers. These families have the right to seek asylum in the United States. Denying them entry makes a mockery of our American values.”

Times staff reporters Patrick McDonnell, Laura King, Alene Tchekmedyian and Ruben Vives, correspondent Cecilia Sanchez, and San Diego Union-Tribune writers Kate Morrissey and Lyndsay Winkley contributed to this report.

Tim Horton spokesman James Dyke said that he had no explanation for the unexpected hike in demand for goods offered by the popular coffee shop franchise but that some had suggested it could be linked to the recent legalization of cannabis.

“Several of the stores which experienced abnormally high demand are in fact located near places where cannabis is legally sold,” he told reporters.

“It was like a mob of zombies. I even saw one man steal another client’s box of donuts and run out of the store with it,” one employee told reporters, visibly amused.

Tim Horton’s head office in Oakville has also sent emails to its franchisees warning them of possible flour shortages in the upcoming weeks due to the unexpected hike in demand.

The head office also suggested hiring more staff at certain high traffic locations and even suggested posting security guards at highly crowded intersections in areas such as Toronto, Vancouver, and Montreal.

U.S. Customs and Border Protection has used 2-chlorobenzylidene malononitrile, or CS, since 2010, and deployed it 26 times in fiscal 2012 and 27 times in 2013. The use dropped after that, but was still deployed three times in 2016, Mr. Obama’s final full year in office.

Use of CS rose again in fiscal 2017, which was split between Mr. Obama and Mr. Trump, and reached 29 deployments in fiscal 2018, which ended two months ago, according to CBP data seen by The Washington Times.

Border authorities also use another agent, pepper spray, frequently — including a decade-high record of 151 instances in 2013, also under Mr. Obama. Pepper spray, officially known as Pava Capsaicin, was used 43 times in fiscal year 2018, according to the CBP numbers.

The data poses a challenge to the current anger over the Border Patrol’s use of tear gas Sunday to prevent a mob from busting through sections of old border fence in California.

Critics, including Latin American leaders, immigrant-rights advocates and congressional Democrats, have said use of tear gas is “un-American.”

“It’s horrifying to see tear gas used on mothers and young children as they seek refuge in the United States. That’s not what America should be,” said Sen. Dianne Feinstein, California Democrat.

Other Democrats complained about threats of “deadly force” against the border incursions, which saw migrants punch through fencing, and launch rocks and bottles at agents who responded to stem the intrusion.

Brandon Judd, president of the National Border Patrol Council, took umbrage at the outrage, questioning where the critics were when tear gas was deployed under Mr. Obama.

“This policy that we use was an Obama-written policy and it was used in 2013 at the same port of entry,” he told CNN, wondering in particular about the intense media interest now versus then.

“The facts are, the policy written under President Obama allows us to use tear gas to disperse a crowd that was very dangerous,” he told the network.

Host Erin Burnett scoffed at Mr. Judd’s facts, saying the agents were using tear gas against women and children this weekend.

“The tear gas was not deployed at the children,” Mr. Judd countered, saying migrants were attempting to use them as human shields.

Some 9,000 members of the migrant caravans are camped in Baja California along the U.S.-Mexico border, plotting their attempts to enter the U.S., according to Mexican press accounts.

Mexican authorities have said 500 migrants were involved in the attempts to storm the border. Some U.S. officials have put the number higher.

Mexico said it has deported 98 caravan members it has identified as part of the violence and chaos.

According to witnesses at the Central High School, Dorothy Fransen was furious after one of her students, 17-year old Jeremy Dunlop, kept interrupting her class and making jokes about her physical appearance.

She reportedly tackled the young man and held him on the ground while stapling his lips more than 45 times.

Amanda Jones, one of the victim’s classmates who witnessed the whole incident, says that the teacher “completely lost it” after the young man made a joke about her weight.

“She was just enraged! She yelled ‘This will shut you up, you little fucker!’ and just jumped on him. She held him down and then she began stapling his lips over and over again.”

Another witness, Justin Reynolds, says he tried to help his classmate, but was kicked by the infuriated teacher.

“I tried to pull her off Jeremy and the first time she violently pushed me away. When I tried again, she kicked me in the guts with her high heels.”

Fortunately, two officers of the Springfield Missouri Police Department were already on the site and Ms Fransen was arrested less than five minutes after the beginning of the assault.

Ms Fransen now faces a total of 21 criminal charges, including 5 charges of aggravated assault, and could now face up to 110 years in jail.

Her lawyer, Robert Monroe, says that her violent reaction was due to the fact that she was being harassed by Mr Dunlop on a regular basis.

Mr Monroe claims that Ms Fransen is in fact the victim in this story, and that she “temporarily lost contact with reality” as a result of the harassment.

She is expected to appear in court in May, but her lawyer has already announced that she would plea “not guilty”."

ATLANTA, GA—While Empire actor Jussie Smollett has been having a tough week so far, there appears to be a silver lining: cable news channel CNN has offered Smollett a job as an investigative reporter and on-air anchor after witnessing his skills at fabricating a story entirely out of thin air.

CNN producers were reportedly impressed throughout the ongoing saga of Smollett's apparent hoax attack on himself. They realized early on the facts didn't add up but were fascinated with how well the actor kept the narrative going. An HR rep quickly reached out to Smollett to see if he'd be interested in taking on a position at the news organization after news broke that the entire thing was probably fabricated.

""Smollett has exactly the kind of skills we look for at our fine organization,"" said CNN correspondent Brian Stelter. ""He picked a narrative, made up all the relevant facts and details, and stuck with his story in spite of glaring holes in the plot. It's hard to find people who understand our core values here at CNN, but Smollett seems to be just the guy for us.""

The actor has accepted the offer and is now undergoing training to learn how to weave even more intricate narratives ex nihilo, according to insiders.

The law, signed by Republican Gov. Doug Burgum in 2017, had been blocked by a U.S. District Court which found it to be discriminatory towards the state's Native American population. The Eighth Circuit overturned that ruling, and the Supreme Court upheld the circuit court's decision, with only Justices Ruth Bader Ginsburg and Elena Kagan dissenting. The two noted in their dissent that this ruling was confusing because voters who used their identification to vote in the primaries could now find that same identification insufficient, because ""the injunction against requiring residential-address identification was in force during the primary election and because the secretary of state's website announced for months the ID requirements as they existed under that injunction.""

Native Americans living on reservations often do not have residential addresses, but have IDs which feature P.O. boxes. Native Americans are North Dakota's largest minority population, comprising over 5 percent of the state's population.

This Supreme Court ruling could significantly affect the re-election chances of Democratic Sen. Heidi Heitkamp, who is trailing Republican opponent Kevin Cramer in polling. Heitkamp won her seat by just under 3,000 votes in 2012, with the help of Native American voters. If a few thousand Native American voters lack the necessary identification and are unable to vote, that could damage Heitkamp in a close race.

However, it is possible to obtain a residential address before Election Day, according to a Facebook post by the organization Native Vote ND, which encourages voter participation by Native Americans in the state.

Individuals can reach out to their county's 911 coordinator to begin the process of having a residential address assigned. They can then describe where their homes are located, enabling coordinators to assign addresses. The office assigning the addresses will provide letters upon request to confirm each individual's new address. The voter can use this letter to obtain a new ID, or as proof of a residential address for voting purposes.

But there's a long history associated with theannualskywatching event.

Itall began on the night of Nov. 12, 1833, when theWestern Hemisphere unexpectedly came under attack by a firestorm ofshootingstars that were reportedly silent, but overwhelming filled the sky.

Duringthis historic display, which was seen under clearskies across the eastern United States, an estimated 240,000 meteorswereobserved. So heavy was the concentration of meteors that to thosegazingskyward it was visually obvious that they were fanning out from a spotwithinthe star pattern known as the Sickle in the constellation of Leo, theLion. [Top10Leonid Meteor Shower Facts]

Followingthis realization, the meteors were given theLatin family name for their apparent place of origin: the Leonidmeteor shower.

Leonidmeteor shower is born

Thisspectacular 1833Leonid meteor storm made a deep and terrifying impression onthe Americanpeople.

Accordingto newspaper reports almost everyone saw it,awakened either by the commotion in the streets or by the moving glareoffireballs shining into bedroom windows.

Thispoint of emanation of the meteors (called the ""radiant"")was in the same place for all observers and remained so as the nightwore onand the sky turned. Here was proof that the meteors were travelingparallel toeach other from somewhere outside of our atmosphere.

Upuntil only some years earlier, astronomers had refusedto believe that meteors ? those streaks of light so commonly seen inthe upperatmosphere ? could have any astronomical connection at all.

Thisremarkable finding, that meteors are visitors fromastronomical realms, was striking in its own way as the shower itself.Itsparked intense study into this new field of astronomy.

After1833, many astronomers researched the history ofthe Leonids in ancient European, Arab and Chinese documents. In 1837,theGerman physician and astronomer Heinrich Olbers suggested thatbetter-than-average displays occurred in cycles of 33 or 34 years.

Otheraccounts subsequently came to light. In 1799,Alexander von Humboldt ? the great German naturalist and explorer ?watched astupendous display of brilliant fireballs during his explorations inVenezuela.

""Therewas not a space in the heavens equal to twicethe moon?s diameter which was not filled every instant by shootingstars,""Humboldt wrote.

TheLeonids had apparently been observed for almost 1,000years. [Gallery:Spectacular Leonid Meteor Shower Photos]

Particularlyimpressive displays were found to have takenplace in the years of 1533, 1366, 1202, 1037, 967 and 934. Arabhistoricalaccounts have called the year of 902 A.D. the ""Year of the Stars,"" asLeonid meteors lit up the night sky during which Ibrahim, king ofTunisia andSicily, lay dying.

TheLeonids comet connection

Afterastronomers began studying the Leonid meteor shower,they ultimately traced its origins to a so-called dense ""knot"" ofmatter that revolved around the sun in a period that, in 1866, wasdetermined at33.25 years. That same year, the likely source of meteor streams wasestablished by Italian astronomer Giovanni Schiaparelli: The Leonidscame from a comet.

Schiaparelli'sLeonids origins discovery came after heestablished that the orbit of another famous shower ? the AugustPerseids ? closelymatched that of Periodic Comet Swift-Tuttle. In that same work,Schiaparellipublished his calculations for the orbit of the Leonid stream.

Otherexperts in celestial mechanics noticed a strikingresemblance of the Leonid orbit to that of the newly discoveredPeriodic CometTempel-Tuttle. This relatively small comet is in an orbit that at itsclosestpoint to the sun almost coincides with the Earth?s orbit andalso movesthrough space in a direction opposite to Earth.

Sowhen we meet its dusty trail in mid-November theseparticles collide with us at the maximum possible speed ? 45 miles (72kilometers) per second. From our perspective on Earth, the meteors comeat usfrom the direction of the constellation of Leo, the lion, which inmid-Novemberappears dead ahead of us in our path around the sun.

Thismeans that we have to be on the forward side of the Earthto see them coming ? that is, we must be up during the hours betweenmidnight anddawn. Leonids tend to be quite bright and are tinged with green or bluebecauseof their great speeds.

Abouthalf of the Leonids create bright, luminous trails ?in the most extreme cases, hanging in the air for eight or even 10minutes. Themeteors begin to flow when they are still nearly 100 miles (160 km)highbecause they, like the Orionid meteors of October, are thin flakes fromthenucleus of their parent comet. So the relationship becameclear: meteorstreams are the debris of crumbling comets.

Jupiter,the spoiler

AfterSchiaparelli's 1866 discovery, the Leonid meteorstorms returned on schedule that same year and in 1867, though notnearly asabundant as what had been seen in 1833. The meteor rates reported inthoseyears were about to be 5,000 per hour from Europe in 1866, and about1,000 perhour from North America in 1867.

Anothergreat shower was confidently expected for 1899and fairly wide publicity was given to the possibility of are-enactment of theevents of 1867 and especially 1833.

Butinstead, the anticipated Leonids spectacular failedto materialize. It was later determined that their orbit had beensignificantlyperturbed by Jupiter ? as happens to most comets and meteors sooner orlater ?or perhaps, as some suggested, the meteors in the Leonid stream werebecomingmore evenly and thinly spread along their orbit.

Theonce great Leonids had seemingly become just a minorstream. Even worse, Comet Tempel-Tuttle, the source of the meteordebris,failed to be seen both in 1899 and 1932 and was presumed to be lost.

Butthis was not so.

They'reback ?

By1961, the Leonid meteor shower began to revive,unexpectedly reaching rates of up to 50 per hour. Then in 1965, CometTempel-Tuttle, lost for nearly a century, was at long lastrediscovered.

Observersthat same year in Hawaii and Australiawitnessed Leonid rates of 120 per hour, many of these appearing asspectacularfireballs. Then one year later, on Nov. 17, 1966, a tremendous storm oftens ofthousands of Leonids fell for a short interval timed for skywatchers inthecentral and western United States.

Therate was estimated by some as 40 per second!

Thatworks out to 144,000 per hour. It was a veritable stormof Leonid meteors, the greatest meteor display ever seen atany rate inhistorical time.

CometTempel-Tuttle swept through the inner solar systemonce again in early 1998. New studies using computer modeling indicatedthat itwas not a singular knot, but rather several dense trails of materialimbeddedwithin the Leonid stream that gave rise to spectacular meteorstorms.

Aspectacular display of hundreds of fireball meteorsappeared in 1998. This was followed by meteor storms numbering in thethousandsper hour in 1999, 2001 and 2002.

Morethan a decade has now passed since the comet?s mostrecent visit, and the Leonids are now producing far more modestdisplays. Attheir peak, perhaps a dozen or more meteors might be seen streakingfrom out ofthe Sickle of Leo.

Itseems that we?ll have to wait until Tempel-Tuttlereturns to the vicinity of the inner solar system in 2031 for the nextgreatLeonid cycle.

JupiterAgain!

However,long-range orbital computations indicate that aclose encounter with Jupiter in 2028 is expected to once againseriouslyperturb both the comet's path and its accompanying dense trails ofmaterial,making storms of historic magnitude (meteor rates in the thousands perhour)unlikely for many decades to come.

Aboutthe best we can hope for are Leonid displaysnumbering not in the thousands, but maybe only the hundreds per hourforseveral years beginning perhaps in the year 2033. The Leonids have thepotential to be quite impressive in those years ? a display of, say,500meteors per hour would be more meteors than most people would see in anentirelifetime.

Butany hope of a repeat of the amazing spectacles of1799, 1833 or 1966 does not appear likely until sometime after thestart of the22nd century; something for our great-grandchildren to look forward to.

Brenda Lee, 58, of Anaheim, was carried off by airport security after she refused to leave the area, saying that she wanted to hand the president a letter denouncing the California Supreme Court for deciding Tuesday not to annul gay marriages in the state.

Lee was dressed in a cassock.

In a phone interview, Lee said that she is a Catholic priestess “with St. Juliana’s in Fullerton,” and that there are 60 other Catholic priestesses worldwide.

Father Paul Gins of St. Juliana’s said that Lee is a member of the parish and a “well-meaning person,” but that “she does not represent the church. We do not recognize women priests, and haven’t for 2,000 years.”

Lee said that her duties as a minister involve consecrating the host, and ministering to the disabled and elderly in convalescent homes.

She called the White House to request credentials for Obama’s arrival, citing her involvement with the Georgia Informer, an independent black newspaper in Macon, Georgia.

At LAX this morning, Lee asked a Secret Service agent to take her letter to President Obama after learning that the president wasn’t scheduled to take any questions at the appearance.

The staffer came and asked to see the letter. “He said his name was Worly but I doubt that was his real name,” Lee said.

After “Worly” gave Lee the letter back, another staffer asked to see it, Lee said. Lee said that she’d rather give it to Obama herself when he walked by.

“‘I assure you, he’s not going to come by here,'” Lee recounted the man saying. “‘I don’t want you to yell his name. I don’t want you to do anything disruptive.'”

When Lee refused to surrender the letter, the man had security remove her, Lee said.

Lee said she yelled at reporters for not sticking up for her, saying “…you did nothing. What kind of reporting is this?”

Lee said she thinks she was being discriminated against for being a priestess, and that a priest wouldn’t have received the same treatment.

She said she was discriminated against because her stand for traditional marriage offended the staffer.

“The person who came to get the letter was, in my opinion, gay,” Lee said. That’s why he acted that way, she said, because, “why would a person jeopardize his job for craziness.”

Outside the terminal, a police officer chided Lee for making a scene, she said.

“‘This could’ve been much worse,'” she said the officer told her. “We could have cuffed you, put you in a black-and-white, and held you for 72 hours.'”

Lee – whose sister worked in a mental hospital, she said – understood the reference to the holding period for mental illness cases.

As she tearfully recounted this afternoon, she had one thing to tell the officer: “Are you trying to imply that there’s something mentally wrong with me?”

The White House had no comment, deputy press secretary Josh Earnest in Washington told the Associated Press.

A call to the Georgia Informer was not returned.

Lee writes on religious matters for the newspaper, and her columns are available online.

Here's how three nearby states do it

Gov. Bruce Rauner, right, and challenger J.B. Pritzker disagree on the state's income tax. Rich Hein/Chicago Sun-Times via AP

This story has been updated to clarify that J.B. Pritzker's reference to people paying ""13 to 13.5 percent of their income in state taxes” includes sales and other taxes.

The gubernatorial candidates' diverging views on flat versus progressive income taxes have generated rancor and insults but few details on what a fundamental shift in Illinois' system would mean.

Republican Gov. Bruce Rauner wants to lower the state's 4.95 percent flat tax, and Democrat J.B. Pritzker seeks a graduated or progressive tax with different brackets based on earnings.

""The vast majority of the people in the state of Illinois should get an income tax break,"" Pritzker said in a recent interview. ""The wealthiest people in the state can afford to pay a little bit more.""

Rauner charges the plan will raise taxes for the middle class, which Pritzker disputes. ""Nightmare for Illinois,"" Rauner told the Daily Herald. ""We cannot raise taxes more to solve any of our problems.""

So what does a graduated income tax mean? Here's how it works in three nearby states.

Ohio

Ohio has used a progressive tax since 1973. People with taxable income up to $10,850 get a break in taxes; the rest of Ohioans fall into seven categories with tax rates ranging from 1.98 percent in the lowest bracket to 4.9 percent in the highest. Taxpayers also pay a base amount ranging from about $81 to $8,333 over the seven brackets.

For example, an individual or couple would pay 1.98 percent on taxable income between $10,851 and $16,300, then 2.47 percent on taxable income between $16,300 and $21,750, and so on. Taxable income between $43,450 and $86,900 is taxed at 3.46 percent, and taxable income between $86,900 and $108,700 is taxed at 3.96 percent.

The Ohio Department of Taxation estimated a married couple under age 65 filing jointly and making $100,000 a year could have a tax liability of $2,703 after tax credits and other variables were figured in.

Wisconsin

Wisconsin also uses a graduated system with four brackets from 4 percent to 7.65 percent. For a single person or head of household, that means taxable income from zero to $11,450 is taxed at 4 percent, taxable income between $11,450 and $22,900 is taxed at 5.84 percent, taxable income between $22,900 and $252,150 is taxed at 6.27 percent, and taxable income of $252,150 and higher is taxed at 7.65 percent.

Wisconsin also uses a set amount in addition to percentages in calculating taxes.

The Wisconsin Department of Revenue estimated a married couple making $100,000 a year might have a net tax amount of between $4,000 and $4,900 depending on deductions and credits.

Minnesota

Minnesota has a progressive income tax with four levels that start at 5.35 percent and rise to 9.85 percent.

For a married couple filing jointly, that means taxable income from zero to $37,850 has a tax rate of 5.35 percent, between $37,851 and $150,380 has a 7.05 percent tax rate, from $150,381 to $266,700 has a 7.85 percent rate, and $266,700 and higher has a 9.85 percent rate.

In Illinois, ""the bottom 20 percent are paying roughly 13 to 13.5 percent of their income in state taxes"" that include sales and other taxes, Hyatt hotel heir Pritzker said. ""The people at the top are paying 6 percent. That seems very unfair.""

He promised that shifting to a progressive tax would lower property taxes for schools.

Rauner, a venture capitalist, disagrees.

""I want to roll the income tax rate back down to 3 percent over the next four or five years,"" he said. Changes in pensions and health care spending and consolidating government can achieve about $6 billion to pay for the tax cuts and grow the economy, he said.

Nine states have no income tax, eight have a flat tax, and 33 use a progressive system, according to the IRS and TurboTax."	How would a graduated income tax work in Illinois?

But if Donald Trump somehow gets elected and if the early days of his presidency look anything like his campaign, he may find himself becoming particularly familiar with the 25th Amendment to the U.S Constitution. So what is the 25th Amendment?

Ratified and adopted in 1967 following the assassination of John F. Kennedy, the 25th Amendment lays out the rules of succession in the case of a president's death, resignation, removal, or incapacitation. The key part of the 25th Amendment for a Trump presidency is Section Four, which gives the vice president, backed by the majority of the executive cabinet, the power to declare the president unable to serve and assume the role of acting president. In such a case, we would all be waving bye-bye to President Trump and hello to President Mike Pence.

If Trump were to object to this action, the decision would be left up to a two-thirds vote in Congress. Considering the number of senators and representatives who opposed a Trump presidency, the odds of Trump winning a congressional vote are unlikely.

MANDEL NGAN/AFP/Getty Images

Pence invoking the 25th Amendment would be a move straight out of a political thriller, and though the first three sections of the amendment have been cited before, the fourth never has. The last time the 25th Amendment was used, in 2007, President George Bush cited Section Three to temporarily transfer his powers to Vice President Dick Cheney before undergoing a colonoscopy. Bush reassumed his powers only a couple hours later.

Possible reasons for Pence to invoke the 25th Amendment could include anything from a classic Trumpian outburst in which he (if elected) threatens to act against the wishes of his party to yet another revelation of Trump's sexual misconduct. In any case, the moment the 25th Amendment comes into play after a Inauguration Day is the moment Trump and Melania should start getting ready to move out of the White House (if they make it there)."

Hate crimes are up dramatically, people are afraid for their basic safety. Trump doesn't seem to have even the most basic understanding of the job he's now got on his hands. He's still tweeting. In the event of a total emergency, there is a Constitutional loophole that could remove him from office. Could Donald Trump be removed with the 25th Amendment? Yes, Mike Pence could fire the president, but it would be a very dangerous thing for democracy.

Here's how the 25th amendment works.

Once Trump assumes office, Mike Pence, along with either a majority of Trump's cabinet or Congressional Republicans, can invoke the 25th amendment because the president is unfit or lacks the capacity to serve, according to Cornell University Law School Legal Institute. And in the event a President Trump is endangering national security or is deemed completely unable to do the job, that's a solid option. It's been invoked six times since it was ratified in 1967, most notably by President Richard Nixon, according to Politico. But if the 25th amendment is used for political purposes, that becomes a dangerous threat to democracy itself.

Vice President Pence deciding with a handful of presidential advisers or Congressional GOPs to wrestle control away from a democratically-elected sitting president sounds a lot like a coup. Trump was elected, whether you agree with it or not, because Americans wanted a president who would break from the Washington D.C. political establishment.

If Trump uses his presidency to challenge the Republican establishment in Congress, the idea of getting rid of Trump and replacing him with a party faithful like Pence might seem like a good idea. And that's the scenario that should concern all Americans.

Consider the fact that many right-wing news outlets called for the 25th amendment to be invoked against President Obama for mental illness, among other perceived incapacities, like this December 2015 article from the Washington Times that asked,

Is it now time to invoke Section 4 of the 25th Amendment?

Has our president officially lost his ability to discharge the powers and duties of his office?

Anyone who listened to President Obama speak to reporters in Paris on Tuesday would reasonably conclude it is high time to start drawing up the papers to transmit to Congress for his removal.

The 25th amendment is, if you'll forgive the metaphor, the nuclear option — the emergency glass we can break in the event of a catastrophe. And if President Trump turns out to be a danger to national security then it will be up to those around him to make the decision of whether to strip him of the powers of his office. But if Trump can be elected by the American people and simply discarded once he's no longer useful to the political machine, then maybe the folks who elected him to demolish the establishment are onto something after all."

What its website will not tell you is that this fringe organization, under the veneer of its professional-sounding name and claims, works to defame and discredit LGBT people, often by distorting legitimate research. It consists of around 200 members and started because a small group of anti-LGBT physicians and other healthcare professionals broke away from the 60,000 member American Academy of Pediatrics (AAP), composed of leaders in the professional field, to form its own group after the AAP issued a new policy statement in 2002 in support of adoption and foster parenting by same-sex couples.



Anti-marriage equality protester at the Supreme Court

ACPeds has a history of propagating damaging falsehoods about LGBT people, including linking homosexuality to pedophilia, and claiming that LGBT people are more promiscuous than heterosexuals, and that LGBT people are a danger to children.

In 2010, for example, ACPeds mailed a letter to over 14,000 school district superintendents pushing so-called “ex-gay” therapy and making other false claims about LGBT people in its “Facts About Youth” campaign, which brought a scathing response from a researcher whose work the group had distorted. That wasn’t the first time ACPeds had been called out for distorting legitimate research, but clearly, if the brief they filed is any indication, the lesson didn’t take.

ACPeds filed the brief with the Alabama Supreme Court on Nov. 6 in response to that court’s pending decision regarding the U.S. Supreme Court (SCOTUS) ruling in Obergefell v. Hodges last June, which legalized same-sex marriage in the United States. In defiance of Alabama federal district court judge Callie Granade, the Alabama Policy Institute and Alabama Citizens Action Program petitioned the Alabama Supreme Court to uphold Alabama’s state law, which declares that marriage is between one man and one woman. While the Alabama Supreme Court requested that the parties in the case have their briefs filed by July 6, 2015, amicus briefs seem to still be tricking in and the court has yet to rule.

The ACPeds brief urges the court to defy the U.S. Supreme Court and confirm that marriage is only between one man and one woman. The brief states that ACPeds is “concerned by the delay of the Alabama Supreme Court and the immediate threat of Obergefell to the stability of families, the safety of children and our constitutional republic.”

Unsurprisingly in the brief, ACPeds cites professors Loren D. Marks and Mark Regnerus, both of whom have attempted to claim through discredited research that children “do worse” in same-sex parent households than in heterosexual-parent households. Regnerus’s infamous study, which received almost a million dollars from right-wing anti-LGBT think tanks, was released in 2012 and was immediately trumpeted by anti-LGBT groups around the country and has been used repeatedly in various amicus briefs in opposition to same-sex marriage.



Loren Marks (top) is a professor of family life at BYU and Mark Regnerus is a professor of sociology at the University of Texas, Austin

Regnerus has become a darling on the anti-LGBT circuit, though in legitimate social science circles, his credibility continues to wane. Last year, Regnerus testified in a federal court case in Michigan regarding the legality of same-sex marriage. Federal judge Paul Friedman dismissed Regnerus’s testimony as “unbelievable” and “not worthy of serious consideration” and wrote that his study was “hastily concocted at the behest of a third-party funder.” In addition, Regnerus’s own academic department has distanced itself from him.

In spite of that, ACPeds relies heavily on Regnerus as well as on other researchers affiliated with the National Association for the Research and Therapy of Homosexuality (NARTH; now the NARTH Institute), which supports the discredited “ex-gay” therapy movement. So-called “ex-gay” or “reparative” therapy seeks to change gay people to heterosexual.

The ACPeds brief also cites outdated sources from the 1970s, 1980s, and 1990s to bolster claims that same-sex relationships don’t last very long, and that same-sex relationships are “more violent” than heterosexual. “This Court,” the brief implores, “should take care that innocent and helpless Alabama children are not sacrificed on the altar of adult passions, judicial will, or politically correct opinion.”

In a supreme case of irony, the brief further claims that legitimate research by professional organizations like the American Psychological Association are the result of a “biased political agenda.” The brief goes on to cite, for example, a 2002 report by physician Ellin Perrin in support of ACPeds’ views that legitimate research is “biased.”

That 2002 report actually found the opposite of what ACPeds claims. The report states that, “the weight of evidence gathered during several decades using diverse samples and methodologies” is persuasive in demonstrating that “there is no systematic difference between gay and nongay parents in emotional health, parenting skills, and attitudes toward parenting.” The report further notes that “no data have pointed to any risk to children” as a result of growing up in a family of one or more gay parents.”

Perrin’s report, co-authored by the Committee on Psychosocial Aspects of Child and Family Health is part of what caused ACPeds to break away from the AAP in the first place, because it helped form the basis for AAP’s support of adoption and foster parenting by same-sex parents, which ACPeds vehemently opposes. Nevertheless, the group has no problem taking one line in that report out of context and using it to bolster their own flagging position.

But in the strange world of the anti-LGBT right, damaging falsehoods about LGBT people are considered true while legitimate science is seen as false. This is why fringe think tanks like ACPeds have formed in hard-right circles: a means to hold on to and perpetuate views that are being proven wrong with every passing day."

The American College of Pediatricians urges healthcare professionals, educators and legislators to reject all policies that condition children to accept as normal a life of chemical and surgical impersonation of the opposite sex. Facts – not ideology – determine reality.

1. Human sexuality is an objective biological binary trait: “XY” and “XX” are genetic markers of male and female, respectively – not genetic markers of a disorder. The norm for human design is to be conceived either male or female. Human sexuality is binary by design with the obvious purpose being the reproduction and flourishing of our species. This principle is self-evident. The exceedingly rare disorders of sex development (DSDs), including but not limited to testicular feminization and congenital adrenal hyperplasia, are all medically identifiable deviations from the sexual binary norm, and are rightly recognized as disorders of human design. Individuals with DSDs (also referred to as “intersex”) do not constitute a third sex.1

2. No one is born with a gender. Everyone is born with a biological sex. Gender (an awareness and sense of oneself as male or female) is a sociological and psychological concept; not an objective biological one. No one is born with an awareness of themselves as male or female; this awareness develops over time and, like all developmental processes, may be derailed by a child’s subjective perceptions, relationships, and adverse experiences from infancy forward. People who identify as “feeling like the opposite sex” or “somewhere in between” do not comprise a third sex. They remain biological men or biological women.2,3,4

3. A person’s belief that he or she is something they are not is, at best, a sign of confused thinking. When an otherwise healthy biological boy believes he is a girl, or an otherwise healthy biological girl believes she is a boy, an objective psychological problem exists that lies in the mind not the body, and it should be treated as such. These children suffer from gender dysphoria. Gender dysphoria (GD), formerly listed as Gender Identity Disorder (GID), is a recognized mental disorder in the most recent edition of the Diagnostic and Statistical Manual of the American Psychiatric Association (DSM-5).5 The psychodynamic and social learning theories of GD/GID have never been disproved.2,4,5

4. Puberty is not a disease and puberty-blocking hormones can be dangerous. Reversible or not, puberty- blocking hormones induce a state of disease – the absence of puberty – and inhibit growth and fertility in a previously biologically healthy child.6

5. According to the DSM-5, as many as 98% of gender confused boys and 88% of gender confused girls eventually accept their biological sex after naturally passing through puberty.5

6. Pre-pubertal children diagnosed with gender dysphoria may be given puberty blockers as young as eleven, and will require cross-sex hormones in later adolescence to continue impersonating the opposite sex. These children will never be able to conceive any genetically related children even via artificial reproductive technology. In addition, cross-sex hormones (testosterone and estrogen) are associated with dangerous health risks including but not limited to cardiac disease, high blood pressure, blood clots, stroke, diabetes, and cancer.7,8,9,10,11

7. Rates of suicide are nearly twenty times greater among adults who use cross-sex hormones and undergo sex reassignment surgery, even in Sweden which is among the most LGBTQ – affirming countries.12 What compassionate and reasonable person would condemn young children to this fate knowing that after puberty as many as 88% of girls and 98% of boys will eventually accept reality and achieve a state of mental and physical health?

8. Conditioning children into believing a lifetime of chemical and surgical impersonation of the opposite sex is normal and healthful is child abuse. Endorsing gender discordance as normal via public education and legal policies will confuse children and parents, leading more children to present to “gender clinics” where they will be given puberty-blocking drugs. This, in turn, virtually ensures they will “choose” a lifetime of carcinogenic and otherwise toxic cross-sex hormones, and likely consider unnecessary surgical mutilation of their healthy body parts as young adults.

CLARIFICATIONS in response to FAQs regarding points 3 & 5:

Regarding Point 3: “Where does the APA or DSM-5 indicate that Gender Dysphoria is a mental disorder?”

The APA (American Psychiatric Association) is the author of the Diagnostic and Statistical Manual of Mental Disorders, 5th edition(DSM-5). The APA states that those distressed and impaired by their GD meet the definition of a disorder. The College is unaware of any medical literature that documents a gender dysphoric child seeking puberty blocking hormones who is not significantly distressed by the thought of passing through the normal and healthful process of puberty.

From the DSM-5 fact sheet:

“The critical element of gender dysphoria is the presence of clinically significant distress associated with the condition.”

“This condition causes clinically significant distress or impairment in social, occupational, or other important areas of functioning.”

Regarding Point 5: “Where does the DSM-5 list rates of resolution for Gender Dysphoria?”

On page 455 of the DSM-5 under “Gender Dysphoria without a disorder of sex development” it states: “Rates of persistence of gender dysphoria from childhood into adolescence or adulthood vary. In natal males, persistence has ranged from 2.2% to 30%. In natal females, persistence has ranged from 12% to 50%.” Simple math allows one to calculate that for natal boys: resolution occurs in as many as 100% – 2.2% = 97.8% (approx. 98% of gender-confused boys). Similarly, for natal girls: resolution occurs in as many as 100% – 12% = 88% gender-confused girls.

The bottom line is this: Our opponents advocate a new scientifically baseless standard of care for children with a psychological condition (GD) that would otherwise resolve after puberty for the vast majority of patients concerned. Specifically, they advise: affirmation of children’s thoughts which are contrary to physical reality; the chemical castration of these children prior to puberty with GnRH agonists (puberty blockers which cause infertility, stunted growth, low bone density, and an unknown impact upon their brain development), and, finally, the permanent sterilization of these children prior to age 18 via cross-sex hormones. There is an obvious self-fulfilling nature to encouraging young GD children to impersonate the opposite sex and then institute pubertal suppression. If a boy who questions whether or not he is a boy (who is meant to grow into a man) is treated as a girl, then has his natural pubertal progression to manhood suppressed, have we not set in motion an inevitable outcome? All of his same sex peers develop into young men, his opposite sex friends develop into young women, but he remains a pre-pubertal boy. He will be left psychosocially isolated and alone. He will be left with the psychological impression that something is wrong. He will be less able to identify with his same sex peers and being male, and thus be more likely to self identify as “non-male” or female. Moreover, neuroscience reveals that the pre-frontal cortex of the brain which is responsible for judgment and risk assessment is not mature until the mid-twenties. Never has it been more scientifically clear that children and adolescents are incapable of making informed decisions regarding permanent, irreversible and life-altering medical interventions. For this reason, the College maintains it is abusive to promote this ideology, first and foremost for the well-being of the gender dysphoric children themselves, and secondly, for all of their non-gender-discordant peers, many of whom will subsequently question their own gender identity, and face violations of their right to bodily privacy and safety.

“It actually started out as a joke,” Snowden said in his speech. “Someone photocopied a picture of an elf with the caption ‘I’m watching you,’ and it just kept moving from cubicle to cubicle.”

Snowden said that at some point it occurred to someone that if people as paranoid as NSA staff would play this game, what would happen with civilians?

“Now, the NSA has an agent inside practically every home with a child in it,” Snowden said.

“The elves have basic mobility, which isn’t a problem because when one shows up someplace unexpected,” Snowden added, “it’s just assumed to be part of the game.”

Through these adorable snoops, the NSA has gained access to millions of tax returns, bank statements, and 10-year old boys unwrapping and re-wrapping their presents in the days ahead of Christmas.

“We would flag those kids for later recruitment to the intelligence community,” Snowden said. “Especially for Tailored Access Operations.”

In addition, the NSA has uncovered a trove of data about the personal lives of millions of Americans, sources confirmed.

“The NSA has incorporated advanced sensors into these things that can uncover all kinds of information,” journalist Glenn Greenwald told Duffel Blog in an email. “They can tell things about people’s health — cancer, heart disease, liver disease. They know who’s being naughty, and who’s being really naughty, things that even extensive online snooping couldn’t provide. Dildos, vibrators, chains — all the things stashed in closets and under beds.”

Sources told reporters these were previously inaccessible to the government’s leading intelligence agency, if the owners paid cash at least.

“If you want to know why the ‘privacy advocates’ have settled down, and moved on? My guess is, blackmail. These elves have accumulated petabytes of evidence against pretty much everybody,” Snowden said.

“You wouldn’t believe what perverse things people will do to each other, right in front of these things,” Snowden concluded. “It’s why ‘ElfMonitor’ is such a highly sought after duty assignment.”"	Snowden: 'Elf On A Shelf' Is An NSA Project	2014-12-15 07:00:51-05:00	['Posted By']	['project', 'intelligence', 'snowden', 'millions', 'elf', 'naughty', 'nsa', 'know', 'whos', 'elves', 'things', 'shelf', 'told']	"“Now, the NSA has an agent inside practically every home with a child in it,” Snowden said.

The essence of science is figuring out what things are made of, and how things work. This page gives just a brief introduction to the science of snowflakes.



Delving deeper brings one into a fascinating, and still unfolding, story about the molecular dynamics of how crystals grow and develop. For that you can browse the Contents page, and from there jump to a wide variety of topics relating to snowflake science. What is a snowflake?

When people say snowflake , they often mean snow crystal . The latter is a single crystal of ice, within which the water molecules are all lined up in a precise hexagonal array. Snow crystals display that characteristic six-fold symmetry we are all familiar with. The picture on the left shows a snow crystal.



A snowflake, on the other hand, is a more general term. It can mean an individual snow crystal, but it can also mean just about anything that falls from the winter clouds. Often hundreds or even thousands of snow crystals collide and stick together in mid-air as they fall, forming flimsy puff-balls we call snowflakes. Calling a snow crystal a snowflake is fine, like calling a tulip a flower. Frozen water vapor

Snow crystals are not frozen raindrops; that is called sleet . A snow crystal appears when water vapor in the air converts directly into ice without first becoming liquid water. As more water vapor condenses onto a nascent snow crystal, it grow and develops, and that is when its ornate patterns emerge. Why such complex, symmetrical shapes?

And why are no two alike?

A stellar snow crystal begins with the formation of a small hexagonal plate, and branches sprout from the six corners when the crystal grows larger. As it tumbles through the clouds, the crystal experiences ever changing temperatures and humidities, and each change makes the arms grow a bit differently.



The exact shape of the final snow crystal is determined by the precise path it took through the clouds. But the six arms all took the same path, and so each experienced the same changes at the same times. Thus the six arms grow in synchrony, yielding a complex, yet symmetrical shape. And since no two snow crystals follow the exact same path through the clouds as they fall, no two look exactly alike.



We have made ""identical-twin"" snowflakes by exposing a pair of tiny seed crystals to nearly identical varying conditions as a function of time. This shows essentially what would happen if two snow crystals traveled side-by-side as they fell from the clouds. What synchronizes the growth of the arms?

Nothing. The six arms of a snow crystal all grow independently, as described in the previous section. But since they grow under the same randomly changing conditions, all six end up with similar shapes. There are no mysterious forces -- quantum-mechanical, acoustical, or anything else you might have heard about -- that provide communication between the arms to ensure they all grow alike.



One analogy I like is what happens on a rainy day. You look outside, see that it is raining, so you grab your umbrella on your way out. Then you find out that your neighbors are all carrying umbrellas too. You didn't communicate with one another about this, yet everyone's umbrella usage was synchronized. The same goes for the six branches of a snow crystal. When the temperature or humidity changes around the crystal, the six branches all change their growth in snychrony, even though the branches do not communicate with one another.



Now, let me assure you that the vast majority of snow crystals are not very symmetrical. Don't be fooled by the pictures -- irregular crystals (see the Guide to Snowflakes) are by far the most common type. Just take a look for yourself next time it snows. Near-perfect, symmetrical snow crystals are fun to look at, and sought after by photographers, but they are not common. Why six?

The six-fold symmetry you see in a snow crystal arises from the arrangement of water molecules in the ice crystal lattice. As this ice crystal model spins around, you can see the hexagons in the structure. But a crystal is a three-dimensional structure, and snowflakes are also three-dimensional. Stellar plates are thin and flat (see the Guide to Snowflakes), but other snow crystals are not.



The simplest snowflakes

When snow crystals first begin growing, they are shaped like the simple hexagonal prisms shown here. Each prism has two basal facets and six prism facets .



Hexagonal prisms can be long, slender, hexagonal columns, or thin, flat, hexagonal plates, or anything in between.



Hexagonal prisms display the simple, perfect order of the molecular lattice. These crystals result from slow growth, and they are usually small in size.







Snowflake Asymmetry

If you take a close look at the snow crystal on the left, you will see that it is not very symmetrical. Sure it has six similar branches, but the sidebranches are randomly positioned on the each of the branches. This is a fernlike stellar dendrite (see the Guide to Snowflakes), and each branch grows independently of the others. Plus each branch grows rapidly (compared to other snowflake types), sending out sidebranches at irregular intervals.



The chaotic branching of a fernlike stellar dendrite arises during rapid ice growth, in contrast to the slow, simple growth of hexagonal prisms.





Faceting, Branching, and Sharpening

There is no blueprint or genetic code that guides the growth of a snowflake. Yet they appear in these amazingly ornate, symmetrical shapes. The shape of each crystal is not determined by any plan or predetermined design, but by different processes that govern its growth behavior.



Faceting. One such process is faceting, which causes flat surfaces to appear on the crystal, surfaces that reflect the underlying molecular symmetry. Click on the link to read more about faceting.



Branching. This process causes complex structures to grow out from the ice. Click on the link to read more.



Sharpening. This process pushes snow crystal growth to thin, flat plates, happening mainly at temperatures near -15C (5 F).



The different growth processes guide snow crystal growth differently. Faceting creates order, as embodied by the simple, perfect, hexagonal prism. Branching brings chaos, as embodied by the randomly spaced sidebranches in a fernlike stellar dendrite. But with the right mix of order and chaos, nature sometimes creates beautiful snow crystals that are both complex and symmetrical.



As you learn more about snowflakes, you soon find that the underlying science is quite complicated. The growth of a snowflake depends on how water molecules diffuse through the air surrounding a growing crystal, and it depends on how water molecules stick to ice surfaces. There is a lot going on as these crystals form in the clouds. Of course, that is what makes it all so fascinating!

The Snow Crystal Morphology Diagram

The way snow crystals grow depends strongly on the temperature and humidity in the clouds. This is summarized in the Snow Crystal Morphology Diagram shown on the right. This is also called the Nakaya Diagram , after Japanese physicist Ukichiro Nakaya, who discovered this behavior by growing snow crystals in his lab in the 1930s.



Go ahead, click on the diagram for a closer look. It shows that the largest, most photogenic stellar snow crystals only grow in a narrow temperature range around -15 C (5 F). Needles and columns are best found around -6 C (21 F). Capped columns appear when the temperature changes as the crystals grow. Remember these are temperatures in the clouds; it is often substantially warmer on the ground.



You can also see that more elaborate, branched crystals grow when the humidity is high. Simple prisms grow when the humidity is low (or when the crystals are tiny).



Exactly why snow crystals grow this way is not yet fully understood, although much progress has been made. The growth behavior of ice depends on the molecular structure and dynamics at the crystal surface, and this is all so complicated that no one really understands everything about it.



Although science has made great advances in understanding the secrets of the Universe, there remains a bit of mystery still in these remarkable ice structures. More...

John le Carré - English novelist

This is High Noon for American democracy. The rights and freedoms that have made America the envy of the world are being systematically eroded. A new McCarthyism is abroad. Bush tells us that those who are not with him are against him. I am not with him.

The American over-reaction is beyond everything Osama could have hoped for in his nastiest dreams. But this war was planned long before Osama struck, and it is Osama who made it possible. Without him, the Bush junta would have been mired in Enron, electoral scandal and taxation sleaze. Thanks to Osama, Americans are instead being daily misled by their leaders and by their compliant corporate media.

There is a stink of religious self-righteousness in the air that reminds me of the British Empire at its worst. I cringe when I hear my Prime Minister lend his head prefect’s sophistries to this patently self-interested adventure to secure our oil supplies.

“But will we win, Daddy?”

“Of course we will, child, and quickly, while you are still in bed.”

“But will people be killed, Daddy?”

“There will be a few Western casualties. Very few. Go to sleep.”

“And after that, will everything be normal? Nobody will strike back? The terrorists will all be dead?”

“Wait till you’re older, dear. Goodnight.”

“And is it really true that last time round Iraq lost twice as many dead as America lost in the entire Vietnam war?”

“Hush child. That’s called history.”

Where’s the hurry? Iraq is a vile dictatorship, and Saddam is a monster who sits on the world’s second largest oil reserves. But there is ample time to consider how to unseat him before we plunge into this predatory and dishonest war. Leave the UN inspectors there. Convene Iraq’s neighbours. And consider for a moment where the will came from to make this war in the first place.

Americans can still awake to the shame of what is being done in their name.

Britain is half way there. The French and Russians have been bribed and browbeaten into submission. Only the good Germans have so far succeeded in sticking to their silent guns. I wish profoundly that the rest of us Europeans, in the spirit of a nobler President, would declare ourselves to be citizens of Berlin.

Roger Scruton - English philosopher, novelist and composer

When assessing US foreign policy it is important to remember that America has often intervened around the globe, and is unique in seeking instantly to withdraw thereafter.

It withdrew from Europe after the two world wars, and from Korea, Japan, and (wrongly) Kuwait and Iraq last time round. The Americans tried to withdraw from Vietnam, having established what they believed to be a friendly regime in the South. Of course, the Americans do not withdraw, as a rule, until securing a settlement in their own favour. But such a settlement, they believe, will be one in which the people of the countries involved have acquired the right to elect their own governments. It is very difficult to object to a policy of intervention, when the intention is not to enslave a foreign people, but to liberate them.

Of course, Americans are bluff optimists, often insensitive to history, to local culture, to traditional allegiances and to the balance of power. This may mean that things are less stable after an American intervention than before - as was Europe after Woodrow Wilson’s input into the Treaty of Versailles.

But compare the Soviets in Ethiopia and North Yemen, in Eastern Europe or the Baltics; compare the Chinese in Tibet or the Syrians in Lebanon.

The vices of the USA are always before us; but the virtues are not sufficiently remembered.

America attracts blame because it responds to blame. Criticism of the Soviet Union was always met with a blank wall of indifference, and in any case could not be publicly voiced within the Soviet Empire itself. Hence, during the Cold War, the US was continually singled out as the source of conflict - notably by people on the Left, who often turned a blind, or at any rate myopic, eye, as did Christopher Hill and Eric Hobsbawm to name but two, to the incredible and still unatoned-for crimes of the Soviet Communist Party.

With tyrannical regimes there is no point in criticism from outside, and death or imprisonment is the reward of criticism from inside. That is why intellectuals brought up under tyrannies end up in the USA. It is the one place where they can criticize freely, not just the countries they have fled from, but the country which has offered them refuge. In the face of virtues like these, the Chomskian and Pilgerish criticisms of US foreign policy begin to look, to say the least, one-sided.

US foreign policy isn’t always right. But it emerges from a rational process - one in which criticism is permitted, and accountability assumed. The foreign policies of North Korea and Iraq issue from no such rational process: which is one reason for using force in order to prevent them from issuing at all.

John Berger – Anglo-French writer and critic

I write in a night of shame.

Many fear that U.S. military forces will soon be launching its “preventive” war against Iraq. Others hope that this can be avoided. Between the announced decisions and the secret calculations, everything is kept unclear, since lies prepare the way for missiles.

By shame I do not mean individual guilt. Shame, as I’m coming to understand it, is a species feeling which, in the long run, corrodes the capacity for hope and prevents us looking far ahead. We look down at our feet, thinking only of the next small step.

The shame begins with the contestation (which we all acknowledge somewhere but, out of powerlessness, dismiss) that much of the present suffering could be alleviated or avoided if certain realistic and relatively simple decisions were taken.

To understand and take in what is happening, an inter-disciplinary vision is necessary in order to connect the “fields” which conventional arguments keep separate. The precondition for thinking on a global scale is to see the unity of the unnecessary suffering taking place. Any such vision is bound to be, in the original sense of the word, political.

I write in the night, but I see not only the tyranny. If that were so, I would probably not have the courage to continue. I see people sleeping, stirring, getting up to drink water, whispering their projects or their fears, making love, praying, cooking something whilst the rest of the family is asleep, in Baghdad and Chicago. (Yes, I see too the forever invincible Kurds, 4000 of whom were gassed – with US compliance – by Saddam Hussein.) I see pastry cooks working in Teheran and the shepherds, thought of as bandits, sleeping beside their sheep in Sardinia, I see a man in the Friedrichshain quarter of Berlin sitting in his pyjamas with a bottle of beer reading Heidegger and he has the hands of a proletarian, I see a small boat of illegal immigrants off the Spanish coast near Alicante, I see a mother in Mali, her name is Aya which means Born on Friday, swaying her baby to sleep.

Democracy is a proposal (rarely realised) about decision making; it has little to do with election campaigns. Its promise is that political decisions be made after, and in the light of, consultation with the governed. This is dependent upon the governed being adequately informed about the issues in question, and upon the decision makers having the capacity and will to listen and take account of what they have heard. Democracy should not be confused with the “freedom” of binary choices, the publication of opinion polls or the crowding of people into statistics. These are its pretense.

Today the fundamental decisions, which effect the unnecessary pain increasingly suffered across the planet, have been and are taken unilaterally without any open consultation or participation.

The new tyranny, like other recent ones, depends, to a large degree, on a systematic abuse of language. Together we have to reclaim our hijacked words and reject the tyranny’s nefarious euphemisms; if we do not, we will be left with only the word shame.

This is written in the night. In war the dark is on nobody’s side, in love the dark confirms that we are together.

Pervez Hoodbhoy – Pakistani nuclear physicist

Three horses draw George W. Bush’s furiously racing chariot of war. Their names are Vengeance, Greed, and Fear. Vengeance is a young steed born on 11 September 2001, and gallops well. Greed is old but sturdy, can smell oases of oil from afar, and understands his master’s corporate compulsions. The third horse, Fear, is weak and anaemic. Despite lashes from the Texan’s whip, he is a drag on the team. Nevertheless he is indispensable for convincing the American public that a puny Saddam Hussein, castrated of weapons of mass destruction, remains a mortal threat to a superpower many oceans away. So far the finest spin doctors in Washington have failed to make Fear strong, and Hans Blix has not been totally helpful. Fortunately, Vengeance and Greed have made up admirably well.

The fanatical hordes spilling out of Pakistan’s madrasas see not the horses, nor care about them. But they do imagine seeing Richard the Lion Hearted bearing down upon them. It is, for them, a war between Islam and kufr (unbelief). Sword in hand, they pray to Allah to grant war. Belief in final victory is, of course, never doubted by the faithful. They seek the modern Saladin, one who can miraculously dodge cruise missiles and turn them back to hit their launchers. Who will he be? How many decades, or centuries, shall the modern Crusades last? Surely, a lot longer than you and I will be around for.

Salman Rushdie – writer

There is a strong, even unanswerable case for a “regime change” in Iraq that ought to unite Western public opinion and all those who care about the brutal oppression of an entire Muslim nation.

Saddam Hussein and his ruthless gang of cronies from his home village of Tikrit are homicidal criminals, and their Iraq is a living hell. This obvious truth is no less true because we have been turning a blind eye to it – and “we” includes, until recently, the government of the United States. Nor is it less true because it suits the politics of the Muslim world to inveigh against the global bully it believes the United States to be, while it tolerates the all-too-real monsters in its own ranks.

Iraqi opposition groups in exile have been trying to get the West’s attention for years. Now, there’s a change in Washington’s tune. Good. One may suspect the commitment of the Wolfowitz-Cheney-Rumsfeld axis to the creation and support of a free, democratic Iraq, but it remains the most desirable of goals.

The complicating factors, sadly, are this U.S. administration’s pre-emptive, unilateralist approach which looks like bullying because, well, it is bullying. And the United States’ new pre-emptive strike policy would, if applied, make America itself a much less safe place, because if the United States reserves the right to attack any country it doesn’t like the look of, then those who don’t like the look of the United States might feel obliged to return the compliment. It’s not always as smart as it sounds to get your retaliation in first.

Nor does America’s vagueness about its plans for a post-Hussein Iraq and its own “exit strategy” inspire much confidence.

These are some of the reasons why I have remained unconvinced by President Bush’s Iraqi grand design. But as I listen to Iraqi voices describing the numberless atrocities of the Hussein years, then I am bound to say that if, as now seems possible, the United States and the United Nations do agree on a new Iraq resolution; and if Hussein gets up to his old obstructionist tricks or refuses to accept the new U.N. resolution; then the rest of the world must stop sitting on its hands and join the Americans and British in ridding the world of this vile despot and his cohorts.

It should be said loudly that the primary justification for regime change in Iraq is the dreadful and prolonged suffering of the Iraqi people, and that the remote possibility of a future attack on America by Iraqi weapons is of secondary importance. A war of liberation might just be one worth fighting. The war that America is currently trying to justify is not.

David Hare, playwright

I supported the United States in 2001 when it had a clear right to pursue the murderers of 3,000 of its residents and citizens. To me, the invasion of Afghanistan was justified and inevitable.

Shortly after the assault on his own country, President Bush made an explicit promise that he would work to help reinforce the move towards democracy for the Palestinians, and to reinforce security for the Israelis.

Since the beginning of the second intifada, nearly 3000 people have also been killed, over two-thirds of them Palestinian, a majority on both sides, like those in the Twin Towers, innocent victims of a violence in which they themselves had no part.

President Bush has since reneged on all his promises. By his failure of purpose in the Middle East, he has sanctioned extremists who pursue mayhem and murder in pursuit of ultimately unobtainable goals – on one side, continued occupation and expansion ; on the other, an end to the state of Israel.

He has been, thus far, the most self-righteous, dangerous and inadequate President in American history.

No exponent of American foreign policy has been able to explain why one UN resolution – that voted through recently against Iraq – should be made a matter of military urgency, while another, far more pressing resolution – the one which demands the withdrawal of Israeli troops to pre-1967 borders – has been allowed to stand for thirty years, unenforced, mocking Western claims of impartiality and justice.

I cannot understand a species of Christian zealotry prevailing in the White House which seeks only to prioritise the strong over the weak and the rich over the poor – an exact reversal of Christ’s stated mission on earth.

An unsanctioned invasion of Iraq has no legitimacy. Its arbitrariness is a hearty gesture of encouragement to terrorists all over the world. Like everyone else, I wish an end to dictatorship – in Pakistan and in Saudi Arabia, in Burma and in China, as well as in Iraq. But, most of all, I wish for an American government which has the guts and the vision to imagine a policy for justice and peace in the Middle East.

Denis Halliday, former United Nations Humanitarian Coordinator in Iraq

In relation to Iraq, UN sanctions and now the threat of another American war, I tend to hold the minority viewpoint. Now I find myself in line with the majority view - that is, the majority viewpoint of the Arab community. I base this on recent visits to Tunis, Cairo, Amman and Baghdad. I failed to find one Arab - offical or private citizen - who understands the current crisis between the USA and Iraq to be about weapons of mass destruction. The unanimous view from prime minister to taxi driver is that the conflict is primarily about oil - access, control and cheap! Nobody I talked with sees a threat from Iraq, be it in Turkey, Jordan or Egypt. Why is it that the Washington regime is apparently so threatened? Has it swallowed its own spin, propaganda?

Where is the middle ground? How do we find a solution that saves the face of our two ego-players - Presidents George Bush and Saddam Hussein? Let’s make sure there are no weapons of mass destruction in Iraq and as required by UN Resolution 687, lets make sure the entire neighbourhood is equally clean. Let’s look at US oil needs, recognise the insecurity of the Saudi supply and have the US negotiate with Baghdad, as a trading partner not as a war-threatened state, a plan for the sale of Iraq's oil over the next 30-50 years at a fair market price. This would serve American interests and provide Iraq with the kind of sustained revenue needed for rebuilding the economy, and thereby restoring to the Iraqi people their economic and social rights.

As the same time, Iraq will want to move forward with a multi-party democratic system for which a constitutional change is now being written. The USA must begin to invest massively in renewable sources of energy while also imposing efficient means for reduced consumption of imported oil. Weaning itself from dependency on Middle East oil serves the best interests of Americans. Likewise, the move toward dialogue and trade would begin the process of restoring the lives of the people of Iraq tragically diminished under 12 years of deadly UN sanctions. This could produce a win-win situation for all concerned, including the United Nations, and the Arab community of the Middle East currently so deeply concerned about the catastrophic impact that an American war on Iraq would have on their well-being.

Edwin Morgan, poet.

I deplore the idea of a declaration of war - or even worse, a military attack without such declaration - on Iraq. I retain the rather forlorn hope that diplomacy will still find a way out of the present impasse without the loss of face, but the steady build-up of American forces (tagged by a token tail-wagging British contingent) may already have acquired a momentum of irreversibility. Who thinks of the consequences? ‘Regime change’? By imposition? How about regime change in Jerusalem? In Riyadh? In quite a few other places it would not be hard to name? What looks like the arrogance of American selectivity is of course no more than the reality of power, and it is not new in the world. But there is all the more reason to out it, to question it, to satirise it, since the stakes today are so high. The so-called Gulf War was not really a war but a one-sided massacre. Is British public opinion happy to underwrite what President Bush clearly regards as the finishing of unfinished business? Perhaps it is. If so, these are bad times!

Anita Roddick, founder of The Body Shop

Shame.

Shame on Bush and Blair for threatening their illegal and immoral war. The United Nations Charter, that noble document which authorizes war only in ""self-defence if an armed attack occurs"" or if the UN Security Council deems force necessary to maintain international peace and security, is like so much dust in the wind against the oil-slicked aggressive greed of an arrogant, rogue superpower and its shameless British lackeys. If the Security Council approves this unjust war, it will not be because the world is in agreement, but because it has been strong-armed by a bully.

Shame on the media for refusing to ask the right questions, or to question the right villains. Shame on them for their 24-hour war-watch programming peppered with million-dollar ads and extremist talking heads. Shame on them for cashing in on conflict and ignoring nuance and the truth-telling masses in the streets who are resisting the incessant war cries.

Who is asking the real questions: like, why now? Why not ten years ago, twenty years ago, or ten years from now? Or, if this war is truly about weapons of mass destruction, where is the evidence? If this war is really about the liberation of the Iraqi people from a tyrant, why did we never liberate Chile from Pinochet or Cambodia from Pol Pot? Why are we not liberating Zimbabwe from Mugabe? Why are we not seeking ""regime change"" by force in North Korea? The answer is obvious, and yet we are told not to believe it. Shame on us if we don't. And shame on us all for entering the new millennium still at each other's throats.

Günter Grass, German novelist

Against whom is it being waged, this war that purports to be no more than a threat, not a fact? Against a terrible dictator, they tell us.

But Saddam Hussein, like so many other dictators, used to be on the side of the democratic superpower and her allies. Iraq waged war on Iran with Western weapons for eight years. Why? Because the country next door to the dictator’s was ruled by a dictator who was perceived at the time to be the most dangerous enemy.

But in the meantime Saddam Hussein has got hold of weapons of mass destruction, the warmongers claim. Not only does this accusation remain to be proven, but the western countries which make it have their own arsenal of weapons of mass destruction – and this accusation is easy to prove.

They promise that once the dictator has been overthrown, they will bring democracy to Iraq. However, the dictator’s neighbours, Saudi Arabia and Kuwait – Western allies which are being used as military bases - are themselves ruled by dictators. Will they become the target of more wars to be waged in the name of democracy?

Of course, these questions are pointless; in its arrogance, the superpower can answer them all. But everyone knows, or at least has an inkling, that the real issue is oil. Or, to be precise: once again, the issue is oil. The web of pretences which usually conceals the interests of the world’s last remaining superpower and her chorus of allies has been worn away to expose the true interests of power. They are revealed in all their hubris as shameless, a danger to the public interest. The president of the United States of America today embodies this danger that faces us all.

Paul Gilroy, professor of Afro-American Studies

Political, ethical and pragmatic arguments against invading Iraq have been made familiar. But the fearful and uncertain atmosphere created by the information warriors makes them sound worn out. We have to struggle to restore their meaning and to invest dissent with moral and cultural authority especially now that attempts are being made in England to popularise the war by linking the theme of terrorism to a nativist hatred of asylum seekers - the latest ‘enemy within’.

I reject the voices in favour of war which have recently suggested that the measurable good involved in having resurgent US imperial power obliterate the tyranny of Saddam Hussein can somehow be offset against the problems involved in an endorsement of the Bush junta's imperial project. The same pretend wisdom would have us believe that Blair has been supremely skilful in counselling restraint to George and Condi. My hunch is not only that they can do without his fig leaf, but that their long-term plans will require them to remove it with an assertive flourish.

Not long ago, I heard Blair's advisor Mark Leonard wonking away on the radio. He argued that these days a reliable measure of political maturity was a preparedness to accept the notion that all of Europe's best and benign hopes - for peace, security and enhanced democracy - rested entirely upon the simplifying global force of US military power. Fantasy projects of pre-emptive and proactive aggression inflated by the unchallenged power of all the old Project for a New American Century (PNAC) warriors and orchestrated as redemption and invulnerability by the technocratic offices of worthy folk like Admiral Poindexter are now the absolute guarantors of Britain's moral aspirations towards a better planet. God Save The Queen!

Philip Bobbitt, author of The Shield of Achilles

Saddam Hussein has spent the last twelve years breaching every provision of the Ceasefire Agreement that ended the Gulf War. Though required to “unconditionally accept” disarmament of his weapons of mass destruction under UN supervision, he has actively sought to acquire such weapons, expelled the inspectors and hidden the WMD he already had. After the defection of the head of his biological weapons program in 1995, Saddam Hussein was compelled to acknowledge that he had produced no fewer than 183 biological weapons in violation of the Agreement. Since 1998, he has repeatedly attempted to acquire weapons-grade uranium. He has replaced the original design for a nuclear warhead with a new design that could accommodate a Scud missile. Nine such missiles are still unaccounted for in the Iraqi inventory.

When Saddam Hussein attacked the unprotected Kurds in violation of the Agreement, the Coalition should have acted, immediately and decisively. But for the same reasons one hears now - concern about post-Saddam governance, anxiety among local allies over domestic reaction, fear of retaliation - the US could not marshal support for action at that time or at any time during the following decade in which Saddam Hussein flagrantly violated the Agreement that had allowed him to maintain his dictatorial power over Iraq. Indeed the US was barely able to keep the sanctions in place even after Saddam had threatened and expelled the inspectors. During those years, nothing changed - until 11 September 2001. What happened on that day had little to do with Iraq - but a great deal to do with the willingness to respond to the ongoing situation in Iraq.

So those who are looking for a “smoking gun,” or for something new in Saddam Hussein’s behavior that would compel us to act now, or for some link between al-Qaida and Iraq in order to justify a change of regime by force are looking in the wrong place. It is not new evidence that is driving the response now; I for one pray he hasn’t been able to get nuclear weapons, despite his best efforts. Rather there is a new resolve, and a new urgency.

For we must act now. In August 2002, former weapons inspectors for the UN testified that “the current leadership in Baghdad will eventually achieve a nuclear weapon in addition to their current inventories of weapons of mass destruction.” Once Saddam Hussein has nuclear weapons, the West will be deterred from using force to thwart an Iraqi move against it neighbors; the chances of an attack by terrorists using these weapons increases significantly; and Iraq’s neighbors will scramble to acquire nuclear weapons of their own.

If we could avoid Saddam Hussein’s acquisition of weapons of mass destruction through a combination of sanctions and inspections, I would surely favor this instead of war, in spite of the human cost an indefinite continuation of the sanctions would impose on the people of Iraq. But Saddam Hussein’s unique combination of vast wealth (which can quickly replace any weapons decommissioned under pressure), aggressive risk-taking, and resolute mendacity makes inspections hopelessly inadequate, even if they were to be continued indefinitely, which we all must know is impossible. Given the divided, impotent nature of the Western response to Saddam Hussein’s shredding of the Ceasefire Agreement and all the UN Resolutions that, pathetically, repeatedly called on him to respect its provisions without success, I see no grounds for confidence in a system of sanctions and inspections.

If we want to restore Iraq’s wealth to its people, to avoid nuclear proliferation, and to lessen the dangers of terrorism, Saddam Hussein cannot remain in power. If he cannot be persuaded to leave, he must be forced to leave.

Todd Gitlin, American sociologist and writer

If wishes were arguments, the strongest argument for an American war would be the most ambitious - the wish, or prayer, that by deposing Saddam Hussein and occupying Iraq, the US would instal a democratic regime in the Arab world, a regime that, in turn, would undermine the autocratic consensus that governs the region, reverse the fundamentalist Islamic movement and foster the growth of anti-fundamentalist tendencies everywhere. Such an outcome is devoutly to be desired. If only the wish sufficed!

But the world in which the wish would suffice is not the world we live in. An American war in Iraq is very unlikely to bring it about. What it is far more likely to bring about is carnage and more terror. The risks are far too great to justify war. Is it not an elementary truth that wars get out of control and are, after all, hellish? That’s why they must only be last resorts. There are simply too many ways in which an Iraq war could get out of control. In fact, the scenario most likely to bring about the use of weapons of mass destruction is precisely the one George W. Bush has been angling for: an attack on Saddam Hussein’s regime. The scenario most likely to bring about terror attacks - on Americans, too - is precisely the same. The scenario most likely to win recruits for al-Qaida is precisely the same.

Meanwhile, against Saddam Hussein’s future threats, there are substantial, not merely rhetorical, alternatives. The case for containment is strong. Smart sanctions (not the current blunderbuss kind), coercive inspections, and maintenance of the no-fly zones are the alternatives to war.

But let it be understood that Americans are indeed - as John le Carré hoped -”awakening to the shame of what is being done in their name.”

Don’t underestimate popular American conscience and sense. Understand that the American public has not been swept away by Bush’s bravado. Far from it. The latest national Knight Ridder poll, taken 3-6 January, finds only about a third of Americans supporting unilateral war - while 83% would support multilateral war with UN backing. And this after more than a year of drum-beating, jingoist Bush indoctrinating, and the panic induced by terror attacks.

On 16 January, by a vote of 46-1, the Chicago City Council “opposed a pre-emptive US military attack on Iraq unless it is demonstrated that Iraq poses a real and imminent threat to the security and safety of the United States”. The demonstrations are growing and deepening. The antiwar movement is getting out from under the sectarian left. Churches and unions are coming forward.

Recall, for that matter, that no American majority elected George W. Bush.

Surely this is a time to refresh the optimism of the will!

Meena Alexander, poet and academic of Indian origin

A cold day, the temperatures have dipped below normal. I see the black lattice work of winter trees, glisten of light on the street. Lines come to mind, by the poet Huda Naamani who wrote in Beirut in a season of war:

We will write our bodies with snow, the soul

remains a horizon

I imagine a woman in Baghdad. She waits for the bombs to fall. What is it like to live, waiting for bombs to fall?

She wakes in the morning light. She washes herself, combs her hair, touches her throat. She hears again the voice she heard in dreams. It is her own voice, torn from her body.

Here come back. It’s not safe out there. She is calling to her children. I gave birth to you and now you must come back.

But they do not hear her. When she wakes she sees the wall, the street. She understands you can’t turn time back.

I live far away from her, in the country that is sending thousands of young people to attack Iraq. Other means of change are possible, and may well be within arm’s reach. Why this massive military build-up? For oil? For a ghostly empire?

‘No blood for oil’ is the chant of thousands of antiwar demonstrators in cities across the United States and all over the world. It is a cry that needs to be heard.

If fire rains down on the heads of innocent people, if soldiers start fighting and people start dying as they will, how shall we continue our ordinary lives?

What will become of our so-called normalcy?

How will we cross the street, bring our children home from school, approach our lovers, bury our dead?

Steel from the twin towers was melted down, used to make a battleship. Is this what the new world brings?

Rather than the first war of a new century, we should make an effort to stitch together peace, a difficult and necessary peace. A harvest of light.

Somewhere on a city street a woman surrenders her scarves.

They are black. The wind blows them back.

Rukhsana Ahmad, writer and playwright of Pakistani origin

I am deeply troubled by this crisis which threatens to further divide and polarise people. It is bound to make our world a much more dangerous place.

No one wins a war: wars yield nothing but devastation, tragedy and deep smouldering hatred. Nor can a war resolve a problem conclusively. Afghanistan is a recent case in point. Poor Mr. Karzai has to depend on the US for his safety. It would be tragic if we, in the West, foolishly presumed that war is an easy option. It is never that.

I feel a kind of despair when I see the incredible might of the warmongers, the sophistication of their propaganda machine and their unwillingness to listen to reason. But, equally, I am encouraged by the extent of anti-war feeling in Britain. Despite the propaganda there is very little public support for this action. My faith in the wisdom of ordinary people is restored when I see the massive block of protest and resistance. It includes people from every faith, every race, every community, and of every political hue.

I have not as yet met anyone in real life, white, black or Asian, left, right, or centre, who actually wants this war. If our government here blatantly disregards public opinion and chooses to participate in the action, or even to bless it, it will be a real travesty of the spirit of democracy.

Arnold Wesker, dramatist

There seem to be two kinds of left-wing reasoning. (Many more, of course, it's in the nature of the left to fragment itself - which is both good and bad.) The kind that reasons all tyranny must be brought down; the kind that reasons anything the right supports must be wrong.

By March 1933 in Germany the Communists refused to join a United Front with the Social Democrats thus leaving the way free for Hitler to come to power. British Communists later opposed the war with Hitler because it had been declared by a right-wing government. They changed their minds when the Soviet Union entered the battle.

Having campaigned for years against the tyrannical Argentinean generals who slaughtered thousands, many unaccounted for - 'the disappeared ones' - the 'right-is- wrong' left then refused to support the war against Argentina's invasion of the Falklands because it was lead by the right-wing leader, Margaret Thatcher. She brought down the fascist generals, and democracy returned to the Argentine.

One of the most dangerous, murderous tyrants of recent times, Saddam Hussein of Iraq, has usurped the sovereignty of his people and dragged them through three bloody wars, one of them against his own Kurdish people. Bush and Blair are attempting to lead an international force to physically disarm and overthrow him.

The 'right-is-wrong' left opposes a war with Iraq.

I belong to that part of the left that reasons all tyranny must be brought down.

Donald Sassoon, historian and writer

Wars present many problems. One is that we never know what’s going to happen. For most of us, and this excludes genuine pacifists and Saddam-sympathisers, such knowledge would determine our support. Assume the ‘best scenario’: the inspectors find overwhelming evidence of the presence of weapons of mass destruction; the United Nations decide to intervene; the subsequent attack on Iraq kills very few people. Foremost among the casualties is Saddam Hussein himself. The whole operation is accompanied by a popular movement which establishes a genuine democracy in Iraq. Unlikely but not impossible.

Take a far darker outcome: though no weapons are found and without UN support, Bush attacks with Blair’s enthusiastic support; the war drags on for weeks, months even, with considerable ‘collateral damage’; what’s worse (from the point of view of western public opinion, so resilient when the dead are not theirs) body bags return in large numbers to London and Washington. And even worse: the inevitable skyrocketing of oil price makes driving prohibitive while the recession turns into a depression. The medium-term outcome is just as catastrophic: ‘friendly’, i.e. pro-Western governments are toppled throughout the Middle East which is swept by an unprecedented wave of Islamic fundamentalism; Israel proceeds to a massive ethnic cleansing of the West Bank; al-Qaida’s recruiting agents are besieged by applicants eager to join and die for the cause. Still gung-ho on the war? I don’t believe you.

The actual outcome is likely to be between these two poles; the precise point impossible to predict. But then, if we knew the outcome, there might never be wars. We certainly would not have had the first, perhaps not even the second, world war. So war is risky. But before you cast your vote, think seriously: who is risking? Whose children? Whose future?

Sonja Linden, playwright and theatre director

I have been feeling confused about my attitude to this proposed war - a lone and rather timid voice amongst all the people I know. I share their feelings about American dominance and the US’s profound abuse of its economic and military supremacy. Yet I have been amazed at the absence of concern for a totally oppressed population; there is almost no mention of it. All the talk is about whether action over Iraq is good or bad for 'us'.

My feeling is that all this resurgent energy against war should be directed to finding ways to aid populations in getting rid of regimes that murder and oppress them. The left's natural sympathies here have been skewered by virulent suspicion and hatred of the US. That's why people are clamouring for a United Nations lead; but the UN as it stands has proved to be a weak and much manipulated tool (not least by great powers like the US). In my opinion, changes are urgently needed in the functioning and remit of the UN, including reform of Security Council membership.

The premise for action in cases like Iraq is genocide. Along with the likes of Milosevic and Pinochet, we should be able to indict and extradite Saddam Hussein. Terror and murder of one's own population is in my mind a much more legitimate reason for intervening in another state than weapons of mass destruction (how to intervene is of course the next big question). So many states currently fall under that category and the world still stands by. So much for 'Never Again'!

We have more information now than at any other time in history about what is happening behind closed borders, and yet we are still paralysed. The current Iraq war hysteria has so many subtexts that the real issues are being totally fudged. The people of Iraq have suffered too long under this brutal regime. In this they share the fate of many countries in the Middle East and Africa. It is the casualties of these regimes that are washed up on Britain’s unwelcoming shores. These are the voices we should be hearing from now - the fugitives of hideous oppression.

Muqtedar Khan, American Muslim scholar

The war on Iraq may well be the first disaster of the century. This war, regardless of the rhetoric from Bush, Blair & Co., is an unjust war. Ironically if preemptive strikes are justifiable then Iraq at the moment may be justified in attacking the US and the UK who have been threatening to attack it for the last six months. Saddam has had access to chemical and biological weapons for over two decades, he used them against Iran (without any criticism from the US or UK) and he has used them against the Kurds, but he has never passed them on to any terrorists so far. It may sound strange but it is true, Saddam's record is his best defense.

An unjust war and prolonged occupation (direct colonialism) will generate intense anti-west sentiments, will alienate the US and UK and make them the most hated nations all over the world. As it is, anti-Americanism has become as global a phenomenon as Britney Spears.

The people of Iraq have suffered enough at the hands of Saddam Hussein and the US-UK sponsored sanctions. It is difficult to say who has killed more innocent people, Saddam or sanctions. I hope that all decent people in the world will stand up against this unjust war and let the war mongers know that the civilised world is not with them.

Lindsay Waters, editor at Harvard University Press

If one were of a biblical frame of mind, one might respond to openDemocracy’s question by asking another: what is a man profited if he shall gain the whole world and destroy the soul of his country? It is time to point out just how un-American Bush and his incompetent crew are. Behind the mask of this puppet we have a staff of right-wing fanatics totally out of line with the mainstream America they manipulate with a brazen braggadoccio that is, as our teens say, awesome.

The republican virtue of Lincoln and Eisenhower has been tattered by those who inherit the name. Would even my Republican mother, a supporter of Barry Goldwater in 1964, have supported these people? When Goldwater ran, his opponents warned the people should not be confused by his avuncular manner. If he were elected, he'd staff the White House with loonies who'd drop nuclear bombs on Vietnam. Well, look where we are today! I pray they will not prevail.

For in threatening war to realise their geopolitical fantasies, they would sell our very souls. I am worried about my soul. It is against the law, the moral law, to invade a foreign country that has not attacked you, just because they might sometime attack you. There is no connection between Iraq and 9/11. None. These fanatics are out on a limb. The whole lot of them needs to be confined, with their weapons taken away from them, until we can throw them out of office.

""Extremism in the defense of liberty is no vice,"" Goldwater taught us back then when the radical right was fighting as if it were a saving remnant. Now, it behaves like a Leninist vanguard leading by the nose people it regards as dumb or ""just following orders"". It is up to American liberals and leftists to stop talking as if Bush is dumb. Let him rather be accountable. We must demand he speak. He may be an agent of a faceless military-industrial complex, but he has a face and voice. We must demand that he stop hiding behind a bureaucratic iron curtain and explain himself. We have to insist on his individual responsibility - and our own.

Are there grounds for hope? In the last week, opinion polls have registered a 5% fall in Bush's popularity; some large surveys report only 24% supporting the war; 18 January saw a huge antiwar demonstration in Washington. I have confidence that the American people will reject this war. The idea that politics is contemptible has been promoted by zealots who want the general public to stop paying attention. America is an idea and an open practice; to work well, it needs the engagement of its citizenry. Americans need to become political again and take back their country. We will be answerable when the last days come.

Hugh Beach, retired general working for peace

There could be four good reasons for going to war with Iraq. The first would be if she waged aggressive war against another country, as against Iran in 1980-88, and against Kuwait in 1990-91. She poses no such threat at present. The second would be gross, flagrant and continuing abuse of human rights. Iraq suppressed a Kurdish revolt during the 1980s, using chemical weapons and systematically killing an estimated 100,000 men women and children. Though the regime remains abusive and tyrannical it is doing nothing like this. The third would be a direct and provable link with the attacks of 11 September 2001, such as led to the forcible ejection of the Taliban regime from Afghanistan by a US-led coalition, with UN endorsement, in 2001. Despite its best efforts the US has established no such connection. The fourth reason would be blatant refusal to comply with United Nations Security Council Resolutions, over a dozen years, in maintaining a covert stock of biological and chemical weapons. Western intelligence sources are sure that these exist and they are probably right. But action lies squarely in the hands of the UN Security Council and its investigators – UNMOVIC and the IAEA. Military deployments by the US and Britain have greatly strengthened their hand. But they must be given the time and intelligence assistance to find and, if necessary, to destroy these things. Unless and until the Security Council expressly so determines there can be no justification for bombing or invasion.

As the US and its allies prepare for war on Saddam by building up troops and military personnel in the Gulf to disarm Saddam of his arms of mass destruction, perhaps they should bear this in mind: Saddam is also busy preparing for war. When the US attacks him, he’ll retaliate and probably strike back by using those harmful weapons.

In this part of Africa I have friends young and old who are asking the following:

How destructive are Saddam’s weapons?

What effect could those weapons have on human life and the environment?

Has everything been done to avert this war?

Let those concerned with this war give it another thought, a thought for a peaceful resolution. Let them do so for the sake of the innocent, for Iraq’s women and children and for the sake of Iraq’s neighbours. Public opinion in Kenya is already worried about the possible repercussions of this war on our lives and on our crippled economy. Let this be known to the world, openDemocracy, and let us have some responses, please.

Hazhir Teimourian, commentator on the Middle East

If this war really does take place, it will save many more lives than it will cost, and millions of Iraqis (if no-one else) will show their gratitude for that. I’m not an Iraqi, but I shall rejoice with them as if I were.

As someone who has been warning the world about the ultimate ambitions of Saddam Hussein since 1973 - when I sneaked into northern Iraq to report on his preparations for his first war, on the Kurds - I am convinced that only the removal of this psychopath will prevent more conflicts in the future. When he waged his second war, on Iran in 1980, the world rightly felt reluctant to act to stop him, for that would have helped the only slightly less repugnant regime of the ayatollahs. But when the full extent of the gassing of over 280 Kurdish villages and small towns became clear in the summer of 1988, after the end of the war with Iran, surely there was then no excuse to tolerate the vile regime any longer.

To my disgust, and after my pleadings in BBC programmes and press articles, Mrs Thatcher’s government doubled Saddam’s Export Credit Guarantee to £320m a year, and the leader of the Labour Party, Neil Kinnock, refused even to add his name to a dozen other prestigious figures in a statement in The Times to condemn the gassings.

If resort had been made then to the 1948 Geneva Protocol on Genocide to overthrow Saddam, perhaps more than a million people would not subsequently have lost their lives: in the deportations and disappearances of some 180,000 Kurds, the eviction of the Iraqi army from Kuwait, the massacres of the Shia in the south of Iraq, the destruction of the Marsh Arabs, all those dead Iraqis who were deliberately deprived of food and medicines supplied by the UN in order to blame their deaths on sanctions.

Just before the war of 1991, the foreign minister of India asked me to advise him what position to take at the UN. When I failed to persuade him that backing Saddam would be a complete betrayal of Gandhi, under whose portrait we had just had lunch, he felt ashamed. ""I can’t oppose Saddam"", he said. ""If I do and he still ends up in possession of Kuwait, India will pay an extra £2bn a year in oil imports"". Now the pleadings of those two big sleazebags, Chirac and Putin, to bind America and Britain to their vetoes in the Security Council reminds me of that Indian minister and how politicians determine their moralities. Russia and France have been offered massive contracts to work for the survival of Saddam.

Twice recently, I have questioned Tony Blair in Downing Street. I do not know about George Bush, but I have the firm impression that Britain’s leader hates war and hates having to spend £4-5bn on overthrowing Saddam just as much. I’d rather be on his side than on the side of men like Chirac.

Ralph Giordano, German Jewish writer

You ask me where I stand?

My immediate reaction: any question about the Iraq crisis which mentions George W. Bush, but not Saddam, contains per se a tendentious answer. Which prompts me to ask back: ""And where do you stand?""

My second spontaneous reaction is to say: ""I am on Israel’s side, ladies and gentlemen, primarily on Israel’s side!""

No, I do not want this war, I dread it and its consequences – but I strongly oppose the impulse which lets the arch crook Saddam off the hook, leaving intact this terrible status quo, and delegating sole responsibility for the crisis to ""the Americans"". I am fed up to the point of nausea with the pathology of anti-Americanism and refuse to identify oil greed as the motive for the escalation of the crisis in the Middle East.

I am not a blind defender of the United States, and I have often raised my voice against a foreign policy which connived in the Cold War with all right-wing dictators around the globe. America, however, does not have one face. It has many. And it is a good thing to have America – I owe her my life after all, even though the 8th British Army liberated me on 4 May 1945.

I hope that Saddam will be defeated without a war – but he has to be defeated! And the UN must be behind it.

Again it rings true: pacifism in a non-pacifist world means nothing but the continuation of murderous and terrorist regimes. It cannot be the answer to the chief rogue Saddam Hussein.

Aaron Breitbart, Senior Researcher, Simon Wiesenthal Center

Saddam Hussein may be the most dangerous person on earth. I believe that President Bush understands that only too well, and realises that powerful steps must be taken to stop the Iraqi dictator. I cannot believe that those of America’s allies who do not share his views on this issue, are blind to the truth. They, quite simply, lack the political will to take the necessary measures to eliminate the threat that Saddam Hussein poses. Europe is certainly no newcomer to the policy of appeasement. The general tone of the policies of many of her component nations regarding the Middle East suggests that she has not only lost her will to confront the Iraqi dictator, but also her moral compass with regard to the Israeli-Palestinian conflict.

Ian McEwan - novelist

Ambivalence is not a useful sentiment on the brink of war, but my misgivings about military action have been tempered, or complicated, by the writing of various Iraqi exiles as well as the testimonies of those persecuted by the regime. Nor does it seem outlandish, the possibility of Saddam Hussein passing on weapons of mass destruction to the enemy of his enemies. In the right context, with the right ambitions, it could be a moral act to remove Saddam and his hideous entourage by force and restore Iraq to its people. By the right context, I refer to an attempt to begin the process of a focussed, creative and inclusive settlement to the Palestinian problem.

Naturally, it would require deep American involvement, if not leadership, and at present this is a remote prospect. But without such an initiative, and in the aftermath of the 9/11 attacks, the whole area is too unstable; it seethes with hatred. Mutual incomprehension between the Arab world and the West is at a new peak. Only last month, the mainstream Cairo press was repeating the story that the US itself destroyed the Twin Towers in order to have a pretext to attack Islam.

Meanwhile, the US Administration is vague about its post-invasion plans. There has been no forthright commitment to a democratic Iraq. This invites suspicion. Military action in the Middle East now could prompt any number of very undesirable, if not tragic, consequences. No one, no ‘expert’, can know what is going to happen. But I think it is safe to assume, given the present pandemic of irrationality, that this is not the best time to be going to war against an Arab nation.

For all that, I can’t say I’ve been much impressed by the integrity of the anti-war movement in Britain. Peace movements are of their nature incapable of choosing lesser evils. The failure to take an interest in, or engage with, Iraqi exiles, or the Iraqi National Congress meeting in London recently, was a moral evasion. All the more shameful when a large part of the INC embraces the liberal or libertarian and secular values that much of the anti-war movement professes. I keep hearing the raised voices of those very same people who preferred to leave the Taliban in power, and who were prepared to let the Kosovars rot in their camps on the borders of their homeland, and to let Serbian genocidal nationalism have its way. Why should we trust those voices now? Tony Blair, vilified at the time, played a tough hand in both those campaigns, and he was proven right. Far more would have suffered if nothing had been done. The “Bush’s poodle” charge this time round is lazy. It was the Blair-Powell axis of compromise that brought the US to the UN. Another empty argument I keep hearing is that it is inconsistent to attack Iraq because we are not attacking North Korea, Saudi Arabia and China. To which I say, three dictatorships are better than four.

To the waverer, some of the reasoning from the doves seems to emerge from a warm fug of illogic: that the US has been friendly to dictators before, that it cynically supported Saddam in his war against Iran, that there are vast oil reserves in the region - none of this helps us decide what specifically we are to do about Saddam now. The peace movement needs to come up with concrete proposals for containing him if he is not to be forcefully disarmed. He has obsessively produced chemical and biological weapons on an industrial scale, and has a history of bloody territorial ambition. What to do?

No one seriously disagrees about his record of genocide - perhaps a quarter of a million Kurds slaughtered, thousands of their villages destroyed, the ruthless persecution of the Shi’ites in the south, the cruel suppression of dissent, the widespread use of torture and summary imprisonment and execution, with the ubiquitous security services penetrating every level of Iraqi society. It is an insult to those who have suffered to suggest, as some do, that the US administration is the greater evil.

Nor does it advance the cause of peace to ignore the opportunity as well as the responsibility Saddam has, even at this late stage, to avoid a war. Those in the peace camp who argue for a complete military withdrawal from the area ignore the fact that the Kurds would face further genocide without the current protection of the no-fly zones. The peace movement does not have a monopoly of the humanitarian arguments.

As for the hawks, they have evasions of their own. There is a simple piece of arithmetic that they cannot bring themselves to do in public: given the vile nature of the regime and the threat it presents to the region, how many Iraqi civilians should we allow ourselves to kill to be rid of him? What is the unacceptable level?

The best argument for a pre-emptive invasion would be evidence of a recent nuclear weapons programme. So far, nothing has been found. Other questions do not dissolve because they are unanswerable: if nation building is too lowly a task for this US administration, what might follow from the break-up of the nation state of Iraq, an artifice devised and imposed last century by the British? What if a missile attack draws in the efficient and the bellicose Israelis? Will an invasion be al-Qaida’s recruiting sergeant? And might Saddam, the ‘serial miscalculator’ in Kenneth Pollack’s memorable phrase, take everyone down with him in a final frenzy of psychosis? To choose war is to choose unknown terrifying futures. Containment by perpetual inspection might be the duller, safer option.

Still, the hawks have my head, the doves my heart. At a push, I count myself - just - in the camp of the latter. And yet my ambivalence remains. I defend it by reference to the fact that nothing any of us say will make any difference: ambivalence is no less effective than passionate conviction.

At present, following the Blix and Powell reports to the UN Security Council, a war looks inevitable. One can only hope now for the best outcome: that the regime, like all dictatorships, rootless in the affections of its people, will crumble like a rotten tooth: that the federal, democratic Iraq that the INC committed itself to at its conference can be helped into existence by the UN, and that the US, in the flush of victory, will find in its olman’s heart the energy and optimism to begin to address the Palestinian issue. These are fragile hopes. As things stand, it is easier to conceive of innumerable darker possibilities.

Ghada Karmi, recent author of the memoir, ‘In Search of Fatima: A Palestinian Story’

This war is something no one wants, least of all an Arab and a Palestinian like myself. There is no rational reason why it should be prosecuted and no argument proffered to date has been convincing – certainly not the weapons of mass destruction argument, which has fallen flat on its face ever since the US showed itself willing to counter a real threat coming from North Korea with diplomacy and offers of economic and energy support. For Arabs, the tolerance shown to Israel’s brutality against the Palestinians and its known possession of nuclear and other weapons of mass destruction while castigating Iraq in the harshest and most bellicose of ways is nauseating. Many theories have been put forward to explain the American imperative to attack a country which is on its metaphorical knees and which poses not the faintest threat to the US or the West, but the real reason it seems to me lies in the West’s foolish policy towards Iraq, before and after 1991.

Having decided that Saddam Hussein was becoming a liability rather than the asset he had been during the 1980s, the US led a war designed to squash the Iraqi leader. But, despite stringent sanctions and a degraded country, he clung onto power and is a living monument to Western double-dealing and ineptitude. Iraq therefore poses a conundrum: how to resume normal business with it but have to stomach the fact that if Saddam stays in power, he will have ‘won’, and the US with all its might and power will have lost? This is unthinkable and, hence he must go, so as to enable the West deal with Iraq once more. The fact that this may get out of hand and drag the US (and Britain) into an Iraqi post-invasion quagmire is a nightmare which was not anticipated when the eagerness to teach Saddam a lesson first rose to fever pitch. If this ego-driven enterprise goes ahead, we will now all have to live with its dire consequences.

Nuha Al-Radi, Iraqi artist and writer

It comes as a big shock that in this age of supposed democracy, a country can be invaded, colonized and occupied in so blatant a manner – daisy-cuttered and e-bombed, all in the name of peace. And that it’s even feasible to look on, like at a play unfolding or something live on T.V. Even more extraordinary is the fact that this war on terror and all the so-called ‘Islamic’ terrorist activities that are taking place all over the world are the work of every nationality except Iraqi. There is no logic to this action, unless it is the logic of power and greed, hypocrisy and lies. These are the virtues and morals of the U.S. - the country that rules the world. It is morality driven by the black gold - oil.

I am a potter, sculptor, painter. I try to visualise things. Right now I am in Pakistan preparing for an exhibition. One of the journalists interviewing me asked me why my work did not depict Iraq – the million children dead, the results of 12 years sanctions, the damage left behind with the depleted uranium etc. During the first Gulf War I was in Baghdad and wrote a diary that was published. It was just every day life under bombardment, which later became just living and trying to mind one’s own business. I wished then that something could happen to the U.S., and now 12 years later a repeat is about to take place, on a now weak and battered nation, 22 million people trying to mind their business and live their lives.

A dictatorship within is to be replaced by a military occupation from outside. We already know how much (and how little) care is given later to helping put right the damage done. How can we hope for a different reality?

David Hayes, assistant editor, openDemocracy

The way that Iraqis will take possession of war to reach for inner liberation is the decisive element in the story that is unfolding. This will transform the field of political calculation, inside and outside the country.

There are no perfect choices. No one would wish to start from here. The complicity and misdeeds of western states and corporations are indeed extensive, and must in time be paid for.

Yet, overriding all other factors is one, whose immensity no current debate has begun fully to register. The Saddam Hussein regime is the most pathologically violent in the history of the Arab world. Destroying it will be an unequivocal service to the Iraqi people and to humanity.

The revolution that will follow in the minds and hearts of Iraqis – astonishing, liberating, and inevitable - will be definitive justification for the war that has freed them. In Iraqi memory, it will be indelible.

The aftermath will be convulsive. The nature of the dictatorship has prescribed its own fate. Every grotesque monument will fall, every statue in every town will be blown up, every mosaic or document with his inlaid handprint and inscripted blood will be torn apart. Every trace of the monster will be erased from Iraqi life. Soon, not a single Iraqi will be found who confesses the smallest allegiance to his memory.

There will be many dangers in this period. The need for massive food, health, and infrastructural aid from the military victors will be urgent. Territorial integrity and stable governance will require intense efforts of military, political, and civil society cooperation.

Behind them, the political victors, the Iraqi people, will begin the confusing and necessary task of remaking their society – and in an extraordinarily painful process, exploring the meaning of living with trust and freedom in everyday life.

Iraqis are about to reclaim an active role in their own country’s history. They will be seen and heard telling, in their own voices, the unimaginable stories of these unforgettable years.

In the process, they will write a new script that makes sense out of nationalist madness, as Cambodians, Rwandans, and Bosnians have done before them. Every power in the world, everyone concerned with politics, should read, respect, and engage with it.

Bahman Nirumand – Iranian author of ‘An Alien Amongst Germans’, and journalist in exile

The warmongering in Washington flows from an arrogance of power mixed with unlimited stupidity and ignorance. Nobody has any doubt that the US are capable of bulldozing Iraq with their gigantic military machinery, of killing hundreds of thousands and of taking control of the oilfields. However, they will not be able to quench the rising hatred and the wrath of the survivors. And this hatred and wrath will spread like a bushfire in the whole region and beyond. Nothing could provide a better basis for the fundamentalists and terrorist organisations.

A war against Iraq will jeopardise the partly artificially-drawn borders between states in the region. What if Iraq splits into several parts, if the Kurds found a new state, if the Shiites in Southern Iraq forge an alliance with their brothers in Kuwait, perhaps even in Iran, if the Wahhabite fundamentalists in Saudi Arabia chase away the king and the five hundred corrupt princes? Will the USA take the war to these countries as well? How many casualties do Bush and Rumsfeld find acceptable: a hundred thousand, two hundred thousand, more than a million? And what happens if Saddam Hussein, just as in Kuwait, sets the oilfields in Iraq alight?

According to international law no country has the right to use military force to cause regime change in another country. It cannot be denied that Saddam Hussein is a criminal, that he has total control over his people, that he is not only dangerous for his own country, but also for the neighbouring states. Nevertheless how would Americans react if Saddam Hussein decided to direct his weapons at the USA, to kill hundreds of thousands, to topple the government in Washington? Would the world allow him to do that if he had the power? After all the US possesses nuclear, biological and chemical weapons. If weapons of mass destruction justified a military attack, is it not Iraq who has the right to attack the United States, if only because it has not yet been proven to possess these weapons?

Should the USA in breach of international law and any humanitarian principle and in disregard of majority opinion at home and in the world really invade Iraq, they will begin a new era of global history, an era which encourages only the law of the fist. Is this the new global order, which President Bush and Mr Rumsfeld, Minister of Defense, want to confer upon us?

Sulak Sivaraksa, Thai activist and teacher

If one must summarise Buddhism in one word, then it would be ahimsa or non-violence. In order to act non-violently, one must overcome the three poisons of the mind and sources of violence - greed, hatred, and delusion - through mindfulness and loving kindness.

Non-violence does not mean inaction or omission. It requires continuous and active dialogue with others, and overcoming dualisms that pit ""us"" against ""them"", human against subhuman. It is the recognition that, in Gandhi's wise words, ""An eye for an eye just makes the whole world blind."" Is it really greed for oil and power in the Middle East that is blinding Bush and Blair, with the disarmament of Iraq as the deceitful but easily refutable pretext for war? Is it hatred that enables them to render 23 million Iraqis, already facing a humanitarian crisis after ten years of economic sanctions, faceless and reduce them to one hated figure, Saddam Hussein?

Another war would not only lead to unnecessary loss of life of hundreds of thousands of people, but also trigger a humanitarian disaster in Iraq. Is it the delusion of the lone superpower that makes it so impervious to the growing planetary sentiments against war on Iraq? War on Iraq would be unjust, destructive, and illegal. It would also diminish the faculties for critical self-reflection in the American and British governments, thus hindering the wisdom that is necessary for peace. It is very important to understand that non-violence is an effective and very powerful response to the present conflict.

Eyal Weizman, Israeli architect

Nobody has yet managed to provide a good explanation why - even in its own terms - America needs to go to war with Iraq.

Could it be that the true, missing relation between its rhetoric and its plans lies well beyond our ability to see only two steps ahead?

For the latter possibility I have a 1960s technophobic-fantasy version. Somewhere at the renovated Pentagon there is a giant computer that simulates possible scenarios when you press ‘play’. It is a kind of an ‘international relations laboratory’ that runs alternative futures in fast forward mode.

Maybe when they ran it often enough, it no longer came up with deadly urban warfare in Iraq, a massive humanitarian problem or a wave of global terrorism. Maybe Sharon withdrew from the West Bank and established Palestine. Maybe Iran, rubbing shoulders with half a million Americans, switched to the west again. Maybe Saudi Arabia brought science back into its textbooks.

This is a simple call for the American administration to come clean - and tell us what the end-game is (or put the software on the web), and why what we think will happen will not happen. In an age when even ‘good causes’ are questionable, how can we be expected to accept something whose relation to any cause or common-sense is so feeble? And yet we do.

It was about 9:30 p.m. when I left. From my relatively isolated apartments, it's about 10-15 minutes or so to downtown (Abilene has a population of about 110,000).

Right next to Camalott Communications' old location is a $1.50 movie theater. At the time, the place was featuring that masterwork of modern film, Mortal Kombat. I drove by the theater on the way into the center proper and pulled into an empty parking space.

Using the glow of the marquee to write out my check, I was startled to hear a knock on the driver's-side window of my car.

I looked over and saw two children staring at me from street. I need to describe them, with the one feature (you can guess what it was) that I didn't realize until about half-way through the conversation cleverly omitted.

Both appeared to be in that semi-mystical stage of life children get into where you can't exactly tell their age. Both were boys, and my initial impression is that they were somewhere between 10-14.

Boy No. 1 was the spokesman. Boy No. 2 didn't speak during the entire conversation -- at least not in words.

Boy No. 1 was slightly taller than his companion, wearing a pull-over, hooded shirt with a sort of gray checked pattern and jeans. I couldn't see his shoes. His skin was olive-colored and had curly, medium-length brown hair. He exuded an air of quiet confidence.

Boy No. 2 had pale skin with a trace of freckles. His primary characteristic seemed to be looking around nervously. He was dressed in a similar manner to his companion, but his pull-over was a light green color. His hair was a sort of pale orange.

They didn't appear to be related, at least directly.

""Oh, great,"" I thought. ""They're gonna hit me up for money."" And then the air changed.

I've explained this before, but for the benefit of any new lurkers out there, right before I experience something strange, there's a change in perception that comes about which I describe in the above manner. It's basically enough time to know it's too late. ;)

So, there I was, filling out a check in my car (which was still running) and in a sudden panic over the appearance of two little boys. I was confused, but an overwhelming sense of fear and unearthliness rushed in nonetheless.

The spokesman smiled, and the sight for some inexplicable reason chilled my blood. I could feel fight-or-flight responses kicking in. Something, I knew instinctually, was not right, but I didn't know what it could possibly be.

I rolled down the window very, very slightly and asked ""Yes?""

The spokesman smiled again, broader this time. His teeth were very, very white.

""Hey, mister, what's up? We have a problem,"" he said. His voice was that of a young man, but his diction, quiet calm and ... something I still couldn't put my finger on ... made my desire to flee even greater. ""You see, my friend and I want to see the films, but we forgot our money,"" he continued. ""We need to go to our house to get it. Want to help us out?""

Okay. Journalists are required to talk to lots of people, and that includes children. I've seen and spoken to lots of them. Here's how that usually goes:

""Uh ... M ... M ... Mister? Can I see that camera? I ... I won't break it or anything. I promise. My dad has a camera, and he lets me hold it sometimes, I guess, and I took a picture of my dog -- it wasn's very good, 'cause I got my finger in the way and ...""

Add in some feet shuffling and/or body swaying and you've got a typical kid talking to a stranger.

In short, they're usually apologetic. People generally teach children that when they talk to adults, they're usually bothering them for one reason or another and they should at least be polite.

This kid was in no way fitting the mold. His command of language was incredible and he showed no signs of fear. He spoke as if my help was a foregone conclusion. When he grinned, it was as if he was trying to say, ""I know something ... and you're NOT gonna like it. But the only way you're going to find out what it is will be to do what I say ...""

""Uh, well ..."" was the best reply I could offer.

Now here's where it starts to get strange.

The quiet companion looked at the spokesman with a mixture of confusion and guilt on his face. He seemed in some ways shocked, not with his friend's brusque manner but that I didn't just immediately open the door.

He eyed me nervously.

The spokesman seemed a bit perturbed, too. I still was registering something wrong with both.

""C'mon, mister,"" the spokesman said again, smooth as silk. Car salesmen could learn something from this kid. ""Now, we just want to go to our house. And we're just two little boys.""

That really scared me. Something in the tone and diction again sent off alarm bells. My mind was frantically trying to process what it was perceiving about the two figures that was ""wrong.""

""Eh. Um ...."" was all I could manage. I felt myself digging my fingernails into the steering wheel.

""What movie were you going to see?"" I asked finally.

""Mortal Kombat, of course,"" the spokesman said. The silent one nodded in affirmation, standing a few paces behind.

""Oh,"" I said. I stole a quick glance at the marquee and at the clock in my car. Mortal Kombat had been playing for an hour, the last showing of the evening.

The silent one looked increasingly nervous. I think he saw my glances and suspected that I might be detecting something was not above-board.

""C'mon, mister. Let us in. We can't get in your car until you do, you know,"" the spokesman said soothingly. ""Just let us in, and we'll be gone before you know it. We'll go to our mother's house.""

We locked eyes.

To my horror, I realized my hand had strayed toward the door lock (which was engaged) and was in the process of opening it. I pulled it away, probably a bit too violently. But it did force me to look away from the children.

I turned back. ""Er ... Um ...,"" I offered weakly and then my mind snapped into sharp focus.

For the first time, I noticed their eyes.

They were coal black. No pupil. No iris. Just two staring orbs reflecting the red and white light of the marquee.

At that point, I know my expression betrayed me. The silent one had a look of horror on his face in a combination that seemed to indicate: A) The impossible had just happened and B) ""We've been found out!""

The spokesman, on the other hand, wore a mask of anger. His eyes glittered brightly in the half-light.

""Cmon, mister,"" he said. ""We won't hurt you. You have to LET US IN. We don't have a gun ...""

That last statement scared the living hell out of me, because at that point by his tone he was plainly saying, ""We don't NEED a gun.""

He noticed my hand shooting down toward the gear shift. The spokesman's final words contained an anger that was complete and whole, and yet contained in some respects a tone of panic:

""WE CAN'T COME IN UNLESS YOU TELL US IT'S OKAY. LET ... US .... IN!""

I ripped the car into reverse (thank goodness no one was coming up behind me) and tore out of the parking lot. I noticed the boys in my peripheral vision, and I stole a quick glance back.

They were gone. The sidewalk by the theater was deserted.

I drove home in a heightened state of panic. Had anyone attempted to stop me, I would have run on through and faced the consequences later.

I bolted into my house, scanning all around -- including the sky.

What did I see? Maybe nothing more than some kids looking for a ride.

And some really funky contacts. Yeah, right.

A friend suggested they were vampires, what with the old ""let us in"" bit and my compelled response to open the door. That and the ""we'll go see our mother"" thing.

I'm still not sure what they were, but here's an epilogue I find chilling:

I talk about Chad a lot. He's still my best friend, my best ghost-hunting companion and an all-around cool guy. He recently moved to Amarillo, but at the time this happened was still living in San Angelo of Ram Page fame.

I called him and talked to him briefly. He had two female friends with him at the time, both professing some type of psychic ability.

I started telling him the story, leaving out the part about the black eyes for the kicker. One of the women (we were on a speakerphone) stopped me.

""These children had black eyes, right?"" she asked. ""I mean, all-black eyes?""

""Er ... Yes."" I said. I was a bit taken aback.

""Hmmm,"" she said. ""One night last week, I had a dream about children with black eyes. They were outside my house, wanting to be let in, but there was something wrong with them. It took me a while to realize it was the eyes.""

I hadn't even gotten as far as them wanting to come in.

""What did you do?"" I asked.

""I kept the doors and windows locked,"" she said. ""I knew if they came in, they would kill me.""

She paused.

""And they would have killed you, too, if you had let them into your car.""

So, from this extra-long post, we have three unanswered questions:

A) What did I see?

B) What would have happened if I opened my car door?

C) Why does Chad always get the cool psychic chicks? ;)

++++

Well, there you have it. I'll write some more later. But for now, your comments are welcomed as always.

**************************************************

Okay. Original's there. Now check this out:

I should preface this by saying that Jon Northwood is one of my very good Internet friends. A gentleman of high intelligence and candor, he's an investigator for SPIRIT, a pagan rights coordinator in his home state of Oregon and one of the nicest fellows I've ever met. He doesn't joke around about the paranormal.

Which is why this scares me to no end. I'm absolutely certain it's true.

Jon and I had never talked about the ""black-eyed kids"" before. In fact, he wasn't aware that I had an experience like his.

He swears that all of the text below is true.

I believe him

(I'm THOTH in the transcript, by the way.)

Webmaster's note: NOTE: Most off-topic dialogue was removed for length considerations, dialogue lines were rearranged for easier readability, and minor grammatical errors were corrected.

<JonNrthwd> So, do any of y'all really believe in ghosts? Or, for that matter, kids with funny eyes? (shiver -- never again, in downtown Portland at night . . .)

<Lykaon> kids with....wha?...

<Thoth> Er ... Jon. You know I do. And I believe in kids with funny eyes,

too. ;)

<Thoth> Did you see some?

<Nancy-> Well, I guess I believe in ghosts. And I have seen kids with funny eyes. :-)

<JonNrthwd> Yes -- a week ago -- downtown Portland about 2330.

<Lykaon> i believe in ghosts....kids...like the ones from village of the damned?...

<Thoth> Indeed. Do tell, Master Northwood.

<Lykaon> it was like a bunch of 6-8 year olds with glowing white eyes...

* Thoth hmmms. (The children he saw had black eyes. Assuming, of course, they had eyes at all.)

<Hellraisr> ah I remember that Thoth

<Hellraisr> remember u telling it

<Lykaon> jeez!

<Thoth> It was most disturbing.

<Lykaon> just regular kids but with black eyes...

<JonNrthwd> I was in downtown Portland (Oregon) after a seminar series on software development. I'd grabbed a bite of dinner about 10pm, and when I left it was about 11(ish). I'd grabbed a bite of dinner about 10pm, and when I left it was about 11(ish).

<JonNrthwd> I'd gotten in my car, locked and belted up and just started the

engine when someone tapped on my window.

<Thoth> This sounds ... incredibly familiar, Jon.

<JonNrthwd> I was in an above-ground garage on the third floor, so I wasn't too freaked (good lighting, still some people around).

<JonNrthwd> It was one of the guys from the conference, so I rolled down my window and asked him what was up.

<JonNrthwd> He wanted a ride around the block a few times, as he was freaked about who was standing outside his car.

<JonNrthwd> I figured (so sue me) that it was some of Portland's homeless, or some punker kids. So, being a good Samaritan, I let him in and we took off.

<JonNrthwd> We drove by his car, and there were three kids around it, two boys and a girl.

<JonNrthwd> The girl was . . . weird. Just freaky. Y'know, clothes and hair and makeup -- Goth-O-Matic. <g>

<JonNrthwd> The two kids were . . . I dunno . . . just scary as shit.

<Lykaon> thats goths for ya..heh..

<Lykaon> how old roughly?...

<JonNrthwd> She was probably fourteen or fifteen, the oldest boy was probably fourteen(ish) and the youngest between ten and twelve.

<JonNrthwd> She looked bored and was smoking a cigarette, the two boys were just leaning against the car.

<JonNrthwd> They looked _way_ too intense for kids.

<JonNrthwd> Anyway, I started itching behind my eyes, like I needed to really look at them, so, like an ass, I slowed down.

<JonNrthwd> BIG mistake.

<JonNrthwd> The two boys sauntered over and the girl stayed against the car.

<JonNrthwd> The eldest was on Doug's side (the guy from the seminar) and the youngest was on mine.

<JonNrthwd> I made sure the doors were locked (I love electronic locks) and asked why they were standing around his car.

<JonNrthwd> The young one said ""It's scary out there all alone, and we just wanted a ride home.""

<JonNrthwd> The eldest one said ""You promised you'd help us out"" and Doug said ""I don't even _know_ you.""

<JonNrthwd> By this time, I was really on edge -- I felt caught between throwing up and jazzing -- adrenaline does that to me.

<JonNrthwd> All of a sudden Doug said he was getting out of the car, and I told him not to. As soon as he reached for the handle, the two kids . . . I don't know how to say this right . . . they looked a _lot_ older.

<JonNrthwd> Their faces were somewhat drawn, and their eyes were _solid_ black. Edge to edge -- no pupil, no iris -- nothing. Just a liquid black pool.

<JonNrthwd> I just about wet myself, slapped the car into reverse and burned rubber backing about sixty feet away. They started running after the car, so I spun around one of the support struts and we took off. I kid you not -- I was convinced that if they got ahold of the car, I was going to die -- and not in anything approaching a pleasant fashion.

<JonNrthwd> Anyway, the oldest one was at the bottom of the garage when we came out, and almost made it to my side door.

<Lykaon> preservation instinct prevails yet again...

<JonNrthwd> We'd gone down from the third floor doing thirty-ish, maybe thirty-five around the ramp. He'd _beaten_ us down the stairs and onto the sidewalk.

<JonNrthwd> Anyway, we left him on the corner, and when I turned to look -- nothing. He was gone.

<JonNrthwd> Doug just about passed out.

<JonNrthwd> All of a sudden, the feeling of menace -- left.

<Lykaon> i've never heard of a sighting of those entities in human bodies tho i've had my speculation on the fact that it could happen...

<Hellraisr> did you ever go back there?

<JonNrthwd> We went back about ten minutes later, nobody was around his car.

<JonNrthwd> He got out, got in his car, and drove home.

<JonNrthwd> He'd said that he had met the young one earlier in the evening, and had said he'd take him home -- had even given him a short ride in his car to the seminar and told him to wait. Apparently, though, the older brother scared him, so he felt that all bets were off.

<JonNrthwd> I was behind him about forty-five feet when the feeling of *menace* hit again. At that moment, Doug misjudged going across an intersection on a yellow light and his car was hit by a truck. He was killed instantly.

<JonNrthwd> I gave a police report, and the whole time, felt _really_ freaked out and very exposed.

<The_JAmis> that's one freaky ass story :/

<JonNrthwd> I got back to my car, got in, locked the door, and waited.

<JonNrthwd> I saw the kids again, from about two blocks away.

<Hellraisr> wow

<JonNrthwd> I'm not making it up -- I'm not thinking they were ""vampires"" or something like that, but they weren't as pale, they weren't as skinny, and they felt a damn sight more menacing. I left, quickly.

<JonNrthwd> My only concern now, though, is that this upcoming Wednesday I'm going back to the area for another seminar, and I won't be leaving until 9:30.

<JonNrthwd> I'm _freaked out_, people.

As was I, for obvious reasons.

Okay, now, the commentary:

I've been haunted -- no pun intended -- by this story ever since I decided to share it. Rather than the ridicule I expected, it seems that it touches some sort of strange, primal chord in people.

I've been trying, of course, to move beyond and forget these events, but inevitably something comes along to remind me of it.

Apparently, I've become something of an urban legend. I have people ask me all the time on the Net: ""Hey, did you read the ghost story about the guy who saw the black-eyed kids who wanted to get in his car?""

""Yeah, that was me.""

""Really? Cool!""

""Not exactly.""

And that's something I can't seem to get the point across about. This was not ""cool."" It was not ""just like being in a Stephen King novel!"" or any of the inane comments that sometimes go along with it. It was real, though sometimes it made me feel crazy.

And now, I have a report from someone I trust that an extremely similar event has occurred -- and even resulted in the death of someone, at least indirectly.

In a word: Help?

I need thoughts. I need ideas. I need to calm down. ;) But beyond that ... I just want to know what people think about this?

I've protected myself in my own manner. I am not worried about any danger to me. But this is too close to what I experienced to be mere coincidence.

Your thoughts are welcomed.

https://www.snopes.com/fact-check/take-off-your-clothes/	"in the film aladdin, the hero whispers, ""good teenagers, take off your clothes."""	false	['Aladdin', 'Disney Films']	2000/04/24	David Mikkelson	['https://www.apnews.com/0376de994217a56d8abf8bcad9ad13b0', 'http://www.disneyvibe.com/movies/aladdin/script', 'https://en.wikipedia.org/wiki/Paul_is_dead']	https://www.apnews.com/0376de994217a56d8abf8bcad9ad13b0	https://www.apnews.com/	"Anna Runge, a mother of eight, was so enamored with Walt Disney Co. that she owned stacks of its animated home videos, a ``Beauty and the Beast″ blanket and a Disney diaper bag. ``Disney was almost a member of the family,″ she says.

Until, that is, an acquaintance tipped her off to a startling rumor: The Magic Kingdom was sending obscene subliminal messages through some of its animated family films, including ``Aladdin,″ in which the handsome young title character supposedly murmurs, sotto voce, ``All good teenagers take off your clothes.″

``I felt as if I had entrusted my kids to pedophiles,″ says the Carthage, N.Y., homemaker, who promptly threw the videos into the garbage. ``It’s like a toddler introduction to porn.″

By now, just about everyone has heard the rumors that so shocked Mrs. Runge. Indeed, Disney catapulted into the headlines a few weeks ago on reports that there are subliminal sexual messages in three popular Disney videos: ``The Lion King″ and ``The Little Mermaid,″ as well as ``Aladdin.″ The charges were reported around the world; TV news shows broadcast the offending snippets in slow motion, among them a scene from ``The Lion King″ in which dust supposedly spells out the word ``sex.″

Disney denies inserting any subliminal messages. And the three allegedly obscene sequences are hardly crystal clear; even using the pause button on a VCR, viewers may debate whether they exist. Yet they have quickly become the stuff of suburban myth, like the ``Paul is dead″ rumor from the heyday of the Beatles or the persistent allegations that Procter & Gamble Co.’s moon-and-stars logo symbolizes devil worship.

As the rumors spread, though, so did a common refrain: Where does this stuff come from? In the case of ``Aladdin,″ the allegation crisscrossed the country, traveling mostly through conservative Christian circles and helped by, among others, Mrs. Runge; a high-school biology class in Owensboro, Ky.; an Iowa college student; and a traveling troupe of evangelical actors. It was passed on by some people who didn’t believe it, by others who thought it was a joke, and by a Christian magazine that later _ and apparently to no effect _ retracted its story. At least two waves of the rumor swept the country, from very different starting points.

Most people probably first heard about the allegations in early September, after the Associated Press ran a story saying a Christian group had identified the three subliminally smutty incidents. The article described the ``Aladdin″ and ``The Lion King″ scenes as well as one in ``The Little Mermaid″ in which it said an avuncular bishop becomes noticeably aroused while presiding over a wedding ceremony.

Disney quickly fired back. ``If somebody is seeing something, that’s their perception. There’s nothing there,″ says Rick Rhoades, a Disney spokesman. Aladdin’s line is ``Scat, good tiger, take off and go,″ Disney says. The company maintains that Simba’s dust is just that, dust. And Tom Sito, the animator who drew the Little Mermaid’s purportedly aroused minister, says, ``If I wanted to put Satanic messages in a movie, you would see it. This is silly.″

The Associated Press, as it turns out, didn’t ferret out the story itself. It picked up the item from the Daily Press in Newport News, Va. The reporter on that story, Jim Stratton, himself stumbled on the allegations inadvertently. On a slow day at the end of August, Mr. Stratton, who at the time covered health and medicine for the paper, was casually flipping through a copy of Communique, a biweekly newsletter published by the American Life League, an antiabortion group based in Stafford, Va. He was struck by an article warning parents about a scene from ``The Lion King″ in which Simba, the cuddly lion star, stirs up a cloud of dust. ``Watch closely as the cloud floats off the screen,″ the newsletter instructed, ``and you can see the letters `S-E-X.‴

Bemused, Mr. Stratton called the league, where a spokeswoman told him about the illicit messages in ``Aladdin″ and ``The Little Mermaid.″ He decided to see for himself and gathered a dozen or so reporters around a newsroom TV to view ``The Lion King″ scene. They weren’t convinced. ``We didn’t make a final decision either way on what exactly people were seeing,″ he says. Still, he decided to write a breezy tongue-in-cheek article about all three incidents for his paper. ``We handled it lightly,″ he says.

Mr. Stratton’s source for the story, the American Life League, meanwhile, hadn’t actually found the alleged subliminal scenes itself, either. Its article was prompted by phone calls and letters from Christian groups. One of the callers had first read about the ``Aladdin″ allegation in the March issue of Movie Guide magazine, a Christian entertainment review based in Atlanta.

In a story titled ``Aladdin Exposed,″ Movie Guide alleged that, in a scene on the palace balcony with love interest Princess Jasmine and her pet tiger, Aladdin murmurs the ``take off your clothes″ line. The article likened the line to allegedly demonic messages in some 1970s rock songs that can only be heard when the albums are played backward. ``Thousands were seduced into following the suggestions of those same messages,″ the magazine wrote. It urged ``moral Americans″ to write to Disney’s chairman, Michael Eisner, asking him to remove the ``manipulative subliminal messages.″

Shearer used Twitter to indicate that he wouldn't be returning in upcoming seasons of the long, long-running cartoon, suggesting that his desire to work on other projects was the reason for the decision. The actor quoted Simpsons writer and producer James L. Brooks' lawyer, who reportedly said that while the ""show will go on, Harry will not be part of it.""

Seasons 27 and 28 of The Simpsons are due to enter production soon, but earlier this week, it was reported that Shearer was delaying the process by holding out on signing his contract. It's not yet clear exactly why the show has parted ways with the actor — while Shearer says he wanted ""the freedom to do other work,"" Simpsons voices have always appeared in other shows, movies, and projects. TMZ claims the move may have something to do with merchandising payments, but one thing's for sure: with his departure, The Simpsons loses the voice behind some of its biggest, best, and most memorable characters. After a 26-year run, and stripped of one of its greatest voices, maybe it's time to put the poor thing down.

AMERICA has entered one of its periods of historical madness, but this is the worst I can remember: worse than McCarthyism, worse than the Bay of Pigs and in the long term potentially more disastrous than the Vietnam war.

The reaction to 9/11 is beyond anything Osama could have hoped for in his nastiest dreams. As in McCarthy times, the domestic rights and freedoms that have made America the envy of the world are being systematically eroded.

The hounding of non-national US residents continues apace. 'Non-permanent' males of North Korean and Middle Eastern descent are disappearing into secret imprisonment on secret charges on the secret word of judges. US-resident Palestinians who were formerly ruled stateless, and therefore not deportable, are being handed over to Israel for 'resettlement' in Gaza and the West Bank, places where they may never have set foot before.

Are we playing the same game here in Britain? I expect so. Another 30 years and we'll be allowed to know.

The combination of compliant US media and vested corporate interests is once more ensuring that a debate that should be ringing out in every town square is confined to the loftier columns of the East Coast press: see page A27 if you can find and understand it.

No American administration has ever held its cards so close to its chest. If the intelligence services know nothing, that will be the best-kept secret of all. Remember that these are the same organisations who brought us the biggest failure in intelligence history: 9/11.

The imminent war was planned years before Osama bin Laden struck, but it was Osama who made it possible. Without Osama, the Bush junta would still be trying to explain such tricky matters as how it came to be elected in the first place; Enron; its shameless favouring of the already-too-rich; its reckless disregard for the world's poor, the ecology and a raft of unilaterally abrogated international treaties. They might also have to be telling us why they support Israel in its continuing disregard for UN resolutions.

But Osama conveniently swept all that under the carpet. Eighty-eight per cent of Americans want the war, we are told. The US defence budget has been raised by another $60 billion to around $360 billion. A splendid new generation of US nuclear weapons is in the pipeline, tailored to respond equally to nuclear, chemical and biological weapons in the hands of 'rogue states'. So we can all breathe easy.

And America is not only deciding unilaterally who may or may not possess these weapons. It also reserves to itself the unilateral right to deploy its own nuclear weapons without compunction whenever and wherever it considers its interests, friends and allies threatened. Precisely who these friends and allies are going to be over the next years will, as ever in politics, be a bit of a conundrum. You make nice friends and allies, so you arm them to the teeth. Then one day they're not your friends and allies any more, so you nuke them.

It is worth remembering here for just how many long hours, and how deeply, the US cabinet weighed the option of nuking Afghanistan in the wake of 9/11. Happily for all of us, but for the Afghans in particular whose complicity in 9/11 was much less than Pakistan's, they decided to make do with 25,000 ton 'conventional' daisy-cutters, which by all accounts deliver as much clout as a small nuke anyway. But next time it'll be for real.

Quite what war 88% of Americans think they are supporting is a lot less clear. A war for how long, please? At what cost in American lives? At what cost to the American taxpayer's pocket? At what cost -- because most of those 88% are thoroughly decent and humane people -- in Iraqi lives? It is probably by now a state secret, but Desert Storm cost Iraq at least twice as many lives as America lost in the entire Vietnam war.

How Bush and his junta succeeded in deflecting America's anger from Osama bin Laden to Saddam Hussein is one of the great public relations conjuring tricks of history. But they swung it. A recent opinion poll tells us that one in two Americans now believes Saddam was responsible for the attack on the World Trade Centre.

But the American public is not merely being misled. It is being threatened, bullied, browbeaten and kept in a permanent state of ignorance and fear, with a consequent dependence upon its leadership. The carefully orchestrated neurosis should, with any luck, carry Bush and his fellow conspirators nicely into the next election.

Those who are not with Mr Bush are against him. Worse -- see his speech of January 3 -- they are with the enemy. Which is odd, because I'm dead against Bush, but I would love to see Saddam's downfall -- just not on Bush's terms and not by his methods. And not under the banner of such outrageous hypocrisy.

Old-style American colonialism is about to spread its iron wings over all of us. More Quiet Americans are slipping into unsuspecting townships than at the height of the Cold War.

The religious cant that will send American troops into battle is perhaps the most sickening aspect of this surreal war-to-be. Bush has an arm-lock on God.

And God has very particular political opinions.

God appointed America to save the world in any way that suits America.

God appointed Israel to be the nexus of America's Middle Eastern policy, and anyone who wants to mess with that idea is: a) anti-Semitic, b) anti-American, c) with the enemy, and d) a terrorist.

God also has pretty scary connections. In America, where all men are equal in His sight, if not in one another's, the Bush family numbers one President, one ex-President, one ex-head of the CIA, the governor of Florida and the ex-governor of Texas. Bush Senior has some good wars to his credit, and a well-earned reputation for visiting America's wrath on disobedient client states. One little war he hand-launched was against his own former CIA pal, Manuel Noriega of Panama, who served him well in the Cold War but got too big for his boots when it was over. Power doesn't come much more naked than that, and Americans know it.

Care for a few pointers?

George W Bush. 1978-84: senior executive, Arbusto Energy/Bush Exploration, an oil company. 1986-1990: senior executive of the Harken oil company.

Dick Cheney. 1995-2000: chief executive of the Halliburton oil company.

Condoleezza Rice. 1991-2000: senior executive with the Chevron oil company, which named an oil tanker after her.

And so on.

But none of these trifling associations affects the integrity of God's work. We're talking honest values here. And we know where your children go to school.

In 1993, while ex-President George Bush was paying a social visit to the ever-democratic Kingdom of Kuwait to receive their thanks for liberating them, somebody tried to kill him. The CIA believes that 'somebody' was Saddam Hussein. Hence Bush Junior's cry: 'That man tried to kill my Daddy.' But it's still not personal, this war. It's still necessary. It's still God's work. It's still about bringing freedom and democracy to the poor, oppressed Iraqi people.

To be an acceptable member of the Bush team it seems you must also believe in Absolute Good and Absolute Evil, and Bush, with a lot of help from his friends, family and God, is there to tell us which is which. I think I may be Evil for writing this, but I'll have to check.

What Bush won't tell us is the truth about why we're going to war. What is at stake is not an Axis of Evil -- but oil, money and people's lives. Saddam's misfortune is to sit on the second biggest oilfield in the world. Iran's, next door, is to possess the world's largest repositories of natural gas. Bush wants both, and who helps him get them will receive a piece of the cake. And who doesn't, won't.

If Saddam didn't have the oil, he could torture and murder his citizens to his heart's content. Other leaders do it every day -- think Saudi Arabia, think Pakistan, think Turkey, think Syria, think Egypt -- but these are our friends and allies.

In reality, I suspect, Baghdad represents no clear and present danger to its neighbours, and none to America or Britain. Saddam's weapons of mass destruction, if he's still got them, will be peanuts by comparison with the stuff Israel or America could hurl at him at five minutes' notice. What is at stake is not an imminent military or terrorist threat, but the economic imperative of American growth.

What is at stake is not -- as presently offered -- a handful of empty rocket-heads, but America's need to demonstrate its over-arching military power to all of us -- to Europe and Russia and China, and poor mad little North Korea, as well as the Middle East; to show who rules America at home, and who is to be ruled by America abroad.

The most charitable interpretation of Tony Blair's part in all this is that he believed that, by riding the tiger, he could steer it. He can't. Instead, he gave it a phoney legitimacy, and a smooth voice. Now I fear, the same tiger has him penned into a corner, and he can't get out. Ironically, George W himself may be feeling a little bit the same way.

In One-Party Britain, Blair on a lousy turnout was elected supreme leader by about a quarter of the electorate. Given the same public apathy and the continued dismal showing by the opposition parties at the next election, Blair or his successor will achieve similar absolute power with an even smaller proportion of the vote. It is utterly laughable that, at a time when Blair has talked himself against the ropes, neither of Britain's opposition leaders can lay a glove on him. But that's Britain's tragedy, as it is America's: as our governments spin, lie and lose their credibility, and the supposed parliamentary alternatives to them merely jockey for their clothes, the electorate simply shrugs and looks the other way. Politicians can never believe how little they deceive us.

So the point in Britain is not which political Party will form a government after the looming shambles, but who will be in the driving seat.

Blair's best chance of personal survival must be that, at the eleventh hour, world protest and an improbably emboldened UN will force Bush to put his gun back in his holster unfired. But what happens when the world's greatest cowboy rides back into town without a tyrant's head to wave at the boys?

Blair's worst chance is that, with or without the United Nations, he will drag us into a war that, if the will to negotiate energetically had ever been there, could have been avoided; a war that has been no more democratically debated in Britain than it has in America or the UN. By doing so, Blair will have helped provoke unforeseeable retaliation, great domestic unrest, and regional chaos in the Middle East. He will have set back our relations with Europe and the Middle East for decades to come. Welcome to the party of the Ethical Foreign Policy.

There is a middle way, but it's a tough one: Bush dives in without UN approval and Blair stays on the bank. Goodbye to the Special Relationship.

The stink of religious self-righteousness in the American air recalls the British Empire at its worst. Lord Curzon's cloak sits poorly on the shoulders of Washington's fashionably conservative columnists. I cringe even more when I hear my Prime Minister lend his Head Prefect's sophistries to this patently colonialist adventure. His very real anxieties about terror are shared by all sane men. What he can't explain is how he reconciles a global assault on al-Qaeda with a territorial assault on Iraq.

We are in this war, if it takes place, in order to secure the fig-leaf of our special relationship with America, to grab our share of the oil pot, and because, after all the public hand-holding in Washington and Camp David, Blair has to show up at the altar.

'But will we win, Daddy?'

'Of course, child. It will all be over while you're still in bed.'

'Why?'

'Because otherwise Mr Bush's voters will get terribly impatient and may decide not to vote for him after all.'

'But will people be killed, Daddy?'

'Nobody you know, darling. Just foreign people.'

'Can I watch it on television?'

'Only if Mr Bush says you can.'

'And afterwards, will everything be normal again? Nobody will do anything horrid any more?'

'Hush, child, and go to sleep.'

Last Friday an American friend of mine in California drove to his local supermarket with a sticker on his car saying 'Peace is also Patriotic'. It was gone by the time he'd finished his shopping.

One image of a bullet-pocked target is labelled “Group therapy—sometimes it works.” Others show a masked figure brandished a handgun and hunting knives.

Before a mass shooting erupted at Cruz’s former high school on Wednesday, most classmates thought of the 19-year-old as no more than “creepy and weird.”

Before 6AM on Thursday, he was formally booked into Broward County jail charged with 17 counts of premeditated murder.

Law-enforcement officials believe he attacked Marjory Stoneman Douglas High School in Parkland, Florida, on Wednesday.

The teens who knew Cruz at the school were stunned. They described Cruz as an awkward “outcast”—someone who had trouble fitting in at Douglas High. But they never saw a mass murderer in the making.

“I knew him to be passive aggressive but not violent. He was rude to people. He had an act up like he was tough. He never got into, like, physical fights with anyone, but he did get into verbal arguments,” 17-year-old Ocean Parodie told The Daily Beast. “I just thought he dropped out of school, I didn’t think he would do anything. He always kept a low profile.”

“He was definitely not accepted at our school socially. People saw him as someone who was different than the normal people at our school,” Parodie added.

Douglas High has a place students call “the Emo Gazebo,” he said. “That’s where all the kids that are considered weird or not accepted sat. Kids at the Emo Gazebo didn’t even accept him there. He was just an outcast... He didn’t have any friends.”

Cruz always had his hair short and had a penchant for wearing patriotic shirts that “seemed really extreme, like hating on” Islam, Parodie said. The suspected gunman would also deride Muslims as “terrorists and bombers.”

“I’ve seen him wear a Trump hat,” the student said.

“Most kids ignored him at school. They pushed him off to the side as if he was garbage. He screamed in class one time. He was upset and just started yelling at the teacher. The teacher was trying to help him and he just took it the wrong way,” Parodie continued.

One student told the Miami Herald that he was expelled and told never to return to the school wearing a bag, after bullets were found in his backpack, but that has not been confirmed by officials.

Friends and family said both of Cruz’s parents, who adopted him at birth, had died—his mother late last year—and he moved in with a friend’s family after being expelled from school.

Jim Lewis, an attorney representing the suspect, told the Sun Sentinel that he already owned the AR-15, which he bought legally, when he moved in to the house around Thanksgiving. “It was his gun,” he said. “The family made him keep it in a locked gun cabinet in the house but he had a key.”

Lewis said the family had encouraged Cruz to continue his education and that he had a job at a dollar store. “The family is devastated, they didn’t see this coming. They took him in and it’s a classic case of no good deed goes unpunished,” he said. “He was a little quirky and he was depressed about his mom’s death, but who wouldn’t be?”

Ocean Parodie’s 15-year-old sister, Milan, had a similar impression of Cruz as her brother.

“I could tell he tried to be social at times but there was something off about him,” she said. “I never really saw him with many people. Girls thought he was creepy and weird. He was pretty pale with red hair. I didn’t talk to him that much, but from what I could tell he wasn’t a nice kid. He wore a lot of black and was always alone.”

Still, Milan Parodie described Cruz as “always enthusiastic... He never seemed depressed or sad. He was always a little crazy is the best way to put it... He was peppy but not in a good way, in a crazy way. He tried to look creepy or weird, I think. He tried to talk to one of my girlfriends and he said she was cute, but she was weirded out and he was bothering her.”

“ Most kids ignored him at school. They pushed him off to the side as if he was garbage. ” — Ocean Parodie

“Honestly, a lot of people were saying that it was gonna be him,” one student told WJXT of Cruz. “Actually, a lot of kids joked... saying that he was gonna be the one to shoot up the school, but it turns out, you know, everyone predicted it, that’s crazy.”

The student added: “He was in the third floor. He knows the school layout, he knows where everyone would be... he’s been in the fire drills. He’s prepared for this stuff.”

Another student told WFOR-TV that Cruz “always had guns on him.”

“He was off,” Giovanni Watford, 17, told BuzzFeed News. “He was super stressed-out all the time and talked about guns a lot and tried to hide his face.”

Watford told the site he had been in the same Junior ROTC program as Cruz and that Cruz would complain about bullying at Douglas High.

Broward County Sheriff Steve Israel told reporters the suspect was a former student of the school who was expelled for “disciplinary reasons.” Math teacher Jim Gard told the Miami Herald that Cruz was identified as a threat to the school in previous years.

“We were told last year that he wasn’t allowed on campus with a backpack on him,” Gard said. “There were problems with him last year threatening students, and I guess he was asked to leave campus.”

Helen Pasciolla, a former neighbor of Cruz, told The New York Times that he had told her his family had been forced to sell their house in the upscale neighborhood because of money problems. She also told the paper both Cruz and his brother were adopted and their adoptive father had died.

Their mother, Lynda Cruz, would call the police to try to help deal with the boys’ behavioral problems, Pasciolla told the Times.

“I think she wanted to scare them a little bit,” she said. “Nikolas has behavioral problems, I think, but I never thought he would be violent.”

Broward County Public Schools superintendent Robert Runcie told reporters outside the school he was unaware of previous concerns about the student. “We received no warnings,” he said. “Potentially there could have been signs out there. But we didn’t have any warning or phone calls or threats that were made.”

Ocean Parodie, for his part, felt bad for Cruz—and visited him after he was thrown out of Douglas High.

“After he got expelled he worked at a Dollar Store next to the movie theater,” Parodie said. “I went there and asked him what happened once. He said he was expelled and was happy that he was thrown out. I felt bad for him. I think just to treat someone differently [for] how they look is wrong, so I tried to treat him like I treat everyone else.”

Parodie was in anatomy class on Monday afternoon when he saw his fellow students running away. Then he heard the fire alarm go off—minutes before school was supposed to end.

“One stairway was crowded, so I went down a different stairway, and I heard shots. That’s when I knew something was up and it wasn’t a drill. I made it outside. I was one of the first people to make it outside. Teachers were asking what was going on, the administrators didn’t know what was going on. Once they had an idea of what’s going on they sent us to the middle school next to our school. We walked near a canal to stay away from the school in case it showed up.”

A few hours later, Parodie realized the outcast he had pitied was the person who had just executed his schoolmates.

“I found out it was him when the news said who it was. I was like, ‘Oh man, I can’t believe it’s him.’”"	Florida School Shooting Suspect Nikolas Cruz Was ‘Creepy and Weird,’ Survivors Say	2018-02-14 21:49:49+00:00	['Taylor Lorenz']	['think', 'family', 'school', 'nikolas', 'cruz', 'florida', 'didnt', 'kids', 'survivors', 'tried', 'say', 'creepy', 'student', 'parodie', 'suspect', 'shooting', 'weird', 'told']	"He never got into, like, physical fights with anyone, but he did get into verbal arguments,” 17-year-old Ocean Parodie told The Daily Beast.

National Historic Landmark

National Register of Historic Places

Virginia Historic Landmark



Sherwood Forest Plantation was the home of the 10th U.S. President John Tyler from 1842 until his death in 1862. Sherwood Forest Plantation has been the continuous residence of the Tyler family since the President purchased it in 1842. Known to be the longest frame house in America, it is over 300 feet long. Sherwood Forest Plantation reflects the lifestyle of this mid-19th century Presidential family. Beautifully wooded landscape and 12 dependencies surround President Tyler's home. Sherwood Forest Plantation's grounds are open 9:00 am-5:00 pm daily. Located on State Rt. 5, 14501 John Tyler Highway, Charles City, VA. 30 minutes from Williamsburg and 45 minutes from Richmond. 804-829-5377. 3 miles west of the courthouse in Charles City County - Tyler Country. John Tyler was the first vice president to ascend to the presidency upon the death of 9th President, William Henry Harrison. The plantation, first recorded in a 1616 land grant, was originally known as Smith's Hundred. The house, circa 1720, is a classic example of Virginia Tidewater design: big house, little house, colonnade, and kitchen. It had several owners before Tyler purchased the home and its surrounding 1,600 acres in 1842. He bought the plantation from his cousin, Collier Minge, while he was still in the White House and renamed the plantation ""Sherwood Forest"" referring to his reputation as a political outlaw. The Tyler family still maintain the plantation today through the Sherwood Forest Plantation Foundation. Their children and grandchildren frequently are seen at the Plantation. Sherwood Forest Plantation remains the longest frame house in America -- expanded to its present length of over 300 feet in 1845 when Tyler added a 68-foot ballroom catering to the popular dance of his time, the Virginia Reel. The grounds are 25 acres of terraced gardens and lawn based on the landscape designs of Andrew Jackson Downing of New York and include original outbuildings or dependencies. It is considered one of the most complete plantation yards left in America, dating from c. 1680. Please enjoy your visit to our WWW site.

Texas school system warns its students will get 3-day suspension for protests during school

(CNN) Students around the United States are walking out of class to demand tougher gun laws in response to last week's deadly shooting in Parkland, Florida, but some schools are threatening them with harsh punishments.

The Needville Independent School District in Texas issued a warning Tuesday that anyone who participated in a walkout or other political protest would be suspended for three days.

""Life is all about choices and every choice has a consequence whether it be positive or negative. We will discipline no matter if it is one, fifty, or five hundred students involved. All will be suspended for 3 days and parent notes will not alleviate the discipline,"" Superintendent Curtis Rhodes said in a statement posted on the Needville High School Facebook page.

Rhodes said the Houston-area district would not tolerate any protests or demonstrations during school hours.

""A school is a place to learn and grow educationally, emotionally and morally. A disruption of the school will not be tolerated,"" he said.

A Quarter Century of Disinformation Exclusive commentary by Greg Lewis

March 2, 2004







It's a methodology which has a long history but which has been particularly effective in the U.S. since the late 1960s. It turns out that the media versions of many important events for more than a quarter century have often borne very little relation to the events themselves. John Kerry's involvement in those events, particularly in the aftermath of the War in Vietnam, is one of the elements of that story.



A few weeks ago in a column about Kerry, I referred to what has turned out to be an ""urban legend."" Specifically, based on a ""news"" item that appeared on NewsMax.com, I repeated a reference to a volume of memoirs supposedly published by North Vietnamese General Vo Nguyen Giap in 1985 as the source of an assertion by Colonel Oliver North. After a reader requested a reference to Giap's 1985 ""Memoirs,"" I did research that convinced me no such volume exists. For that matter, I haven't been able to verify through Fox News that Colonel North actually made the comments he is said to have made and which I repeated. My apologies to Colonel North and to WashingtonDispatch.com readers for including inadequately verified material in my piece on Kerry.



What has emerged for me from all this, however, is something truly bizarre having to do with verifiable and unverifiable reportage and commentary. On the one hand, the current President of the United States (with the backing — depending on which week's polls you refer to and how the poll questions are loaded — of anywhere from just above half to well over 70 percent of the American people) has conducted enormously successful and necessary wars and subsequent police actions in Afghanistan and Iraq. The same was true in the late 1960s and early '70s: Popular support in America for the War in Vietnam held consistently above 50 percent through the end of the war.



On the other hand, as in the Vietnam era, U.S. tactical and strategic successes in Iraq are barely even mentioned in most of the media. The print and broadcast headlines represent such a disconnect from reality that, in the words of comedian Lewis Black, ""It makes you want to stick a pencil in your ear!"" This is the understandable response of someone encountering truly schizophrenic behavior just before realizing that the behavior is actually psychotic and is comprehensible only as such.



And the behavior of the media is at best borderline psychotic, at worst certifiable. News headlines and Op Eds veritably scream out the ""fact"" that the President duped the country into going to war in Iraq on the false pretense of trying to prevent the spread (and the use against the United States) of weapons of mass destruction, which weapons obviously didn't exist, since we haven't been able to sift through every grain of desert sand in Iraq in the past eight months and actually find them. Those same headlines then turn around and announce the story of talks in North Korea aimed at forestalling that dictatorship's further development and deployment of, you guessed it, weapons of mass destruction.



In Pakistan the story is even scarier. The founder of Pakistan's nuclear weapons program, Abdul Qadeer Khan, has admitted to transferring nuclear weapons technology to Iran, Libya, and North Korea. Wonder if Khan had any dealings with Saddam Hussein or members of his regime? I know it sounds preposterous, but people who sell the secrets of how to make nuclear weapons on the black market don't much care who they sell them to. Not everyone believes this, but guys like Khan are bad guys, and their intentions and those of the people who now possess nuclear weapons capability because of them, are not honorable nor beneficent toward the United States.



The point is that you often don't read stories like this in the papers or see them on TV. And if you do, they'll be right alongside other stories bludgeoning you over the head in order to get you to believe that the threat of weapons of mass destruction was not sufficient grounds for going to war with Iraq. Makes you want to stick a pencil in your ear!



Now, what does this have to do with John Kerry and George Bush and Vietnam and the Air National Guard? The same schizophrenia prevails with regard to that story. To repeat: As in the late 1960s and early '70s, media reportage of today's events often has very little to do with the events themselves. Let's see . . . George W. Bush was in the National Guard, flew planes, and at least took the risk that he might be called up for service in Vietnam; more than a thousand reservists and national guardsmen were killed in that conflict, although one gets the idea that for John Kerry and the press corps they were somehow not really soldiers, since they weren't ""regular army."" During the same period, after his discharge from the service (and even during the time he was on active duty), Kerry was a principal in one of the most virulent antiwar groups this country has ever known, and he gave testimony about supposed atrocities committed by our troops in Vietnam.



The media bought it hook, line, and sinker at the time. And while lapping up Kerry's witness about American atrocities, they all but ignored the Hue massacre committed by the North Vietnamese against the South. The Hue massacre of more than 3,500 Vietnamese civilians, you'll recall — wait, you probably won't recall, because Walter Cronkite et al. hushed it up — was perpetrated when the battle for the town of Hue turned against the Vietcong, who proceeded to slaughter the men, women, and children of several villages surrounding the besieged city when they discovered that South Vietnamese support for their cause was less than expected. After the Hue massacre it was understood among the South Vietnamese that, as local provincial chief Le Van Than said at the time, ""the Vietcong would kill them, regardless of their political belief.""



America never suffered a military defeat in Vietnam. The infamous 1968 Tet Offensive resulted in the deaths of tens of thousands of enemy troops (for those of you who don't remember, ""enemy"" refers to North Vietnamese troops and not, as Kerry and the media of the time tried to convince us, American troops). As Victor Davis Hansen has recounted in The American Legion Magazine (September, 2003) North Vietnamese Commander General Vo Nguyen Giap told a French television interviewer that ""his most important guerrilla ally during the war was the America press.""



George W. Bush is the person who, by his courageous and undaunted response to the use of weapons of mass destruction against the United States (a jetliner loaded with fuel qualifies as such a weapon if it's crashed into a building with the intent to kill thousands of people) has uncovered a viper's nest of WMD traffickers of heretofore unimagined proportions and complexity. I know that we can trust President Bush not to turn on his country and somehow declare that we are the ones guilty of atrocities in the current conflict. The President's patriotism is definitely not the issue.



The kicker is, however, that, aided and abetted by journalistic media, this message is not getting delivered.

One thing John Kerry's insistence on focusing attention on his and George W. Bush's military records has done is to give us the opportunity to revisit the Vietnam War era, if not to have it practically shoved down our throats. And among the things that has accomplished is to bring to light the perpetuation of a campaign of lies and disinformation that has been waged in and by print and broadcast media.It's a methodology which has a long history but which has been particularly effective in the U.S. since the late 1960s.

Vo Nguyen Giap is perhaps the most important figure in the early history of communist Vietnam -- with the exception of Ho Chi Minh. At the end of World War II, Ho named Giap commander in chief of the Viet Minh forces fighting French colonial rule. Giap orchestrated the defeat of the French at the battle of Dien Bien Phu in 1953 and remained minister of defense of the newly independent Democratic Republic of Vietnam. He was the chief North Vietnamese military leader in the subsequent war against U.S. forces. This interview, which was conducted in May 1996, has been translated from Vietnamese.

On the battle of Dien Bien Phu:

The Dien Bien Phu campaign is a great and first victory of a feudal colonial nation, whose agricultural economy is backward, against the great imperialist capitalist which has a modern industry and a great army. Thus, it means a lot to us, to people all over the world, and to other countries. This is also how Ho Chi Minh saw it.

We see the Dien Bien Phu victory as the victory [over] the French army and [over] the intervention of the Americans --because in the Dien Bien Phu campaign, 80 percent of the war expenditures were spent by the Americans. The Americans had their hands in it. So the Dien Bien Phu defeat was a defeat for both the French and the Americans. But whether the Americans had drawn the lessons from that, I don't think so. That's why the Americans continued in South Vietnam. ...

When we received news of the Dien Bien Phu victory, everyone practically jumped up in the air, they were so happy about it. But Ho Chi Minh said that this is only victory of the first step: we have yet to fight the Americans. It was very clear then.

On the United States' involvement in Vietnam:

In 1945, some Americans parachuted into our war zone [for a] meeting [with] our late President Ho Chi Minh. ... Back then, President Roosevelt's attitude was that the U.S. did not want to see events like the war with France coming back to Indochina, but later this attitude was changed. After the August Revolution in 1945, the relationship between Vietnam and the U.S. could have been good, and we wished that it had been good.

Then only the intelligent people or those with vision and wisdom, such as Eisenhower, ... saw the impracticality of the [domino] theory. And any mistakes were due to following the domino theory. They thought that if the theory was put into practice here, it would become the pivotal location for [preventing] the spread of communism to the whole Southeast Asia. So Vietnam was made the central location to check the expansion of communism, and this was what President Kennedy believed, and it was mistake. ...

The Americans sent advisers to each and every division in the South Vietnamese [army] before 1965. In 1965, they started to commit big forces. We discussed among ourselves in the Politburo whether at that point it was ... a limited war. We decided that it was already a limited war. We discussed it in the Politburo that with America bringing in gigantic forces was to carry out a new campaign, with the American forces committed, it was not good for America but it would be very hard for us to fight. The struggle would be very fierce but we already concluded that we would win the war. ...

On fighting technologically superior U.S. forces:

When American combat forces were committed, it was a myth that we could not fight and win because they were so powerful. ... [We survived] because of our courage and determination, together with wisdom, tactics and intelligence. During the attacks of B-52s, we shot down a few B-52s and captured documents. One of them was a order by the [U.S.] air command about the targets to be bombed in and around Hanoi and the positions of [our] forces. Some [of the figures] were correct, [but] some were wrong because of our deception [measures]. And our conclusion was that with such anti-air-power measures, the B-52 is not an effective way to fight. ...

We had to resort to different measures, some of which are quite simple, like hiding in man-holes and evacuating to the countryside. And we fought back with all our forces and with every kind of weapon. We fought with anti-aircraft artilleries and with small guns, even though [it was] sometimes solely with the strength of our local force. An 18-year-old girl once said that she followed routes every day and studied the patterns of American flights and when they would attack. I told her that she is a philosopher to understand that, because only philosophers talk about principles. Later she used small gun to shoot down an aircraft from a mountainside. That is an example of the military force of the common people. ... We had ingenuity and the determination to fight to the end.

I appreciated the fact that they had sophisticated weapon systems but I must say that it was the people who made the difference, not the weapons. There was also a human factor involved. [As to] whether they were tempted to use nuclear weapons during the war: there was a time during the Dien Bien Phu campaign in which the Americans were going to use nuclear weapons, and this is back in 1954 during the Eisenhower era. We were also aware of possible use of nuclear weapons and we were prepared for it. But whether the Americans could really use nuclear weapons was a question of international politics, and it also depended on the American allies. But looking at the intertwined forces, as the situation was, the result [of a nuclear blast] would not be good, and the Americans had to think hard. If nuclear weapons were used on locations where the Vietnamese troops were concentrated, it [would] also [affect] American troops.

On the Ho Chi Minh Trail:

The Ho Chi Minh Trail was a very extensive system; it started with a trail but later became a road. Many roads, actually: the Western road system and the Eastern road systems, criss-crossing here and there. And also there were the extensive systems of gas pipelines and communications lines, and routes on rivers and across the sea. We did everything possible to keep the whole system going. I visited many important points which were subjected to many B-52 bombings 23 out of 24 hours a day; we had many teams working toward maintaining the operation, including a team made up of women who had to use iron rings to defuse the [unexploded] bombs. ...

We made big sacrifices. I visited a dozen girls who maintained the route in Dong Lap of Nghe An Province; they showed me how they invented camouflage to cover the lamps so that those in vehicles can see, but the planes could not see. They urged us to move fast; and they all died during the bombing. There was danger of the trail being cut off, but it never really was cut off. With a long procession of vehicles, and with the bombing from the B-52s, it was very difficult, but we had to use both courage and wisdom. There are some routes that the Americans did not know about, but if they had used a telescope they would have seen the routes quite clearly. But we did not use those routes. We used some secret smaller trails as a detour and we went during the day.

On the Tet Offensive:

The Tet Offensive is a long story. ... It was our policy, drawn up by Ho Chi Minh, to make the Americans quit. Not to exterminate all Americans in Vietnam, [but] to defeat them.

It could be said [Tet] was a surprise attack which brought us a big victory. For a big battle we always figured out the objectives, the targets, so it was the main objective to destroy the forces and to obstruct the Americans from making war. But what was more important was to de-escalate the war -- because at that time the American were escalating the war -- and to start negotiations. So that was the key goal of that campaign. But of course, if we had gained more than that it would be better.

And [after Tet] the Americans had to back down and come to the negotiating table, because the war was not only moving into the cities, to dozens of cities and towns in South Vietnam, but also to the living rooms of Americans back home for some time. And that's why we could claim the achievement of the objective.

On the U.S. leadership during the war:

In general, I must say they were the most intelligent people, with certain talents such as military, political and diplomacy skills. They were intelligent people. That was the first point that I want to say. The second point I want to say is that they knew little about Vietnam and her people. They didn't understand our will to maintain independence and equality between nations even though these are stated in President Jefferson's manifestation. And so they made mistakes. They did not know the limits of power. ... No matter how powerful you are there are certain limits, and they did not understand it well. ...

The people in the White House believed that Americans would definitely win and there is not chance of defeat. There is a saying which goes, ""If you know the enemy and you know yourself, you would win every single battle."" However, the Americans fought the Vietnamese, but they did not know much about Vietnam or anything at all about the Vietnamese people. Vietnam is an old nation founded in a long history before the birth of Christ. ... The Americans knew nothing about our nation and her people. American generals knew little about our war theories, tactics and patterns of operation. ...

During the war everyone in the country would fight and they [would] do so following the Vietnamese war theory. We have a theory that is different from that of the Russians and that of the Americans. The Americans did not understand that. They did not know or understand our nation; they did not know our war strategies. They could not win. How could they win? As our president said, there was nothing more precious than independence and freedom. We had the spirit that we would govern our own nation; we would rather sacrifice than be slaves.

Now that the normalization between our two countries have been established, we hope for better relations, but it should be based on equality. Otherwise, if America is at advantage simply because she is richer, it will be unacceptable for us. Now we hope that American leaders can understand Vietnam and her people better."

The web site ""Snopes.com"" has claimed today that the story below is FALSE. I stand-by the story.



The owners and publishers of Snopes.com are well known jews who would lie at the drop of a hat to protct their tribe. Since it is jew bankers who have the most to gain by perpetrating the AMERO switch outlined in the story below, the kikes at Snopes have every reason to spin this story; to help their rich jew pals deceive!



I personally vouch for this story and stand-by every world of it no matter how many filthy jews come out of the woodwork to say otherwise. I caught them and they know it.



So upset are the powers-that-be over this expose, they actually CLOSED THE DENVER MINT to the public so they can move the AMEROS out without being seen!



This from the Denver Mint Web Site:





My story has caused a huge amount of fallout for the folks trying to perpetrate this AMERO switch and they are doing everything possible to spin it, cover it up and say it isn't so.

""THE AMERO"" IS REAL;

I HAVE ONE TO PROVE IT! UNITED STATES, CANADA AND MEXICO TO BE MERGED INTO SINGLE NEW ENTITY NAMED NORTH AMERICAN UNION! By: Hal Turner



Three weeks ago, I published a brief snippet on the front page of my web site reporting the governments of the US Canada and Mexico are conspiring in secret to merge the three nations into a new entity called the North American Union.



There has been much talk of this on various internet blogs for over a year. Most of those blogs have been smeared as ""conspiracy theorists"" and have been largely ignored by the main stream.



What prompted my interest in the issue was money: I was sent professional images of actual AMERO coins by someone in the US Treasury! The person included a note saying they like my radio show and are frightened by what's been going on in secret within our government.



This Treasury Department person was outraged that our country was beginning to coin money as part of a merger that would do away with our country, via a merger the American public knew nothing about!



When I got the professional images of the AMERO coin, I was finally intrigued enough to make mention of it on my web site. My site has gotten over 20 Million visits in the last couple years and is becoming more popular because of the brutal honesty and timely delivery of news that folks don't find elsewhere. This story about AMERO coins would fit my niche of breaking news, so I ran a snippet of a story.



As part of my report, I included the professional images sent to me by the Treasury person. They appear below:











I also mentioned that very pricey ""Collector Proofs"" of the coins were also being Minted in Silver and Gold, and I posted an image of one such Silver Proof, shown below:







The story went on to say that the US Government has intentionally overspent itself for the purpose of irreversibly Bankrupting the country. The idea is that they will drive the country into economic failure, then when millions of Americans are panicking at the prospect, offer them a solution of merging the three countries as ""the only possible way"" to avoid losing everything.



They will force Canada into the merger by telling them the US currency they hold and rely upon will be worthless and the only way Canada can even hope to salvage any of the funds is to join the NAU.



They will sell it to the Mexican people by saying it will instantly improve their buying-power and quality of life.



In reality, the value of the US and Canadian dollars will be significantly reduced to counter the worthless peso being absorbed. People in the US and Canada will suffer great financial loss while Mexicans will see significant gain. In the meantime, the financial elite and the politicians they own will make out like bandits!



That's the reason politicians are doing this: to get rich for themselves and their financial elite pals.



The folks in power within government and their buddies in Banking and finance know that in any currency switch, some lose big while others gain big. Really big! In fact, folks with foreknowledge of such a switch can make hundreds-of-millions, perhaps even billions for themselves overnight. Those without foreknowledge (common folks like you and me) usually end up being wiped out.



INSTANT, FULL BLAST ""SPIN""



I published the images and the small story and went to bed. I had no idea what my little story would do.



Within a matter of hours, there was a full blown effort to discredit my story and the images as fake.



I was accused of lying. I was accused of having ""photoshopped"" the images by creating them in Adobe Photoshop.



Within a couple days, a basic web site for AMERO ""FANTASY COINS"" was erected on the internet and word of that site was spread quickly. The site contained the same images as I had run on my front page, so clearly whatever ""SPIN"" was happening was being driven by others who also had the professional images.



There was intense effort to claim the whole idea of these coins was a fantasy and there was absolutely no truth to them whatsoever. That effort to ""spin"" the story out of existence worked. Folks quickly lost interest. I did not.



Get me the real thing by any means necessary



I reached out to the person in the Treasury who first alerted me to the coins. That person told me ""The shit hit the fan around here when your story ran."" The person went on to say ""They told everyone in all the Mints that anyone revealing information about the AMERO would be fired and perhaps even criminally prosecuted for endangering national security.""



Ahhhh yes, the grand old catch-all of national security. When they wheel that one out, you just KNOW they're pissed off about something!



I told the Treasury person that the only way anyone might believe this is happening, is for me to actually get one of the coins. The Treasury guy balked. He said ""there's no way to get one without stealing it.""



I though about that for a moment. . . . . then decided that if my government is concealing the actual Minting of coins for a new sovereign entity which may end up with power over me, but which I haven't been told about, then that government deserves whatever gets done to it.



I told the Treasury person to get me an Amero by any means necessary - even if that meant stealing it. The Treasury person said it would require them to think about for awhile and if it could be done, I would get one in the mail.



I waited. And waited. Frankly, after about three weeks, I lost track of the story -- until today. A real AMERO coin arrived at my home in the mail this afternoon!



The real thing arrives! Today, I received a single 20 AMERO coin in the mail. A real coin. Real metal, really MINTED by the US Mint in Denver, CO. The proof that it is being Minted in Denver is that the coin is stamped with the Mint Identity letter ""D"" on the bottom right of the side with the eagle just like regular US coins already in circulation today!



Click each image to enlarge it, CLICK TWICE TO SUPER ENLARGE IT!!























Please note the letter ""D"" stamped below and to the right of the Planet earth at the bottom right of the coin in this photo. That ""D"" stands for the United States Mint at Denver, CO.



VIDEO!

So that you can see this is a real, metal coin, I have made a small video of me holding the coin, turning it, then dropping it on a wooden table top so you can hear what it sounds like when it hits.

I WAS RIGHT!

I stand vindicated. All those who claimed I fabricated the images now owe me an apology. All those who claimed these were ""fantasy"" coins can now explain why anyone in their right mind would spend Millions of dollars to create the rare and expensive professional dies and plates necessary for minting coins that will not be issued?



The simple truth is, the coins are real. The plan to merge the US, Canada and Mexico is real. Our government is lying about it and the fact they are minting money at the Denver Mint bearing the name of Union of North America is proof.



So America, Canada and Mexico, our governments are betraying us and planning to merge our countries without our knowledge or consent, or by financial disaster they bring-on intentionally. What are we going to do about it?



For my part, the Second Amendment comes to mind.

Jerry Falwell said late Thursday he did not mean to blame feminists, gays or lesbians for bringing on the terrorist attacks in New York and Washington this week, in remarks on a television program earlier in the day. On the broadcast of the Christian television program ""The 700 Club,"" Falwell made the following statement: ""I really believe that the pagans, and the abortionists, and the feminists, and the gays and the lesbians who are actively trying to make that an alternative lifestyle, the ACLU, People For the American Way, all of them who have tried to secularize America. I point the finger in their face and say 'you helped this happen.'"" Falwell, pastor of the 22,000-member Thomas Road Baptist Church, viewed the attacks as God's judgment on America for ""throwing God out of the public square, out of the schools. The abortionists have got to bear some burden for this because God will not be mocked."" But in a phone call to CNN, Falwell said that only the hijackers and terrorists were responsible for the deadly attacks. ""I do believe, as a theologian, based upon many Scriptures and particularly Proverbs 14:23, which says 'living by God's principles promotes a nation to greatness, violating those principles brings a nation to shame,'"" he said. Falwell said he believes the ACLU and other organizations ""which have attempted to secularize America, have removed our nation from its relationship with Christ on which it was founded."" ""I therefore believe that that created an environment which possibly has caused God to lift the veil of protection which has allowed no one to attack America on our soil since 1812,"" he said. Pat Robertson, host of the 700 Club program, seemed to agree with Falwell's earlier statements in a prayer during the program. ""We have sinned against Almighty God, at the highest level of our government, we've stuck our finger in your eye,"" said Robertson. ""The Supreme Court has insulted you over and over again, Lord. They've taken your Bible away from the schools. They've forbidden little children to pray. They've taken the knowledge of God as best they can, and organizations have come into court to take the knowledge of God out of the public square of America."" National Gay and Lesbian Task Force Executive Director Lorri L. Jean bristled at the idea that gays and lesbians had anything to do with the attacks on the World Trade Center and the Pentagon that may have left thousands dead, and demanded an apology from Falwell. ""The terrible tragedy that has befallen our nation, and indeed the entire global community, is the sad byproduct of fanaticism. It has its roots in the same fanaticism that enables people like Jerry Falwell to preach hate against those who do not think, live, or love in the exact same way he does,"" she said. ""The tragedies that have occurred this week did not occur because someone made God mad, as Mr. Falwell asserts. They occurred because of hate, pure and simple. It is time to move beyond a place of hate and to a place of healing. We hope that Mr. Falwell will apologize to the U.S. and world communities.""

The abuse claims against the Shenandoah Valley Juvenile Center near Staunton, Virginia, are detailed in federal court filings that include a half-dozen sworn statements from Latino teens jailed there for months or years. Multiple detainees say the guards stripped them of their clothes and strapped them to chairs with bags placed over their heads.

""Whenever they used to restrain me and put me in the chair, they would handcuff me,"" said a Honduran immigrant who was sent to the facility when he was 15 years old. ""Strapped me down all the way, from your feet all the way to your chest, you couldn't really move. ... They have total control over you. They also put a bag over your head. It has little holes; you can see through it. But you feel suffocated with the bag on.""

In addition to the children's first-hand, translated accounts in court filings, a former child-development specialist who worked inside the facility independently told The Associated Press this week that she saw kids there with bruises and broken bones they blamed on guards. She spoke on condition of anonymity because she was not authorized to publicly discuss the children's cases.

In court filings, lawyers for the detention facility have denied all allegations of physical abuse.

Many of the children were sent there after U.S. immigration authorities accused them of belonging to violent gangs, including MS-13. President Donald Trump has repeatedly cited gang activity as justification for his crackdown on illegal immigration.

Mr. Trump said Wednesday that ""our Border Patrol agents and our ICE agents have done one great job"" cracking down on MS-13 gang members. ""We're throwing them out by the thousands,"" he said.

But a top manager at the Shenandoah center said during a recent congressional hearing that the children did not appear to be gang members and were suffering from mental health issues resulting from trauma that happened in their home countries -- problems the detention facility is ill-equipped to treat.

""The youth were being screened as gang-involved individuals. And then when they came into our care, and they were assessed by our clinical and case management staff ... they weren't necessarily identified as gang-involved individuals,"" said Kelsey Wong, a program director at the facility. She testified April 26 before a Senate subcommittee reviewing the treatment of immigrant children apprehended by the Homeland Security Department.

Most children held in the Shenandoah facility who were the focus of the abuse lawsuit were caught crossing the border illegally alone. They were not the children who have been separated from their families under the Trump administration's recent policy and are now in the government's care. But the facility there operates under the same program run by the U.S. Office of Refugee Resettlement.

It was not immediately clear whether any separated children have been sent to Shenandoah Valley since the Trump administration in April announced its ""zero tolerance"" policy toward immigrant families, after the lawsuit was filed.

Trump signs executive order to reverse his immigration policy

The Shenandoah lockup is one of only three juvenile detention facilities in the United States with federal contracts to provide ""secure placement"" for children who had problems at less-restrictive housing. The Yolo County Juvenile Detention Facility in California has faced litigation over immigrant children mischaracterized as gang members. In Alexandria, Virginia, a board overseeing the Northern Virginia Juvenile Detention Center voted this week to end its contract to house federal immigration detainees, bowing to public pressure.

The Shenandoah detention center was built by a coalition of seven nearby towns and counties to lock up local kids charged with serious crimes. Since 2007, about half the 58 beds are occupied by both male and female immigrants between the ages of 12 and 17 facing deportation proceedings or awaiting rulings on asylum claims. Though incarcerated in a facility similar to a prison, the children detained on administrative immigration charges have not yet been convicted of any crime.

Virginia ranks among the worst states in the nation for wait times in federal immigration courts, with an average of 806 days before a ruling. Nationally, only about half of juveniles facing deportation are represented by a lawyer, according to Justice Department data.

On average, 92 immigrant children each year cycle through Shenandoah, most of them from Mexico and Central America.

Wong said many of the 30 or so children housed there on any given day have mental health needs that would be better served in a residential treatment unit. But such facilities are often unwilling to accept children with significant behavioral issues, she said.

Wong and other managers at the Shenandoah center, including Executive Director Timothy J. Smith, did not respond to phone and email messages seeking comment this week. A city manager on the local commission that oversees the facility referred questions to an official at the Refugee Resettlement agency, who did not respond to a phone message.

Financial statements reviewed by AP shows the local government commission that operates the center received nearly $4.2 million in federal funds last year to house the immigrant children -- enough to cover about two-thirds of the total operating expenses.

The lawsuit filed against Shenandoah alleges that young Latino immigrants held there ""are subjected to unconstitutional conditions that shock the conscience, including violence by staff, abusive and excessive use of seclusion and restraints, and the denial of necessary mental health care.""

The complaint filed by the nonprofit Washington Lawyers' Committee for Civil Rights and Urban Affairs recounts the story of an unnamed 17-year-old Mexican citizen apprehended at the southern border. The teen fled an abusive father and violence fueled by drug cartels to seek asylum in the United States in 2015.

After stops at facilities in Texas and New York, he was transferred to Shenandoah in April 2016 and diagnosed during an initial screening by a psychologist with three mental disorders, including depression. Besides weekly sessions speaking with a counselor, the lawsuit alleges the teen has received no further mental health treatment, such as medications that might help regulate his moods and behavior.

The lawsuit recounts multiple alleged violent incidents between Latino children and staff at the Shenandoah center. It describes the guards as mostly white, non-Spanish speakers who are undertrained in dealing with individuals with mental illness. The suit alleges staff members routinely taunt the Latino youths with racially charged epithets, including ""wetback,"" ''onion head"" and ""pendejo,"" which roughly translates to dumbass in Spanish.

A 16-year-old who said he had lived in Texas with his mother since he was an infant ended up at Shenandoah in September after a police officer pulled over a car he was riding in and asked for ID, which he couldn't provide. As one of the few Latino kids who is fluent in English, the teen would translate for other detainees the taunts and names the staff members were calling them. He said that angered the guards, resulting in his losing such modest privileges as attending art classes.

""If you are behaving bad, resisting the staff when they try to remove you from the program, they will take everything in your room away -- your mattress, blanket, everything,"" he said. ""They will also take your clothes. Then they will leave you locked in there for a while. This has happened to me, and I know it has happened to other kids, too.""

The immigrant detainees said they were largely segregated from the mostly white juveniles being held on criminal charges, but they could see that the other housing units had amenities that included plush chairs and video gaming consoles not available in the Spartan pods housing the Latinos.

In their sworn statements, the teens reported spending the bulk of their days locked alone in their cells, with a few hours set aside for classroom instruction, recreation and meals. Some said they had never been allowed outdoors, while the U.S.-born children were afforded a spacious recreation yard.

The Latino children reported being fed sparse and often cold meals that left them hungry, though meals of American fast food were occasionally provided. Records show Shenandoah receives nearly $82,000 a year from the Agriculture Department to feed the immigration detainees.

The lawsuit said the poor conditions, frequent physical searches and verbal abuse by staff often escalated into confrontations, as the frustrated children acted out. The staff regularly responded ""by physically assaulting the youth, applying an excessive amount of force that goes far beyond what is needed to establish or regain control.""

In the case of the Mexican 17-year-old, the lawsuit said a staff member who suspected him of possessing contraband threw him to the ground and forcibly tore off his clothes for an impromptu strip search. Though no forbidden items were found, the teenager was transferred to ""Alpha Pod,"" described in the lawsuit as a unit within the facility designated for children who engage in bad behavior.

The lawsuit said Latino children were frequently punished by being restrained for hours in chairs, with handcuffs and cloth shackles on their legs. Often, the lawsuit alleged, the children were beaten by staff while bound.

As a result of such ""malicious and sadistic applications of force,"" the immigrant youths have ""sustained significant injuries, both physical and psychological,"" the lawsuit said.

After an altercation during which the lawsuit alleged the Mexican teenager bit a staff member during a beating, he was restrained in handcuffs and shackles for 10 days, resulting in bruises and cuts. Other teens interviewed as part of the court case also reported being punished for minor infractions with stints in solitary confinement, during which some of the children said they were left nude and shivering in cold concrete cells.

Academic studies of prison inmates kept in solitary confinement have found they often experience high anxiety that can cause panic attacks, paranoia and disordered thinking that may trigger angry outbursts. For those with mental health issues, the effects can be exacerbated, often worsening the very behaviors the staff is attempting to discourage.

A Guatemalan youth sent to the center when he was 14 years old said he was often locked in his tiny cell for up to 23 hours a day. After resisting the guards, he said he was also restrained for long periods.

""When they couldn't get one of the kids to calm down, the guards would put us in a chair -- a safety chair, I don't know what they call it -- but they would just put us in there all day,"" the teen said in a sworn statement. ""This happened to me, and I saw it happen to others, too. It was excessive.""

A 15-year-old from Mexico held at Shenandoah for nine months also recounted being restrained with a bag over his head.

""They handcuffed me and put a white bag of some kind over my head,"" he said, according to his sworn statement. ""They took off all of my clothes and put me into a restraint chair, where they attached my hands and feet to the chair. They also put a strap across my chest. They left me naked and attached to that chair for two and a half days, including at night.""

After being subjected to such treatment, the 17-year-old Mexican youth said he tried to kill himself in August, only to be punished with further isolation. On other occasions, he said, he has responded to feelings of desperation and hopelessness by cutting his wrists with a piece of glass and banging his head against the wall or floor.

""One time I cut myself after I had gotten into a fight with staff,"" the teen recounted. ""I filled the room with blood. This happened on a Friday, but it wasn't until Monday that they gave me a bandage or medicine for the pain.""

The lawsuit alleges other immigrant youths held at Shenandoah have also engaged in cutting and other self-harming behaviors, including ingesting shampoo and attempting to choke themselves.

A hearing in the case is set for July 3 before a federal judge in the Western District of Virginia.

Lawyers on both sides in the lawsuit either did not respond to messages or declined to comment, citing strict confidentiality requirements in the case involving children.

The child development specialist who previously worked with teens at Shenandoah told AP that many there developed severe psychological problems after experiencing abuse from guards.

""The majority of the kids we worked with when we went to visit them were emotionally and verbally abused. I had a kid whose foot was broken by a guard,"" she said. ""They would get put in isolation for months for things like picking up a pencil when a guard had said not to move. Some of them started hearing voices that were telling them to hurt people or hurt themselves, and I knew when they had gotten to Shenandoah they were not having any violent thoughts.""

She said she never witnessed staff abuse teens first-hand, but that teens would complain to her of injuries from being tackled by guards and reveal bruises. The specialist encouraged them to file a formal complaint.

Though lawyers for Shenandoah responded with court filings denying all wrongdoing, information contained in a separate 2016 lawsuit appears to support some of the information contained in the recent abuse complaints.

In a wrongful termination lawsuit filed against the Shenandoah center, a former staff member said he worked in unit called ""Alpha Pod"" where immigrant minors were held, ""including those with psychological and mental issues and those who tend to fight more frequently.""

The guard, Trenton Farris, who denied claims that he punched two children, sued the justice center alleging he was wrongly targeted for firing because he is black. Farris said most staff members at the facility are white, and that two white staff members involved in the incident over which he was fired went unpunished.

Lawyers for the center denied the former guard's claims, and the case was settled in January."

A big crowd gathered in a Tucson church last week, ready to hear candidates' plans for gun-control legislation from people vying to become lawmakers at the Arizona state Capitol.

All was going more or less as expected. Then, it was Bobby Wilson's turn to speak.

Wilson, one of two Republican candidates who attended the July 9 meeting, took the mic and told a story of how he shot and killed a crazed attacker in an act of self-defense while a teenager.

That attacker, it turned out, was his mother.

He said his life story illustrates the importance of having ""a good guy there with a gun"" rather than gun-control legislation.

""You can pass all the laws you want to in this world, and when you've got somebody out there that wants to harm somebody, they're going to do it if you don't stop them,"" Wilson told the crowd.

The audience was shocked, as video posted online showed. The crowd, brought together by Moms Demand Action, a nationwide movement against gun violence, burst into boos and heckles.

But there is more to Wilson's story — a lot more.

The tale begins in Hugo, Oklahoma, in 1963, when Wilson was 18 years old. It includes charges of familial murder, a home destroyed by fire, years of amnesia and the start of a winding path that led a young man to a legal career and, now, ambitions to serve in the Arizona Legislature.

The candidate told only part of this story to the Tucson audience.

""(She) was hell-bent on killing me in my sleep one night. At three o'clock in the morning, I woke up to find a rifle in my face — a semiautomatic rifle at that — and the bullets started to fly, and I started diving for cover,"" Wilson said.

A clip of Wilson's remarks was posted on Twitter by a reporter with the Tucson-based Arizona Daily Star.

He said he dodged six bullets before reaching for the gun under his bed, which he then used to shoot his mother. He said if not for that gun, he'd be dead.

Both his 49-year-old mother and 17-year-old sister died that night, as Wilson recalled in a 2010 memoir about the event. The book, ""Bobby's Trials,"" was published by Apache Publishing Company, a small Arizona-based publisher operated by Wilson's wife. The publisher has printed four other books by Wilson.

In his memoir, Wilson wrote that his mother suffered debilitating depression and fits of intense rage. He has also called her ""deranged"" and a ""fugitive hiding in the backwoods of S.E. Oklahoma.""

Court records and newspaper articles from the time suggest there may be more to the story than Wilson's account.

Those records show he was charged with the murder of his mother and sister, and soon after his arrest he confessed to those charges. He later recanted his confession and claimed he had amnesia about the events of the night in question.

The charges against him ultimately were dismissed by an Oklahoma judge.

What happened the night of the killing?

In an interview with The Arizona Republic, Wilson recalled more of his memories of the events that night at his childhood home.

Wilson said his mother, Lavonne Wilson, entered his room and repeatedly shot at him but missed.

While aiming for Wilson, he said his mother must have seen a shadow move, so she swung the gun. The rifle butt hit his younger sister, Judy Wilson, in the back of the head and caved it in, he said. Wilson said Judy had entered his room upon hearing the commotion.

An autopsy found she was killed upon impact to the head, according to Wilson.

Wilson's mother continued to shoot at him, Wilson said. A few bullets ricocheted off two gallon-size containers of gasoline in the room and smashed them open.

The Wilsons stored gas in glass jars in Bobby's bedroom because it was the coolest area of the house, which had no air-conditioning, he said. Gas spilled all over the floor, Wilson said.

Wilson said he then grabbed a single-shot rifle from under his bed and fired at his mother.

He said an autopsy later concluded the shot hit her point-blank in the eye. Wilson then ran to the living room to call for help. As he turned on the light switch to reach for the phone, a spark ignited fumes from the spilled gasoline in the other room, he said.

""The house exploded,"" Wilson recalled.

According to Wilson, he was blasted through the living-room window and into a barbed-wire fence. He said he received a concussion upon impact and was found unconscious and taken to the hospital.

Wilson said his mother and sister were found dead in the house's rubble. A medical examiner declared his mother dead from a combination of the bullet wound and burns, Wilson said.

Wilson said he was arrested by the county sheriff while in the hospital and was thrown in jail. With his two family members dead and he as the sole survivor — and unable at the time to recall what happened — Wilson said the sheriff blamed him and imprisoned him right away.

He said he spent seven or eight months in jail until his employer bailed him out. Wilson said he faced two trials, both of which he said were ""inconclusive.""

He said that at a third trial in 1973, all charges against him were dropped. He said the district attorney announced the state never had a solid case against him and was wrong all along.

According to Wilson, the district attorney and sheriff apologized for Wilson's ordeals and the judge dismissed all charges against him.

Newspaper, court accounts of killings are much different

Details reported at the time in a local newspaper, in addition to court records from Wilson's case, both differ significantly in numerous regards from Wilson's account to The Republic.

The Choctaw County Weekly, a publication that compiled articles from multiple area papers, published several stories about the events in the days following the deaths and fire.

The Choctow County District Court Clerk's Office also provided records about Wilson's case.

Court records list Wilson's last name as Wiste. Wilson said that was because his mother — who was a widow — had the family living under an assumed last name. He said he later changed his last name to Wilson.

According to the June 20, 1963, edition of the Choctaw County Weekly, after the fire at the house was extinguished, a water truck sprayed the site of the burned house to allow funeral workers to remove the remains.

According to the newspaper, the charred bodies of Lavonne and Judy Wilson were found lying together in bed ""in a 'perfectly relaxed' position, indicating they died in their sleep from suffocation.""

The paper reported that neighbors heard the explosion and rushed to the house to find young Wilson lying in the grass, gasping for breath. The paper said he was suffering from smoke inhalation and had minor cuts and burns.

Initially, authorities anticipated no foul play was involved, but they proceeded with an investigation.

One week later, the paper reported that Wilson had confessed to murdering his mother and sister.

The paper said Wilson led officers to where he buried the rifle used to kill them.

After prompting by his boss at the meat market, ""Bobby reflected a moment, and then slowly added that last jigsaw piece with this account — a story already put together by officers, needing only his stamp of authenticity,"" the Weekly wrote.

Wilson admitted to shooting his mother, according to the paper. Then, when his sister ran at him, he crushed her skull with his rifle butt. He placed the bodies on the bed, poured gas around the house and lit a match, the paper reported.

""It was Sheriff Thornton's tenacious insistence that the bodies be sent to the state crime bureau for examination that spoiled what otherwise could easily have been the perfect crime,"" the Weekly reported. ""Reports showed death came prior to the fire and from causes that later proved completely accurate.""

Wilson was tried on homicide charges.

Court records show that three years after he was charged with the murders, Wilson filed with the court for ""mental incapacity to make a rational defense.""

He claimed he suffered from amnesia during the time of the allegations, and with no clear memory of the night's events, was unable to plan his defense with attorneys or tell his side of the story.

The court ordered a jury to decide whether evidence supported Wilson's claims of memory loss.

Four days later, the jury returned its verdict: Wilson indeed suffered from amnesia, they said. The judge ruled Wilson was thus ""not capable of proceeding to trial and making a rational defense.""

The case was ""suspended"" until Wilson could regain enough memory to defend himself, the judge said.

Seven years later, in late 1973, Wilson moved to dismiss entirely the charges against him.

According to court filings, his attorney argued that because the district attorney, state and district court had taken no action in seven years, he had been ""deprived of his right to speedy trial."" He added that his witnesses were no longer available because they had died. He motioned for all charges to be dismissed.

The court dismissed his case.

Wilson then moved to Texas for college and law school. After graduating, he practiced law in Texas for 20 years.

Last year, Wilson told the Green Valley News, a southern Arizona publication, that he regained all of his memory of the events in a momentous day as a lawyer.

He was investigating the case of one of his first clients, ""who also had been falsely accused of murder,"" Wilson told the Green Valley News.

He said he was looking for clues in the woman's vehicle, when he smelled the combination of gasoline and blood.

""The horrible, nauseating smells off the car plummeted me back like a lightning bolt to that fateful night in my childhood, and all the memories flooded in,"" Wilson told the paper. ""It was an incredibly disturbing experience, but it also brought relief: Now I had the truth.""

Wilson told the Green Valley News that after his amnesia subsided, he could fully recount the events of that night in 1963. He proceeded to pen a book and tell his version of the story.

Wilson moved to Arizona in 1995 to teach law as a college professor.

According to his candidate website, he also owned a private-investigation agency in Arizona for 10 years.

The Maricopa County Community College District hired Wilson in 1995 as an adjunct faculty member in the criminal-justice department, where he remains active.

He teaches paralegals at Rio Salado College. He said he is a three-time recipient of a teaching award for adjunct faculty at the college.

More on gun laws, and an Oklahoma City bombing conspiracy

In the interview with The Republic, Wilson stood by his remarks about gun-control legislation and doubled-down on his belief that ""good"" armed people are ""the only way"" to stop gun violence.

""When I was in high school, all of the high-school boys had rifles and shotguns in their cars every day when they came to school, and nobody shot anybody at school, and nobody even thought about it,"" Wilson said.

""In today's world, we've got people walking into the public schools and public events and killing innocent people, and yes, the only way you can stop that is somebody better have a firearm to put a stop to it.""

Wilson reiterated his belief that legislation will make no difference.

""I don't think you can control people's behavior by passing laws,"" he said. ""They keep looking for a magic-bullet law that they can pass where it’s gonna put an end to the killings and the gun violence, and they're not gonna find the magic bullet. There is no magic bullet.""

In another take on American government, Wilson penned a 2016 book explaining his theory that the 1995 Oklahoma City bombing was part of a government sting operation and that ""a massive cover-up had occurred and possibly an innocent man executed.""

Man who helped save Gabby Giffords responds

State Rep. Daniel Hernandez, D-Tucson, was seated next to Wilson at the forum — what Hernandez called ""a bizarre meeting"" — as both are running to represent Legislative District 2 at the Capitol.

Hernandez was an intern for former Congresswoman Gabrielle Giffords in 2011 when she was shot in the head and almost died at a mass shooting outside a Tucson-area supermarket.

He is credited with saving her life. He applied pressure to her forehead wound and made sure she didn't choke on blood.

Giffords was in the audience at the forum.

Hernandez said he was ""so confused"" upon hearing Wilson's comments, and said he checked with Wilson after the event to make sure he heard correctly.

""I thought I had misheard him,"" Hernandez said. ""We were just like 'Wait, what did he just say?!'

""Even though I was sitting right next to him, it just took me aback that at this forum put on by Moms Demand Action, when we were talking about common-sense gun-violence prevention, he was talking about how he had to kill his mother in what I take is self-defense,"" Hernandez said.

After his experience at the Jan. 8, 2011, shooting, Hernandez became an outspoken advocate for gun-violence prevention at the state and federal levels.

""The idea that we can't actually do anything as a policymaker is just something that baffles me to this day,"" Hernandez said.

Candidate: Giffords 'created a target'

Wilson said he was aware of Hernandez's story and knew that he ""supposedly"" helped Giffords in the moments immediately after the shooting. Wilson said he expected to be ""booed and heckled"" at the event given its focus on gun-control measures.

""I knew it was gonna be a hostile audience when I went,"" Wilson said. ""I just thought, 'I'm gonna go in and tell them how I think, and they can throw rocks or bananas or whatever, I don't care.' ""

Wilson said Giffords should have had security with her at the 2011 supermarket meet and greet.

""She basically created a target,"" he said. ""Anytime you have a group of celebrities or a group of people like at the forum last night, you better have security there. It's the same with a public school.""

Wilson mentioned that an armed officer was present in the back of the church at Monday's forum, which he said made the boos after his comments seem ""pretty hypocritical"" and ""ironic"" to him.

But Hernandez said that even if armed people are present in a violent incident, they still may not act, be it for lack of training or for not wanting to add to the ""confusion"" in a mass-shooting event.

He added that the officer present on Monday was a trained professional.

""(Wilson's) notion of all you need is a good guy with a gun is I think just bonkers,"" Hernandez said. ""It was utter shock at hearing a candidate talk about killing his own mother, and then also just being really surprised that he would come to this forum where gun-violence prevention was really the main topic.""

District 2 is a Democratic stronghold encompassing parts of Pima County and Santa Cruz County, south of Tucson. All three Democratic incumbents are running for re-election this fall.

The victim, 54-year-old Wa Tiba, went missing while checking her vegetable garden near her village on Muna island in Southeast Sulawesi province on Thursday evening, according to the village chief, Faris.

On Friday, her family went to look for her at the garden but found only her belongings, including sandals and a flashlight, said Faris, who uses a single name.

The family and villagers launched a search for the woman, and found the snake with a bloated belly about 50 meters (yards) from where her belongings were found.

The villagers killed the snake and carried it to the village.

“When they cut open the snake’s belly they found Tiba’s body still intact with all her clothes,” Faris said. “She was swallowed first from her head.”

Videos posted on some websites showed villagers slicing open the python’s carcass to reveal the woman’s body.

Faris said the victim’s garden, about 1 kilometer (half a mile) from her house, is located in a rocky area with caves and cliffs believed to contain many snakes.

Reticulated pythons, which are widespread in Indonesia and other parts of Southeast Asia, grab onto their prey with dozens of sharp curved teeth and then squeeze it to death before swallowing it whole.

Reports of humans being killed by pythons are extremely rare. In the wild they are known to eat monkeys, pigs and other mammals.

It was the second python attack on a human in Indonesia since March last year, when a 25-year-old man was swallowed whole by a python in West Sulawesi province."	7-meter-long python swallows Indonesian woman	2018-06-16 11:54:41+00:00	[]	['sulawesi', 'swallowed', 'woman', 'indonesia', 'garden', 'indonesian', 'village', 'villagers', 'went', '7meterlong', 'python', 'pythons', 'swallows']	"JAKARTA, Indonesia (AP) — A 7-meter-long (23-foot-long) python has swallowed a woman in central Indonesia, a village official said Saturday.

“It is our understanding that the cast of this film has raised over $235 million for their efforts to spread their black extremist message,” said FBI director Christopher Wray. “That is not something that we can tolerate.”

Sources report that A-list celebrities Chadwick Boseman, Michael B. Jordan and Lupita Nyong’o have been added to the watch list, with little justification other than seeming “suspicious.”

“It’s an imperfect process,” says one source within the FBI. “But if anything uses the words ‘black’ and ‘panther’ we’re all over it.”

Both members of the cast and members of the actual Black Panthers have expressed confusion at the maneuver.

“I don’t understand why I’ve been put on a watch list,” said Lupita Nyong’o, who played Nakia. “It has nothing to do with the Black Panther Party. Has anyone at the FBI even seen it?”

“I’m an actor, not an actual Black Panther,” said Michael B. Jordan, who has witnessed several unmarked vehicles parked outside of his residence in Sherman Oaks, CA. “With all due respect, the FBI is wildin’. Did they even see the movie?”

“As inhumane and biased as the FBI’s actions toward the BPP have been in the past, this is a grave injustice,” added playwright, professor, and former Black Panther Jamal Joseph. “It just seems like they are being watched as a result of our government’s ongoing campaign against anyone who celebrates blackness. Also, has anyone at the FBI seen the film?”

But the FBI has remained firm in their stance.

“The Bureau will not bend to the will of those who choose to be linked to domestic terrorist organizations,” iterated Michael P. Kortan. “We have an obligation to monitor those individuals and maintain the safety of our great country.”

""We apologize to anyone who was offended by the content of the assignment and have taken steps to avoid such occurrences in the future,"" Pennridge School District Superintendent Dr. Jacqueline Rattigan said in a statement.

The assignment contained questions based on poet and civil rights advocate Maya Angelou's autobiography, ""I Know Why the Caged Bird Sings"" -- a book the school has long assigned to students. The biography details her life, including her teen pregnancy, sexual abuse and drug use.

The question provided a math formula and asked: ""Angelou was sexually abused by her mother's ___ at age 8, which shaped her career choices and motivation for writing."" Pennridge High School students needed to use the formula before deciding whether the answer was boyfriend, brother or father.

Another question asked students whether Angelou worked as a bookie, drug dealer or night club dancer when she was ""trying to support her son as a single mother.""

The district said steps were taken to make sure this type of assignment never happens again.

""We have received a number of complaints from parents and members of the community regarding a recent high school math homework assignment which contained adult content without a proper context,"" said Rattigan. ""The homework worksheet in question was downloaded from a website that allows teachers around the world to share educational resources. It is not part of our approved curriculum.""

The district did not comment on whether the teacher could face any disciplinary action.

Around 2,400 students attend Pennridge High along N 5th Street in Perkasie, with about 250 faculty and staff, says the district.

A five-year-old girl was fined £150 by a council for selling 50p cups of lemonade to festival goers.

The girl's father Andre Spicer said his daughter had set up the stall in Mile End, east London, while thousands of music fans were on their way to the Lovebox Festival at the weekend.

Mr Spicer said his daughter burst into tears and told him ""I've done a bad thing"".

Tower Hamlets Council has since cancelled the fine and apologised.

Mr Spicer said his daughter loved the idea of setting up a stall near their home.

""She just wanted to put a smile on people's faces. She was really proud of herself,"" he said.

""But after a small time trading, four enforcement officers walked over from the other side of the road.

""I was quite shocked. I thought that they would just tell us to pack up and go home.

Street trading licence rules

To operate a market stall, you will need a street trading licence

There are two types of street trading licences: temporary and permanent

The application fee for both temporary and permanent licences is £75

You must be over 17 years of age to hold a licence

To sell hot/high risk food, there are several extra restrictions in place on a street trading licence

""But they turned on their mobile camera and began reading from a big script explaining that she did not have a trading licence.

""My daughter clung to me screaming 'Daddy, Daddy, I've done a bad thing.' She's five.

""We were then issued a fine of £150. We packed up and walked home.""

A council spokesman said: ""We are very sorry that this has happened. We expect our enforcement officers to show common sense and to use their powers sensibly.

n the Qur'an. In Surat al-Hadid, meaning Iron, we are informed: And We also sent down iron in which there lies great force and which has many uses for mankind… (Qur'an, 57:25) The word ""anzalna,"" translated as ""sent down"" and used for iron in the verse, could be thought of having a figurative meaning to explain that iron has been given to benefit people. But, when we take into consideration the literal meaning of the word, which is, ""being physically sent down from the sky,"" as in the case of rain and Sun rays, we realize that this verse implies a very significant scientific miracle. Because, modern astronomical findings have disclosed that the iron found in our world has come from giant stars in outer space. Not only the iron on earth, but also the iron in the entire Solar System, comes from outer space, since the temperature in the Sun is inadequate for the formation of iron. The sun has a surface temperature of 6,000 degrees Celsius, and a core temperature of approximately 20 million degrees. Iron can only be produced in much larger stars than the Sun, where the temperature reaches a few hundred million degrees. When the amount of iron exceeds a certain level in a star, the star can no longer accommodate it, and it eventually explodes in what is called a ""nova"" or a ""supernova."" These explosions make it possible for iron to be given off into space

https://www.snopes.com/fact-check/dod-bullets-into-flowers/	the u.s. army is investigating ways to build biodegradable bullets that will sprout into plants.	true	['']		Alex Kasprak	['http://www.navfac.navy.mil/navfac_worldwide/specialty_centers/exwc/products_and_services/ev/erb/tech/rem/phyto.html', 'http://www.acq.osd.mil/osbp/sbir/about/index.shtml', 'https://www.sbir.gov/sbirsearch/detail/1207769']	https://www.sbir.gov/sbirsearch/detail/1207769	https://www.sbir.gov/	"Description:

TECHNOLOGY AREA(S): Weapons

OBJECTIVE: Develop biodegradable training ammunition loaded with specialized seeds to grow environmentally beneficial plants that eliminate ammunition debris and contaminants.

DESCRIPTION: Currently the US Army manufactures and consumes hundreds of thousands of training rounds. These rounds are fired at proving grounds and training ranges in the United States and around the world. In addition, special forces conduct day and night training exercises utilizing these training rounds. These rounds include low velocity 40mm grenades; 60mm, 81mm, and 120mm mortars; shoulder launched munitions; 120mm tank rounds; and 155mm artillery rounds. The projectiles, and in some circumstances the cartridge cases and sabot petals, are either left on the ground surface or several feet underground at the proving ground or tactical range. Components of current training rounds require hundreds of years or more to biodegrade. Further, civilians (e.g., farmers or construction crews) encountering these rounds and components do not know if they are training or tactical rounds. Proving grounds and battle grounds have no clear way of finding and eliminating these training projectiles, cartridge cases and sabot petals, especially those that are buried several feet in the ground. Some of these rounds might have the potential corrode and pollute the soil and nearby water. The solution sought by this topic is naturally occurring biodegradable material to replace the current training round materials, eliminating environmental hazards. This SBIR will prove out the technology and replace current training round components with biodegradable parts. The biodegradable materials identified can be utilized by private industry to manufacture biodegradable water bottles, plastic containers, or any other composite or plastic product(s) on the market today. The US Army Corps of Engineers' Cold Regions Research and Engineering Laboratory (CRREL) has demonstrated bioengineered seeds that can be embedded into the biodegradable composites and that will not germinate until they have been in the ground for several months. This SBIR effort will make use of seeds to grow environmentally friendly plants that remove soil contaminants and consume the biodegradable components developed under this project. Animals should be able to consume the plants without any ill effects.

PHASE I: In Phase I the contractor develop a process to produce biodegradable composites with remediation seeds that can be used to manufacture 40mm-120mm training rounds. These Training rounds shall meet all the performance requirements of existing training rounds. The contractor should also explore avenues to produce biodegradable composites with remediation seeds for use in products outside the defense sector.

PHASE II: In Phase II the contractor will prove out the fabrication process and manufacture prototypes that demonstrate the process is ready for industrial use. Provide a sufficient number of prototypes for the government to perform ballistic tests.

PHASE III: Contractor will coordinate with PEO Ammunition and ammunition prime contractors to establish a transition path for the SBIR technology.

WASHINGTON – One of the world’s biggest producers of asbestos, a Russian company with ties to Vladimir Putin, is praising President Trump for allowing asbestos to remain legal in the U.S.

The company’s applause for Trump comes as Russia is poised to become the leading importer to the U.S. of asbestos, which causes diseases that kill an estimated 15,000 Americans a year. A recent study led by Jukka Takala, president of the International Commission on Occupational Health, found the death toll from asbestos exposure may be much higher, at nearly 40,000 Americans a year and more than 255,000 a year worldwide.

On June 25, the asbestos producer Uralasbest posted photos on its Facebook page of pallets of its signature product, chrysotile asbestos, wrapped in plastic adorned with Trump’s image. Trump’s picture is at the center of a large red seal declaring: “APPROVED BY DONALD TRUMP, 45th PRESIDENT OF THE UNITED STATES.”

Photo: Uralasbest OJSC, via Facebook

In an English translation of the post, Uralasbest said:

Donald is on our side! … He supported the head of the United States Environmental Protection Agency, Scott Pruitt, who stated that his agency would no longer deal with negative effects potentially derived from products containing asbestos. Donald Trump supported a specialist and called asbestos “100% safe after application.""

Pruitt resigned as EPA administrator last week, after an 18-month tenure marred by ethical scandals, profligate spending of taxpayer dollars and aggressive attempts to roll back public health protections. One of his last decisions was to exclude so-called legacy uses of asbestos from the scope of an ongoing safety assessment. He also declined to ban new uses of asbestos. The Obama administration had designated asbestos a priority for a new safety assessment under the nation’s new toxic chemicals law.

Trump has long rejected the scientific consensus that asbestos is so dangerous that there is no safe level of exposure. In his 1997 book, “The Art of the Comeback,” the future president claimed asbestos is “100 percent safe, once applied.” In 2012, he tweeted that if asbestos had not been removed from the World Trade Center, the twin towers “would never have burned down” in the 9/11 terrorist attacks.

Not to be outdone in showering adoration on Trump, Kostanai Minerals, the largest chrysotile asbestos producer in neighboring Kazakhstan, shared the post on its own Facebook page.

Uralasbest claims its asbestos mine in the Ural Mountains city of Asbest is the largest in the world. According to an investigation by the Center for Public Integrity, in 2010, Putin met with the head of the Uralasbest workers union, who said he “promised to support Russian producers of chrysotile, especially in situations where we find ourselves under political pressure at the international level.” The Center also reported that Kostanai Minerals has received financial backing from state-controlled banks in both Russia and Kazakhstan.

According to the U.S. Geological Survey, in 2016, roughly 95 percent of the asbestos imported into the U.S. came from Brazil, with the rest coming from Russia. The Commerce Department and the U.S. International Trade Commission estimate that 705 metric tons of asbestos came into the U.S. in 2016, compared to 343 metric tons the year before.

But in November, Brazil joined more than 60 other nations and banned asbestos. Brazil’s ban leaves Russia, Kazakhstan and China as the world’s dominant asbestos producers. With Brazil no longer providing the vast majority of asbestos to the U.S., Russia and Kazakhstan could fill the void.

“Vladimir Putin and Russia’s asbestos industry stand to prosper mightily as a result of the Trump Administration’s failure to ban asbestos in the U.S.,” said EWG President Ken Cook. “Helping Putin and Russian oligarchs amass fortunes by selling a product that kills thousands each year should never be the role of a U.S. president or the EPA, but this is the Trump administration. Russia’s interests are Trump’s interests, and any clear-eyed American knows it.”

“By allowing asbestos to remain legal, the Trump administration would be responsible for a flood of asbestos imports from Russia and other countries into the U.S., as well as the wave of illnesses and deaths that will continue for years to come,” said Linda Reinstein, co-founder and president of the Asbestos Disease Awareness Organization. “Americans know Putin does not have their interests at heart, but it’s becoming increasingly apparent that neither does Trump.”

Trump and Putin are scheduled to hold a one-on-one summit in Helsinki, Finland, on July 16. The agenda for the meeting has not been made public, but it is safe to assume talks over trade between the two countries could be part of the discussion.

WASHINGTON, D.C.—When Israel responded with airstrikes to over 600 rockets fired at them from Gaza, many defended this as a justified act of defense. Representative Ilhan Omar lashed out against this view, saying on Twitter about Israel, “If they’re so innocent, why are they Jews?”

Omar pointed out how many in Israel continue in the extremely hostile act of being Jewish, provoking all of the people around them. “They want people to feel sorry for them,” Omar said, “but they’re just out there, every day, being Jews. It’s almost like they’re taunting everyone.”

Representative Rashida Tlaib backed up Omar’s comments. “It’s a very provocative region to insist on being Jews,” she tweeted. “Couldn’t they find somewhere else to be Jews where it’s not so dehumanizing to the people around them?” When pressed on where she thought it would be okay for them to be Jewish, after a while Tlaib was only able to come up with “the moon.”

Many Republicans have condemned the statements, but Democrats have mostly remained silent, Speaker Nancy Pelosi claiming to have never heard of Representatives Omar and Tlaib.

If it becomes law, Alabama would be the ninth state to do so.

This comes as the federal agency Housing and Urban Development is rolling out its nationwide ban on smoking in public housing, and just a few years after many states have outlawed smoking in beaches and public parks. This trend raises the question: Are we getting closer to prohibiting tobacco smoking altogether? And would that be such a bad thing?

“In America, it’s very difficult to be simply paternalistic,” Ronald Bayer, co-director of the Center for the History and Ethics of Public Health at Columbia University’s Mailman School of Public Health, tells Yahoo Lifestyle. American values of privacy and freedom make it very difficult to prohibit anything as mainstream as tobacco, even if it’s to save the lives of smokers. That old “nanny state” argument rears its head every time.

Smoking isn’t good for anyone, but would an all-out ban work? (Photo: Getty Images)

In 2014, a Gallup poll found that 79 percent of Americans would be against an outright ban of smoking. On the other hand, 56 percent were in favor of prohibiting smoking in public places. The difference is that people accept the concept of protecting nonsmokers from the dangers of secondhand smoke.

In 2006, the surgeon general declared that there is no risk-free level of second-hand smoke. So even if some are skeptical that smoke coming in from the street to the second or third floor of a building would do real damage to nonsmoking residents, second-hand smoke is the only politically acceptable grounds for such laws.

You won’t hear anyone arguing that smoking with children in the car is a good thing either.

“Exposing a child to smoke in a closed environment is really unhealthy,” Bayer says. But laws like Alabama’s pose other problems, and he wonders if this would become a new way to target minorities, like controversial “stop and frisk” policies. “How are you going to enforce it?” he asks. “Are people of color going to be stopped more frequently and searched to see if they are smoking? … The questions of enforceability and what intrusions are necessary to enforce it are critically important.”

While there is plenty of evidence that public space and workplace bans on smoking improve the health of adults and their children, not even the scholars trying to envision a future without tobacco smoking are pushing for all-out prohibition. One of the stumbling blocks for prohibition would be the disproportionate affect such a law would have on the poor.

“About 5 percent of people with a graduate degree smoke and about 30 percent of people with a GED smoke, so there’s a very steep social gradient,” Bayer explains.

With millions of people still addicted to cigarettes, there is also the very real fear that a ban would spawn a black market similar to what exists with illegal drugs or what happened with alcohol during Prohibition.

Bayer suggests that one way to help people quit would be by tackling the problem from the supply side. “I think we would do much better to think about reducing the nicotine content, so that the addictive quality of cigarettes wasn’t as severe, and make quitting easier.”

The World Health Organization’s Framework Convention on Tobacco Control established a method called MPOWER in 2008 that aims to end the “global tobacco epidemic,” which kills over 7 million people each year. The way to do this is not by banning it all at once, but instead by monitoring use and prevention, protecting citizens from second-hand smoke, offering ways to help people quit, warning people of the dangers of smoking, enforcing bans on advertising, and raising taxes on tobacco products.

Washington, D.C. (Wednesday, Sept. 6, 2017) – The fiscal year 2018 Departments of Labor, Health and Human Services, and Education, and Related Agencies (LHHS) Appropriations bill provides a total of $166 billion. This figure includes $164.1 billion in discretionary funding as well as $1.896 billion in cap adjustment funding to prevent waste, fraud, abuse and improper payments in the Medicare, Medicaid, and Social Security programs.

U.S. Senator Patty Murray (D-Wash.), Ranking Member of the Departments of Labor, Health and Human Services, and Education, and Related Agencies Subcommittee, said:

“This is a bipartisan compromise and not the bill that either of us would have written on our own, but I am glad that Senator Blunt and I were able to work together to protect many critical investments in students, workers, women, families, and the economy. I am especially pleased that this bill doesn't include a single new damaging policy rider. While I support this bill as a compromise and the best we can do given the inadequate investment levels we’ve been given, it underscores the need for us to keep working toward another budget deal to increase investments in people, communities, and economic growth. But this bill is a good first step and a strong foundation for continued bipartisan work.”

Key Points & Highlights

The bill recommends increases for several programs that enjoy strong bipartisan support, including significant investments in the National Institutes of Health. The bill also protects investments in public schools and increases the maximum Pell grant by $100 to $6,020.

DEPARTMENT OF LABOR:

Job Training and Employment Services. The bill protects critical investments in the Workforce Innovation and Opportunity Act (WIOA) grants to States, which support our national workforce system and help approximately 20 million people each year look for work, train for in-demand careers, and connect with local employers ready to hire. The bill includes $2.71 billion for the WIOA formula grants and rejects the Administration’s proposal to cut them by over $1.1 billion, or 40 percent.

Apprenticeship Grants. The bill includes $95 million to support the ApprenticeshipUSA Initiative, which is consistent with fiscal year 2017. This funding will continue to expand innovative, job-driven approaches that expand apprenticeship programs to train workers with 21st century skills that meet employer and industry needs. The bill directs the Department of Labor to generate and respond to new employer demand for apprenticeship programs and to recruit and serve under-represented populations, with a particular emphasis on increasing the representation of women in apprenticeships.

Veterans Employment and Training Services. The bill includes $284 million for veterans training programs, providing intensive employment services to veterans and eligible spouses, transitioning service members early in their separation from military service, and wounded warriors recuperating in military treatment facilities. The bill includes a $4 million increase for the Transition Assistance Program to expand employment workshops at military installations and in virtual classrooms worldwide for exiting service members and spouses.

Wage and Hour Division (WHD). The bill maintains funding of $227.5 million for the Wage and Hour Division. Wage and Hour enforces important federal labor laws, including those covering the minimum wage and overtime for 135 million workers nationwide. A focus of the Division is ensuring a fair day’s pay for a fair days work by investigating employer violations of the Fair Labor Standards Act and collecting back pay owed to workers. Last year, WHD recovered almost $270 million for more than 280,000 workers.

Bureau of International Labor Affairs (ILAB). The bill rejects President Trump’s proposal to slash the budget of this critical agency and provides the current level of $86 million to ensure that our trading partners around the world respect workers’ rights and workers in the United States are competing on a level playing field. These funds will enable ILAB to monitor and enforce labor provisions in the nation’s trade agreements, and support additional grant assistance to address worker rights issues and combat exploitative child labor around the world.

DEPARTMENT OF HEALTH AND HUMAN SERVICES (HHS):

National Institutes of Health (NIH). The bill provides $36.1 billion for NIH, an increase of $2 billion from last year’s level and $9.5 billion above President’s request. The increase includes an additional $414 million for Alzheimer’s disease research for a total of $1.8 billion. It also includes increases of $140 million for the BRAIN Initiative and $50 million for research to combat antimicrobial resistance. Every NIH Institute and Center receives increased funding to support investments that advance science and speed the development of new therapies, diagnostics and preventive measures, improving the health of all Americans. The bill rejects the President’s arbitrary proposal to dramatically cut facilities and administrative support, and includes language to ensure NIH adheres to its current policies for calculating these costs.

The Affordable Care Act (ACA). The bill provides the Center for Medicare and Medicaid Services (CMS) with funding and program authorities that are consistent with those in fiscal year 2017, ensuring the Administration has sufficient resources to administer Medicare, Medicaid and the ACA. This includes full funding for the ACA Navigator program and other outreach and enrollment support programs. The bill does not include new language restricting HHS’ authority to administer or enforce the ACA.

Family Planning Clinics. The bill includes $287 million for the Title X program, the same level of funding as in fiscal year 2017. Grantees rely on these funds to provide comprehensive family planning and preventive health services to nearly 5 million people. The bill also includes new bill language that directs HHS to administer the program as it was during the Obama Administration.

Domestic Violence and Sexual Assault Programs. The bill includes $5 million for a new HRSA grant to support clinical training of sexual assault nurse examiners (including registered nurses, nurse practitioners, and nurse midwives) to administer medical forensic examinations and treatments to victims of sexual assault in hospitals, health centers, and other emergency health care settings. The bill also includes an additional $5 million, a 30 percent increase, to the tribal set-aside for domestic violence shelters and related services, as well as an additional $5 million, an 11 percent increase, to CDC’s Rape Prevention and Education program.

Children's Hospitals Graduate Medical Education (CHGME). The bill includes $305 million for CHGME, which is $5 million more than fiscal year 2017. This funding will expand support for freestanding children’s hospitals’ training of resident physicians, research capabilities and care for vulnerable and underserved children.

Centers for Disease Control and Prevention (CDC). The bill provides $7.18 billion to CDC, which is $1.2 billion more than the President’s request. The bill rejects cuts proposed by the administration to vital public health priorities such as immunization grants, HIV/AIDS prevention, birth defects and global health. The bill also maintains separate funding for chronic disease prevention programs - in the areas of tobacco cessation, diabetes, nutrition, obesity, heart disease and stroke prevention - and rejects the proposed “America’s Health” block grant to states.

Substance Abuse and Mental Health. The bill provides $3.8 billion for the Substance Abuse and Mental Health Services Administration (SAMHSA), which is $13 million more than fiscal year 2017 and $387 million more than the President’s request. The bill includes $15 million at SAMHSA for a new opioid prevention program that will fund prevention grants to communities and community coalitions based on evidence-based programs and promising practices. This bill includes $500 million for the State Response to the Opioid Abuse Crisis grants and a new $5 million Screening and Treatment for Maternal Depression program, which were both authorized in the 21st Century Cures Act.

Preschool Development Grants. The bill provides $250 million for Preschool Development Grants, which were proposed for elimination in the President’s budget. The first round of grants provided access to high-quality preschool for low- to moderate- income families in over 230 communities across 18 states, serving approximately 30,000 children in the most recent school year. The new round of Preschool Development Grants, as authorized in the Every Student Succeeds Act, would continue to expand access while improving coordination of existing early childhood programs and alignment with K-12 education. The bill also maintains the current level of funding for Head Start and the Child Care and Development Block Grant.

Community Services. The bill rejects the President’s proposal to eliminate the Low Income Home Energy Assistance Program (LIHEAP) and the programs under the Community Services Block Grant (CSBG) Act. The bill maintains the current funding level of $3.39 billion for LIHEAP, which provided critical heating and cooling assistance to over 6 million households at the same level of funding in fiscal year 2016. The bill provides $700 million for the Community Services Block Grant, less than a 3 percent reduction from fiscal year 2017, and maintains the current funding level for the Community Economic Development and Rural Community Facilities programs.

Teen Pregnancy Prevention (TPP). The bill includes $108 million for the TPP program, which provides funding for evidence-based interventions that reduce teen pregnancy and are medically accurate as well as age appropriate. This is level with fiscal year 2017. The program was proposed for elimination in the President’s budget. The bill also includes new bill language directing HHS to administer the program as it was during the Obama Administration.

Office of Refugee Resettlement. The bill provides $320 million for the Transitional and Medical Services program, which would allow HHS to continue the current policy of providing eight months of cash and medical assistance at the projected number of eligible arrivals, and to sustain the matching grant program. The bill consolidates the Refugee Social Services, Targeted Assistance and Refugee Health Promotion programs, and rejects the President’s request to cut those services by $43 million, or 20 percent. The bill provides an increase of $2 million to the Victims of Trafficking program, which provides a variety of services to victims of commercial sex and forced labor trafficking. The bill also reflects HHS projections for a continued reduction in the numbers of referrals to its Unaccompanied Children’s Program compared to recent years.

DEPARTMENT OF EDUCATION:

Supporting Elementary and Secondary Education. The bill protects key investments needed to support the implementation of the Every Student Succeeds Act (ESSA), the bipartisan reauthorization of the Elementary and Secondary Education Act. The bill includes:

$15.5 billion, $25 million more than fiscal year 2017, for Title I-A grants to local educational agencies (LEAs). The bill also rejects the President’s request for language authorizing the Department to use $1 billion of these funds to compel districts to adopt policies which are not authorized by ESSA. This proposal would have resulted in funding cuts to all eligible public school districts. The Title I-A program assists half of the nation’s schools in their efforts to raise student achievement for the almost 24 million students served by such programs. These programs provide extra academic support to help students, particularly those in high-poverty schools, meet college- and career-ready state academic standards, including through preschool programs for eligible children;

$2.1 billion, the same as the current level, for Supporting Effective Instruction state grants, rejecting the President’s proposal to eliminate this support for evidence-based professional development and other activities that increase student achievement. States have submitted and continue to submit plans to the Department that describe how they will use these funds for teacher and school leader training programs and other activities that would be undermined if such a proposal were adopted.

$1.2 billion, the same as the current level, for the 21st Century Community Learning Centers program. The President’s budget proposed eliminating this source of support for afterschool and extended learning time activities for 1.8 million students at approximately 11,500 centers around the nation.

$95 million, a reduction of $5 million from the fiscal year 2017 level, for the Education Innovation and Research program, which supports the development and scaling up of evidenced-based innovations designed to improve student achievement in public schools. The bill does not include language requested in the President’s budget to authorize private school vouchers to be funded within this program; and

$450 million, rejecting the Administration’s proposed elimination and $50 million more than the fiscal year 2017 level, for the Student Support and Academic Enrichment formula grant program. This program provide flexible resources that states, LEAs and schools can decide how to best use to improve student outcomes.

College Access and Affordability: The bill maintains or increases a range of programs that help students prepare for, succeed in and pay for college. These include:

$22.5 billion in discretionary spending for Pell Grants in fiscal year 2018, an increase in the maximum award by $100, to a new level of $6,020, and the rescission of $2.6 billion in prior year appropriations. The increase in the maximum award combined with last year’s reinstatement of year-round or summer Pell grants will help make college more affordable for roughly eight million Pell recipients. The bill preserves enough of the estimated $8 billion surplus of funds previously appropriated for Pell to keep the program in surplus through the remainder of the decade;

$733 million for the Supplemental Educational Opportunity Grant program proposed for elimination in the President’s budget. These funds provide additional grant aid to 1.6 million undergraduate students, 70 percent of who had family incomes less than 30 percent. The bill also rejects the 50 percent cut to the Federal Work Study program proposed in the President’s budget, maintaining the current funding level of $990 million for the more than 600,000 undergraduate and graduate students who receive financial assistance through the program.

$953 million, an increase of $3 million more than last year, for the TRIO program, rejecting the President’s budget proposal to cut the program by $142 million and deny assistance to 130,000 individuals served through TRIO’s education opportunity centers or McNair Postbaccalaureate Achievement Program. The bill also rejects the Administration’s proposed 35 percent cut to GEAR UP, maintaining the $340 million current funding level for college awareness and preparation programs for low-income elementary, middle, and high school students.

The bill also includes new bill language restoring the eligibility period for Pell Grants for those students defrauded by institutions of higher education and language directing the Secretary to take additional actions to provide relief from fraudulently issued federal loan debt, including by contacting potentially eligible borrowers using information already available to the Secretary.

Office for Civil Rights (OCR). The bill provides $117 million, an increase of $8.5 million, for the Department of Education’s OCR. These funds are needed to maintain current staffing levels to handle an increased workload of complaints and investigations and allow for timely reporting of the important civil rights data collection.

RELATED AGENCIES:

National Labor Relations Board (NLRB). The bill maintains the current funding level of $274 million for the NLRB, which is charged with protecting employee and employer rights by enforcing the National Labor Relations Act. The bill is free of language that might restrict or interfere with the NLRB’s activities.

Corporation for Public Broadcasting (CPB). The bill provides $445 million, the same as the current level for CPB, to support a healthy and vibrant network of public media stations across the country. The federal appropriation supports more than 1,400 locally owned and operated public television and radio stations that serve almost 99 percent of the American population living in rural and urban communities across all 50 states, the District of Columbia and U.S. territories. In addition, the bill provides $20 million, a decrease of $30 million, to continue federal support for the costs associated with replacing CPB’s interconnection system and system wide infrastructure that benefits the American people.

Corporation for National and Community Service. The bill protects critical investments in CNCS, which supports thousands of nonprofits, schools, faith-based groups, and local governments in meeting pressing local needs through community service and social innovation. The bill rejects the Administration’s proposal to eliminate the agency and includes $1 billion to support more than 345,000 AmeriCorps and Senior Corps members serving in 50,000 locations, providing direct services and mobilizing millions of additional volunteers to solve problems, expand opportunity, and strengthen communities.

Social Security Administration (SSA). The bill provides $12 billion for Social Security’s administrative budget. The Committee recognizes the budgetary needs and critical importance of SSA, and expects to revisit this funding level in conference. SSA affects the lives of 50 million Americans currently receiving retirement and survivor benefits, as well as the millions more who become eligible each year and those applying for and receiving disability benefits.

Institute of Museum and Library Services (IMLS). The bill provides $235 million, an increase of $4 million more than fiscal year 2017, and $212 million more than the President’s request. IMLS is the primary source of federal support for our nation’s 123,000 libraries and approximately 35,000 museums. IMLS provides grants to every state and territory in the country.

When it comes to the rate at raising money for his campaign, he takes the cake hands down. He announced a matter of weeks ago and he is already at nearly 30 million in donations – most of which coming from millennials donating everything they have for the cause they believe in.

NPC Daily has reported stories of forward-thinking liberals who have donated their entire student loans to the Bernie Sanders campaign, some who have took out multiple mortgages on their property as well as some who have donated their family’s money.

There have been numerous millennials who have sold their organs such as kidneys, liver parts, skin grafts and hundreds of thousands of gallons of blood. This report is gathered from the quote of a brave millennial who sold both of his testicles to raise money for the Bernie Sander’s 2020 campaign.

My heart is set and my mind is made up. Bernie’s promises will make our country into what our founding fathers envisioned. I already donated my life’s savings to the Bernie 2020 campaign but I wanted to donate more. Since I don’t have any personal property and I work a minimum wage job, I sold both of my testicles for $10,000 each and donated all of it to Bernie’s campaign. I’m a little sore but I know it will be worth it in the end. Jared Michelle, 28, NYU

It’s a wonderful sacrifice for a wonderful cause. If Bernie Sanders wins the election, there will be medicare for all and everything will be free for everyone. That means Jared will actually get his testicles back if Bernie Sanders wins in 2020. As progressives, we can think of no better way to show support for a future we can all believe in. We can only hope that liberals across the nation will follow in Jared’s footsteps."

Keanu Reeves has lovingly supported his younger sister through the most traumatic period of her life. Now he's taken her on a holiday to Tahiti

As film star Keanu Reeves flies into Tahiti with a slim, dark-haired woman by his side, there's no mistaking the look in his eyes as he gazes happily at her. It is obvious that he loves her.

She is the woman who receives flowers and special messages from him at least once a week; the one he suns with on tropical beaches; the one he took as his date to the Oscars five years ago, introducing her as ""the very special woman in my life"".

Yet Keanu's affection for this beauty has a nobility and virtue beyond the tacky world of Hollywood. She is his younger sister, she has faced death, and he will do anything for her. Keanu, 34, has lovingly supported Kim, 32, since she was diagnosed with lymphatic cancer more than 10 years ago.

""I love Kim,"" Keanu says. ""She's so brave, and I want the very best for her. You can star in hit movies, but that's nothing compared to going through what Kim's been through.""

The siblings have always been very close. When Keanu was a baby, their constantly travelling parents, Patricia and Samuel, moved from his birthplace of Beirut, Lebanon, to spend a year in the Sydney suburb of Dover Heights. Kim was born in Australia, at Sydney's Royal Women's Hospital, Paddington.

The toddlers were thrown together by adversity when their parents split soon after. Patricia moved her young family to New York and then Toronto, Canada, They weathered her three remarriages, and the birth of their half-sister, Karina, in 1976.

Kim has bittersweet memories of their childhood. ""We never had anyone to play with us, to watch me riding horses or Keanu playing hockey,"" she recalls. ""But what we always had was each other.""

A friend remembers that the two were always inseparable. ""He was very much the elder brother and felt very strongly about her.""

Keanu cheered Kim on through her early career as a model, and she took him in when he was finding his feet in Hollywood. But it was when Kim's illness was at its worst that his true supporting nature shone through.

""Keanu helped me so much through my illness,"" Kim says.

""When the pain got really bad, he would sit with me and hold my hand, and keep the 'bad man' from making me dance. He was supporting me and comforting me all the time, even when he was away.""

The pair recently took time out from Keanu's Hollywood commitments for a holiday together in tropical Tahiti. Now, after eight years of battling the disease that took her to the brink of death, Kim is in remission and can revel in the balmy sunshine.

In Tahiti, Keanu carried Kim's bags, opened doors for her and guided her to the water's edge for a ferry boat ride.

Keanu's support of his little sister has always been loyal and unswerving. He rarely speaks about Kim's health - those close to him say it's for fear of breaking down in tears.

Keanu was expected to return to Australia for the April 7 premiere of Matrix, the science fiction thriller he filmed here last year. During the shoot, he also toured with his rock band, Dogstar, and went out of his way to sign autographs for a group of children suffering from leukaemia.

Explaining his action to friends, the star simply said, ""Someone in my family has cancer.""

Four Wilmington Police Department officers shot Jeremy McDole on September 23, 2015. The Delaware Department of Justice (DOJ) undertook an investigation to determine whether any of the four officers should be charged with a criminal offense. As detailed in this report, DOJ also examined whether, notwithstanding any potential violations of criminal law, there were deficiencies in the Wilmington Police Department’s policies and/or training that should be corrected in light of Mr. McDole’s shooting, to ensure that similar incidents do not occur in the future.

Our investigation revealed serious deficiencies in the way in which the Wilmington Police Department prepares its police officers to deal with situations like the one that Mr. McDole presented, specifically with regard to use of force policies and training and policies for dealing with individuals with mental illness, disabilities, or cognitive impairments. Most significantly, we find that the “continuum of force” provisions of the Wilmington Police Department’s use of force policy are effectively meaningless for police officers as currently written.

With respect to three of the four officers – Senior Corporal (S/Cpl) Daniel Silva, Corporal (Cpl) Thomas Lynch, and Corporal (Cpl) James MacColl – DOJ did not find probable cause to charge them with a criminal offense. Through our investigation, we determined that these three officers believed – at the moment they discharged their firearms – that doing so was necessary to protect themselves, or others, against death or serious physical injury. Because of that belief, they were entitled under Delaware law to use deadly force to subdue Mr. McDole. Under Delaware’s deferential legal standard for the use of deadly force by a law enforcement officer, their subjective belief that using deadly force was necessary to protect themselves or others immunizes them from criminal responsibility.

With respect to the fourth police officer who discharged his firearm, Senior Corporal (S/Cpl) Joseph Dellose, the Attorney General did believe that the state should attempt to gather sufficient evidence to pursue a felony assault charge, based upon S/Cpl Dellose’s conduct in immediately confronting Mr. McDole rather than communicating with officers who S/Cpl Dellose knew were already on the scene, and discharging his shotgun in the manner that he did. However, after hiring a former federal prosecutor from Pennsylvania to prepare a case for possible criminal prosecution and after consulting with two nationally recognized police use-of-force experts who had recently recommended criminal charges against the Cleveland police officer who shot Tamir Rice, and after receiving opinions from both of those experts that S/Cpl Dellose’s actions did not constitute criminal conduct under the Delaware Code, DOJ concluded that it could not proceed with a criminal prosecution against S/Cpl Dellose given that the defense would present unchallenged expert testimony that S/Cpl Dellose’s conduct was reasonable.

Although DOJ is not able to pursue criminal charges against S/Cpl Dellose, it is DOJ’s position that S/Cpl Dellose’s conduct in this case was extraordinarily poor police work that endangered both the public and his fellow officers. DOJ does not believe that S/Cpl Dellose should be employed by the Wilmington Police Department in any role where he would be carrying a firearm in public.

Scope of Investigation

The scope of the investigation into Mr. McDole’s death was much broader than the scope of prior investigations that have been undertaken by DOJ regarding police-involved shootings. There were a number of reasons for this. First, this case was the first police-involved shooting since Attorney General Denn assumed responsibility in January 2015 where there was a bona fide question as to whether the individual who was shot was armed with a weapon at or around the time of the shooting. This created a need for a broader factual investigation. Second, concerns were raised by Mr. McDole’s family as to (among other things) (1) the integrity of the scene of the shooting (and, in particular, whether evidence may have been placed at the scene by Wilmington Police Department officers), (2) the possibility of prior contact between Mr. McDole and one or more of the officers involved, and (3) the possibility of additional video of the incident. All of these issues had to be thoroughly investigated by DOJ investigators, in addition to their investigation of the shooting incident itself. Third, a decision was made early in the investigation that, notwithstanding any issues of criminal liability, the shooting raised serious questions about the Wilmington Police Department’s preparation of its officers, which DOJ should attempt to address through the use of outside experts for the future benefit of both the Wilmington Police Department and other Delaware police departments. All of these factors resulted in an investigation that was more extensive than other investigations of police-involved shootings.

Finally, the preliminary conclusion that DOJ should attempt to gather sufficient evidence to pursue a felony assault charge against S/Cpl Dellose required that DOJ (a) recruit, hire, and deputize a former federal prosecutor who was not a member of the Delaware bar to prepare the case for possible presentation to a Delaware grand jury, and (b) consult with two national experts with respect to police conduct who had supported criminal charges against a Cleveland police officer with respect to the shooting of Tamir Rice, in order to determine whether the facts collected by DOJ were sufficient to initiate a criminal prosecution against S/Cpl Dellose. DOJ first consulted with Jeffrey Noble, former Deputy Chief of the Irvine Police Department in California, who has been involved in over one thousand police use-of-force investigations and, in November 2015, authored an expert opinion on behalf of Tamir Rice’s family that criticized the expert opinions of the Cleveland District Attorney and argued that the Cleveland police officer who shot Tamir Rice should be held responsible for his death. After reviewing all of the materials in the McDole case, Mr. Noble told DOJ that, in his expert opinion, S/Cpl Dellose’s conduct did not violate Delaware’s criminal statute. After receiving Mr. Noble’s opinion, DOJ solicited a second opinion from Roger Clark, the former head of the Los Angeles Sheriff’s Department’s North Regional Surveillance and Apprehension Team. Mr. Clark has been retained as a consulting expert 1,400 times, the majority of times for cases involving the use of force, and like Mr. Noble, authored an expert opinion last year on behalf of Tamir Rice’s family that criticized the expert opinions of the Cleveland District Attorney and argued that the Cleveland police officer who shot Tamir Rice should be held responsible for his death. Like Mr. Noble, Mr. Clark reviewed all of the materials in this case, and told DOJ that, in his expert opinion, S/Cpl Dellose’s conduct did not violate Delaware’s criminal statute.

DOJ’s investigation included:

In the days immediately after the shooting, a broad-based neighborhood canvass involving multiple DOJ investigators to locate eyewitnesses, video or audio evidence, or any other information that would help DOJ prosecutors to understand all relevant facts from the incident in which Mr. McDole was shot. This canvass was accompanied by a public request through traditional media and social media for persons with information to come forward.

Ballistic evidence was analyzed by Carl M. Rone of the Delaware State Police Forensic Firearms Services Unit. The evidence itself was gathered by the Wilmington Police Department and the Delaware Division of Forensic Science from the crime scene.

Performance of an autopsy by the Delaware Medical Examiner’s office. This autopsy, which was received by DOJ on January 28, 2016, included a post-mortem toxicology report.[1]

Interviews of Wilmington Police Department officers who were at the scene of Mr. McDole’s shooting and civilian witnesses. Some of these interviews were conducted by Wilmington Police Department officers and observed by DOJ investigators, others were conducted jointly between DOJ and WPD officers, and some were conducted by DOJ investigators outside the presence of WPD officers.

Interviews by DOJ of members of Mr. McDole’s family (accompanied by their legal counsel), followed by interviews of persons identified by those family members as potentially having relevant knowledge.

Subpoenaing and reviewing thousands of pages of documents from the Wilmington Police Department, and hundreds of pages of documents from other third parties.

Microscopic examination of swabs taken from Mr. McDole’s hands by the R.J. Lee group, an independent laboratory. The swabs themselves were gathered by the Wilmington Police Department at the scene

Video evidence, including a version of the cell phone video processed by the Federal Bureau of Investigation, providing a detailed review of the images captured by the cell phone video.

Collection and review of video evidence from multiple stationary locations in the area of Mr. McDole’s shooting.

Retention of experts in police policies and training to review the policies and trainings of the Wilmington Police Department, in order to identify any relevant deficiencies relating to the incident involving Mr. McDole.

Retention of an attorney from the Pennsylvania bar (a former federal prosecutor) sworn as a Delaware DOJ Special Deputy Attorney General to prepare the case for possible prosecution, in order to avoid any real or perceived conflicts presented by DOJ prosecutors presenting a case involving criminal charges against a Wilmington Police Department officer.

Retention of two national experts in police practices to determine whether, if charges were filed, the State could rebut expert testimony expected from the defendant officer with respect to the justification of his conduct under Title 11, Section 464 of the Delaware Code. As noted above, the national experts retained by DOJ were the two experts retained by Tamir Rice’s family who recommended criminal charges against a police officer in Cleveland, Ohio for the police shooting incident that led to Tamir Rice’s death.

While there, Trump also left a note, following in the footsteps of other US leaders, including former presidents Barack Obama and George W. Bush, and former Secretary of State Hillary Clinton.

""It is a great honor to be here with all of my friends — so amazing and will never forget!"" Trump wrote in a note signed by him and first lady Melania Trump.

Obama visited the memorial in July 2008, while he was still a U.S. senator and presidential candidate.

""I am grateful to Yad Vashem and all of those responsible for this remarkable institution,"" Obama's note in the guest book read. ""At a time of great peril and promise, war and strife, we are blessed to have such a powerful reminder of man's potential for great evil, but also our capacity to rise up from tragedy and remake our world.""

It continued: ""Let our children come here, and know this history, so that they can add their voices to proclaim 'never again.' And may we remember those who perished, not only as victims, but also as individuals who hoped and loved and dreamed like us, and who have become symbols of the human spirit.""

Bush visited Yad Vashem in January 2008, shortly before his second term ended. He, too, was brief.

""God bless Israel,"" Bush wrote in his note.

According to the Associated Press, the memorial chairman said Bush had tears in his eyes as he toured the memorial, and he reportedly told Secretary of State Condoleezza Rice that the US should have bombed Auschwitz to stop the genocide.

When first lady Laura Bush visited the memorial in May 2005, she wrote a longer message:

""Each life is precious. Each memory calls us to action to honor those lost. We commit (sic) ourselves to reject hatred and to teach tolerance and live in peace.""

Secretary of State in March 2009, following an election in which she competed against Obama for the Democratic nomination for president. It was her first Mideast visit as the top US diplomat.

""Yad Vashem is a testament to the power of truth in the face of denial, the resilience of the human spirit in the face of despair, the triumph of the Jewish people over murder and destruction and a reminder to all people that the lessons of the Holocaust must never be forgotten,"" Clinton's note read. ""God bless Israel and its future.""

RESEARCH FINDINGS : Howard Shultz, the chairman of Starbucks is an active zionist. In 1998 he was honoured by the Jerusalem Fund of Aish HaTorah with ""The Israel 50th Anniversary Friend of Zion Tribute Award"" for his services to the zionist state in ""playing a key role in promoting close alliance between the United States and Israel"". The Jerusalem Fund of Aish HaTorah funds israeli arms fairs chaired by the butcher of Jenin - General Shaul Mofaz, and the zionist propaganda website honestreporting.com.[1]

Howard Shultz,

Chairman of Starbucks His work as a propagandist for Israel has been praised by the Israeli Foreign Ministry as being key to Israel's long-term PR success [2]. Recently whilst the Israeli army was slaughtering Palestinians in Jenin, Nabulus and Bethlehem he made a provocative speech blaming the Palestinians of terrorism, suggesting the intifada was a manifestation of anti- Semitism, and asked people to unite behind Israel [3]. At a time when other businesses were desperately pulling out of Israel, Starbucks decided to help Israel's floundering economy and invest in Israel - a joint venture with Israeli conglomerate Delek Group for Starbucks outlets in Israel ( Shalom Coffee Co).[4][5][6]. A bad business decision - Starbucks made heavy losses and in April 2003 Starbucks were forced to announced that all 6 Starbucks cafes in Israel will be shut down and its partnership with Delek end.[14] It has been revealed that Starbucks still continues to support Israel by sponsoring fund raisers for Israel.[15] See [11] for suggested action against Starbucks.. Oxfam has misguidedly partnered with Starbucks in return for £100,000 - please support our ""Campaign Against Oxfam Agreement with Starbucks"". Starbucks fully supports Bush's war of terror and has opened a Starbucks in Afghanistan for the US invaders - they like to do there bit to help the occupation.[17] ADDITIONAL INFO & REFs : [1] Israel 50th Anniversary Friend of Zion Tribute Award Howard Schultz was presented with ""The Israel 50th Anniversary Friend of Zion Tribute Award"" by the The Jerusalem Fund of Aish HaTorah in August 27, 1998. [a][e] According to the Jerusalem Fund of Aish HaTorah ""The Friends of Zion award salutes leaders who have played key roles in promoting close alliance between the United States and Israel""[e] Awards Page Mystery Its interesting that the Israel 50th Anniversary Award given to Howard Schultz was once displayed with pride on the Starbucks website on the companys ""Awards and Accolades"" page but since the boycott started biting it has mysteriously disappeared from the page![a]

The Jerusalem Fund of Aish HaTorah 1. The Jerusalem Fund of Aish HaTorah sponsors Israeli military arms fairs chaired by the butcher of Jenin - General Shaul Mofaz, Israel's Minister of Defense. It aims to ""strengthen the special connection between the American, European and Israeli defense industries"" and ""to showcase the newest Israeli innovations in defense"".[f] 2. The Jerusalem Fund of Aish HaTorah also sponsors the zionist propaganda website ""honestreporting.com"".[g] 3. The Aish HaTorah, the main beneficiary of The Jerusalem Fund of Aish HaTorah, whilst described as an apolitical international network of Jewish education centres, produces propaganda material for Israel. One video they produce by Rabbi Ken Spiro titled ""The Islamic Connection to Jerusalem"" starts ""The Islamic connection begins in the 7th century, thousands of years after the original Jewish connection.."" and continues to belittle Jerusalem's Islamic heritage - propaganda to justify Israeli occupation of Jerusalem.[b] Also featured on their site is ""The Occupied Territories - A Primer"" which denies the status of the West Bank and Gaza as ""occupied"" and argues that they be called ""disputed territories""..[c] No wonder they were praised by Israeli Prime Minister Binyamin Netanyahu: ""..I congratulate Aish HaTorah for what they're doing, where they're doing it, and for whom they're doing it.""[d] [a] http://www.starbucks.com/aboutus/recognition.asp

By Sharon Berger

JERUSALEM (April 20) - The Delek Group and Starbucks Coffee International, a wholly owned subsidiary of Starbucks Coffee Company, said yesterday that they had reached an agreement to form a joint venture to open Starbucks here. The costs involved in the joint venture were not disclosed. According to the agreement, which is expected to be signed in the next few weeks, Delek will hold 80.5 percent of the coffee chain, while Starbucks Coffee International will hold the remaining 19.5%. Starbucks will have the option to increase its share to 50% at a later date. Originally Delek and Burger King co-owner Yair Hason were negotiating for a 40% share each in a venture with Starbucks, but a few months ago the deal was cancelled. The announcement that Starbucks will be coming is expected to be welcomed by local coffee lovers who have long been awaiting the rumored arrival of the chain which has with 3,600 stores in the US. According to the Delek Group the plan is ""to open dozens of stores."" The first stores are expected to open late this year. ""We expect Israel to be an excellent market for Starbucks, with great growth opportunities,"" said Peter Masien, president of Starbucks Coffee International. Delek's investment in the coffee chain is part of its strategy to expand into new areas, said Giora Sarig, president of Delek's Israel Fuel Corporation, one of the three subsidiaries of the Delek Group. ""We are delighted to become partners with such a world-class brand as Starbucks,"" he said. The coffee shops will not be connected to the Delek gas stations. The local competition is not overly concerned about the entrance of the well known chain. Aroma's operating manager Ben Balbinder told The Jerusalem Post that ""more coffee stores will raise the awareness of coffee drinking."" He added that according to his personal experience in the US, Starbucks coffee is not on the same level as that of Aroma. Aroma, which sells one and half tonnes of coffee a month, currently has eight cafes with another three are to be opened in the next two months. Balbinder said that the local coffee market is continuing to grow and has contributed to a decision to expand aggressively in the next year and a half. Starbucks , which has been traded on Nasdaq since 1992, has a current market capitalization of $7.8 billion, with more than 4,500 retail locations in the US, Europe, the Middle East, and the Pacific Rim. It is well represented in the Middle East with stores in Bahrain, Saudi Arabia, Kuwait, Lebanon, Qatar, and the United Arab Emirates. The company was founded in 1971 and also sells tea, pastries, ice creams, other food and beverages, and coffee accessories. The company also has an on-line store as well as selling directly to restaurants, businesses, airlines, and hotels. The Delek Group, which was founded in 1951, has three major subsidiaries: Israel Fuel Corporation, Delek Real Estate, and Delek Investments & Properties, a holding company for activities in automotive distribution and retailing, oil and gas exploration, biochemical manufacturing, convenience stores, and other retail operations. Delek is traded on the Tel Aviv Stock Exchange at a value of NIS 2.8b. [7] Two ""Standard replies"" activists are receiving from Starbucks when they complaint about the recent speech Howard Schultz made: First: Thank you for contacting Starbucks Coffee Company. Howard Schultz recently spoke at his local synagogue and shared his concern over the rise of anti-Semitism, which is linked to the growing crisis in the Middle East.

The investment marks the Netanya-based company's first entrance into the overseas retail gasoline markets.

According to Israel's Haaretz.com, poor sales and Delek's failure to find an investor to bail it out of a losing venture caused the decision to shut down the expensive coffeehouses.

For April 2002, their spending record includes the following entry: ""P. W. lost his brother S. in an anti-terror operation in Jenin April 8, 2002. The family is left with eight children, of whom P. is the first to get married. OneFamily (Israel Emergency Solidarity Fund) gave them $1000 toward the wedding.""[c] So the fund rewards the families of war criminals for a job well done!

Some even suggested boycotting Starbucks: It is time for all Americans to boycott Starbucks Coffee. Spread the word on this. They are stopping business relations with Israel, because like so many companies, people, and leaders in the world, they do not have the moral values or courage needed to do otherwise. Add this to the fact that Starbucks does tons of business in Lebanon, Saudi Arabia, Qatar, as well as other radical Arab countries who are working to destroy America. Where they will not pull out of and it makes it clear their stand is with the enemies of Israel and of America. Standing is something that takes moral value and courage today.And their stand indicates the lack of quality of their product. Starbucks has chosen. NOW is the time for us to choose to boycott. Let's call on everyone we can to boycott Starbucks.. [a] Its interesting to observe that it was the ultra-zionist Anti-Defamation League (ADL) that came to Starbucks rescue[b] and put down the zionist backlash against it. (For those unaware of the activities of the ADL see http://www.inminds.co.uk/boycott-news-0313.html ). As the New York Times put it: “Perhaps the most effective of the company's weapons used to combat the rumor, experts said, came from the Anti-Defamation League, which lent its support. Starbucks, which is based in Seattle, did not place any messages refuting the rumor on its Web site. But the Anti-Defamation League contacted the company to investigate the matter and later circulated the company's message to interested parties on its Web site and in telephone calls.” It also quoted Starbuck chairman Howard Shultz, describing him as ""a Jewish American who has long been supportive of Jewish organizations and causes in the United States and in Israel"", saying that the company will return to Israel in due course.[a] See also [17] for another zionist defence of Starbucks. Many other zionist groups also came to Starbucks defence including the Jewish Council for Public Affairs whose alert[d] states: ""The chairman of Starbucks is an avid Zionist who opened the stores in Israel despite the ongoing violence. Coffee is serious business in Israel, and Starbucks was unable to penetrate the market.""

PORTLAND, Maine (AP) — The summer air is sizzling as the Fourth of July approaches, yet 86-year-old Richard Perkins already worries about how he’s going to stay warm this winter.

President Donald Trump has proposed eliminating heating aid for low-income Americans, claiming it’s no longer necessary and rife with fraud. People needn’t worry about being left in the cold, he says, because utilities cannot cut off customers in the dead of winter.

But he is wrong on all counts.

The heating program provides a critical lifeline for people like Perkins, and officials close to the program don’t see any widespread fraud. Guidelines for winter shutoffs by utilities vary from state to state and don’t apply to heating oil, a key energy source in the brittle New England winter.

“It’s beyond my thinking that anyone could be that cruel,” said Perkins, a retired restaurateur who relies on the program to keep warm in Ogunquit, Maine.

The proposal to kill the program, which has distributed $3.4 billion to about 6 million households this fiscal year, will face strong opposition in Congress.

Forty-three senators from mostly cold-weather states already signed a letter urging the Republican chairman and ranking Democrat on an appropriations subcommittee to ensure funding for the Low-Income Home Energy Assistance Program, known in many states by its acronym, LIHEAP (pronounced LY’-heep).

In Maine, the poorest state in New England, the program helped about 77,000 people over the past winter, and those numbers represented less than a quarter of eligible households, said Deborah Turcotte of MaineHousing, which helps to run the program.

Perkins is a typical recipient.

His income was fine 10 or 12 years ago when he retired, but gasoline, food and other expenses grew faster than he anticipated. In the winter, he keeps an eye on his oil storage tank, and the local community action agency sends 100 gallons when it gets low.

It’s difficult for him to keep warm because he’s on a blood thinner, and he shudders at the thought of being cold. But he doesn’t want to move south, either.

“I was born and raised here,” he said. “Maine is part of me. I can’t imagine living anywhere else.”

Mark Wolfe, of the National Energy Assistance Directors’ Association, said that the Trump administration is relying on an old General Accounting Office report on the fraud claim, and that improvements have been made since then. In Maine, for example, only 100 cases — 0.3 percent of all submitted applications — are being investigated for potential fraud, according to MaineHousing.

ADVERTISEMENT

And programs aimed at preventing utilities from being turned off wouldn’t protect everyone. Utility regulations vary, with some states preventing shutoffs during the entire winter and others doing so only on exceptionally cold days.

And there’s absolutely no requirement for heating oil and propane dealers, which are not regulated like electric and natural gas utilities, to make deliveries to customers who cannot pay. That’s a big problem in the Northeast, which accounts for more than 80 percent of the nation’s residential heating oil consumption.

Health and Human Services Secretary Thomas Price, who contends the LIHEAP program doesn’t demonstrate “strong performance outcomes,” said difficult decisions are necessary to streamline the government to focus on the administration’s goals of defense and public safety.

The LIHEAP program already has undergone substantial cuts.

The average benefit has been reduced by $100 from 2010 to 2015 as funding was slashed during the Obama administration. That coincides with Venezuela’s Citgo Petroleum Corp. ending participation in a free-oil program run by a Massachusetts-based nonprofit.

Nationwide, the average home heating cost last winter was $1,448 for propane, $1,227 for heating oil, $902 for electricity and $577 for natural gas.

Many observers refuse to accept that the program will be eliminated altogether.

It’s just too popular in Congress, and it also distributes aid to poor people in states like Florida and Arizona to keep cool on blazing hot summer days.

Sen. Angus King, an independent from Maine, said he and other senators, including fellow Mainer Susan Collins, a Republican, will fight for the program, which he said ensures that needy people “aren’t forced to make the impossible choice between heat and food, medications, or other necessities.”

The Satanic Temple’s “After School Satan Club” Returns With a Nationwide Volunteer Network

SALEM, Mass. — In 2016, The Satanic Temple (TST) generated nationwide controversy with the roll-out of its After School Satan Club (ASSC) campaign, placing openly Satanic clubs in public schools to counterbalance what TST sees as a coercive presence of Evangelical extracurricular clubs in public schools. After a successful first year, ASSC is back, and it promises to be much bigger than before.

“Last year, the After School Satan Club curriculum was only offered in school districts where local chapters of The Satanic Temple could manage and maintain them,” explains Chalice Blythe, National Director for The Satanic Temple’s ASSC campaign. “In that time, we received a flood of emails from parents, educators, and other qualified parties who were interested in operating After School Satan Clubs in schools near them. This year, we have made our curriculum available to this volunteer network, and we expect to see a much larger After School Satan Club presence in 2017. Our curriculum has also been revised by qualified experts in education to provide a reason-based, fun alternative to the evangelical indoctrination clubs already present in the schools. This year’s After School Satan Club is going to be even better and much bigger.”

The ASSC campaign was created specifically to offer an alternative to other religious clubs that seek to indoctrinate children after school, particularly the Good News Club, an Evangelical Fundamentalist club run by the Child Evangelism Fellowship. According to the ASSC website, “Proselytization is not our goal, and we’re not interested in converting children to Satanism. However, we feel that our presence in schools that are burdened with the loathsome stink of the Good News Clubs serves an anti-indoctrination function, illustrating to children that opposing religious perspectives can be held by moral and responsible people who don’t live in fear of divine retribution. We think it’s a positive and strong character-developing lesson that we are happy to deliver.”

Those interested in volunteering to operate an ASSC should contact The Satanic Temple at: info@afterschoolsatan.com. To help support The Satanic Temple efforts to expand the ASSC program, please visit www.afterschoolsatan.com

Judicial Watch Creates Bizarre Fabricated News Story Claiming IRS Gave After School Satan Club “Fast-Track” Tax Exemption

Chalice Blythe – After School Satan Club Director

Stu De Haan – The Satanic Temple Legal Counsel

FOR IMMEDIATE RELEASE

On March 16, 2017 the website Judicial Watch published an article entitled “IRS Gives ‘After School Satan Club’ Tax-Exempt Status in 10 Days” which claimed that the Internal Revenue Service (IRS) “fast tracked a deranged Satanic cult to operate as a nonprofit in taxpayer-funded elementary schools.” While this claim has been repeated by several news organizations, including Fox and The Washington Times, it is utter fiction. The Satanic Temple (TST) does, in fact, run After School Satan Clubs (ASSC) as a reason-based science-centered counterbalance to fundamentalist evangelical after-school programs, but the IRS played absolutely no role in the approval of these clubs. The After School

Satan Clubs are sponsored by the non-profit 501(c)(3), Reason Alliance, Ltd.; however, Reason Alliance earned its tax-exempt status long before ASSC existed and did not, despite claims, receive its exemption in 10 days. Further, nothing in the filings for Reason Alliance make reference to Satan or Satanism. Clearly, any insinuations that “Obama’s IRS” struck a secret alliance with Satanists are nothing more than an absurd fabrication.

Not only is Judicial Watch’s story demonstrably false, it is a clear example of gross journalistic negligence across the reporting spectrum and an inability to comprehend not only what the After School Satan Club is, but also what procedures ASSC underwent to get approval for operation in public schools. Procedures, it should be noted, that are very clearly laid out in the documentation they themselves obtained and released.

Reason Alliance, Ltd., was formed in 2014 by the founders of The Satanic Temple (TST). The non-profit was set up to encourage reason and empathy, reject tyrannical authority, promote justice, and advocate pragmatic common sense. Reason Alliance also supports activities that advance these core values. When the After School Satan Club was formed in July 2016, Reason Alliance was used to sponsor this program as ASSC operations are consistent with its mission statement. This sponsorship supports The Satanic Temple’s After School Satan Club by way of covering the rental fees and liability insurance coverage required by law. The assertion by Judicial Watch and all other news outlets that ASSC is somehow itself a tax exempt entity or operated by Reason Alliance Ltd. has no grounding in reality nor does the documentation they’ve obtained support this claim.

Additionally, multiple news outlets have and continue to refer to The Satanic Temple as a “cult.” This slanderous categorization of our organization is precisely the type of irresponsible, lazy, and sensational journalism that Americans have come to expect. This expectation, however, does not absolve the media from propagating such falsehoods. By any definition of the term, The Satanic Temple does not fall into this category and any accusation of such is not only a bald face lie, it’s libelous due to the heinous connotations implied. Any cursory research of this organization would debunk this allegation, calling into question the actual efforts these journalists put into verifying the facts prior to publishing. This, in essence, is why the After School Satan Club is so necessary in schools to teach critical thought and rational inquiry so this type of vitriol can be avoided in the future.

We hope that news outlets exercise more skepticism toward Judicial Watch press releases in the future.

The Satanic Temple leverages Religious Freedom laws to put After School Clubs in elementary schools nationwide

This school year The Satanic Temple will have After School Clubs in public elementary schools across the nation leveraging Religious Freedom laws established by decades of Evangelical litigation

The Satanic Temple (TST) has announced that this coming school year (2016) will find their organization operating in elementary schools across the nation where they will be offering their new After School Satan Club program to students. While the presence of a religious organization in public schools will no doubt be shocking to some, evangelical litigants — primarily the Child Evangelism Fellowship (CEF) represented by lawyers from the Liberty Counsel — have solidly established the legal rights of religious organizations to operate clubs in public schools.

According to the CEF website, “[…] the United States Supreme Court ruled that a public school which allows use of its facilities to secular groups may not discriminate against religious groups.” And now that the CEF has established its Bible-based Good News Clubs across the nation, TST are eager to offer their own after school clubs, which will focus upon “critical reasoning, independent-thinking, fun, and freethought.”

According to TST spokesperson, Lucien Greaves, “School districts across the nation have received letters from The Satanic Temple explaining that we will be offering our clubs in their schools this coming school year, and parents in those schools can expect to be presented with a permission slip from their children in the first weeks of the Fall semester. All of the districts we’ve approached are nearby to local chapters of The Satanic Temple, and each school district has hosted, or is now hosting, Good News Clubs in their schools. This being the case, we are sure that the school districts we’ve approached are well aware that they are not at liberty to deny us use of their facilities, nor are they at liberty to deny us any level of representation in the schools that they afford to other school clubs — such as fliers, tables, brochures, and school-wide announcements. We would like to thank the Liberty Counsel, specifically, for opening the doors of public schools to the After School Satan Club through their dedication to religious liberty.”

Elaborating the mission of the After School Satan Clubs, Greaves states, “It’s important that children be given an opportunity to realize that the evangelical materials now creeping into their schools are representative of but one religious opinion amongst many. While the Good News Clubs focus on indoctrination, instilling them with a fear of Hell and God’s wrath, After School Satan Clubs will focus on free inquiry and rationalism, the scientific basis for which we know what we know about the world around us. We prefer to give children an appreciation of the natural wonders surrounding them, not a fear of everlasting other-worldly horrors.”"	Press Releases		[]	['school', 'club', 'press', 'releases', 'assc', 'religious', 'temple', 'satan', 'public', 'satanic', 'clubs', 'schools']	"The Satanic Temple Rolls Out “Bigger, Better” Satanic After-School Club for 2017The Satanic Temple’s “After School Satan Club” Returns With a Nationwide Volunteer NetworkSALEM, Mass.

Community leaders continued Sunday to sound off about the Wilmington police shooting that left a 28-year-old wheelchair-bound man dead.

Jeremy “Bam” McDole, 28, was shot and killed by four city officers Wednesday around 3 p.m. in the 1800 block of Tulip Street.

Some called for the Attorney General’s Office to swiftly file charges against the four officers – three of whom are white and one of whom is Hispanic. Others denied police accounts that McDole had a .38-caliber gun, pointing to a YouTube video where a gun is not visible.

“This is an injustice,” said community activist and Hilltop resident Robert Bovell. “There is no way someone in a wheelchair should be shot that many times.”

Wilmington Police Chief Bobby Cummings said McDole was armed when officers arrived around 3 p.m. to a report of a man who had shot himself. McDole was reaching for a gun when the officers opened fire, he said.

Police also say they found a .38-caliber gun at McDole’s side after the shooting.

Cell phone video captured by a bystander and posted to YouTube shows an officer pointing a shotgun at McDole, screaming at him to “drop the gun,” while other officers scream “hands up.”

McDole, who was paralyzed from the waist down, is seen fidgeting and trying to raise himself from the wheelchair. Then he slides his hands up his thigh and toward his waist as the officers open fire.

The video has drawn international attention and a growing chorus of questions about what led up to the shooting. In response, police released a portion of the 911 call where a woman reported to police that a man had shot himself.

She asked police to get an ambulance to the AutoZone parking lot along Lancaster Avenue, saying that the man was still moving and had a gun.

The recording did little to quell some activists’ disbelief that McDole had a gun.

“There was no weapon in that video,” Bovell said. “There is no system in this place we call America that they give you justification for what happened to Mr. McDole.”

Two investigations – one by city police and another by Attorney General Matt Denn’s office – are ongoing. Few details have been released from either office, and a city police spokeswoman said the department may provide more information Monday depending how the investigation progresses.

Frustration over the lack of details could be seen Sunday during Bovell’s live television program called “Community Conversations.”

McDole’s family, including his mother Phyllis, were invited to be on the show. They arrived for the taping, but then left, refusing to talk about McDole’s shooting.

The show went on with Bovell hosting three activists for an hour-long discussion.

One of the guests, who identified himself as Hope, from New Jersey, said the city community needs to unite. “No matter who you are, we will be here to step in to help,” he said.

He questioned the police training that led the four officers to open fire, rather than negotiate with McDole or try to help him.

Bovell agreed. “At what point were your lives threatened?” Bovell asked of the officers. “At what point were your lives in jeopardy? They didn’t take cover; they took a stand, and they aimed and they fired.”

Minister Robert Muhammad, of Wilmington’s Muhammad’s Mosque #35, encouraged peace in the city and touted the importance of people attending the Million Man March in Washington D.C. on Oct. 10 in light of the shooting of McDole. This year’s march will mark 20 years since the original one where African American men gathered on the National Mall.

“This is not going away,” Bovell said. “This is somebody who was shot multiple times – we don’t even know the number – and no one deserves to die that way.”

While commenting on President Donald Trump's very public support for Christianity, as well as the frequent Bible studies and prayer gatherings held at the White House, evangelical Pastor Paul Begley said first lady Melania Trump demanded that the White House be spiritually cleansed and that pagan, demonic items and artificats from the Obama and Clinton years be removed.

Melania Trump reportedly said, ""I’m not going to go into that White House unless it has been completely exorcised,"" according to Pastor Begley. One thing was left, a cross on the wall. ""They cleansed the White House,"" he said. ""They had people in there anointing it with oil and praying everywhere.”

Pastor Begley made his remarks during the Feb. 2 edition of Weekend Vigilante, hosted by Sheila Zilinsky.

“I have to say, when the president allowed 40 pastors to come in to the White House and anoint him with oil and lay their hands and pray on him—seven times he’s done this—that is unheard of,” Begley said. “We haven’t ever – the guy’s got flaws, we all do. But at least he is humble enough and recognizing that he needs God enough that he keeps bringing them in for the prayer.""

""And I’ve got to say this, it might have started with the first lady,"" said Begley. ""I’m just being honest with you.""

“The first lady, in that five hours when the Obamas and the Trumps went down to the Capitol and Trump was being sworn in as the 45th president of the United States,” Begley claimed, “Melania Trump said to her husband – she said, ‘I’m not going to go into that White House unless it has been completely exorcised.'”

He continued, “Because apparently during the eight years when Obama was there, and maybe even some of the presidents before him, there were all kinds of idol gods and images and all kinds of artifacts in there that were demonic, even some of the stuff from the Clinton era because they were really tied in with the Haitians.""

""I can tell you, you can read the Serpent and the Rainbow story and find out just how much Haitian witch-doctor influence was on Bill Clinton and Hillary Clinton’s lives,"" said Pastor Begley. ""They constantly went back there. They spent their honeymoon with a witch doctor. Who does that?""

According to the Washington Post, the Clintons did go to Haiti for their honeymoon in 1975. The Post further reported, “They toured the old hotel where the writer Ernest Hemingway once stayed and visited a voodoo high priest dressed in all white.” The article does not say why they visited the voodoo high priest.

""They decorated their homes with Haitian art,"" said The Post. ""They flew back again and again. Hillary Clinton once said that theirs was a 'Haiti-obsessed family.'""

In his book, My Life, Bill Clinton explained that he and Hillary attended a voodoo ceremony where an alleged ""spirit arrived,"" participants rolled flaming torches over their bodies and walked on hot coals and, at one point, a person bit off the head of a chicken.

Pastor Begley then related that the first lady apparently said, ""'You’ve got to get all of that out of there and send in some preachers and priests'"" – she wanted priests or anyone -- to go in and cleanse the White House or, ‘I will not spend one night in it.'”

The president did, said Begley. ""There were people in there packing up every idol. The only thing that was left, Sheila, was one cross on one wall. They cleansed the White House. They had people in there anointing it with oil and praying everywhere.”

“This was a major spiritual – it might sound like overdoing it, a little excessive,"" he said, ""but you’ve got to take the seat of authority when you go into spiritual warfare. You start with the spiritual authority and then it goes on from there out. I think that that might have been where this whole thing began, in a mighty way of exorcising the demons.”

CNSNews.com contacted Pastor Paul Begley and asked for more information about the spiritual cleansing. Begley said his source for the story was close to ""those working in the White House"" and requested that he (or she) not be named.

In an email to CNSNews.com, Pastor Begley said, "" I was not there, but a close source to those working in the White House revealed to me that the 'Spiritual Cleaning' did take place before the First Lady would feel comfortable living at the White House. All religious artifacts from former administrations were removed expect for 1 cross on 1 wall in the White House. Also Prayer Meetings were established in the White House for prayer and devotions. I was requested to (not reveal my source).""

Melania Trump is a Catholic. Her husband, President Donald Trump, is a Presbyterian. The two were married in an Episcopal church in 2005. When Melania came down the aisle she was holding a Catholic rosary and a vocalist was singing the Ave Maria, reported the Washington Post.

Having a home blessed by a priest is a standard practice among Catholics, especially if there is any concern that anything unholy may be in or have occurred in the home or on the property in the past.

In his many prayer meetings, President Trump reportedly has welcomed evangelical Protestants, Catholics and Jews."

""Residents were suspicious the snake swallowed the victim, so they killed it, then carried it out of the garden,"" said local police chief Hamka, who like many Indonesians has only one name.

Hamka said villagers found the giant serpent lying about 30 metres from Tiba's sandals and machete, adding she was swallowed head first and her body was found intact.

The garden in which she disappeared was at the base of a rocky cliff, pockmarked by caves, and known to be home to snakes, Hamka added.

Giant pythons, which regularly top six metres, are commonly found in Indonesia and the Philippines.

While the serpents have been known to attack small animals, attempts to eat people are rare.

STATE v. ROBINSON.

Supreme Judicial Court of Maine.

March 8, 1950.

Lloyd H. Stitham, County Attorney for the County of Somerset, Pittsfield, for the State.

Dubord & Dubord, by F. Harold Dubord, Waterville, Lewis L. Levine, Waterville, for defendant.

Before MURCHIE, C. J., and THAXTER, FELLOWS, MERRILL, NULTY and WILLIAMSON, JJ.

MERRILL, Justice.

On exceptions. The respondent, Rodney L. Robinson, was tried at the May Term of the Superior Court in the County of Somerset, upon a complaint and warrant charging him with assault and battery upon one John B. Gallant. At the close of the testimony, motion for a directed verdict of not guilty was seasonably made, denied, and exceptions alleged and allowed. At the conclusion of the charge, the respondent in writing requested eleven instructions to the jury. To the denial of the eleventh request, the respondent seasonably alleged exceptions which were allowed. The jury having found the respondent guilty, the case is now before this Court upon the foregoing exceptions.

The record clearly discloses that the complaining witness, John B. Gallant, a deputy sheriff, and the respondent engaged in a serious physical struggle in which both parties were severely and grieviously injured. Each of them complained that the other was the unprovoked aggressor and struck the first blow. The respondent's plea was not guilty. He admitted striking the complainant, and relied upon self defense in justification thereof. He sought to justify his acts upon two grounds, repelling an unwarranted attack by the complaining witness upon him, and resistance of an unlawful arrest.

*261 It would be profitless to relate the conflicting testimony of the complaining witness and the respondent and the witnesses called on behalf of the State and the respondent. Issues of fact were raised and their solution in a large measure depended upon the credence given by the jury to the conflicting testimony of the complaining witness and the respondent. The determination of these questions of fact was peculiarly within the province of the jury which observed and heard the witnesses. As said by this Court in State v. Hume, 131 Me. 458, 460, 164 A. 198, 199:

""We are of opinion that, if the testimony of the state's witnesses was believed, it was sufficient to establish the guilt of the respondent beyond a reasonable doubt. A direct denial of the state's charges and a contradiction of its witnesses raised an issue of fact which was for the jury. There was no error in the denial of the respondent's motion for a directed verdict. State v. Donahue, 125 Me. 516, 517, 133 A. 433; State v. Harvey, 124 Me. 226, 127 A. 275.""

The exception to the refusal to direct a verdict of not guilty must be overruled.

The requested instruction which was refused was as follows:

""The jury is instructed as a matter of law that the evidence adduced by the State is insufficient for you to find that the respondent at the time of the alleged assault was intoxicated to that degree sufficient to authorize the officer to arrest the respondent without a warrant for intoxication. This being true, the attempted arrest without a warrant was unlawful and the respondent had a right to resist with reasonable force. You are further instructed that unless you are convinced beyond a reasonable doubt that the respondent used more force to resist the unlawful arrest than was reasonable, that you should find the respondent not guilty.""

The rule of law with respect to the denial of requested instructions is correctly stated in State v. Cox, 138 Me. 151, 169, 23 A.2d 634, 644, where we said:

""A requested instruction which is not, in its totality, sound law, is properly withheld. It is no part of the duty of the court to eliminate errors in a requested instruction. State v. Cleaves, 59 Me. 298, 303, 8 Am.Rep. 422.""

Neither is it the duty of the Court to supply omissions in a requested instruction in order that the same may be applicable to the case at bar.

Whether or not the respondent was intoxicated was peculiarly a question of fact for the jury. The jury were properly instructed by the court as to what constituted intoxication, and this at the request of the respondent. The determination thereof depended upon the condition of the accused as exhibited by conduct. There was a sharp conflict of testimony between the respondent and his witnesses and the State's witnesses, including the complaining witness, as to the conduct of the accused.

It was an undisputed fact that the respondent had been drinking at the time the alleged assault occurred. This fact, coupled with his unprovoked assault upon the complaining witness, his use of vile epithets, and his appearance both to the witness and to the other officers at the scene of the altercation and later at the jail as related by the State's witnesses, even though denied by the respondent, was sufficient to justify the court in submitting the question of his intoxication at the time of the alleged assault to the jury.

The requested instruction, however, has another infirmity. The instruction taken as a whole was a direction to the jury to return a verdict for the respondent unless they were convinced beyond a reasonable doubt that the respondent used more force than was reasonable in resisting unlawful arrest.

To entitle a respondent to an instruction that he should be acquitted if the jury find or fail to find the existence of a single fact set forth in the instruction, the fact so set forth must be absolutely determinative of the guilt or innocence of the accused upon the entire evidence before the jury. In other words, the record must show that such fact is the only disputed fact upon which the guilt or innocence of the accused depends.

*262 An illegal arrest is an assault and battery. The person so attempted to be restrained of his liberty has the same right, and only the same right, to use force in defending himself as he would have in repelling any other assault and battery. See 4 Am.Jur. Sec. 41, Page 148.

According to the testimony of the complaining witness, he was seated in his truck behind the steering wheel with the door closed and the window open. The respondent was in the street close to the truck. The State's witness testified as follows as to the beginning of the trouble:

""A. After I saw Mr. Robinson I thought he was waving at me to stop, so I stopped, rolled down the window and asked him if he wanted to see me and he said no, that he was talking to his wife. Then I started rolling back up the window and he run up, opened the door and said: `You sons of bitches are laying for me.' I said: `We are watching you and if you continue to drive as you are we will pick you up.' Then he said: `You sons of bitches, you are laying for me now and this is once you can't pick me up.' And then he came into the truck, grabbed me by the throat, choked me in the truck, cut off my wind. We had some struggling and scuffling in the truck.""

Even if the officer told the respondent that he was under arrest before he entered the officer's truck, which is denied by the respondent, this evidence would show that the respondent violently assaulted the officer before the officer made the slightest attempt to take physical custody of him. While it is true that a person who is illegally arrested may use such force as is reasonably necessary to resist the force used against him, he cannot initiate the use of force. We recognize that there are circumstances under which an assault may be repelled by a battery, and a show of force may be repelled by actual force. But words alone do not justify an assault. A mere statement by an officer that a person is under arrest, even if the officer has no authority to arrest, does not justify an attack by him on the officer before any physical attempt is made to take him into custody.

As said in Harris v. State, 21 Ga.App. 792, 95 S.E. 268:

""The officer must, by some physical attempt, endeavor to make the unlawful arrest before the other person can lawfully strike him or otherwise resist him by the use of physical force.""

Absent physical attempt to arrest, the question is not whether the respondent used reasonable force but whether he used any force whatsoever.

Even though the complaining witness, an officer, without right told the respondent he was under arrest, it was a question of fact for the jury whether or not the respondent attacked the officer before the latter made any physical attempt to make the arrest. If so, the respondent was not entitled to use any force whatsoever and he would be guilty. The requested instruction ignored this question of fact. It did not leave its determination to the jury. It presupposed the right of the respondent to use some force and that the only question of fact was whether the force actually used was reasonable. As the instruction did not require the jury to pass upon this issue of fact which could be determinative of the respondent's guilt it was properly refused and the exception to its refusal should be overruled.

Exceptions overruled.

Prosecutors are investigating the site near the city of Nakhodka, which has been dubbed a ""whale jail"" by local media.

Eleven orca and 90 beluga whales are being held in the pens, and activists fear they are illegally being sold to Chinese water parks and aquariums, contravening laws on the capture of wild whales.

Some of the animals have been in containment since July, CBS News correspondent Debora Patta reported on Wednesday.

A video shared on social media on Monday shows a whale being lifted out of a small container by a crane in preparation, activists believe, to ship it to China.

It is illegal to capture wild whales except for educational and scientific purposes following a worldwide ban on commercial whale hunting in 1982. However, orca whales, or killer whales as they are often called, can fetch as much as $6 million at theme parks in China.

Russian newspaper Novaya Gazetta has reported that the four companies that own the containers exported 13 whales to China between 2013 and 2016.

Between 2012 and 2015, the companies allegedly involved were granted permission to capture ten orcas in the wild for educational purposes. However, seven of those whales were exported to China, where one was valued at over $1 million on a customs form.

Earlier this year, Russian authorities called on the Interior Ministry to launch a fraud investigation over the capture and sale of the seven whales.

Other firms are reportedly renting out whales in an effort to get around certain restrictions on the sale of wild sea mammals.

Video shot from a helicopter of the containment tanks shows dozens of beluga whales in tight quarters. Experts say that given the size of the tanks, many of the whales must be calves. The capture of whale calves is categorically forbidden, even for scientific or educational reasons.

Greenpeace Russia has condemned the conditions as ""torture,"" and warned that capturing whales in these numbers threatens the animals' population in the long term.

The Telegraph quoted Greenpeace Russia's Oganes Targulyan as saying that although the law permits the capture of 13 killer whales per year, ""no one is taking into account that at least one orca is killed for every one that is caught.""

""Catching them at this tempo, we risk losing our entire orca population.""

In the nearby Kamchatka region, orca numbers have decreased so drastically that they are now listed as endangered."

Terry Glenn MILLER, Appellant, v. STATE of Alaska, Appellee.

No. 986.

Supreme Court of Alaska.

December 15, 1969.

*422 Denis R. Lazarus, Anchorage, for appellant.

Douglas B. Baily, Dist. Atty., Keith E. Brown, Asst. Dist. Atty., Anchorage, for appellee.

Before DIMOND, RABINOWITZ, BONEY, and CONNOR, JJ.

OPINION

CONNOR, Justice.

Appellant was convicted by a jury verdict of the crime of stabbing at another with intent to wound, in violation of AS 11.15.150. The one at whom the stabbing *423 was directed was Trooper Russell Anderson of the Alaska State Police, who was attempting to effect an arrest of appellant at the time of the attempted stabbing.

The incident out of which the indictment resulted took place in the parking lot of a bowling alley in Soldotna, Alaska, shortly before midnight on March 18, 1967.

At about 11:30 that evening Trooper Anderson and a friend, Ed Meyer, left Anderson's home in Soldotna to remove a dead moose from the Sterling Highway. On the way, they happened to notice a car parked in the lot of a bowling alley which had closed for the night. Anderson decided to check it out; and as he drew near in his patrol car, the other car made a U-turn and proceeded to the back of the bowling alley building. Anderson activated the red light on his patrol car and the other car stopped.

Anderson then walked to the driver's side of the car and found Darlene Heatherton behind the wheel and the car's owner, Terry Glenn Miller, next to her. The trooper testified that he knew both of them, and that he knew they were both minors. When he asked Miss Heatherton for her driver's license, he noticed what appeared to be a case of Lucky Lager beer on the floor behind the driver's seat. Anderson told Heatherton and Miller to get out of the car and informed them that they were under arrest for being minors in possession of an alcoholic beverage. He then took possession of the case of beer, and he noticed at that time that several of the bottles of beer were empty.

Miss Heatherton got into the patrol vehicle, but appellant became argumentative. After a scuffle, appellant returned to his car. Anderson removed appellant forcibly from his car and managed to jostle him to the patrol car where he was planning to handcuff appellant. They slipped to the ground and appellant came up wielding a bayonet. Trooper Anderson testified that Miller slashed at him with the bayonet and that his clip-on necktie might have been knocked loose by the bayonet.

Because he was now wary of appellant and the bayonet, Trooper Anderson stepped backward, unsnapped his revolver and ordered appellant to drop his weapon. Thus the investigation of an automobile parked after hours near a bowling alley had mushroomed into a serious event.

While Trooper Anderson and appellant were standing off from each other, Anderson repeatedly told appellant to drop the weapon and appellant told Anderson to leave him alone. Miss Heatherton then went to appellant to try to convince him to submit to the officer. According to the testimony of Anderson, Miller was so upset that he threatened Miss Heatherton. Finally, the impasse ended when Miller and Miss Heatherton got into Miller's car, and a few moments later the bayonet was dropped out of the car window. About this time Trooper Provine of the Alaska State Police arrived in another patrol car. Anderson and Provine then were able to remove appellant from the car, advise him that he was under arrest for attempting to stab Anderson, and turn him over to custody of Corporal English, who had just come upon the scene.

Appellant specified a number of errors in the prosecution and trial of his case. Although twelve errors are specified, these are not correlated with the body of the argument in appellant's brief. Accordingly, we must deal with the claims of error as we are best able to discern them.

Appellant's first contentions can be grouped under the proposition that the indictment was defective because of irregularities in the constitution and administration of the grand jury. Appellant moved to dismiss the indictment on the grounds that the grand jury was extended beyond the five-month limitation prescribed by Rule 6 of the Rules of Criminal Procedure, that the foreman of the grand jury and one other grand juror were not qualified to sit as grand jurors because they had served beyond the five-month limitation, *424 that the witness before the grand jury that indicted appellant was never properly sworn because the foreman was not qualified to administer the oath to the witness, and that the endorsement of the indictment was defective because the foreman was not qualified to act.

The record is clear that the grand jury foreman served in the months of August and September of 1966, that he was excused from service in October, but again served in January and March of 1967. His actual service did not exceed four separate months. He acted as foreman in January and March of 1967. It is also plain that 15 members of the grand jury voted for the indictment against appellant. Under Criminal Rule 6(c) (2) the disqualification of one or two grand jurors would not invalidate the indictment. Crawford v. State, 408 P.2d 1002, 1011 (Alaska 1965).

We see no harm inflicted on appellant because the grand jury foreman served for a few months, was temporarily excused, and then resumed service a few months later. We find this to be in substantial compliance with the pertinent rule.[1]

A case similar to this one is People v. Whalen, 26 Misc.2d 714, 208 N.Y.S.2d 130 (1960). In that case an indictment returned by a grand jury containing two unqualified members was held to be valid. The court noted that a grand jury can act through a de facto foreman without violating any constitutional rights of the accused.

The role of the foreman was described by the court in People v. Whalen, supra, in the following terms:

""The foreman of the grand jury is appointed by the judge of the court which impaneled the grand jury. He occupies roughly the same position as the foreman of a petit jury. He has no greater or lesser powers than any other grand juror. Each paneled grand juror is a distinct legal entity and the identity of the foreman is merged along with the other jurors. ""The foreman is, in the absence of the courts, the presiding officer of the inquiry; he is merely the instrumentality through which the proceedings and actions of the grand jury are reported to the court, and the most important of his duties is to report all indictments which are returned by the grand jury and to endorse on such bills, as foreman, whether or not they are true bills."" 208 N.Y.S.2d, at 132.

Thus, even if the foreman was somehow not qualified, it would require a greater showing of prejudice to appellant before we would be willing to invalidate the indictment on the ground that the foreman was disqualified and that he had no power to administer oaths or sign indictments.

II

Appellant contests the validity of his arrest, made without a warrant, on the misdemeanor charge of being a minor in possession of an alcoholic beverage.

His claims of error are based upon the rejection by the trial court of appellant's exhibit B, offered to show that the misdemeanor charge against him had been dismissed, the denial of a motion for mistrial based upon the judge's statement in the presence of the jury that the only issue about the legality of the arrest was whether the officer had probable cause to believe that appellant had committed a misdemeanor in his presence, and that the court erred in instructing the jury on the legality of the arrest. Additionally, appellant claims that there was no probable cause to justify the arrest itself.

*425 The relevant arrest statute, AS 12.25.030(1), authorizes a private citizen or a police officer, without a warrant, to make an arrest for a crime ""committed or attempted in his presence."" An arrest for a misdemeanor made by an officer without a warrant is valid if the offense is committed in his presence. Rubey v. City of Fairbanks, 456 P.2d 470, 474 (Alaska 1969); Herrin v. State, 449 P.2d 674, 677 (Alaska 1969); Drahosh v. State, 442 P.2d 44, 46 (Alaska 1968).

Appellant contends that ""an officer who arrests without a warrant on a misdemeanor charge acts at his peril, since the arrest will be unlawful if the offense was actually not committed, even though the officer acted on reasonable grounds and in good faith."" Under appellant's theory, Anderson's arrest of appellant on the misdemeanor charge without a warrant was lawful only if the prosecution proved that the offense was actually committed in Anderson's presence. We disagree.

In Rubey v. City of Fairbanks, supra, we held that an arrest for a misdemeanor committed in the presence of an officer was valid where what the officer observed was sufficiently indicative that an offense was in the course of commission as to lead to the logical conclusion that it was in progress. Support for that ruling was found in United States v. Viale, 312 F.2d 595 (2d Cir.1963), in which the United States Court of Appeals applied the New York statute. The New York statute is similar to our own. In Viale, the court said:

""It is now clear under New York law that one person may without a warrant justifiably arrest another who commits a misdemeanor in his `presence' only when the arrestor actually observed acts which were `in themselves sufficiently indicative of a crime being in the course of commission * * *' [T]he arrestor must have perceived `indications of the commission of the offense sufficient to induce reasonable belief of the fact.'"" (Citations and footnote omitted.) 312 F.2d, at 600.

In Coverstone v. Davies, 38 Cal. 2d 315, 239 P.2d 876 (1952), the California Supreme Court construed the applicable statute, which was also similar to AS 12.25.030(1), as allowing an officer to make a warrantless arrest for a misdemeanor where the officer had probable cause to believe the arrestee was committing the offense in his presence. The court held that the arrest is proper when circumstances exist that would cause a reasonable person to believe that a crime had been committed in his presence. The court explained the policy reasons underlying its interpretation:

""When an arrest for a misdemeanor is made upon the complaint of one other than the arresting officer, it is proper to require the securing of a warrant to justify the arrest. * * * However, to make the same requirement, when the officer sees that in all probability a public offense is being committed in his presence, would be to hamper law enforcement officers in their everyday enforcement of the law. Peace officers would be reluctant to make arrests for fear that they would be held liable for having made an honest and reasonable mistake. It is thus manifest that the day to day problems of law enforcement require that peace officers be allowed to act without fear of being held liable upon the facts as they see them, provided such facts would lead a reasonable person to conclude that he was witnessing the commission of a public offense by the person arrested."" 239 P.2d, at 879-880.[2]

We find these authorities persuasive. We hold that an arrest under AS 12.25.030(1) is lawful where the peace officer has perceived facts which would lead a reasonable man to believe that the *426 arrestee has committed or attempted to commit an offense in his presence. We further hold that appellant's arrest on the charge of being a minor in possession of an alcoholic beverage was lawful.[3] Anderson, an experienced police officer, properly set out to investigate a car parked adjacent to a closed business, late at night, and stopped it when it started to move away. He recognized both occupants and while questioning them saw a partially open case of beer on the floor behind the driver's seat. These facts reasonably indicated that the offense was being committed in his presence.

Lastly, we take up the question of whether one can resist a peaceful arrest even though the arrest is unlawful. The weight of authoritative precedent supports a right to repel an unlawful arrest with force. United States v. Di Re, 332 U.S. 581, 594, 68 S. Ct. 222, 92 L. Ed. 210 (1948); John Bad Elk v. United States, 177 U.S. 529, 537, 20 S. Ct. 729, 44 L. Ed. 874 (1900); United States v. Heliczer, 373 F.2d 241, 248 (2d Cir.1967), cert. den. 388 U.S. 917, 87 S. Ct. 2133, 18 L. Ed. 2d 1359; 1 Wharton, Criminal Law & Procedure, Sec. 216 (1957). This was the rule at common law. It was based upon the proposition that everyone should be privileged to use reasonable force to prevent an unlawful invasion of his physical integrity and personal liberty.

But certain imperfections in the functioning of the rule have brought about changes in some jurisdictions. A new principle of right conduct has been espoused. It is argued that if a peace officer is making an illegal arrest but is not using force, the remedy of the citizen should be that of suing the officer for false arrest, not resistance with force. The legality of a peaceful arrest may frequently be a close question. It is a question more properly determined by courts than by the participants in what may be a highly emotional situation. Because officers will normally overcome resistance with necessary force, the danger of escalating violence between the officer and the arrestee is great. What begins as an illegal misdemeanor arrest may culminate in serious bodily harm or death.

The control of man's destructive and aggressive impulses is one of the great unsolved problems of our society. Our rules of law should discourage the unnecessary use of physical force between man and man. Any rule which promotes rather than inhibits violence should be re-examined. Along with increased sensitivity to the rights of the criminally accused there should be a corresponding awareness of our need to develop rules which facilitate decent and peaceful behavior by all.

The common law rule was developed in a time when self-help was a more necessary remedy to resist intrusions upon one's freedom.

""[It] was developed largely during a period when most arrests were made by private citizens, when bail for felonies was usually unattainable, and when years might pass before the royal judges arrived for a jail delivery. Further, conditions in English jails were then such that a prisoner had an excellent chance of dying of disease before trial."" Warner, ""The Uniform Arrest Act,"" 28 Va. L.Rev. 315 (1942).

Section 5 of the Uniform Arrest Act provides:

""If a person has reasonable ground to believe he is being arrested by a peace officer, it is his duty to refrain from using force or any weapon in resisting arrest regardless of whether or not there is a legal basis for the arrest.""

That provision, or its equivalent, has been enacted as statutory law in California, *427 Rhode Island, New Hampshire, and Delaware. The Model Penal Code, Section 3.04(2) (a) (i) similarly prohibits the use of force ""to resist an arrest which the actor knows is being made by a peace officer, although the arrest is unlawful."" In support of this provision Judge Learned Hand stated:

""The idea that you may resist peaceful arrest * * * because you are in debate about whether it is lawful or not, instead of going to the authorities which can determine, * * * [is] not a blow for liberty but on the contrary, a blow for attempted anarchy."" 1958 Proceedings, American Law Institute, at 254.

At least one state court has adopted the recommended rule as a matter of its common law development. State v. Koonce, 89 N.J. Super. 169, 214 A.2d 428 (1965). The legal literature contains discussions on how much force may be used by either an officer making a lawful arrest or by an unlawfully arrested person in resisting arrest. ""Justification for the Use of Force in the Criminal Law,"" 13 Stan.L.Rev. 566 (1961); ""Criminal Law: Force That May be Used to Resist an Illegal Arrest,"" 9 Okl.L.Rev. 60 (1956). At best only elastic standards can be employed, as so much depends upon the exigencies of the situation, the gravity of the offense, and the amount of force and counterforce used or threatened.

To us the question is whether any amount of force should be permitted to be used by one unlawfully but peaceably arrested. We feel that the legality of a peaceful arrest should be determined by courts of law and not through a trial by battle in the streets. It is not too much to ask that one believing himself unlawfully arrested should submit to the officer and thereafter seek his legal remedies in court. Such a rule helps to relieve the threat of physical harm to officers who in good faith but mistakenly perform an arrest, as well as to minimize harm to innocent bystanders. The old common law rule has little utility to recommend it under our conditions of life today. We hold that a private citizen may not use force to resist peaceful arrest by one he knows or has good reason to believe is an authorized peace officer performing his duties, regardless of whether the arrest is illegal in the circumstances of the occasion.[4]

Under this standard appellant was given the benefit of instructions to the jury more favorable than that to which he was entitled, as the case was submitted on the theory that one has a right to resist with force an unlawful arrest. We reject the claims of error both for the reason that the arrest was proper and because appellant in any event had no right to resist a peaceable arrest.

III

Appellant asserts that the trial court erred in unduly assisting the prosecution, particularly in advising the prosecutor, after he had rested his case, that the proof was not sufficient to withstand a motion for a judgment of acquittal and that he should request leave to reopen his case in order to cure evidentiary deficiencies which had been noted by the court.

The record is somewhat unclear as to what occurred, as there was a conference between court and counsel held at the bench but not on the record.

It appears that at the close of the cross-examination of Trooper English the state's attorney advised the court that the state had no further witnesses but would like to read into evidence several pertinent statutes. A brief conference at the bench, off the record, then ensued, during which appellant claims that the court advised the state's attorney that his evidence was insufficient in proving appellant's age. It appears that the state then continued examining *428 English, who was on the witness stand, thereafter recalled Trooper Anderson, and called a custodian of vital statistics records to establish that Anderson reasonably believed that appellant was a minor at the time of the arrest.

Whether this can be characterized as a reopening of the prosecution's case is not clear from the record. The defendant's case had not yet commenced. But in any event, we do not find in this case that the court abused its discretion in allowing the state to call the additional witnesses.

""The trial court has a large discretion with respect to order of proof in permitting a party to reopen after it has rested. * * * There is no suggestion that this surprised the appellant, or that any further preparation was necessary to meet this testimony."" Massey v. United States, 358 F.2d 782, 786 (10th Cir.1966).

In the case just quoted the trial court had twice permitted the government to reopen its case and to introduce testimony to identify a stolen automobile, after the government had clearly rested. In the case before us we are unable to find that appellant was prejudiced by the trial court's action.

We cannot pass upon appellant's claim that the court improperly aided the state by advising it of the evidentiary deficiency because there is nothing in the record to substantiate such a claim. Appellant, in his brief, states that an objection was made, but a review of the record reveals no such objection. If one was made off the record, appellant's trial counsel should have seen to it that an additional objection was registered for the record.

IV

In support of the proposition that there was probable cause for the arrest, the state attempted to introduce the birth certificate of appellant, which indicated appellant was under twenty-one at the time of the arrest. As foundation for the introduction of the document, the state produced Mrs. Louise Hoffer. Mrs. Hoffer testified that she was the Vital Statistics Clerk in Anchorage, that she was the custodian of the birth certificate which she had been required by subpoena to bring to court. The certificate was admitted, although appellant objected on various grounds.[5]

Appellant testified that at the time of the trial he was twenty years of age. Because of this testimony the introduction of the birth certificate, if it were error, could not have amounted to harmful error under Love v. State, 457 P.2d 622 (Alaska 1969). The effect of this birth certificate was completely cumulative, insofar as appellant's actual age was a relevant issue at all. For these reasons we will not give further consideration to this point.

The trial court permitted Trooper Anderson, over appellant's objection, to testify that on an occasion previous to the evening of the arrest he had seen appellant's driver's license and had observed the birth date stated on it. This evidence was offered for the purpose of establishing that Trooper Anderson had probable cause to arrest appellant for the misdemeanor of being a minor in possession of alcoholic beverages.

Appellant objected to this testimony on the ground that it violated the hearsay rule. It appears to us that for the purposes for which this testimony was offered the hearsay rule never came into play. We view this testimony as falling under the doctrine which permits statements by a third party declarant when they are offered to show the state of mind of the *429 one who hears the statement. C. McCormick, Evidence § 228 (1954). This testimony was clearly admissible to show that Trooper Anderson possessed such knowledge as would reasonably lead him to believe that the offense was being committed in his presence. Once again, we are unable to find any error committed by the trial court.

VI

Appellant makes a number of claims of error which we have examined and find to be of little merit. In many instances appellant sets forth a scant discussion of the legal reasoning of the authorities on which the claim of error is based. We have, nevertheless, examined these points to be certain that plain error was not committed which might affect the integrity of appellant's conviction.

The claim is made that during the cross-examination of the witness Meyer, who had accompanied Trooper Anderson on the night in question, he was asked whether he recalled using in his report to the police some words to the effect that appellant had stabbed or threatened Anderson with the bayonet. His first answer was that he did not recall any such words. On redirect examination, after refreshing his recollection with the written statement he had made the morning after the arrest, Meyer answered that he did use such words in his report to the police. On recross-examination, defense counsel attempted to question Meyer about another portion of his written statement, but the court sustained the appellee's objection on the ground that the question was outside the scope of the redirect examination.

Finally the state offered to put the whole statement in evidence. Appellant's counsel then moved for a mistrial, which was denied. In his brief, appellant claims that the state knew that the entire statement would be hearsay and inadmissible and that its offer to place the statement in evidence was in itself enough to require the granting of a mistrial. We find, as did the trial court, that appellant himself was responsible for the state's offer because he had gone beyond the scope of redirect examination, thus causing the question of what was in the statement to be left unanswered. We conclude that the denial of the motion for mistrial was proper.

During the direct examination of Trooper Anderson, in answering a question in a somewhat narrative form, he volunteered the statement that he had had contacts with appellant on occasions previous to the evening in question and that he, therefore, was able to perceive that appellant was ""under the influence,"" presumably of alcohol. The prosecutor stopped the witness at this point. Appellant's counsel then moved for a mistrial. Appellant argues that such evidence was irrelevant and prejudicial and that a mistrial should have been granted. The state argues that the statement was not prejudicial because the officer was stopped before his statement was completed, and it is pointed out that no request was made by appellant to strike the testimony or to have the jury instructed to disregard it.

Not every volunteered statement becomes a ground for mistrial. In the particular circumstances of this case we are unable to conclude that the statement objected to required the granting of a mistrial, particularly in view of appellant's failure to seek other remedies to cure any harm which might have been done by the words uttered by the witness.

Trooper Anderson testified that a few months prior to the arrest he had seen appellant's driver's license in the course of investigating a gun accident in which appellant had shot himself and that he knew appellant was a minor at the time of the arrest. On cross-examination Anderson said he had made notes at the time he saw the driver's license. Appellant's counsel moved for a production of Trooper Anderson's notes under AS 12.45.060.[6]*430 Trooper Anderson said that he did not know where his notes were, and the prosecutor said that the state had no idea where they might be. Appellant moved to strike the testimony of Trooper Anderson or in the alternative to declare a mistrial under AS 12.45.080.[7] The denial of this motion is claimed as error.

Anderson's notes of appellant's age made in the course of an investigation not related to the present criminal charge are not a ""statement"" or ""report"" for purposes of AS 12.45.060 and .070. The trial court properly denied appellant's motion to invoke the sanction under AS 12.45.080.[8]

The court instructed the jury to the effect that it was a misdemeanor for a minor to possess or control alcoholic beverages. Alaska Administrative Code, Title 15, Ch. 4, § 4073. Appellant claims that the instruction was not complete and should have included the language of AS 04.15.080(b), which defines the crime of giving liquor to minors as not including a parent as to his own child. This latter offense had no relevancy to the case at bar. It may have been appellant's theory that he could be in lawful control of alcoholic beverages because they had been placed in his control by his parent. But appellant was not on trial for possessing alcoholic beverages. The mere existence of a possible defense of this kind would not negate the probable cause for arrest as perceived by Trooper Anderson. We find no error.

Appellant requested an instruction which would have told the jury that intoxicating liquor is defined by AS 04.20.010 as containing more than one per cent alcohol by volume, and that an instruction should have been given to the effect that a beverage cannot be determined to be alcoholic in content by sight alone. In response, the state argues that the instruction given was a proper statement of the law on the question of whether the officer had probable cause to believe that appellant was in the unlawful possession of an alcoholic beverage. We agree. The instructions contended for by appellant would only have confused the issue to be determined by the jury.

The indictment charged that appellant attempted to stab Trooper Anderson. The statute under which the indictment was brought, AS 11.15.150, uses the term ""stab at another"" in defining the offense. The verdict found the appellant guilty of attempting to stab with the intent *431 to wound, but did not include the words ""at another."" The appellant claims that this is a material variance and the verdict should not have been accepted. No authority is cited in support of this contention. We do not think that extended discussion is in order. We are unable to find any error.

Finally, we find that appellant's contention that in sentencing appellant the court improperly relied upon mere contacts with the police not resulting in convictions is not supported by the record. We find no error.

The judgment of conviction is affirmed.

Essentially, the Theory points out that no two countries that both have McDonalds franchises have ever gone to war. The reasoning behind this correlation, Friedman says, is that once economies become sufficiently integrated, both the cost of going to war and the amount of contact between two countries will increase. Both these factors lead to more effective conflict resolution, as states will attempt to pursue the more economically beneficial option. Friedman’s argument echoes the main suppositions of the democratic peace theory, which states that democracies never go to war. Friedman’s analysis simply takes this argument further in his economic emphasis, although he places a similar amount of emphasis on the role of domestic society in influencing a government’s willingness to go to war.



Problems with the Golden Arches Theory

The Golden Arches Theory has not held true in all cases, and explanations to explain these inconsistencies vary. In some cases, the increased contact between two countries due to integration may actually exacerbate points of contention between the two states, leading to more opportunities for conflict. Or, the difference may lie in the type of government in power: a democratic government may follow the Golden Arches Theory, but the Theory may break down when confronted with cases of nondemocratic or authoritarian regimes. The Golden Arches Theory assumes that governments respond to the desires of their constituents for economic stability and that the government knows it will be held accountable in the case that it does not provide for the economic well-being of its citizens. In the case of an authoritarian or nondemocratic state, leaders may not experience these dilemmas, causing them not to act in accordance with the Golden Arches Theory. [1]

The report, which admittedly appears somewhat far-fetched, has not been confirmed by any other news outlets and does not name any of its sources. It adds that Prime Minister Binyamin Netanyahu has learned of Obama's aspirations and that he is opposing them, supposedly telling people he spoke to: ""Is it not enough that we have had to live through eight years of Obama's rule, in which he ignored Israel? Now he wants to be in a position to cause us difficulty in the international arenas?""

The newspaper cites what it says are sources close to Netanyahu as allegedly saying that ""Obama is the worst president for Israel, the Middle East and Israel's allies – the moderate Arab states.""

A Netanyahu confidant reportedly said that Netanyahu intends to scuttle the ""Obama project"" of being appointed UN Secretary General, and noted that Obama's term in office has been characterized by a closeness to the Muslim Brotherhood, the toppling of Hosni Mubarak's regime in Egypt, and attempts to forge alliances with political Islam.

A Jarida further quoted the Israeli source as saying that Obama's term is ending with an alliance being struck with Iran, and an agreement about its nuclear program that will ""eventually lead to a scenario similar to what is going on in North Korea.""

Without you, my valued customer, I wouldn’t be able to raise hundreds of millions of dollars each year to support Israeli citizens from terrorist attacks and keep reminding every Jew in America, to defend Israel at any cost. $5 billion per year from the US government are no way near enough to pay for all the weaponry, bulldozers and security fences needed to protect innocent Israeli citizens from anti-Semitic Muslim terrorism.

Keanu Reeves on Sex, Hollywood and Life on the Run.

Young and Restless

by Michael Shnayerson

Last year, Speed made Keanu Reeves a superstar. But after 24 movies, the actor remains an enigma: a man who earns millions, yet lives out of a suitcase; a heartthrob who dates few women, yet fends off rumors of a gay marriage; an actor who can appear in Bill & Ted's Excellent Adventure or Hamlet with equal conviction and appeal. With Reeves's new W.W. II romance, A Walk in the Clouds, due on-screen this month, MICHAEL SHNAYERSON met with the star in Minneapolis to pose the essential question: Offscreen, just who is Keanu?

From hotel to hotel, he takes only a single suitcase. ""I've got it pretty pared down,"" Keanu says. ""A couple of pairs of pants, a few T-shirts, socks, underwear, one suit, a sport jacket, a pair of shoes.""

For months now, Keanu Reeves has been homeless.

There's a story attached, but the details are vague. ""It's just something that happened,"" Reeves says. So the star of Hollywood screen and Winnipeg stage lives in hotels, moving as the work demands. His latest abode, as he puts it with that odd formality of his -- part earnest gentleman, part grown-up Valley dude -- is a businessman's hotel in downtown Minneapolis.

I know to expect that subtly Asian beauty -- the dark, intense eyes, the prominent cheekbones, the golden skin. The surprise is Keanu's lanky six-foot frame. On this gray spring afternoon he bears little resemblance to the actor who appeared in Speed, his surprise hit of last summer. The buzz cut has grown out. The strong jaw sports three days' stubble. He's let the action-hero muscles go, too, and, as casually as he seemed to come by it, the chance to be his generation's Schwarzenegger or Stallone.

Keanu said a year ago he didn't want the job. Now he's proved it, with two films that bear no more relation to Speed than to each other. Johnny Mnemonic is a 21st-century sci-fi thriller that opened in May and quickly drifted into cyberspace. A Walk in the Clouds, out this month, is more commercial, but in a new way for its 30-year-old star: it's his first romantic lead. With any luck, the movie should do for him what Legends of the Fall did for Brad Pitt. In fact, so seductive and graceful is his performance that it will probably fail to dispel two oddly ubiquitous assumptions about him.

That he's dumb. And that he's gay.

""Who do I like?""

It's a quiz question. Category: playwrights. Outside the Walker Art Center, Keanu frowns. ""Stoppard to an extent, Edward Albee, Ionesco, Joe Orton. And the man who wrote ... *Aaagghhh!*""

Keanu flashes a sheepish grin. ""Half-sentences,"" he recites, ""half-utterances searching in the past, / grappling, groping, never last. / In my body, in my heart, and in my mind, / but not on my tongue! / And so my song remains unsung.""

""Who wrote that?""

Keanu issues the boyish laugh I've heard more than once in our short time together, the laugh he laughs when he's stuck for words. *Hee-hee.*

""I just made it up.""

""What? That bit? Just now?""

""Yeah..."" Keanu brightens. ""Oh -- Alfred Jarry! And Ibsen.""

Keanu has lively, intelligent eyes. He asks sharp, sometimes startling questions. And how many stars can speak in doggerel? He is, however, almost painfully shy. Asked about himself, he squirms like a schoolboy or lapses into silence. He pulls at tufts of his silky black hair and smacks his forehead with his palm. His long arms windmill the air. If the gods of speech respond to none of these appeals, he falls back in his seat with a resigned ""whatever."" Gradually he relaxes, until the moment is right and the question hits a chord. Then out comes an extended riff, clever and original. But not everyone waits around that long.

In a strange way, Keanu's good manners hurt him, too: he's so decorous he almost seems dim. Asked about his latest films, he says, ""Oh, thank you for asking."" Surprised or distressed, he comes out with ""Oh my gosh!"" You can hear the Canadian in that rousing expletive, and certainly his upbringing north of the border explains a lot about him: they're *nicer* up there. But for a hockey goalie turned actor who guards his privacy zone like a scoring box, etiquette is also a perfect defense. Some assume there's nothing behind it; others think he has secrets to hide.

As a younger actor in teen-appeal movies -- Youngblood, Permanent Record, The Prince of Pennsylvania -- Keanu was even more guarded than he is today. He slouched around, on-screen and off, in sloppy sweatshirts, big shorts, and unlaced sneakers, said ""dude"" and ""awesome,"" and admitted to bathing only once or twice a week. None of his young fans thought him dumb. They thought he was cool.

The dumbness rap grew out of Bill & Ted's Excellent Adventure. So well did he play the Valleyspeak teen and air-guitarist *extraordinaire* in the 1989 hit and its sequel that a new, broader audience-parents and the press assumed Keanu was Ted. Maybe, he admits, he did like the role enough to take a bit of it home. And perhaps in that first flash of national exposure, I suggest, playing Keanu-as-Ted offscreen was a smart way to keep the world at bay.

""No,"" Keanu says, somewhat offended, as we pause before Rothko and Kiefer canvases in the Walker's collection of 20th-century art. ""I've never played stupid to keep someone distant. I don't play stupid. Either it's been a failure on my part to articulate, or my naivete, or ingenuousness, or sometimes it's the nature of the form.... And you know, I find myself more able to give an explanation of a project five years later than in the middle of it. It's so present-tense! I can tell you how I feel, but its context is harder to explain.... Sometimes when I'm interviewed I'm not ready to do that. So you say ... *excellent*! And you know what, man? It's O.K.""

A striking number of top directors seem not to have confused Keanu with Ted at all. To Stephen Frears (Dangerous Liaisons), Lawrence Kasdan (I Love You to Death), Kathryn Bigelow (Point Break), Ron Howard (Parenthood), Gus Van Sant (My Own Private Idaho), Kenneth Branagh (Much Ado About Nothing), Francis Ford Coppola (Bram Stoker's Dracula), and Benardo Bertolucci (Little Buddha), among others, Keanu radiates a visceral, emotional intelligence found only in the best natural actors. He has character -- an old-fashioned moral imperative that shines through in every role -- wrapped around a core of reserve of feelings withheld. Above all, he's a risktaker, gamely plunging into wildly different roles without a thought for the exigencies of image. ""He's a brave, resilient actor who takes the knocks and plaudits with equal grace,"" says Kenneth Branagh. ""As a result, he just gets better and better.""

A Walk in the Clouds is Keanu's best work yet. The plot concerns a soldier who meets a tearful woman on a train and learns she's pregnant out of wedlock, heading home to face the certain wrath of her father, a wealthy vineyard owner. The soldier gallantly volunteers to pose as her husband for a night, meeting her parents, sleeping on the floor of her bedroom, then ducking out before dawn -- so the baby will seem legitimate. Soon, of course, he's picking grapes and locking eyes with his new love across the vines.

Director Alfonso Arau (Like Water for Chocolate) made the movie as a passion play tinged with magical realism. ""I said [to Keanu], 'You can play a very romantic character if you want,'"" Arau recalls. ""'How much do you want to work?""' Keanu, the director felt, had the rectitude of a returning war hero, but too much innocence. ""I said, 'Keanu, you are going to have to interpret as a grown man, as opposed to an adolescent.""' Which meant conveying not only more maturity but also passion. ""You can feel that he has all these emotions below the skin,"" says Arau, ""so I had to open the door for them.""

""In rehearsal, we did some improvs,"" Keanu says, back in his hotel room. ""Alfonso and I concocted a situation where I lost a buddy, so I'd have that in my body.... I wanted to have a man who through his experiences had come back desperately lonely, had seen death, and that caused in him an appreciation for life."" At the moment, he's in actor shock, as he puts it, over the way the film was edited. ""The wounded bird I portrayed has been ... less wounded. They've made him stronger; you don't see his internal battle as much. [It's like] I'm missing a limb and I keep going to use it."" But he understands what Arau was after. ""The film's on that line of ... melodrama. It's larger than life, operatic sometimes.""

""Sort of a throwback.""

""But is it a throwback? ... Do you believe that?""

Keanu asks a lot of questions. Perhaps because he never went to college, perhaps out of innate curiosity. Shy as he is, he's also learned that asking questions is easier than answering them.

""What about Feeling Minnesota?"" I bat back. This is, as one might guess the film that's brought him to the proud Twin Cities. Shooting is about to begin.

""Have you read the script?"" he asks.

""Yeah.""

""How many *times* have you read it?""

""Once.""

""What did you think of it? How did you *feel* about it?""

Feeling Minnesota is a noir-ish comedy in which Keanu and his co-star Vincent D'Onofrio, play low-life brothers whose hatred for each other erupts over a gangster's moll and leads to a lot of blood in cheap motels. I confess I couldn't tell it was a comedy until halfway through the script.

""Now, you haven't said yet that it's a romance."" Keanu laughs. *Hee-hee*! ""When I first read it I didn't like it at all. I found it very harsh.... I've given it to a couple of people and they've ..."" Word search; search fail. ""But then when they read it again they see it.""

Brilliant as the script may be, not every actor of Keanu's stature would have leapt at a $7.8 million feature by a first-time screenwriter who was, moreover, a first-time director. ""We met in Danny DeVito's office at Sony,"" explains Steven Baigelman, the 34-year-old writer-director. DeVito and his Jersey Films partners, Stacey Sher and Michael Shamberg, fresh from producing Pulp Fiction, are making Feeling Minnesota along with Keanu's longtime manager, Erwin Stoff. ""I don't know what it is that clicked between us, but we hit it off,"" says Baigelman. ""Couple of days later he committed. Couple of days after *that*, Speed opened and went through the roof. He had committed verbally but hadn't signed.""

Overnight, reportedly, Speed boosted Keanu's asking price per picture to $7 million, and the guy doesn't even have to break a contract to lose this Baigelman and go for the big money. Isn't money what it's all about?

""No, no, no, no!"" Keanu says with much bemused headshaking. ""As long as it doesn't have to be about money, then it's *not* about money.""

So what *is* it about?

""The one thing that's constant,"" Keanu says, ""is the acting. That's what it's for.""

""He's like a monk,"" says Alfonso Arau, ""totally devoted to his craft."" Others echo this. ""They say you lead an almost hermit-like life,"" I suggest. ""Is that too strong a term for it?""

""Yeah. Hermit-like, cloistered, monastic... "" Keanu ticks them off with gentle mockery. ""Those are too strong."" Long silence. ""But they're close.""

From hotel to hotel, he brings a single suitcase. ""I've got it pretty pared down,"" he says. A couple of pairs of pants, a few T-shirts, socks, underwear, one suit, a sport jacket, a pair of shoes. He has only three possessions of any consequence. A bass guitar, so he can play with his folk-rock band, Dogstar, and two Norton motorcycles, British-made in the 1970s. Which raises the obvious question of what he does with all that money.

""Ah, what do I do?"" He thinks about it. ""It affords one a certain amount of freedom and travel, and I can buy older Bordeaux. I can afford my two Nortons, which is akin to sending a child to a middle-expensive university in the U.S. But the travel is great.""

""Did you travel last year between films?""

Keanu looks embarrassed.

""Actually, no,"" he says. ""I didn't.""

Keanu goes from project to project without interruption now, it seems. Whether or not he is ever pleased with his work is unclear. ""One of the things that locked us together,"" says Robert Longo, director of Johnny Mnemonic, ""was that I'd think everything was bad."" Every shot could be better. ""Keanu would go off and keep doing the scene, too, thinking it could be better."" Robert Kamen, the screenwriter for A Walk in the Clouds, puts it more bluntly. ""He gets angry at himself,"" Kamen says. ""He just doesn't think his acting is any good.""

""There are days when I'm O.K.,"" Keanu says. But not too many. ""Maybe it's because I'm a Virgo; it's in my sign to be hard on myself.""

In his downtime on the sets of Johnny Mnemonic and A Walk in the Clouds, Keanu could often be found muttering Shakespeare. It was no mere exercise: he had committed to take on theater's greatest challenge at the end of his busiest year ever. Nearly a year ahead of time, Keanu agreed to block out two months for the production, at less than $2,000 a week. Speed's success made the sacrifice specific: he had to turn down four movies, including Heat, with Robert DeNiro and Al Pacino. ""Yeah,"" he says. ""But ... Hamlet!""

Keanu went alone with his suitcase to Winnipeg in early December for the start of rehearsals. He found a city giddy with anticipation. One local paper announced a daily Keanu watch. For the play's sold-out run, hotel rooms were booked by Keanuphiles, mostly women, from all over the world; one woman flew all the way from Australia to sit through eight performances.

Among the cast of professional Shakespeareans, there may have lurked a doubt as to the seriousness of their leading man. The doubts were soon dispelled. ""The thing that impressed me on the first day,"" recalls Stephen Russell, a veteran of 17 Stratford Festivals, who played Claudius in the production, ""was how much work he had done. This was not going to be a star turn or walk in the park. And what I realized, too, was how his principles are etched in stone. He carries a lot of weight extremely well.""

With international press in attendance for opening night, the weight of expectation felt suddenly crushing. Even now, Keanu groans at the memory. ""One of the most horrific nights of my life, oh my gosh! I was surviving, not performing."" The critics agreed. Keanu, they wrote, seemed overwhelmed by the soliloquies; one declared he simply lacked the equipment to handle Hamlet's melancholy, and came alive only in the fight scenes. ""But,"" Keanu says, ""it got better.""

So wrote Roger Lewis in The Sunday Times of London. Lewis stuck around to see Keanu's confidence seep back in later performances, and declared his Hamlet terrific. ""He quite embodied the innocence, the splendid fury, the animal grace of the leaps and bounds, the emotional violence, that form the Prince of Denmark,"" he reported. ""He is one of the top three Hamlets I have seen, for a simple reason: he *is* Hamlet.""

It was while he was in Winnipeg, Keanu says, that he first heard the rumor that had originated in Italian and Spanish newspapers, then spread to all of L.A. and New York: not only was he gay but he had even entered into a secret marriage with producer David Geffen. ""So,"" I ask, ""about this Geffen business...""

Keanu gives me a level gaze. ""I've never met the man.""

""But suddenly this rumor was everywhere. Like Richard Gere and gerbils.""

""It's funny, a friend of mine said that.""

""Does it bother you?""

Keanu shrugs. ""It's so ridiculous, I find it funny.""

""I've never laid eyes on him,"" Geffen confirms, by now more than a little exasperated by the question. ""It's a phenomenon: people *make* *this* *stuff* *up.* I even had a friend say that his trainer said he was *at* *the* *wedding.* You think I could keep something like that *secret?* And then people saying I bought Keanu $15,000 worth of clothes at Barneys. I mean, come on. I'd buy him some clothes, but he doesn't need that. It's just an ugly, mean-spirited rumor meant to hurt him because he's a movie star.""

Speculation about Keanu's sexuality goes back at least five years, when a reporter from Interview asked him directly if he was gay. Keanu denied it, adding, rather sweetly, ""But ya never know."" Some of the talk seems inspired by the observation that Keanu has had no high-visibility romances with women.

""Wouldn't it be useful,"" I suggest, ""to shoot the rumors down cold?""

Keanu is taken aback. ""Well, I mean, there's nothing wrong with being gay, so to deny it is to make a judgment. And why make a big deal of it? If someone doesn't want to hire me because they think I'm gay, well, then I have to deal with it, I guess. Or if people were picketing a theater. But otherwise, it's just gossip, isn't it?""

One of the few simple facts of Keanu's childhood is his name, which means ""cool breeze over the mountains"" in Hawaiian. It's the sort of name you get when you have a Hawaiian-Chinese father -- the Reeveses go way back in Oahu -- and a British bohemian mother who in a burst of 60s abandon head off to pre-war Beirut to hang out, producing a baby in the process. The money to finance this idyll seems to have come from Keanu's paternal stepgrandfather, who made a small fortune bringing a children's edition of the Encyclopaedia Britannica to Canada.

Samuel Nowlin Reeves and his young wife, Patricia, better known as Patric, made a striking pair, he at the wheel of a purple Jaguar XKE, she in cowboy boots, blue jeans, and a mink coat. Or so it's been reported. There also seems to have been more than a little dabbling in drugs. By the time Keanu was two, his father was gone. ""There were fights about Sam's drug taking,"" a cousin, Leslie Reeves, told one reporter. ""My aunt grew out of the hippie phase. My uncle didn't. He refused. In fact, he couldn't give up the drugs."")

Keanu's sister Kim, now 29, counts among her childhood memories Keanu gleefully taking apart furniture with his tool set. A bigger headache for his mother must have been that both children were dyslexic. They later became proficient readers, but it seems possible that dyslexia left some psychic scars, and may have led Keanu to be more visual and physical than verbal.

When Keanu was six, his mother married Off Broadway director Paul Aaron. Within six months they divorced, and Patric moved with her children to Toronto, to be closer to her ex-in-laws, who helped support the family. A gifted seamstress, she made stage costumes for entertainers; Emmylou Harris and Dolly Parton were among her clients. She was a rock 'n' roll character, with a peach-dyed buzz cut; when Alice Cooper recorded ""Welcome to My Nightmare"" at a nearby studio, he stayed with the Reeveses.

Like every strong, athletic boy in Canada, Keanu learned to adore ice hockey. As goalie, he was nicknamed ""the Wall."" His ""thirrsst for the theeeater,"" as he puts it mock-archly, hit him in adolescence. A seed may have been planted by Aaron, who remained a nurturing influence. Soon Keanu was in acting classes, and auditioning for bit parts in U.S. movies shooting in Canada.

High school was a problem. Keanu went through four of them, including a Catholic boys' school where he failed every class except Latin. ""It was the only class I liked,"" he says. ""My attendance record was very bad. I was lazy. I knew I wanted to act when I was halfway through grade 11, I guess, and school wasn't important.""

Keanu briefly moved into a girlfriend's basement. He worked at a hockey rink sharpening skates, and manned a tiny restaurant called Pastissima, where he made 100 pounds of pasta a day. He went on auditions, closing the shop to do so, and landed a starring role in his first professional stage play, a curious production with homoerotic overtones called Wolfboy, in which he was cast as a young innocent placed in a psychiatric hospital, only to be set upon by a deranged boy who believes he's a werewolf.

""I didn't want professional actors,"" recalls director John Palmer. ""So I advertised in the personals. I got totally fucked-up hustlers"" -- and Keanu, who arrived in torn jeans but looked great. For the play's largely gay audience, Palmer persuaded Keanu to appear in a workout scene doing push-ups in white shorts. ""You get this innocent kid, one of the most gorgeous kids anyone's seen, in white shorts -- and we *oiled* them.... What do you want for 10 bucks?""

Every Sunday, Keanu went to a community theater school called Leah Posluns. One of his close friends there was Alan Powell, with whom he starred in a workshop production. ""We'd play off each other; the chemistry was dynamic,"" Powell says. Keanu, he adds, ""was the friend I'd never had as a child. But he was a secretive guy about his life. You could be hanging with the guy for three years; suddenly he'd introduce you to someone who turned out to be a friend of his all that time. You could never get close to the guy.""

His first big break came through a Leah Posluns connection to Hollywood movie director Steven Stern. Keanu auditioned for a bit part in a TV movie. ""There was something about him I liked as a person,"" recalls Stern, a fellow Torontonian. ""Funny, yet a serious side. I told him to take the script home and read it for the lead."" When Stern told the Disney executive in charge of TV movies that he wanted to cast an unknown as his lead, the executive was incredulous. Adamant, Stern paid Keanu's way to L.A. for a screen test, and persuaded Disney executives Michael Eisner and Jeffrey Katzenberg to view it. ""O.K.,"" Katzenberg told Stern, ""but if we don't like him after a few days, we'll replace him."" They liked him.

Keanu made his move to L.A., arriving, in 1986, in a decrepit 1969 Volvo with $3,000. His former stepfather put him up for a while, and steered him to Erwin Stoff, who was then getting started as a manager. Stoff, in turn, found Keanu an agent in Hildy Gottlieb Hill, then head of talent at ICM. ""In 20 minutes I was crazy about him,"" Hill recalls of Keanu's first visit. ""He was very fresh."" When he left, Hill told a colleague, ""I've just signed a new client, and I don't even know if he can act.""

In eight months, Keanu won his first major role in a feature: as the conscience-bound teenager in River's Edge who bucks peer pressure to report a girl's murder. He did his teen films and earned minor roles in major productions (Dangerous Liaisons, Parenthood). Then, after seven auditions, he landed Bill & Ted's Excellent Adventure. ""Clown work,"" he calls it now, but with professional pride.

Keanu seemed not just to distrust his growing fame but to mock it. Hildy Gottlieb Hill recalls him showing up at the ICM office in a kilt. He rode his Nortons fast, sometimes at night, occasionally with the headlight off, and had spills -- one in Topanga Canyon that ruptured his spleen and left a long abdominal scar. In the few interviews he gave, he seemed scornful or bored; once, he entertained a roomful of journalists by spitting on the floor. It was a phase.

His private life remained pretty much that. His longest relationship with a woman, he says, has been around two years; his latest was with a woman named Autumn. ""I'm sort of Han Solo,"" he says. River Phoenix, another product of a 60s counterculture family, became a good friend. The two are said to have done their share of drugs during the filming of My Own Private Idaho, the better to play the movie's street kids, but Keanu says flatly that he's never had cause for concern about himself and either drugs or drink. He spent a lot of time at an L.A. hospital, where his sister Kim lay sick with cancer.

""He helped me through,"" Kim explains. ""When the pain got bad, he used to hold my hand and keep the bad man from making me dance. He was there all the time, even when he was away."" Twenty months ago, after more than eight years of fighting her illness, Kim went into remission. She has a stable of show horses now, paid for by her brother.

Last summer Keanu's father, long estranged from the family, was arrested in Hawaii with a large shipment of heroin and cocaine. He was tried, found guilty of promoting a dangerous drug in the second degree, and sentenced to 10 years.

""How did you react to all that stuff?"" I ask.

""What stuff?""

At moments like this, Keanu stops moving around. The light in his eyes goes out. He doesn't bristle, but he gets quiet, fast.

""The trial last year,"" I sputter. ""The sentencing.""

""I don't know about it.""

""You didn't want to find out?""

""Why would I want to find out what I didn't know?""

""You didn't know he was arrested and sentenced to 10 years?""

""Uh-uh,"" Keanu says without any affect, his almond eyes blank. ""Pretty incredible.""

Over a beer at the nearby City Billiards Bar & Cafe, Keanu turns cheerful again. His presence sends ripples through the after-work crowd, and soon an autograph seeker moves in, followed by another. He takes the intrusions with good humor, even bantering as he signs the proffered scraps. Robert Kamen says that during the shooting of A Walk in the Clouds Keanu was stopped like this all the time. ""How do you do it?"" Kamen asked at last. Keanu shrugged and said, ""I'm Mickey [Mouse]. They don't know who's inside the suit."" Kamen remembers telling Reeves, ""But you're a movie star."" Keanu laughed, ""So's Mickey.""

I've been curious to ask Keanu what he took away from Little Buddha, the Bertolucci film of 1994 shot in Nepal and Bhutan, for which Keanu not only fasted to look the part of Prince Siddhartha but also studied Buddhist texts and met with monks. A lot of what he learned, it turns out, has stayed with him.

""One of the great things was learning about meditation. What is spoken of a lot is the notion of no self, no 'I.' What is ego, what is mind, nature of mind ... and what is desire?""

Answering earnestness with earnestness, I wonder aloud if there isn't in Keanu some central struggle between discipline and nihilism - devotion to acting versus motorcycles, Buddhism versus sex, drink, rock 'n' roll. A dynamic. Keanu looks at me with bemusement. ""I get one dynamic?"" he says. ""Can I have more than one? I want at least nine!""

Back in the hotel room, we order a bottle of wine and Keanu slips a CD into his small portable ""ghetto."" His traveling collection includes Miles Davis, Coltrane, Sonic Youth, Hole, Gorecki's Third Symphony, Jesus and Mary Chain. He says he's planning, somehow, amid all the films, to go on tour with Dogstar. A month and a half, 40 gigs. ""We're getting pretty good,"" he says. ""It's folky, but not Joan Baez folky."" The group, he thinks, is almost ready to record an album. ""But we have to write better songs.""

Even with no album out, the band drew sellout crowds on its first club gigs. ""He doesn't understand the fuss,"" says Ken Funk, who started managing the group three years ago strictly out of friendship for Keanu. (He was actually a hockey buddy.) ""We were having dinner at a restaurant one night and the hostess, who was gorgeous, kept looking at him adoringly. I said to Keanu, 'I wish I could be you for five minutes, just go up and talk to that girl the way you could.' 'I couldn't do that,' he said. And he was serious. He said to me once, 'I'm from the earth, too.' I'm still figuring that one out.""

Mysterious as he may be, even to his closest friends, Keanu is, on another level, as simple as he says: a happy man, doing what he wants to do, only what he wants to do, and getting paid to do it.

Harley-Davidson Inc.’s plans to operate a motorcycle assembly plant in Thailand are drawing strong criticism from labor unions, although Harley says the plant won’t result in any U.S. job losses.

The Thailand plant is scheduled to open in late 2018, Harley said Tuesday, and it will assemble bikes from components produced at the company’s U.S. facilities.

Milwaukee-based Harley has similar operations in India and Brazil, where complete motorcycles are assembled from kits.

In India, where big touring motorcycles and cars are saddled with a 100% import tariff, Harley's sales have grown by a brisk 30% in the past two years.

That's largely because the company has been able to get around the tariff by assembling bikes there, something it's done in that country since 2011.

RELATED: Trump says 100% tariffs hurt Harley-Davidson sales in other countries

RELATED: Harley-Davidson's quarterly sales, profit decline

The Thailand tariff on motorcycles assembled in the United States is about 60%, according to Harley.

“By opening this plant, we expect our regional (Asian) operations to help reduce those costs,” said Harley spokeswoman Katie Whitmore.

“There is no intent to reduce Harley-Davidson U.S. manufacturing due to this expansion,” Whitmore said.

“We anticipate an increase in the number of additional U.S.-manufactured components that will be shipped to the Thailand facility,” she added.

Asia is one of Harley’s fastest-growing markets.

But the Thailand plant, and others like it, worry the United Steelworkers.

“Harley-Davidson has been the crown jewel of American manufacturing. Management’s decision to offshore production is a slap in the face to the American worker and to hundreds of thousands of Harley riders across the country,” Steelworkers President Leo Gerard said in a statement.

Harley-Davidson has said it intends to grow its international business 50% by 2027, and that international sales are pivotal to the company’s future.

But the Steelworkers, which represents employees at the Harley engine operations in Menomonee Falls, says the company should abandon offshoring plans and, instead, expand operations in the U.S.

“Offshoring production is the wrong path to prosperity. It puts in jeopardy the success that has propelled Harley over the years,” Gerard said.

A similar statement came Tuesday from the International Association of Machinists and Aerospace Workers, which also represents employees in Harley's manufacturing plants.

“Harley-Davidson is going overseas and taking American jobs with it. While other companies think about moving work home, Harley-Davidson is doing the opposite. Harley-Davidson is laying off U.S. workers monthly while continuing to hire temporary workers,"" said IAM President Robert Martinez Jr.

He added: “What part of ‘Made in America’ does Harley-Davidson not understand?”

In April, Harley-Davidson Inc. said it was cutting 118 jobs at its plant in York, Pa., as the company moves the production of all cruiser motorcycles to Kansas City.

The layoffs, which will begin June 23, affect 110 hourly employees represented by the Association of Machinists and Aerospace Workers.

The remainder are salaried employees and contractors.

Harley said the employees were notified in November 2015 that it planned to consolidate the production of Softail cruiser motorcycles at its Kansas City plant starting with the 2018 model year.

The move will create 118 positions in Kansas City, according to the company, and it doesn’t affect employment in Milwaukee."

More Americans have died from gunshots in the last 50 years than in all of the wars in American history.

Since 1968, more than 1.5 million Americans have died in gun-related incidents, according to data from the U.S. Centers for Disease Control and Prevention. By comparison, approximately 1.2 million service members have been killed in every war in U.S. history, according to estimates from the Department of Veterans Affairs and iCasualties.org, a website that maintains an ongoing database of casualties from the wars in Iraq and Afghanistan.

Sunday's massacre in Las Vegas — which left 59 dead and 530 others injured — is the deadliest mass shooting in modern American history. And such attacks are becoming more common.

""What we've seen in Las Vegas is an uniquely American scene,"" former FBI agent Ali Soufan said on MSNBC. ""The aftermath of such traumatic events have become an all too familiar scene in our society and in our politics, unfortunately.""

The June 2016 shooting at Pulse Nightclub in Orlando, Florida, which killed 49 people, is now the second deadliest attack, followed by the 2012 massacre at Sandy Hook Elementary in Newtown, Connecticut, which killed 26 people, most of them children.

After the Sandy Hook shooting, a tearful President Barack Obama announced a series of executive actions aimed at curbing violence in America. The orders included a measure to overturn a 20-year-old amendment that prevented the CDC from conducting federally funded research into how gun violence affects Americans.

But despite the elimination of the ban, the agency has remained hesitant to comprehensively research one of the most divisive issues in America. Many activists blame the influence that the NRA and other powerful pro-gun lobbies seem to have on some members of Congress, and the agency's fear that funding could be reduced or revoked.

As President Trump departed Tuesday for a visit to Puerto Rico, he ignored shouted questions on whether the Las Vegas shooting should prompt stricter gun control laws. But he did have harsh words for the suspected gunman, Stephen Paddock.

""He's a sick man, a demented man, lot of problems, I guess,"" Trump said. ""We're dealing with a very, very sick individual."""

https://www.snopes.com/fact-check/lindsey-graham-nominate-trump/	"senator lindsey graham once said that republicans would ""get destroyed"" if they nominated donald trump as their presidential candidate."	true	['donald trump', 'lindsey graham']	2018/10/09	Dan Evon	['https://www.weeklystandard.com/john-mccormack/the-neo-trumper', 'https://mashable.com/article/lindsey-graham-tweets/', 'https://www.washingtonpost.com/politics/2018/10/02/how-lindsey-graham-became-donald-trumps-greatest-ally-senate/?utm_term=.ca23f12ca029', 'https://www.cnn.com/2015/12/21/politics/lindsey-graham-2016-campaign-drops-out/index.html', 'https://www.bostonglobe.com/news/politics/2018/09/27/watch-lindsey-graham-angry-defense-brett-kavanaugh/lWntvrd4xP02cXr5R7w25L/story.html']	https://mashable.com/article/lindsey-graham-tweets/	https://mashable.com/	"The bruising battle over Brett Kavanaugh's Supreme Court nomination may be finished, but the political scars will last a lifetime. That is true for no one more than Sen. Lindsey Graham.

Formerly a believer that a judge must be removed if he commits perjury, the Republican from South Carolina turned a blind eye to Kavanaugh's many demonstrable fibs. Formerly known for his bipartisanship, Graham elected to play the attack dog. (Curiously enough, this turn came after the Judiciary Committee's counsel started asking Kavanaugh searching questions about his history of drinking and partying.)

For Graham watchers, the hearings were the latest evidence of the senator's disturbing transformation from Never Trumper to Trump apologist. ""What happened to Lindsey Graham?"" is the question asked by three separate profiles in the past month. A New York Times columnist just dubbed him ""the saddest story in Washington.""

Some commentators have pointed to the death of his good friend Sen. John McCain of Arizona this summer as a turning point for Graham. In reality, he's been sliding down this path for years. And the best place to witness his transformation — indeed, to glimpse the regression of the GOP as a whole — is via his Twitter account, @LindseyGrahamSC.

First, let's remind ourselves of what Graham used to be like in 2009. In Obama's first term, he was to be found working with John Kerry on a bipartisan bill to put a price on carbon emissions back when Kerry was a senator: ""Yes we can (pass climate change legislation),"" the pair wrote in the Times. (No, they couldn't.)

You can see the exact moment Graham realized his fellow Republicans were not as keen on Obama as he was. In the middle of a September 2009 speech to Congress, Graham starts to applaud the president's words on education, then suddenly thinks better of it.

Graham didn't join Twitter until December 2011, and didn't start tweeting until March 2012. His first tweet thanked supporters for coming to a fish fry and vowed to make Obama a ""one-term president.""

But nearly all his tweets were innocuous back then: bland statements of support for GOP candidates; approving reports of his visits to Google and Apple; a photo of his fashion choices on the links.

Graham announced his own bid for the presidency on June 1, 2015. He touted his experience, and compared himself favorably to Hillary Clinton in that area. But he was also careful to strike a note of civility and bipartisanship — one that sounds like it's from a lifetime ago, not a mere three years.

To my friends in the other party: Our differences are real, and we’ll debate them. But you’re not my enemy. You’re my fellow countrymen. — Lindsey Graham (@LindseyGrahamSC) June 1, 2015

Donald Trump announced his candidacy two weeks later. Graham didn't even think it worth tweeting about. Nor did he mention Trump's comments calling Mexican immigrants criminals and ""rapists."" His first ever Trump tweets came a month later, after Trump denied that McCain was a ""war hero"" because ""I like people that don't get captured.""

.@SenJohnMcCain, like every other POW, went through hell & has earned our respect & gratitude — Lindsey Graham (@LindseyGrahamSC) July 18, 2015

That subtweet was immediately followed by a direct attack on Trump's fitness for office.

If there was ever any doubt that @realDonaldTrump should not be our commander in chief, this stupid statement should end all doubt. — Lindsey Graham (@LindseyGrahamSC) July 18, 2015

Trump punched back by giving Graham's cellphone number out during a campaign speech. Graham's response was to bring a droll understatement to a knife fight.

Probably getting a new phone. iPhone or Android? — Lindsey Graham (@LindseyGrahamSC) July 21, 2015

Still, Graham wasn't cowed; his attacks on Trump ramped up over the following months.

.@RealDonaldTrump unrelenting & offensive comments about @MegynKelly puts the @GOP at a crossroads w/Mr. Trump — Lindsey Graham (@LindseyGrahamSC) August 8, 2015

Here's Graham's first actual joke at Trump's expense:

Donald Trump gets his foreign policy from watching television - the Cartoon Network. #CNNDebate #ReadyToLead — Lindsey Graham (@LindseyGrahamSC) September 17, 2015

But when Trump called for a ""total and complete shutdown of Muslims entering the United States,"" Graham — like many of us — decided the reality TV star's campaign was no laughing matter.

.@Realdonaldtrump has gone from making absurd comments to being downright dangerous with his bombastic rhetoric. — Lindsey Graham (@LindseyGrahamSC) December 7, 2015

The next day, Graham took direct aim at the MAGA slogan using his strongest swear word.

“You know how you make America great again? Tell @realDonaldTrump to go to hell” https://t.co/pBLaZ1kgUV — Lindsey Graham (@LindseyGrahamSC) December 8, 2015

The following week, Trump made an ominous statement of support for Russia's president. Back then, Graham considered it an even more serious foreign policy blunder.

Just when you think it can’t get worse: A leading American candidate for President praising Putin. — Lindsey Graham (@LindseyGrahamSC) December 17, 2015

Graham dropped out of the presidential race on December 21, 2015, citing poor polling numbers. But that didn't stop him from attacking Trump in unequivocal language.

Donald Trump is not a conservative Republican. He's an opportunist. He's not fit to be President of the United States. — Lindsey Graham (@LindseyGrahamSC) February 17, 2016

On February 20, 2016, Trump swept the GOP primary in Graham's home state, South Carolina. Shortly after, Graham and Trump got into the first of two Twitter spats.

@realDonaldTrump I never got past 2%.



You aren't prepared to be Commander in Chief of worlds finest fighting force https://t.co/7prb7ZdEVg — Lindsey Graham (@LindseyGrahamSC) March 7, 2016

On May 3, 2016, Trump's last opponent with a shot at defeating him, Sen. Ted Cruz, dropped out of the race. Graham was in an apocalyptic mood. He posted a dire prediction to his party — one that remains his most liked, most talked-about tweet, even now.

If we nominate Trump, we will get destroyed.......and we will deserve it. — Lindsey Graham (@LindseyGrahamSC) May 3, 2016

Just nine days later, however, Trump won the delegates he needed. Graham posted this, and you can almost hear the gnashing of teeth.

I had a cordial, pleasant phone conversation with Mr. Trump yesterday. I congratulated him on winning the GOP nomination for President. — Lindsey Graham (@LindseyGrahamSC) May 12, 2016

If anyone on Trump's campaign expected Graham to fall into line, however, they were disappointed.

Last night, if you were looking for competency Donald Trump fell short. #CommanderInChiefForum — Lindsey Graham (@LindseyGrahamSC) September 8, 2016

A day after the infamous Access Hollywood tape was released, Graham again made his anti-Trump feelings clear.

I have never been comfortable with Donald Trump as our Republican nominee. — Lindsey Graham (@LindseyGrahamSC) October 8, 2016

Name one sports team, university, publicly-held company, etc. that would accept a person like this as their standard bearer? — Lindsey Graham (@LindseyGrahamSC) October 8, 2016

In the wake of three disastrous debate performances by Trump, Hillary Clinton was riding high in the polls. Graham's tweets indicated he considered Trump's campaign to be a lost cause.

Keeping GOP in control of Congress is best insurance policy American people can take out against Clinton agenda.https://t.co/TSfHsgrl0F — Lindsey Graham (@LindseyGrahamSC) October 24, 2016

Not even the last-minute bombshell of then FBI director James Comey reopening an investigation into Clinton's emails deterred Graham from making it clear on election day that he did not vote for Trump.

In the prez race, voting for Hillary Clinton was always a non-starter and I couldn’t go where Donald Trump wanted to take the USA & GOP. #2 — Lindsey Graham (@LindseyGrahamSC) November 8, 2016

Instead the senator punched his ballot for a Republican running as an independent, Evan McMullin.

I voted @Evan_McMullin for President. I appreciate his views on a strong America and the need to rebuild our military. #3 — Lindsey Graham (@LindseyGrahamSC) November 8, 2016

Even after a perfunctory statement congratulating Trump on his surprise victory, Graham remained cautious — particularly about Trump's relationship with Russia.

I hope President-elect Trump won’t become the 3rd American president to misjudge Vladmir Putin. — Lindsey Graham (@LindseyGrahamSC) December 16, 2016

In the month after Trump's inauguration, Graham's tweets continued to be ambivalent. Reacting to a Trump proposal for a ""border tax"" on Mexico to build the wall, Graham tried to bring the funny by tweeting that it was ""mucho sad.""

Simply put, any policy proposal which drives up costs of Corona, tequila, or margaritas is a big-time bad idea. Mucho Sad. (2) — Lindsey Graham (@LindseyGrahamSC) January 26, 2017

Graham tweeted support for all Trump's cabinet picks, but also pushed for investigations into Russia's impact on the 2016 election — and cautioned against the first Muslim travel ban.

Ultimately, I fear this executive order will become a self-inflicted wound in the fight against terrorism. — Lindsey Graham (@LindseyGrahamSC) January 29, 2017

But if there is a pivot point in Graham's relationship with Trump, it arrived in March 2017. He issued a statement in support of the second travel ban, and had a White House meeting that seemed to thaw relations — to the point where he and Trump became phone buddies again.

How good was the meeting with @POTUS?



I gave him my NEW cell phone number. — Lindsey Graham (@LindseyGrahamSC) March 7, 2017

Still, Graham was prepared to defend Jeff Sessions against Trump's insistence that the Attorney General prosecute Hillary Clinton — even if the strongest word he could muster to describe this norm-breaking outrage was ""inappropriate.""

President Trump’s tweet today suggesting Attorney General Sessions pursue prosecution of a former political rival is highly inappropriate. 4 — Lindsey Graham (@LindseyGrahamSC) July 25, 2017

When literal Nazis and Klansmen rallied in Charlottesville, Graham was prepared to attack Trump over his ""many sides"" statement. But he didn't dare tweet his complaints directly, preferring to link to a newspaper interview.

Spoke with the media earlier today in Columbia about #charlottesville and steps forward.https://t.co/FFwxaUKDcj — Lindsey Graham (@LindseyGrahamSC) August 15, 2017

Two days later Trump struck back at Graham directly, calling him ""publicity seeking"" and a ""disgusting"" liar. Graham then got into his second ever quote-tweet spat. In a non-threaded thread, he warned Trump that he was now being quoted approvingly by racist hate groups, implored him to ""fix this"" and said that ""history is watching us all.""

Mr. President, like most I seek to move our nation, my state, and our party forward - toward the light - not back to the darkness. (1) https://t.co/K1j4JnhCgf — Lindsey Graham (@LindseyGrahamSC) August 17, 2017

But by this point, Graham could not attack Trump without sending an approving tweet literally one minute later.

Your tweet honoring Miss Heyer was very nice and appropriate.



Well done. (2) https://t.co/8I6LVMDXUy — Lindsey Graham (@LindseyGrahamSC) August 17, 2017

Trump's announcement calling for a troop surge in Afghanistan the following week seemed to patch things up as far as the hawkish Graham was concerned.

And then, a couple months later, the golfing began.

How bad did he beat me? I did better in the presidential race than today on the golf course!



Great fun. Great host. — Lindsey Graham (@LindseyGrahamSC) October 9, 2017

Trump International Golf Club is a spectacular golf course.



Great day of fun playing with @POTUS @realDonaldTrump. https://t.co/92Xjk8d8B2 — Lindsey Graham (@LindseyGrahamSC) December 10, 2017

Later that month, the supposed fiscal conservative Graham voted for Trump's deficit-ballooning trillion-dollar tax cut. By Trump's first State of the Union in January 2018, the senator was tweeting full-throated support for the ""law and order president.""

President Trump clearly relishes being the Law and Order president and a strong Commander in Chief.



Just what America needs! — Lindsey Graham (@LindseyGrahamSC) January 31, 2018

In April, two years after predicting the GOP would be ""destroyed"" by Trump, Graham announced he was all in for Trump 2020.

As to the 2020 presidential race, I believe President @realDonaldTrump will run for reelection and I intend to support him. https://t.co/vsExZ1XehG — Lindsey Graham (@LindseyGrahamSC) April 19, 2018

The preemptive endorsement also marked a distinctive trend in Graham's tweets: Since March 2018, he has started using Trump's twitter handle. A lot.

Happy Birthday, Mr. President!



You’re keeping your promise to make America safer and more prosperous.



And unfortunately for me, you’re doing all this without losing a step in your golf game!@realDonaldTrump #TrumpBirthday pic.twitter.com/PJRa54FVAP — Lindsey Graham (@LindseyGrahamSC) June 14, 2018

In July, Trump's craven display of obsequiousness towards Vladimir Putin in Helsinki shocked the world. Graham had once considered Trump's support for Putin worse than his proposal for a Muslim travel ban. Now he merely described it as a ""missed opportunity.""

Missed opportunity by President Trump to firmly hold Russia accountable for 2016 meddling and deliver a strong warning regarding future elections.



This answer by President Trump will be seen by Russia as a sign of weakness and create far more problems than it solves. (1/3) — Lindsey Graham (@LindseyGrahamSC) July 16, 2018

Even that mild display of dissent was erased a couple days later, when Graham credulously insisted Trump was not denying the conclusions of his own intelligence services.

I have just been reassured unequivocally by the White House legislative team that the President’s ‘no’ response today to shouted questions was not intended to suggest that President Trump doubts the intelligence community’s assessment that Russia is continuing to attack.... — Lindsey Graham (@LindseyGrahamSC) July 18, 2018

Soon enough, Graham was couching his Russia criticism within a statement that he was ""totally"" agreeing with Trump.

Totally agree with President Trump’s observation about Russia not being long-term pro-Republican or pro-Trump. Putin is pro-Chaos and is an Equal Opportunity Disruptor of the American electoral system.



Let’s act together, let’s act now. https://t.co/iY5or4mLpA — Lindsey Graham (@LindseyGrahamSC) July 24, 2018

In April 2018, Graham had signed on to a bipartisan Senate bill that would have specifically protected Robert Mueller's investigation into Russian interference in the 2016 election.

But in August 2018, the bill having gone nowhere, Graham tweeted that he hoped Mueller would ""wrap up his investigation sooner rather than later.""

He also gave an interview in which he appeared to back away from supporting Jeff Sessions. For the first time, Trump quoted Graham approvingly.

.@LindseyGrahamSC “Every President deserves an Attorney General they have confidence in. I believe every President has a right to their Cabinet, these are not lifetime appointments. You serve at the pleasure of the President.” — Donald J. Trump (@realDonaldTrump) August 25, 2018

There was little time for Graham to respond to that tweet. John McCain, who had not wavered in his opposition to Trump, passed away later the same day.

I will need some time to absorb this, but I want Cindy —and the entire McCain family — to know they are in my prayers. — Lindsey Graham (@LindseyGrahamSC) August 26, 2018

McCain had specifically disinvited Trump from the funeral, but Graham was able to wangle an invite for Ivanka Trump and Jared Kushner. Around the same time, he tweeted a photo of his meeting with Ivanka.

Great meeting with @IvankaTrump and her daughter Arabella.



I appreciate all Ivanka is doing to improve the plight of women in the developing world. pic.twitter.com/OLNdxzWPop — Lindsey Graham (@LindseyGrahamSC) August 29, 2018

After the McCain funeral, Graham's long transformation into a Trump surrogate seemed complete. Here he is a week later, tweeting his support in the wake of early revelations from Bob Woodward's book Fear.

By any reasonable measure we have one of the strongest economies in modern history, President Trump has rebuilt a broken military, and we are pushing back hard against America’s enemies. — Lindsey Graham (@LindseyGrahamSC) September 5, 2018

Meanwhile, Republican representatives in the House were in the throes of discrediting Mueller's investigation by attacking the investigators. This presented no problem for Graham.

It is increasingly clear it was the Obama Administration who politicized the DOJ/FBI, not the Trump Administration. — Lindsey Graham (@LindseyGrahamSC) September 11, 2018

What is interesting to follow through all this is how much more frequently Graham tells us to tune in to appearances on Fox News, Fox Business News, and CNN. The more controversial he gets, naturally, the more he does on-air ""hits.""

And then we come to the Kavanaugh nomination, and the revelation of Dr. Christine Blasey Ford's accusation. In a startling display of hypocrisy, the senator who had gone all-in for a man he once despised now accused Democrats of acting in a Machiavellian manner.

When it comes to stopping Pres @realDonaldTrump and his agenda there seem to be no boundaries.



Whether it’s coaching witnesses or reporting thinly-sourced stories without proper verification, everything is fair game and falls into the category of – ‘The Ends Justify the Means.' — Lindsey Graham (@LindseyGrahamSC) September 24, 2018

By the end of the nomination process, Graham wasn't just supporting Trump in his tweets — he was starting to sound like him. Note the use of ellipses instead of numbering his tweets, the one-word descriptions, and the very Trumpian touch of capitalizing the word ""victory.""

…..finally thank you President @realDonaldTrump for the good judgment in selecting Judge Kavanaugh and the toughness and determination to stick by his side and see it through to Victory! — Lindsey Graham (@LindseyGrahamSC) October 6, 2018

Perhaps there is more of Graham's Twitter story to be told; maybe he will disentangle himself from Trump after the midterms. But at the moment, his trail of shifting positions looks like a cautionary tale for future generations.

Here, kids, is what happens when you gain a tax cut, and a Supreme Court seat, and a whole lot of airtime, but lose your political soul."

Dear Representative DeLauro:

On behalf of the American Medical Association (AMA), I am writing to express our appreciation for your introduction of H.R. 536, ""Breast Cancer Patient Protection Act of 2001."" The AMA applauds this bipartisan effort aimed at providing coverage for the reasonable treatment of breast cancer.

Your bill focuses on the fundamental concept that medical decisions should be made by patients and their physicians, rather than by insurers. The AMA feels that decisions regarding medical matters, including a patients length of stay in a hospital, must reside with patients and physicians. Moreover, decisions impacting an individual patient must be determined by the specific circumstances affecting that patient. We believe that H.R. 536 meets these objectives.

The AMA will continue to work to ensure that appropriate medical decision making is left in the hands of physicians in consultation with their patients.

Respectfully,



E. Ratcliffe Anderson, Jr., MD"	"AMA (Washington) AMA Letter to Representative Rosa DeLauro Supporting HR 536, the ""Breast Cancer Patient Protection Act of 2001"""		[]	['hr', 'physicians', '536', 'decisions', 'house', 'letter', 'delauro', 'protection', 'representative', 'rosa', 'supporting', 'medical', 'washington', 'patient', 'patients', 'breast', 'ama']	"Washington, DC 20515Dear Representative DeLauro:On behalf of the American Medical Association (AMA), I am writing to express our appreciation for your introduction of H.R.

Another 44,300 women will die from this deadly form of cancer. With every one in eight American women developing this disease, it's difficult to find a person who doesn't know someone who is affected by breast cancer. In 1996, a Middletown surgeon named Dr. Kristin Zarfos sought the help of Congresswoman DeLauro in confronting what she described as the greatest challenge of her surgical career. She faced two HMOs refusing hospitalization for women undergoing a mastectomy or lymph node removal for breast cancer. Despite a prevailing medical standard of two to four days to recuperate and gain physical and emotional strength, women were regularly faced with being sent home a few hours after surgery. Dr. Zarfos and Congresswoman DeLauro worked together to find a legislative solution to the problem of outpatient mastectomies. DeLauro introduced the Breast Cancer Patient Protection Act in January 1997 to ensure that women suffering from breast cancer receive the medical attention they deserve. It was reintroduced in 108th Congress on April 30, 2003 and designated H.R. 1886. The Breast Cancer Patient Protection Act will guarantee a minimum hospital stay of 48 hours for a woman having a mastectomy, and 24 hours for a woman undergoing a lymph node removal, and will ensure that any decision to have a shorter hospital stay will be made by the patient and her doctor -- not an insurance company more concerned with the health of its profits than the health of the patient. Forcing women to leave the hospital too soon after surgery is dangerous and demeaning, and this bill intends to stop the practice.

Brady Press Briefing Room

2:41 P.M. EST

MS. SANDERS: Good afternoon, everyone. Many of you probably saw Protective Life Corporation’s announcement this morning. As a direct result of the Trump tax cuts, the Alabama-based company is raising their minimum wage to $15 per hour, and giving a $1,000 bonus to over 2,000 of their workers.

For those of you keeping track, we now have over 350 companies that have announced wage increases, bonuses, new hiring, or increased retirement benefits as a direct result of tax reform, which not a single Democrat supported. These announcements have affected over 4 million American workers.

The President is working to build an economy that works for all Americans. The tax cuts and reforms are a big part of that, and so is infrastructure.

As you all saw yesterday, the President unveiled a Legislative Outline for Rebuilding Infrastructure in America. To cure decades of neglect, we are committed to quickly building a safe, reliable, and modern infrastructure to meet the needs of the American people and to fuel economic growth.

And to help make this possible, we have a very special announcement today. In keeping with his campaign pledge, the President donates his salary on a quarterly basis to further work being done on important projects.

Most recently, the President donated his third-quarter salary to help the Department of Health and Human Services combat the opioid epidemic. Prior to that, he donated to the Department of Education and the National Park Service.

And today, the President is proud to donate his fourth-quarter salary — 2017 salary to the Department of Transportation to support their programs to rebuild and modernize our crumbling infrastructure.

Secretary of Transportation Elaine Chao is here to accept the check. I’d like to bring her up to say a few words, take a couple of questions on infrastructure and about how these funds will be used. And I trust that you’ll stay on topic, and then I’ll be back up afterwards to answer your questions on the news of the day.

With that, Secretary Chao. Thank you so much for being here.

SECRETARY CHAO: Thank you. We have to get this check here, and with all of us. (Laughter.)

Thank you. Thank you, Sarah. I’m accompanied here, in case you were wondering, by two officials of the U.S. Department of Transportation. I have with me, Derek Kan, Undersecretary of Policy, and Jim Ray, the Senior Advisor to the Secretary for Infrastructure. They’re here because of this gift. And so let me proceed.

As many of you have heard yesterday, 12 federal agencies have been working with the White House on the comprehensive infrastructure proposal that the President announced yesterday. Transportation is one component. The proposal also includes energy, drinking and waste water, broadband, and veterans hospitals, as well.

The goal of the President’s proposal is to stimulate at least $1.5 trillion in infrastructure investment, which includes a minimum of $200 billion in direct federal funding. And a key element is to empower decision-making at the state and the local level because state and local officials know best the infrastructure needs of their communities.

Many of you know that the principles are behind this, and so I wanted to reiterate some of the principles. The principles behind this proposal are, one, to use federal dollars as seed money to encourage infrastructure investment by the states, localities, and the private sector. Two, provide for the infrastructure needs of rural communities. Three, streamline project delivery. And four, invest in transformative projects that benefit everyone.

We are already applying these principles to the Department of Transportation’s major existing infrastructure grant programs, including, for example, the INFRA grants. And that is why these two gentlemen to my right are here — because their offices will be among those at the Department of Transportation that will be taking the applications and also administering these INFRA grants.

This quarter, as mentioned, the President has generously decided to donate his annual salary to the Department’s INFRA Grant Programs. INFRA directly reflects the President’s proposal by providing dedicated, discretionary funding for projects that address critical issues facing our nation’s highways and bridges and ports.

Under the INFRA program, states and localities that secure some funding or financing of their own are given higher priority access to federal funds. In addition, INFRA also reserves at least 25 percent of its funding to be awarded to rural projects.

So infrastructure is the backbone of our economy, and it’s key to keeping our country competitive. The President’s proposal will create new jobs, strengthen our economy, and improve the quality of life for everyone.

And so with that quick summary, I’ll be more than glad to answer any questions.

Yes, John.

Q Madam Secretary, some of the criticisms of the President’s plan as outlined yesterday are that it puts too much of a burden on the states financially because the federal portion is about 13 percent of the overall, and might also end up in people paying more taxes, more tolls, that sort of thing. What do you say to that?

SECRETARY CHAO: You know, federal money is not free. Federal money comes from our communities, people, taxpayers, and our communities. They take that money, send it to Washington, and then we decide how to use it, and send it back to the communities with a lot of strings attached on what they need to do.

So what we are trying to do is to recognize the states and localities, communities understand best what their infrastructure needs are, and to allow them to have much greater flexibility to decide their own projects, in conjunction and in partnership with the federal government.

Yes, sir.

Q Thanks, Secretary Chao. One of the other criticisms about the President’s plan is that it doesn’t include addressing the Highway Trust Fund, which only has so many years ahead of it — of funding — just a few years. Could you address why that was not included in the President’s broader infrastructure plan? And then, what does the administration plan to do about that very important source of funding for infrastructure projects across the country?

SECRETARY CHAO: Well, the Highway Trust Fund does need to be addressed because, every year, more money goes out of it than receipts are received. And this will be a huge problem in 2021. So we, in conjunction with the Congress, have got to address this issue. So we’re not in any disagreement about that. And the issue is how, and we look forward to consulting with Congress on how to do that. Because, again, the cliff begins in 2021.

Q Madam Secretary, so there are no plan — the White House doesn’t have a proposal right now for that?

SECRETARY CHAO: Well, we don’t want to do it unilaterally. As mentioned, the President’s proposal consisted of principles. And we want to discuss and work in consultation, on a bipartisan basis, with the Hill to address the infrastructure needs of our country.

Q Madam Secretary, thank you. The crumbling infrastructure. Could you talk to us about — we know what’s going on with roads, bridges, highways, what have you. But when it comes to rural America, can you give us specifics about what’s crumbling, what needs to be fixed, and what jobs will be given where?

SECRETARY CHAO: Well, I come from the state of Kentucky. I’m a proud Kentuckian, and I come from a rural state. So I am especially concerned about the needs of rural America, and we recognize that the needs of rural America are special. And that is why, in the President’s proposal, there is actually a provision which addresses the unique needs of rural America.

So it will be separate from the — there’s a separate title that is addressed to rural America. And similarly, there’s a separate title addressed to transformative technology as well. So, for example, Derek Kan, the Undersecretary of Policy, one of his portfolio areas is transformational technology — autonomous vehicles, automated driving systems. So that is another part of the President’s infrastructure proposal that we will be also discussing with the Hill.

MS. SANDERS: Let’s take one last question.

SECRETARY CHAO: Yes.

Q Thank you, Secretary Chao. As you know, the federal gas tax has remained at 18.4 cents per gallon since 1993. The U.S. Chamber of Commerce has advocated an increase in the gas tax of 25 cents per gallon. The truckers — the American Trucking Associations recommended a 20-cent-per-gallon increase in the gas tax. What’s your view on this subject?

SECRETARY CHAO: Well, the President has not declared anything out of bounds, so everything is on the table.

The gas tax, like many of the other pay-fors that are being discussed, is not ideal. There are pros and cons. The gas tax has adverse impact, a very regressive impact, on the most vulnerable within our society; those who depend on jobs, who are hourly workers. So these are tough decisions, which is why, once again, we need to start the dialogue with the Congress, and so that we can address these issues on this very important point.

Q Could you just clarify your answer to John from the first question? Were you saying — there are strings attached. So you’re saying that taxes will increase and that tolls may increase, or they won’t?

SECRETARY CHAO: That is a decision that is up to the state and local governments. And also, it’s going to depend — you know, that gentleman mentioned about federal gas taxes. These are tough decisions. We all want better infrastructure. But unfortunately, there’s just not enough money in the world to pay for all the infrastructure, which is why the President’s infrastructure also emphasizes the private sector.

Private sector pension funds are a tremendous source of capital for funding public infrastructure. There are states which disallow the private sector from investing in public infrastructure. So we hope that those restrictions can be removed.

And then, for those states and localities that want to work with the private sector, it’s their decision as to whether they want to use private activity bonds, whether they want to use tolls, whatever. What we are saying in this proposal is that we’re looking for creative ways for financing.

And so tolls is one way. We’re not advocating for them. We’re also not endorsing them. It is really up to the local entities that are involved in trying to raise the financing.

Q Well, but as a quick follow-up, you’re from Kentucky, so you well know the Watterson Expressway, when it was widened in Louisville, one of the biggest — one of the things they liked the best about it, there was no toll. And so in rural areas, it helped people get to where they wanted to go quicker. Here, in the Washington, D.C. area, you have an abundance of tolls, and it cuts into people’s paychecks. So while you’re espousing that you want to help out rural America, isn’t that going to impact — or won’t tolls hurt rural America?

SECRETARY CHAO: That’s really — okay, you’re mixing up, I think, several things here. I’m so sorry. There’s actually going to be a title, as I mentioned, on rural America. So that is separate from the rest of the titles in this proposal that we’re talking about. So there will be a special section for rural America.

And then, as for whether other — urban areas want to embark upon tolls, or private activity bonds, or asset recycling, that is up to them. We are giving them the flexibility to do so. So it’s actually — they’re getting much greater flexibility now to be able to look at the panoply of creative financing mechanisms, and decide for themselves what they want.

MS. SANDERS: Thank you so much.

SECRETARY CHAO: Thank you so much. I’m sure we’ll be talking more. Thank you.

MS. SANDERS: Thank you, Secretary Chao. Due to the fact the President has got an event here momentarily, we’ll jump straight into the questions for today.

John.

Q As you know, FBI Director Christopher Wray laid out a different timeline than the White House has been telling us, or one that would seem to be in contradiction to the timeline that the White House has laid out, in terms of what we knew when about Rob Porter. Can you speak to what the Director said? He seemed to indicate that the first that you would have known about this might have been in March, then again in June, then November, then in January when the case was actually closed.

MS. SANDERS: Look, we explained the process extensively last week. The White House Personnel Security Office, staffed by career officials, received information last year in what they considered to be the final background investigation report in November. But they had not made a final recommendation for adjudication to the White House because the process was still ongoing when Rob Porter resigned.

In the view of Personnel Security Office, the FBI’s July report required significant additional investigatory fieldwork before Personnel Security Office could begin to evaluate the information for adjudication.

As Director Wray said, information was still coming to the White House Personnel Security Office in February.

Q So just to be clear then — in the July report, if not back to March, was there information contained in those reports about the allegations about Rob Porter?

MS. SANDERS: I wouldn’t have access to that information. I wouldn’t know the answer to that, John.

Kristen.

Q I just want to drill down on one important fact, because you and Raj, and you just said this again that the investigation was ongoing. Christopher Wray said it was closed in January. So who’s telling the truth here?

MS. SANDERS: Both. As I said, the FBI portion was closed. The White House Personnel Security Office, who is the one that makes a recommendation for adjudication, had not finished their process and therefore not made a recommendation to the White House.

Q And let me just clarify one more point. You said yesterday that you didn’t get any paperwork from the FBI. Chris Wray said that he did submit paperwork in all the various months that were (inaudible).

MS. SANDERS: Again, that would come through the White House Personnel Security Office, which had not completed their investigation and not passed that information to the White House.

Q But you acknowledge that you did receive paperwork.

MS. SANDERS: Again, the White House — I think you need to be very clear about — there’s multiple groups here.

The White House Personnel Security Office, which is staffed by career officials, would have — may have received information, but they had not completed their process and made a recommendation to the White House for adjudication.

Q And, Sarah, finally, who allowed John Kelly — or Rob Porter rather, to stay here without a permanent security clearance?

MS. SANDERS: I can’t comment on specifics of that other than what we’ve already said on that matter.

Cecilia.

Q And, Sarah, could you answer questions about —

MS. SANDERS: Sorry, Kristen, I’m going to keep moving because we got a short time fuse here today.

Q Is the White House still maintaining that John Kelly really had no idea about these allegations of domestic abuse until this story broke?

MS. SANDERS: I can only give you the best information that I have, and that’s my understanding.

Q And does the President believe the women?

MS. SANDERS: Again, the President takes all of these accusations very seriously. He believes in due process. Above everything else, he supports the victims of any type of violence, and certainly would condemn any violence against anyone.

Q But we still haven’t heard him say that himself. The cameras were in front of him today —

MS. SANDERS: Again, the President dictated to me specifically, that comment yesterday which I read out to you guys.

Zeke.

Q Thanks, Sarah. I’ve got two you. First, can you speak to — did anyone at the White House Personnel Security Office have any communication with anyone in the West Wing about Rob Porter’s clearance, between when the FBI started submitting its interim reports and —

MS. SANDERS: I’m not aware of any communication. I can’t say definitively, but I’m not aware of any communication.

Q And then, secondly — on Capitol Hill today, in an interview with the Associated Press, DNI Coates said that those with interim security clearances should not be granted — should have limited access to classified information rather than access to the full gamut that a full clearance would provide.

Can you speak to whether that is a current practice right now for the large number — for the significant number of officials, whether it be the West Wing or the broader White House complex? The President’s aides who don’t have permanent security clearances, do they have limited access to classified information?

MS. SANDERS: I can’t speak to whether people have interim or permanent security clearances at all, and therefore can’t comment on the process.

We are following the process that has been used by previous administrations, and we would rely on the law enforcement and intelligence communities to determine if that process needed to be changed.

Q But the DNI suggested that it would be changed.

MS. SANDERS: And they would be the ones that would make that determination and play a role in what those changes would look like.

Josh.

Q Sarah, are you saying that, on four different occasions, the FBI obviously said that it made the White House aware of the allegations, and the White House said — officials said that, until Tuesday night, they did not realize the extent of the allegations. Should someone at the FBI or the Personnel Security Office be punished for not telling White House officials? How can those two things be?

MS. SANDERS: That’s something that would be well beyond my scope to determine, Josh.

Q Is the President upset, though, that they weren’t told, if everyone knew, but no one in the senior staff found out. Are you guys upset about that?

MS. SANDERS: I haven’t asked him about that, specifically.

Matthew.

Q Thanks, Sarah. Raj, the other day, said, last week, that the situation could have been handled better. Yesterday, you echoed that and said the situation could have been handled better. Today, the Chief of Staff said it was all done right. Can you explain — does the White House think this Rob Porter situation could have been handled differently? Or do you guys think this was all done right?

MS. SANDERS: Look, as I said yesterday, I think every day we come here, we do the very best that we can, and every day we can do better than the day before. And we’re going to continue to strive for that. We’re humans, making us imperfect people. And so, every day, I think we can learn from the day before, and we can strive to do better. And that’s our goal, certainly within our team, and we’re going to continue to try to do everything we can to help serve the American people to the best of our ability.

Q Was it appropriate for Hope Hicks to be involved in drafting some of these statements, given her relationship with Mr. Porter?

MS. SANDERS: She was not part of a lot of the conversations that took place. I don’t recall any of you being in the room to be able to say specifically what comments she made or didn’t make. She’s the White House Communications Director, and is an important and valuable member of the staff, and she has done a great job in that role.

Steve.

Q Was there some discussion here about promoting Rob Porter to another job at the time that this all blew up?

MS. SANDERS: Not that I’m aware of. I just — I don’t know the answer to that.

Jeff.

Q Sarah, you said that the FBI has said it was completed in late July, but you said a follow-up required more fieldwork on that. Was that because of something that Rob Porter said in response to that, that the allegations weren’t true? Or what required more fieldwork follow-up?

MS. SANDERS: I wouldn’t know the specifics. I can only refer you back to the previous statement.

Q If I could ask again, though. In an op-ed this morning in the Washington Post, the first wife of Rob Porter said specifically of you, “I expected a woman to do better.” Based on what you know, do you believe you were personally misled? And do you have any regret for how you have explained this to the American people?

MS. SANDERS: Look, as I said, we do the very best job we can every single day. I would never presume to understand anything going on with that individual, nor would I think that she could presume what’s going on with me or the way that I’m responding.

Look, we’ve condemned domestic violence in every way possible. In fact, the President’s budget that he released yesterday fully funds the Violence Against Women Act. We’re looking for ways that we can take action to help this prevent this from ever happening to anyone. And to presume that I feel differently is simply a very strong mischaracterization of who I am and who this White House is, and what our actions are focused on, and what we’re trying to do here.

Q If I could ask one more —

MS. SANDERS: Sorry, I’m going to keep moving, Joe.

Q — where does John Kelly stand as we sit here today, in terms of — if the President has confidence in him, why does he have confidence in him, based on everything we’ve learned over the last week?

MS. SANDERS: Look, I don’t have anything further to add. The President has confidence in his Chief of Staff. We’re going to continue trying to do the best we can to help the American people.

Julie.

Q So a clarification and a question. In July, when the FBI was sent back into the field to get more information, are you telling us that no senior staff — not Don McGahn, not Joe Hagan, not John Kelly — nobody in the senior staff in the West Wing was involved in that decision to tell them to go back and see if they could get more information on what was —

MS. SANDERS: Again, not that I’m aware of. I can’t say with 100 percent certainty, but not that I’m aware of, of any conversations between those individuals.

Q And then, are you looking at, now, ways that you could change the process so that, if a senior official in the White House is facing credible allegations of spousal abuse or some other criminal charge, that senior staff would be notified in a more timely way? I mean, this appears to have — if your timeline is accurate — taken more than a year.

MS. SANDERS: Look, again, I think that this is a process that the law enforcement and intelligence community should weigh in on and determine if changes should be made to the way that it’s carried out.

Q I’m not talking about their process; I’m talking about the process here — where an investigation, where serious allegations could surface, and that nobody in the West Wing would be aware of that.

MS. SANDERS: But that would include those agencies and those departments. So you couldn’t exclude them from a conversation about what changes should and need to be made to any program.

I think that that would have to be something that involved all of the stakeholders and something, certainly, far beyond my purview to walk you through today.

Q Just following up on what Julie was asking. You’re saying that law enforcement should weigh in, but you’re the White House, you’re in charge, and this is your process. Should you not weigh in and take —

MS. SANDERS: It’s actually not our process. A large number of the background component is run by the FBI. Other intelligence agencies weigh in.

Again, what I said is that all of the stakeholders should be part of that discussion and it should be looked at and determined whether or not changes need to be made to the process.

Q Given that it impacts the White House staff, do you not want to request an improved process here?

MS. SANDERS: Again, that would go beyond my scope that I can walk you through here today, but I think it’s certainly a conversation that all of those stakeholders should have.

April.

Q Sarah, a couple questions. In light of everything that’s going on, is there a review now — an internal review — of all of those who have interim security clearances to see if they should stay or should they go?

MS. SANDERS: I can’t speak about whether or not different staff have interim or permanent security clearances —

Q I’m not asking about different staff, I’m asking about the process — all right. Is there a review of those who have interim passes to see if they’re going to stay or they’re going to go because — in light of what’s happening now?

MS. SANDERS: My understanding is that has been ongoing for a while, and that determination would be made outside of anything I can walk you through at this point.

Q And you spoke of fully funding the Violence Against Women Act. It’s up for reauthorization. Tell me the price — how much the President is trying to put in that. And was that the price prior to all of this that’s happened with these two people in the last week?

MS. SANDERS: I’m sorry, I’m not following your question.

Q The budget. You’re saying the President is going to fully fund the reauthorization of the Violence Against Women Act that’s up in March. How much — what is he putting in his budget proposal?

MS. SANDERS: I’d have to look at the specific number, but it was rolled out in the budget that was presented yesterday.

Q You mentioned it, but is the number, the number that it’s always been, or was it just done? Can you talk to us about the funding?

MS. SANDERS: I know it what was requested has been put into the President’s budget.

Q When was it put in?

MS. SANDERS: It was in the budget that was rolled out yesterday that’s been part of the ongoing process.

Q But we just got the budget —

MS. SANDERS: We don’t write a budget, like, in 20 minutes, so it’s been part of something that’s been ongoing.

Q I understand that. I understand that. I understand that. But there’s some things in that budget Mr. Mulvaney did not tell us about yesterday.

MS. SANDERS: That means you probably didn’t ask those questions. I’m going to keep going.

John, go ahead.

Q He didn’t give us an answer. He purposely didn’t give us that information.

Q Thanks a lot, Sarah. I wanted to just get some clarification from you regarding the testimony — the sworn testimony today by the FBI Director. He laid out the timeline. And according to the FBI Director’s testimony, the FBI submitted a partial report on the investigation in question of Porter’s background check in March, and then a completed background investigation in late July.

And yesterday, when I was asking you about when the White House Counsel learned about Mr. Porter, had he learned before the report in the Daily Mail last week, your reply to me was that, “the process for the background was ongoing, and the White House had not received any specific papers regarding the completion of that background check.”

So those two statements — the FBI Director’s statement, Mr. Wray, and your statement yesterday seemed to be at odds with one another. Do you see anything that you’d like to clarify, in terms of what I asked you today, based upon your answer yesterday?

MS. SANDERS: Yeah, as I said earlier, my understanding is any information would have gone to the personnel security office. That office had not completed their process in order to make a recommendation for adjudication to the White House. That was still ongoing and therefore, recommendation had not been made.

Q But you said the specific papers regarding the completion of the background check had not been received.

MS. SANDERS: That’s part of that process that the White House Personnel Security Office plays, run by career officials, and we hadn’t received a recommendation from that office.

Q And yet, the FBI Director said today, under oath, that the completed background investigation was actually submitted in late July. So which one is it?

MS. SANDERS: Let me read this to you again:

The White House Personnel Security Office, staffed by career officials, received information last year in what they considered to be the final background investigation report in November. But they had not made a final recommendation for adjudication to the White House because the process was still ongoing when Porter resigned.

In the view of Personnel Security Office, the FBI’s July report required significant additional investigatory fieldwork before Personnel Security Office could begin to evaluate the information for adjudication.

We find those statements to be consistent with one another.

Jacqueline.

Q Could Mr. McGahn come out here and answer —

MS. SANDERS: Sorry, John, I’m going to keep moving.

Q — any questions that we may have regarding what he knew and when he knew it?

Q Sarah, you’ve said repeatedly that you and the press team do the very best job you can to relay whatever information you know up there. So is there a feeling that Chief of Staff John Kelly has misled you and his colleagues on what he knew and when, and set up the communications staff for failure to relay credible information to us over the past week in order to cover up the way that he handled the firing of Rob Porter?

MS. SANDERS: No, we’re simply stating that we’re giving you the best information that we’re going to have. Obviously, the press team is not going to be as read-in, maybe, as some other elements at a given moment on a variety of topics. But we relay the best and most accurate information that we have, and we have get those from those individuals.

Q And can you talk about the other staffers who have been dismissed previously for not passing background checks, and why Porter wasn’t treated in a similarly timely manner?

MS. SANDERS: My understanding is the same process was followed for all employees, and it’s the same process that was used in previous administrations. And I can’t comment on anybody else’s dismissal.

Toluse.

Q Thank you, Sarah. You’ve talked multiple times about, sort of, wanting to get us the best information that you have. This scandal has been going on for a week now, and we still don’t have answers to the basic questions of, sort of, who knew what, when; whether General John Kelly —

MS. SANDERS: I’ve done the best I can to walk you through that process, as has Raj. We’ve done that pretty extensively, and I’d refer you back to all of the statements we’ve given on that.

Q So I want to ask you whether you’ve spoken specifically to General John Kelly and to the White House Counsel to ask them these questions. Because you’ve said, I’m not aware or I’m not sure.

MS. SANDERS: I have, and this is the information that was given to me by those individuals.

Q House Speaker Paul Ryan, this morning, on the Fox Business Network said we’ve got to get out on entitlements. He talked about a structural deficit problem. He said, we need to “get our other partners in government, White House included, to be willing to do the kind of entitlement reform that we’re willing to do in the House.” What — does the President disagree with House Speaker Paul Ryan on that question of the structural deficit and the problem of mandatory spending?

MS. SANDERS: I would have to ask him specifically on that question. I know the President certainly would like to reduce the deficit, and it’s one of the reasons that his budget — this budget reduced the deficit by $3 trillion, which is one of the largest in history. And he’s going to continue to look for ways to do that.

Q The Speaker says that it’s the structural deficit for mandatory spending, not the discretionary spending, that is the driver. He’s been saying this for years. Does the President disagree with him? I know he’s said he doesn’t agree with that approach to entitlements. Why does he not agree with that assessment?

MS. SANDERS: I’d have to ask him what the specifics are that he doesn’t agree with him on.

Dave. We’ll make this the last question.

Q Thanks, Sarah. Majority Leader McConnell said today that the DACA negotiations have to be done by the end of this week. Did he give the White House a heads-up on that decision? And does that reflect any view from the White House that Democrats are not bargaining in good faith? For example, they didn’t — they blocked a vote on sanctuary cities today.

MS. SANDERS: Look, it’s up to Congress to set the timeline. The President has laid out the priorities that he has for that legislation, and we’re only going to support a legislation that deals with those four priorities that we’ve laid out. We hope Republicans and Democrats can come together to a consensus to fix that problem and not kick the can down the road.

Thanks, guys.

""[Kim Jong-un] has been very threatening beyond a normal statement, and as I said, they will be met with fire, fury, and, frankly, power, the likes of which this world has never seen before,"" the president continued.

https://www.snopes.com/fact-check/foam-on-the-range-rover/	the contents of a few cans of frozen shaving cream will, when thawed, expand to fill an automobile.	false	[]		David Mikkelson	['http://cockeyed.com/inside/trueshave/trueshave.html', 'http://www.cockeyed.com/inside/shaving/shaving.html', 'http://www.cockeyed.com', 'http://www.cockeyed.com/inside/howmuchinside.html', 'http://www.cockeyed.com/pranks/frozen/frozen.html']	http://www.cockeyed.com/pranks/frozen/frozen.html	http://www.cockeyed.com/	"I first heard of the frozen shaving cream prank during my first year at U.C. Santa Barbara. The prank goes like this: If you freeze a can of shaving cream in liquid nitrogen, then carefully hacksaw the can open, you can pull out a frozen shaving cream cylinder. This frozen foam block will expand at it heats up, making a huge mess! Two frozen shaving cream ""bombs"" can fill an entire car, so a car with a window rolled down makes the perfect target!

This prank idea is well documented on the internet. It is posted in several places, with some skepticism about the expansion possibilities of a frozen block of cream.

The problem with this joke is the liquid nitrogen. Who has access to it? I love science. I love chemistry and physics. One time I held both Potassium and Daisy in my very hands, but I've never even seen liquid Nitrogen in person. Nevertheless, I accepted this prank as possible for many years.

Upon completion of how much is inside shaving cream, I began to have serious doubts about the legitimacy of this story. I witnessed first hand the pitiful patty of shaving cream that lives in those cans.

Then, one day, I heard that a can of shaving cream could be frozen solid by a household freezer. I decided I'd have to try that some day.

I kept a can of Colgate shaving cream in my freezer for about four days. I wanted to use it as a cool, whipped desert topping, but one night Tony left his car window down a bit and I decided to act. The steel can was extremely cold to the touch, and felt very solid. I wore an oven mitt to protect my hand from the cold. I also wanted to shield the can from my warm hand. I wonder how one would grip a can frozen in liquid nitrogen.

I used bolt cutters to snip the bottom seam of the can. A little shaving cream puffed out, so I continued to work quickly.

After a few minutes of work, I was able to remove the bottom of the can with some pliers. I peeled off the thin steel and extracted the frozen core.

The inside of a wrecked shaving cream can.

I had my prize, an 11-ounce frozen block of shaving cream. It was already starting to heat up and foam out.

It was a frozen cylinder. There was a little mound on the top, where the cream had reached into the dome of the can.

I placed the cream bomb into a small metal bowl.

In 17 minutes, it was surrounded by a little lake of shaving cream.

The lake grew...

... and grew as the shaving cream thawed. The shaving cream wasn't holding my attention, so I started watching television instead. Unfortunately, ""Blind Date"" was the only show on, so I went back to watching the shaving cream.

Two hours after it was released from the can, the shaving cream crested the sides of the bowl. This was about 8 cups of foam.

After three hours, I fell asleep.

The next morning, I was in a panic. I had somehow forgotten to study for my Music117 exam! As I rushed to locate my backpack, I found the entire back room overflowing with shaving cream! Luckily, this was just a dream.

When I actually awoke, the shaving cream had reached the end of it's growth. The shaving cream had nearly overflowed from the bowl, overfilling it with about 12 cups of foam. It appears that the foam had expanded to about 850% of its frozen volume. Unfortunately, this isn't very much shaving cream. This could make a real mess, but it certainly isn't enough to fill up a car."

Vatican treasurer Cardinal George Pell will stand trial on historical sexual assault charges, a court has ruled.

Cardinal Pell formally pleaded not guilty to the charges on Tuesday. He has consistently denied any wrongdoing.

An Australian magistrate ruled on Tuesday that there was enough evidence for the case to proceed to a trial on some charges, but not on others.

Cardinal Pell, 76, is Australia's most senior Catholic and one of the most powerful officials in the Vatican.

He was given a large police guard as he entered the Melbourne Magistrates' Court in front of dozens of media representatives and members of the public.

Cardinal Pell, who is considered the Church's third-ranked official, took a leave of absence from the Vatican last year to fight the charges in his home country.

Most of the evidence given remains confidential.

But following the hearing on Tuesday, his lawyer, Robert Richter QC, argued that the most ""vile"" allegations against his client had been dismissed.

What is known about the allegations?

Last June, police in the state of Victoria charged the senior cleric with what they described as historical charges involving ""multiple complainants"".

More than 30 witnesses testified during a preliminary court hearing, known as a committal, that ran for four weeks from March. Many sessions were closed to the public, which is standard practice in Victoria in sexual offence cases.

Image copyright Getty Images Image caption Cardinal George Pell and his lawyer were given a police guard entering court

In open hearings, the court heard that an alleged incident took place at a Melbourne cathedral in the 1990s when the cleric was archbishop of Melbourne.

Another allegation related to a swimming pool in the city of Ballarat in the 1970s, when Cardinal Pell was a local priest, the court heard.

What does Cardinal Pell say?

The cleric has consistently denied all accusations, saying last year: ""I am innocent of these charges, they are false. The whole idea of sexual abuse is abhorrent to me.""

Cardinal Pell's lawyer, Robert Richter QC, told a previous hearing that the allegations were ""impossible"", describing the complainants as ""unreliable"".

He argued that Cardinal Pell had been targeted by accusers because of his role as Australia's most senior Catholic figure, and that his client had fully co-operated with police.

What happened on Tuesday?

Magistrate Belinda Wallington said about half of the charges had sufficient evidence to be put to a trial.

An allegation that Cardinal Pell committed a sexual assault in a Ballarat cinema during a screening of Close Encounters of The Third Kind was among the charges that were dismissed.

In explaining that decision, Magistrate Wallington cited inconsistencies between the evidence of the accused and other witnesses, as well as timelines of when the film was screening.

""The evidence as a whole is not a sufficient weight for a jury to convict,"" she said.

Pell defiant

Hywel Griffith, BBC News Sydney correspondent

For over an hour, Cardinal Pell listened studiously, arms folded, as all of allegations against him were described in detail.

Surrounded by supporters in the front row, he didn't react when the magistrate announced that half of the charges were to be dismissed.

When he entered his plea, Cardinal Pell remained seated but spoke in a loud, defiant voice with two words: ""Not guilty.""

And with that, it was clear that the cardinal will now face a trial before a jury.

His appearances so far have seen dozens of cameras trail his every move in and out of court. When a trial does finally take place, the scrutiny is likely to be even more intense.

What will happen now?

Cardinal Pell's trial will be held before a judge and a 12-person jury in the County Court of Victoria.

The court will hold an administrative hearing on Wednesday, but the trial is not expected to begin for several months.

On Tuesday, the Archbishop of Melbourne, Denis Hart, said he had ""confidence in the judicial system in Australia and said that justice must now take its course""."

Excerpt from “Faith of My Fathers” by McCain

“Hero” John McCain as Phony and Collaborator: What Really Happened When He Was a POW? – CounterPunch 6/13/08

EXCERPTS: “on March 25, 1999, two of his fellow POWs, Ted Guy and Gordon “Swede” Larson told the Phoenix New Times that, while they could not guarantee that McCain was not physically harmed, they doubted it. As Larson said, “My only contention with the McCain deal is that while he was at The Plantation, to the best of my knowledge and Ted’s knowledge, he was not physically abused in any way. No one was in that camp. It was the camp that people were released from.”Guy and Larson’s claims are given credence by McCain’s vehement opposition to releasing the government’s debriefings of Vietnam War POWs. McCain gave Michael Isikoff a peek at his debriefs, and Isikoff declared there was “nothing incriminating” in them, apart from the redactions.

McCain had a unique POW experience. Initially, he was taken to the infamous Hanoi Hilton prison camp, where he was interrogated. By McCain’s own account, after three or four days, he cracked. He promised his Vietnamese captors, “I’ll give you military information if you will take me to the hospital.”His Vietnamese capturers soon realized their POW, John Sidney McCain III, came from a well-bred line of American military elites. McCain’s father, John Jr., and grandfather, John Sr., were both full Admirals. A destroyer, the USS John S. McCain, is named after both of them. While his son was held captive in Hanoi, John McCain Jr., from 1968 to 1972, was the Commander-in-Chief of U.S. Pacific Command; Admiral McCain was in charge of all US forces in the Pacific including those fighting in Vietnam. ..The Admiral’s bad boy was used to special treatment and his captors knew that. They were working him.For his part, McCain acknowledges that the Vietnamese rushed him to a hospital, but denies he was given any “special medical treatment.” However….two weeks into his stay at the Vietnamese hospital, the Hanoi press began quoting him. It was not “name rank and serial number, or kill me,” as specified by the military code of conduct. McCain divulged specific military information: he gave the name of the aircraft carrier on which he was based, the number of US pilots that had been lost, the number of aircraft in his flight formation, as well as information about the location of rescue ships…

On the other hand, according to one source, McCain’s collaboration may have had very real consequences. Retired Army Colonel Earl Hopper, a veteran of World War II, Korea and Vietnam, contends that the information that McCain divulged classified information North Vietnam used to hone their air defense system…McCain told his North Vietnamese captors, “highly classified information, the most important of which was the package routes, which were routes used to bomb North Vietnam. He gave in detail the altitude they were flying, the direction, if they made a turn… he gave them what primary targets the United States was interested in.” Hopper contends that the information McCain provided allowed the North Vietnamese to adjust their air-defenses. As result, Hopper claims, the US lost sixty percent more aircraft and in 1968, “called off the bombing of North Vietnam, because of the information McCain had given to them.”

‘When John McCain was my captive‘: interview with former head of Vietnamese prison ‘Hanoi Hilton’ – BBC 6/23/08

EXCERPT: “But I can confirm to you that we never tortured him. We never tortured any prisoners.” Mr Duyet reminisces instead about how he often summoned the future US presidential candidate to his private office for informal chats….So is Mr Duyet implying that that Senator McCain lied about his treatment at the Hanoi Hilton? “He did not tell the truth,” he says. “But I can somehow sympathise with him. He lies to American voters in order to get their support for his presidential election.”

EXCERPT: from 1992 Senate Select Committee on POW/MIA’s:

“When two U.S. Army enlisted men were captured by the Viet Cong in 1963, they were plunged into an ordeal that would prove to be a relentless trial of body and spirit by torture. Once they were finally freed, however, their trials began all over again, when their statements critical of the U. S. Vietnam policy landed them in a military court facing a capital offense for violating the military Code of Conduct by “aiding the enemy.”

But, if your name is John McCain and your father and grandfather were famous admirals, violating the Code of Conduct by “aiding the enemy” translates into fodder for a political career, book deals, and adulation bordering on sainthood. Even though news reports of McCain collaborating with the enemy continued from the time he was captured in 1967 through 1970, the Navy never considered prosecution as an option.

Instead, Pentagon pencil pushers chose a political spin that lifted McCain, the former POW turned U.S. Senator, up to a glorified pedestal where he sprouted a halo and wings and became America’s “POW-hero” and today a presidential candidate.

No such luck for the two lowly “grunts.”

SANTOLI: But on the Senate side, we had one person standing in the way of getting in positions that would have been very tough on government bureaucrats who didn’t tell the truth. And that one person was Sen. John McCain.

Cpl. BOB DUMAS, U.S. Army (Ret.): He didn’t want nobody to check his background because a lot of the POWs that was in the camps said he was a collaborator of the enemy. He gave the enemy the information they wanted.

Dr. JAMES LUCIER, former U.S. Senate Chief of Staff: But We do know that when he was there [in the Vietnamese prison], he cooperated with the communist news services in giving interviews there, ah, not flattering to the United States.

USRY: Information shows that he made over 32 tapes of propaganda for the Vietnamese government. Certainly, you do what you need to do to stay alive. Nobody would fault anybody for that. But there comes a point in time when enough is enough.

REP: DORNAN: They made those transcriptions, and in the transcriptions, I heard a POW who heard them comin’ into his cell and said, “Oh, my God, is that Admiral McCain’s son? Is that the admiral’s son? Is that Johnny — telling us that our principal targets are schools, orphanages, hospitals, temples, churches?” That was Jane Fonda’s line. Where are those transcriptions? Believe me — they’re in the archives of the museum, the bragging military phony museum in Hanoi. McCain could not have wanted those [to] turn up in the middle of a presidential race. He knows that. I know that, and a few other people know that, and that’s why he went against Bob Dole’s legislation.

DUMAS: And he didn’t want nobody looking into his background in that camp, what went on in that camp. That stuff is still classified so nobody can see it. And he just had it classified forever, so nobody’ll ever look at it.

LUCIER: That he was given special treatment and was put in a room with two other defectors who were later given special treatment. Although I will say to his credit he refused to be repatriated as a result.

REP: DORNAN: This sounds so good at first. McCain was offered the chance to come home. They called him the “Prince.” And he could have. But nobody ever takes that one step beyond that. If John … Admiral John McCain II … “Junior” … if his son, a lieutenant senior grade, had accepted this princely status and come home in 1967 while the others would sit there for five years, what would the Navy have done, with the son of an admiral who opted to get special treatment and come home? No Navy career. No House seat. No Senate seat. It would have been the end of his career. [Edit.] And they were offering him this chance to go home in one of three groups that came home in ‘68.

SANTOLI: They were all collaborators.

REP. DORNAN: And McCain called them this — except for Bill Kagill [phonetic] — the “slipperies,” the “slimies” and the “sleazies.” I once forgot one of those names — and he refreshed my memory. The slipperies, the slimies and the sleazies. So that meant that he would have become a slimy, a sleazy and a slippery, ruining his career and the admiral’s son goes home. What I’m saying is, yes — he chose to stay. But did he have an alternative if he ever wanted to have a life? And what would it have done to his father?

DOUGLASS: And his activities were sufficiently consistent and widespread in opposing efforts to learn the truth that he was written up in a number of articles as a Manchurian candidate in this issue.

REP. DORNAN: In Hanoi, he saw McCain turn red in the face. He even used the term “Rumblestiltskin” [sic], jumping up and down in place in a rage: “If you release any of these records that you have here in Hanoi on me or the other POWs, you will NEVER get diplomatic recognition.”

USRY: McCain may have been an expert on being a prisoner of war but he was by no means an expert on the POW issue.”

Top cop says McCain was never tortured – PrisonPlanet 2/7/08

“McLamb said the POW’s told him that McCain had sustained two broken arms and a leg injury from not pulling his arms in when he bailed out of his A-4 Skyhawk that was shot down over the Truc Bach Lake in Hanoi. The POW’s said that McCain made 32 propaganda videos for the communist North Vietnamese in which he denounced America for what they were doing in Vietnam.”…”Several Vietnam veterans groups do solely exist to expose McCain’s abandonment of veteran’s interests as well as his lies about being tortured, including Vietnam Veterans Against John McCain and U.S. Veteran Dispatch. “

In fact, McCain’s own account confirms he broke his own arms while ejecting from his plane.

KD. Katie. Zombie.

A common street name for a variety of drugs, KD has taken on a frightening form on the city's east side.

Users writhing on the ground, wide-eyed and struggling to breathe. Standing but moving in slow motion. Sweating. Convulsing.

Indianapolis firefighter Scott Lebherz told IndyStar this variation of KD can take many forms — marijuana, spice, tobacco, even banana leaves — but shares a common trait: all laced with a heavy-duty household bug spray.

It’s cheap — you can buy a bag for about $20, Lebherz said — and it can give users a 45-minute, zombie-like high that leaves them nearly catatonic.

“You look at what it does to a bug,” he said, “and then you got to think what it’s doing to your brain, and your body and everything else.”

The practice of mixing drugs with other chemicals is not new to Indianapolis. Worrisome still is the problem it presents for medics and other rescue personnel who are faced with giving critical aid to people who have smoked or otherwise ingested some uncertain substance.

The uncertain substance continually changes.

Firefighters can’t be surprised: But I was shocked by people smoking roach spray.

More than a game: How IHSAA basketball tournament run lifts entire small Indiana town

In January personnel from Indianapolis Emergency Medical Services, the Indianapolis Fire Department and the Indianapolis Metropolitan Police Department responded to dozens of overdoses in or around Downtown’s Wheeler Mission. At least 17 guests were believed to have overdosed on ""Katie"" — another mix of spice and an unknown chemical or drug.

Most of the men were able to bounce back, but at least one was taken to the hospital and placed on a ventilator that week, according to mission leadership.

Indianapolis police said a subsequent investigation led them to several drug houses connected to the distribution of spice mixed with an unknown chemical. Officers made six arrests in connection with the overdoses and confiscated nearly 10 pounds of synthetic marijuana and five handguns.

""You’re looking at people who will mix (a chemical) with a drug as a way to try to make more profit,"" said Daniel Rusyniak, medical director of the Indiana Poison Center. ""Cutting your drug with ingredients has been a longtime thing that drug dealers have done to increase profits.""

Last year, a Tennessee man admitted to smoking a mix of methamphetamine and bug spray called ""wasp"" before ransacking a family's home and trying to cut himself at the family's dinner table in front of a woman and four children, NBC26 reported.

In Monroe County, Mississippi, authorities last year observed a trend of residents crystallizing wasp spray and injecting it intravenously, a fix called ""hotshots,"" NewsMS reported.

“Oftentimes, when they mix a substance, they're just trying to enhance the predicted high,” said Dan O’Donnell, medical director for IFD and IEMS.

O'Donnell said these ever-changing combinations present an ongoing challenge for first responders and medical professionals.

A person’s reaction to a mixed drug like KD depends on the concentration of the chemical, the ingredients used to produce the base substance and their own physiological response to that substance, he said, making it especially difficult for responders to know exactly what they are treating.

""Someone can go from extremely combative to suddenly unconscious, not breathing and potentially in cardiac arrest,"" O’Donnell said. ""... We try to stay on top of it as much as we can through education and training and situational awareness about just what drugs are in the city, but as soon as we kind of catch up to one, they seem to introduce a new substance out there.""

The active ingredients in household bug sprays, pyrethroids, are generally considered to be safe in small exposures, Rusyniak said. Exposure to high concentrations could induce respiratory distress and neuroexcitations, leading to sweating, muscle spasms or seizure, and the risk of falling into a coma.

""It’s why we use it on bugs,"" he said, ""because it overstimulates the bug, they have the equivalent of seizures and die.""

Despite likely knowing the dangers of ingesting bug spray, people who are most likely to do so are those who already are struggling with deep addiction and abuse issues, Rusyniak said.

""It’s a different decision making process,"" he said. ""There’s a difference between, 'What’s bad for me,' which requires you to think forward … versus, 'I need to get high now.'”

For their part, police can only play a limited role.

Officers can't arrest someone for possessing a household substance like bug spray, IMPD Sgt. Chris Wilburn said.

""If someone sprays a legal substance on something that is harmful to their health,"" Wilburn said, ""that is not ... in their scope to diagnose this person as being a criminal.”

The risks of the unknown are not just immediate, either, for users.

“If they go unconscious and not breathing, they could have problems just from that event,” O’Donnell said, “let alone what are the downstream effects of these drugs, three to five, six, seven, 10 years from now.”

Many people, even health care providers, can be confused about whether the lone star tick causes Lyme disease. It does not. Patients bitten by lone star ticks will occasionally develop a circular rash similar to the rash of early Lyme disease. The cause of this rash has not been determined; however, studies have shown that the rash is not caused by Borrelia burgdorferi, the bacterium that causes Lyme disease.

This condition has been named southern tick-associated rash illness (STARI). The rash may sometimes be accompanied by fatigue, headache, fever, and muscle pains. In the cases of STARI studied to date, the rash and accompanying symptoms have resolved following treatment with an oral antibiotic (doxycycline), but it is unknown whether this medication speeds recovery. STARI has not been linked to arthritis, neurologic disease, or chronic symptoms. Researchers once hypothesized that STARI was caused by the spirochete, Borrelia lonestari, however further research did not support this ideaExternal . The cause of STARI remains unknown.

Lone star ticks have not been shown to transmit Borrelia burgdorferi, the cause of Lyme disease. In fact, their saliva has been shown to kill Borrelia (Ledin et al., 2005, Zeidner et al., 2009).

The lone star tick, Amblyomma americanum, is found throughout the eastern, southeastern and south-central states. The distribution, range and abundance of the lone star tick have increased over the past 20-30 years, and lone star ticks have been recorded in large numbers as far north as Maine and as far west as central Texas and Oklahoma. All three life stages (larva, nymph, adult) of the lone star tick will feed on humans, and may be quite aggressive. Lone star ticks will also feed readily on other animals, including dogs and cats, and may be brought into the home on pets. The saliva from lone star ticks can be irritating; redness and discomfort at a bite site does not necessarily indicate an infection.

People should monitor their health closely after any tick bite, and should consult their physician if they experience a rash, fever, headache, joint or muscle pains, or swollen lymph nodes within 30 days of a tick bite. These can be signs of a number of tickborne diseases.

Tick-borne illness may be prevented by avoiding tick habitat (dense woods and brushy areas), using insect repellents containing DEET or permethrin, wearing long pants and socks, and performing tick checks and promptly removing ticks after outdoor activity. Additional prevention tips are available."	STARI or Lyme?

HIV Positive Women in Kenya has revealed that she has infected a total of 324 men with the Human Immunodeficiency Virus (HIV).

The HIV positive girl, who attends the Kabarak University in Nakuru, is said to have been infected by a man at a party. The unidentified 19-year old is allegedly aiming to infect a total of 2000 men in revenge.

According to reports:

The girl allegedly contacted Kenyan Scandals on Facebook and claimed she had something to confess.

After she was assured her identity was going to be protected she wrote: “Sep 22nd 2013 is a day I”ll never forget, we went clubbing in town and got drunk with some senior students then went back hostels for party round 2″.

She then explained that when she woke up, the morning after, she realized a boy named Javan had had sex with her while she was drunk.

“I only asked if he used a condom and he said yes, however when taking bath I noticed sperms down there, I wanted to commit suicide, I feared getting pregnant and HIV.”

When she discovered she was HIV positive, the girl confronted Javan who insisted he was clean.

“I was so depressed and took alcohol to die, I even bought poison, the pain was just unbearable how was I gone face the world, I let my parents down, I gave up on the world and just wanted to end my life. My future had been ruined, somehow someone had to pay,” the girl said.

“I accepted my fate and promised to make all men I come across suffer, I know I’m attractive and men both married and unmarried chase me left right and center. I buried the good girl in me and became the bad girl, my goal was to infect as many as possible,” she explained.

The girl then confessed she had already infected 324 men, 156 of which are students at the Kabarak University where she studies, the rest are married men, lecturers, lawyers, celebrities and politicians.

“Not a day passes without me having sex, mostly 4 people per day,” she continued in her confession. “Your day is coming, you men destroyed my life and I will make you and your people pay for it”

Unfortunately, it’s likely that what she did was perfectly legal because she solicited the funds through a GoFundMe campaign and the company is notoriously bad at working with police to crack down on scammers.

Johnson was questioned by police, but denies misusing funds. She refuses to hand over records.

le. From an EV email ""As we navigate these challenging and uncertain times, what we do know with confidence is that we will pull through this by pulling together. As the spread of COVID-19 (coronavirus) increases, many LGBTQ people and allies are understandably concerned about how this virus may affect us and our communities. We can take comfort by remembering that our families and neighborhoods are stronger when we come together in moments of joy and celebration, as well as in times of crisis. This is certainly true now more than ever as LGBTQ communities are among those who are particularly vulnerable to the negative health effects of this virus due to several factors: *The LGBTQ population uses tobacco at rates that are 50% higher than the general population. COVID-19 is a respiratory illness that has proven particularly harmful to smokers. *The LGBTQ population has higher rates of HIV and cancer, which means a greater number of us may have compromised immune systems, leaving us more vulnerable to COVID-19 infections. LGBTQ people continue to experience discrimination, unwelcoming attitudes, and lack of understanding from providers and staff in many health care settings, and as a result, many are reluctant to seek medical care except in situations that feel urgent – and perhaps not even then. * In addition, there are more than 3 million LGBTQ elders living in the United States, and they are already less likely to reach out to health and aging providers, like senior centers, meal programs, and other programs designed to ensure their health and wellness, because they fear discrimination and harassment. The devastating impact of COVID-19 on elders makes this a huge issue for the LGBTQ community, and a stark reminder that we are all better off when we are all healthy -- especially the most vulnerable among us. We believe that the antidote to fear is not despondency or self-isolation, not anger or blame, but rather love and connection, shared purpose and collective action. By standing together and ensuring that each and every LGBTQ Virginian has the resources and information they need, we can and will prevail through this time. To that end, we have created a COVID-19 Resource Hub that lists a range of online resources including information about healthcare, employment, mutual aid, and food access. While we have not worked with or vetted each organization, effort, or campaign listed, we are excited to promote resources and inclusive spaces for LGBTQ+ people. We recommend that you do your own research before providing any organization with your personal information or resources."" https://www.equalityvirginia.org/…/co…/…"	Equality Stafford		[]	['health', 'vulnerable', 'rates', 'stafford', 'resources', 'times', 'lgbtq', 'covid19', 'information', 'virus', 'equality', 'population']	"As the spread of COVID-19 (coronavirus) increases, many LGBTQ people and allies are understandably concerned about how this virus may affect us and our communities.

https://www.snopes.com/fact-check/patrick-little-neo-nazi-california/	"republican candidate for u.s. senate in california, patrick little, has expressed anti-semitic views, including calling for a united states ""free from jews."""	true	['anti-semitism', 'california', 'racism', 'Republican Party']	2018/05/01	Dan MacGuill	['http://archive.li/39YW3', 'http://archive.li/usirj', 'http://archive.li/uy0LQ', 'http://archive.li/xPtBy', 'http://archive.li/RFOhP', 'https://www.theatlantic.com/politics/archive/2018/01/paul-nehlen/551312/']	https://www.theatlantic.com/politics/archive/2018/01/paul-nehlen/551312/	https://www.theatlantic.com/	"And he loves making odd generalizations about what Jews are like. “Poop, incest, and pedophilia. Why are those common themes repeated so often with Jews?” he tweeted. One of Nehlen’s 89,000 followers declared that “@pnehlen is one of the few American Christians courageous and honest enough to defend the Faith against Islamists and Talmudic Pharisees alike even when it’s unpopular. God bless you, Paul!” Nehlen hit retweet.

And that’s just what’s happened in the last few days. There’s a lot more. These examples, which are representative of how Nehlen conducts himself online, also represent the well-worn tropes of anti-Semitism: conspiracy theories about Jews controlling the media; using Christianity to target and direct suspicion toward Jews; rewriting history to put distance between Judaism and Christianity. His comments are so over-the-top, so clichéd and ham-fisted, that they almost seem like a joke—a not-particularly-creative parody of Jew-hating, rather than shocking comments from a man who won more than 10,000 Republican votes for Congress in 2016.

All of this is worth noting not because Nehlen seems primed to win office; if anything, whatever influence he once had seems to be slipping. When he ran for office in 2016, he won endorsements from such conservative stars as Sarah Palin and Ann Coulter. He showed up at Roy Moore’s last rally in Alabama and was apparently favored by the former White House chief strategist Steve Bannon. Yet Breitbart News, where Nehlen was formerly a contributor, recently dumped him after he tweeted a string of anti-Semitic messages in December. By all appearances, he remains a fringe figure with a diffuse online following that probably won’t boost his chances in Wisconsin.

But Nehlen does represent two troubling, pernicious political trends. The first is the appropriation of Christianity to justify white-supremacist views. Nehlen says he is not a white supremacist; he is just “pro-white.” Whatever meaningless semantic distinctions he wants to make, the behavior is the same: He repeatedly uses his purported faith as a rallying cry against Jews—a group, he implicitly claims, that is not white. I reached out to Nehlen for an interview about his views on Christianity. He did not respond.

“Save your breath little man,” he tweeted at Ben Shapiro, the editor in chief of the conservative outlet The Daily Wire, who has been the target of extreme anti-Semitism online. “Christians have nothing to learn about Christ from Jews.” While it is not unusual for conservative politicians to tweet their support for Second Amendment rights, it is unusual to “urge Christians to concealed carry,” and then, when asked why he specifically called out Christians, reply that “I’ll advocate for whomever I want, and that will be my Christian brothers and sisters. If you want to advocate for Jews, who’s stopping you?”"	Paul Nehlen Is an Anti-Semitic Clown	2018-01-24 11:14:55-05:00	['Emma Green']	['online', 'clown', 'tweeted', 'conservative', 'views', 'christians', 'white', 'won', 'paul', 'antisemitic', 'christianity', 'nehlen', 'jews']	"Why are those common themes repeated so often with Jews?” he tweeted.

The flight attendant's story started to spread on Facebook over the weekend, as the debate over immigrant children being separated from their parents at the border raged.

On a red-eye flight from Arizona to Miami last week, the story goes, the flight attendant and crew of an unnamed airline were saddened to see a group of 16 children, approximately 6 to 11 years old.

""Sixteen. All dressed in black and gray cheap Walmart sweat suits, quietly boarding the 12:30am flight,'' according to two Facebook posts on Friday that claim the story was copied and pasted from a post by the unnamed flight attendant. ""Children! Thirty-two scared eyes looking straight forward dazed. We try to speak, yet none speak English.

UPDATE: Airlines ask government not to use flights to separate families

""During the beverage service, one of the crew comes to me in tears. They can't face these children that have been ripped from their families with a smile.""

The posts were shared widely and by Monday the flight attendant's story had gone viral.

A post by Twitter user @EmRazz, who has nearly 45,000 Twitter followers and describes herself as ""your favorite friendly feminist,'' had more than 1,000 comments and was retweeted more than 28,000 times and liked more than 32,000 times as of Tuesday at 3 p.m.

One of the retweets came Monday from Ana Navarro, a Republican strategist and CNN political commentator. She had just two words for the situation: ""Dear God.''

Navarro's post about the flight attendant's story has also been retweeted more than 24,000 times as of Tuesday afternoon.

The comments were predictably political, underscoring the deeply divisive immigration issue, in the spotlight with the Trump administration's zero-tolerance policy.

But there was another, major thread in the comments: Is the flight attendant story true or a hoax?

Readers said some things about the story shared on Facebook and Twitter don't add up. One of the biggest: the flight times. The flight attendant reportedly said the flight departed at 12:30 a.m. and the children got off in Miami at 2:30 a.m.

A 12:30 a.m. flight from Arizona to Miami, presumably from Phoenix Sky Harbor International Airport, can't land at 2:30 a.m. because it's already 3:30 a.m. Miami time when the flight takes off given the three-hour time difference. American Airlines, for example, has a non-stop red-eye flight from Phoenix Sky Harbor International Airport that departs at 12:10 a.m. and gets in around 7:36 a.m. Miami time.

Here's what we know and don't know

1. The incident did occur — at least according to the Association of Flight Attendants-CWA, the union representing 50,000 flight attendants from 20 airlines including United, Spirit, Alaska and Frontier. Union spokeswoman Taylor Garland told The Arizona Republic the union has confirmed the original Facebook post was authentic and written by a flight attendant. She declined to say how the union confirmed that, name the flight attendant, flight number or airline, including whether the airline is represented by AFA-CWA.

The union issued a statement saying flight attendants, as aviation's ""first responders'' have extensive experience ushering migrant children to families or deportation but that the climate has changed.

""The difference today is the overwhelming American opposition to a new immigration policy that separates families,'' president Sara Nelson said in the statement. ""This national discussion and response is being felt on the planes and discussed among crews. Some are struggling with the question of participating in a process that they feel deeply is immoral. Airlines are often a first point of contact for any public debate on these issues because all of society passes through our aircraft. Communication to crews from the airlines and the government is paramount as tensions are high and flight attendants continue to serve as aviation's first responders.""

The Association of Professional Flight Attendants, the flight attendants' union at American, did not return calls seeking comment.

2. American Airlines is the likely airline, bad flight math and all. Nowhere in the viral flight attendant story does it say the red-eye flight from Arizona to Miami was a non-stop flight. American is the busiest carrier at Phoenix Sky Harbor International Airport and has a major hub here, offering one-stop service several times a day in addition to the non-stop flights. The shared post also mentions computer outages, cancellations and delays the day of the flight with the ""migrant'' children. On Thursday, American's Charlotte, North Carolina, hub was a mess due to technology problems at its PSA subsidiary. American flight 1682 was due to leave Charlotte for Miami at 10:40 p.m. that night but was delayed until nearly 12:30 a.m. That's the departure time mentioned in the flight attendant's recounting of the incident. It arrived in Miami 1:52 a.m., according to flight tracker FlightAware, also fitting the timetable in the viral post. The airline has a 2:50 p.m. flight from Phoenix to Charlotte that connects with the late-night Charlotte to Miami flight.

American spokeswoman Shannon Gilson said American can't ""confirm the accuracy"" of the flight attendant's post.

""We don't disclose passenger manifests,'' she said.

The airline issued this statement on Tuesday: ""We have been asked about transporting undocumented children and are aware of the narrative that is circulating online. American, like all U.S. airlines, provides travel to the federal government through our Government Services Agreements; however the government does not disclose information about the nature of the flights they take or the passengers who are traveling. We have no way to substantiate the report at this time but would be disappointed to learn that our airline was being used to separate families.''

3. The flight attendant who was shaken by the incident is staying out of the spotlight. No one who has shared the flight attendant's story on Facebook, at least publicly, identifies the flight attendant or links to the original post. It's always a co-worker or a friend of a friend. New York attorney Victoria Cook shared the story on Facebook, saying her flight attendant friend Anika Lodzinski's co-worker posted about the incident following a red-eye flight from Arizona to Miami. Lodzinski, reached via Facebook messenger, said she has been a flight attendant for 18 years but declined to name the airline or her friend and referred other questions to the Association of Flight Attendants-CWA. Tom Johnson shared the flight attendant/migrant children story on Friday, noting that it came from an American Airlines flight attendant, who copied and pasted it from a co-worker who was working the flight. The flight attendant declined to comment.

4. Since we don't know the flight, the attendants or the children, it's impossible to verify the details. Were the children really ""ripped from their families""? Were they headed somewhere because of the current situation — adult parents held awaiting prosecution with their minor children shipped off to shelters elsewhere? Or were they perhaps unaccompanied minors, many of whom have been handled by federal authorities for years now? How did the flight attendants know the children's situations if they couldn't communicate with them?

Immigration and Customs Enforcement spokeswoman Lauren Mack said the agency does not comment on speculative information it cannot verify.

The U.S. Department of Health and Human Services, which runs the Office of Refugee Resettlement, in charge of housing children who have crossed the border or been taken from their parents, did not immediately respond to questions about the report.

Stephanie Corcoran, a Phoenix immigration lawyer and president of the Arizona chapter of the American Immigration Lawyer's Association, said she and other immigration advocates were not surprised by the story.

""I actually shared it (on Facebook) because I thought it was probably true,'' she said.

She said the details about the children's matching outfits — she called it prison garb — make sense because sometimes their personal belongings are taken.

Corcoran, who volunteered at an immigration advocacy center in Miami when she was in law school, also said she has heard about a recent influx of migrant children in Miami.

""If they (the Office of Refugee Resettlement) don't have room here, they're going to transfer them wherever they have space.''

Ethnopharmacological relevance The convolvulacea Argyreia nervosa (Burm. f.) is well known as an important medical plant in the traditional Ayurvedic system of medicine and it is used in numerous diseases (e.g. nervousness, bronchitis, tuberculosis, arthritis, and diabetes). Additionally, in the Indian state of Assam and in other regions Argyreia nervosa is part of the traditional tribal medicine (e.g. the Santali people, the Lodhas, and others). In the western hemisphere, Argyreia nervosa has been brought in attention as so called “legal high”. In this context, the seeds are used as source of the psychoactive ergotalkaloid lysergic acid amide (LSA), which is considered as the main active ingredient.

Aim of the study As the chemical structure of LSA is very similar to that of lysergic acid diethylamide (LSD), the seeds of Argyreia nervosa (Burm. f.) are often considered as natural substitute of LSD. In the present study, LSA and LSD have been compared concerning their potential pharmacological profiles based on the receptor binding affinities since our recent human study with four volunteers on p.o. application of Argyreia nervosa seeds has led to some ambiguous effects.

Material and methods In an initial step computer-aided in silico prediction models on receptor binding were employed to screen for serotonin, norepinephrine, dopamine, muscarine, and histamine receptor subtypes as potential targets for LSA. In addition, this screening was extended to accompany ergotalkaloids of Argyreia nervosa (Burm. f.). In a verification step, selected LSA screening results were confirmed by in vitro binding assays with some extensions to LSD.

Results In the in silico model LSA exhibited the highest affinity with a pK i of about 8.0 at α 1A , and α 1B . Clear affinity with pK i >7 was predicted for 5-HT 1A , 5-HT 1B , 5-HT 1D , 5-HT 6 , 5-HT 7 , and D 2 . From these receptors the 5-HT 1D subtype exhibited the highest pK i with 7.98 in the prediction model. From the other ergotalkaloids, agroclavine and festuclavine also seemed to be highly affine to the 5-HT 1D -receptor with pK i >8. In general, the ergotalkaloids of Argyreia nervosa seem to prefer serotonin and dopamine receptors (pK i >7). However, with exception of ergometrine/ergometrinine only for 5-HT 3A , and histamine H 2 and H 4 no affinities were predicted. Compared to LSD, LSA exhibited lower binding affinities in the in vitro binding assays for all tested receptor subtypes. However, with a pK i of 7.99, 7.56, and 7.21 a clear affinity for 5-HT 1A , 5-HT 2 , and α 2 could be demonstrated. For DA receptor subtypes and the α 1 -receptor the pK i ranged from 6.05 to 6.85."

Usually when we think about the Black Panther Party (BPP), we envision the images that have long dominated public media—images of black men armed with guns, dressed in black. Yet, as Stanley Nelson’s recent documentary highlights, the BPP was far more complex. Established in 1966 by Huey Newton and Bobby Seale, the BPP was created in response to the rise of police violence in the Bay area. Originally called the Black Panther Party for Self-Defense, the BPP set out to monitor police activities and protect black residents from police brutality. One of the fundamental aspects of the BPP was their commitment to serving black communities through a variety of social programs including ambulance services, health clinics, and the creation of schools. One of the most successful of these social programs was the Free Breakfast for Children Program, which provided food for children all across the United States.

The BPP’s Survival Programs were fundamental to the Party’s mission to improve black communities during the late 1960s. According to Newton, “these programs satisfied the deep needs of the community.”[1] Significantly, the BPP’s Survival Programs were deeply intertwined with the Party’s political goals. BPP members understood that in order to advance their political goals, black men and women needed to be able to sustain themselves. As BPP member David Hilliard explained, the “actions the BPP engaged in were purely strategic for political purposes designed to mobilize the community.”

The first BPP Breakfast Program opened in January 1969 at Father Earl A. Neil’s St. Augustine Episcopal Church in Oakland, California. On the first day of the Free for Children Breakfast Program, Party members fed eleven children. By the end of that week, the number rose to 135 children. According to BPP member Flores Forbes, Panthers “cooked, served the food, knocked on doors to let the people know which apartment the food was being served in.” Less than two months later, the Party opened up another breakfast program at San Francisco’s Sacred Heart Church.

In Los Angeles, Forbes and others spoke to parents and business owners, explaining how the Breakfast Program would help black children “grow and intellectually develop because children can’t learn on empty stomachs.” Forbes later recalled that the response was “overwhelming.” Breakfast Programs were springing up everywhere. During the height of the Party’s influence, the Los Angeles Breakfast Program provided food for an estimated 1,200 children per week. In New Orleans, the BPP’s Breakfast Program fed more than 300 children on a weekly basis.

As the BPP became overwhelmingly successful, it became mandatory for all chapters to have a Free Breakfast for Children Program.[2] The minimum requirement for the Free Breakfast Program was an available space with tables and chairs for at least fifty people. Panther leaders requested a minimum of ten persons working—two persons on traffic control; one person at the sign in table; one person taking coats and hats; four servers; and two cooks.[3] As a grassroots organization, the BPP relied on the support of ordinary men and women to help fund the Breakfast Programs and the organization as a whole. To that end, members of the Party organized a number of fundraising events in order to collect money, food, and kitchen supplies from local churches and businesses.

By 1969, the Breakfast Program could be found in every city with a BPP chapter including Philadelphia, Seattle, and New York City. The success of these programs coincided with the federal government’s efforts to quell the Party and limit its influence on black communities across the country and the globe. Under the auspices of COINTELPRO, a counterintelligence program run by FBI agents, director Edgar J. Hoover and others devised a range of strategies aimed at destroying the BPP.

Along with propaganda, infiltration, and various attempts to discredit the organization, the FBI also targeted the BPP’s Free Breakfast for Children Program. Melvin Dickson, a former member of the BPP, has argued that the FBI disliked the BPP because the Party helped to shed light on the failure of the U.S. government to address issues of poverty. According to Dickson, “[the U.S. government] have all this money, but here we are, a grassroots organization feeding kids all across the U.S.” During his tenure in the BPP, Dickson ran the BPP’s Breakfast Program at the Atlantic Street Center in Seattle, Washington, which opened in 1969. “We wanted to give [people] the organizational skills, so [they] could do things [for] themselves,” Dickson explained.[4]

Despite the positive impact of the Free Breakfast for Children Program in black communities, they could not outmatch the powers of the FBI. By the late 1980s, the BPP, along with the Breakfast Programs, had been obliterated. While the Party’s Free Breakfast for Children Program was short-lived, it left a lasting impact. Indeed, the Party’s influence can still be seen in public schools nationwide, which now provide free breakfast and lunch for children in need. Moreover, the Free Breakfast for Children Program underscores how the BPP sought to address the social and economic needs of black communities during the Civil Rights-Black Power era. This is a fundamental, yet often overlooked, aspect of the Party’s history and legacy.

Lesley Woods, co-facilitator for Equality Stafford, relayed the events from the student's family. The group is not identifying the student or the school out of fear for the student's safety and the safety of the other students.

Woods says on Sept. 28, the school held a lockdown drill while the transgender female student was in gym class. The students were instructed to take shelter in the boys and girls locker rooms, but the transgender student was told to sit in a hallway outside of the locker rooms because the staff did not know if it would be appropriate to allow her to go with the other girls into the locker room.

According to Woods, the incident led to anxiety for the girl and her family, and is a clear sign that Stafford County Public Schools needs a clear policy when it comes to transgender students.

""This is nothing new for the family,"" said Woods. ""They are a solid family and they are very much in support of their child, and they are really solid advocates for the community. So I would say all in all, the rest of us are shocked and appalled and motivated to come and speak and learn, but this family - this is their life everyday,""

Woods says there have been inconsistencies previously in how the school handled the transgender student's bathroom and facility use.

Stafford County Public Schools does not have a policy and has been dealing with transgender students on a case-by-case basis, according to Woods.

In a statement to FOX 5, the school district wrote:

""Stafford County Public Schools does not comment on individual student incidents to avoid divulging confidential information. However, the new superintendent has requested a review of all protocols and procedures including security to ensure that all children are treated with dignity and respect. We take such matters very seriously and they will be addressed. The welfare of all students is of the utmost importance for SCPS.""

Stafford County Public Schools declined to answer FOX 5's questions about policies regarding transgender students or the specific incident.

The school board will meet Tuesday at 7 p.m. where Equality Stafford is expected to speak about the incident and the call for a clear policy for transgender students.

The group says it has received hundreds of comments on its Facebook post about the transgender student's recent experience. However, some of the comments have turned ugly, including several threats.

Other school systems have policies that guide staff on caring for transgender students. D.C. Public Schools has a comprehensive policy which allows transgender students access to spaces that correspond with their gender identity. Fairfax County Public Schools has a similar draft policy, but it has not gone into effect, pending the outcome of several court cases and the Trump administration's move to rescind Obama-era guidance that allowed transgender students to use the bathrooms that match their gender identity.

Equality Stafford says despite the September incident, it has been working well with Stafford County Public Schools on LGBTQ-inclusive policies.

""The school is receptive, the school board is receptive and what we're trying to do now is really highlight the need for a little bit more pressure and for a little bit more advocacy from the community to make sure that these changes happen more efficiently,"" said Woods."

https://www.snopes.com/fact-check/flight-attendant-redeye-immigrant-children/	facebook posts by commercial flight attendants describe their experiences working on flights transporting unaccompanied immigrant children to detention facilities.	true	['american airlines', 'family separation', 'immigration', 'southwest airlines', 'trump administration']	2018/06/20	David Emery	['https://www.azcentral.com/story/travel/arizona/2018/06/19/flight-attendant-migrant-children-phoenix-miami-american-airlines/706803002/', 'https://www.houstonchronicle.com/local/gray-matters/article/Flight-attendant-I-won-t-work-flights-that-13008372.php', 'http://archive.is/e6G6p', 'http://archive.is/B7HX8', 'https://www.swamedia.com/releases/release-63dd6d3a3fb0751687938f4889431349-keeping-families-connected', 'http://news.aa.com/news/news-details/2018/Statement-on-Recent-Reports-of-Separated-Families/default.aspx']	https://www.houstonchronicle.com/local/gray-matters/article/Flight-attendant-I-won-t-work-flights-that-13008372.php	https://www.houstonchronicle.com/	"For the past 29 years I have been a flight attendant for a major U.S. airline. Several weeks ago, I worked two flights (one to San Antonio and the other to McAllen) which proved to be two of the most disturbing flights I've ever experienced in my career.

On board these particular flights were ICE agents and migrant children (approximately four to eleven years old) who had been separated from their families and were being flown to a ""relocation"" site.

UPDATE: 2 airlines ask US not to put migrant children on flights

Since working the two flights, the images of those helpless children have burned into my psyche. The little children whose faces were full of fear, confusion, sadness and exhaustion left me somewhat traumatized as it occurred to me a few weeks later that I might as well have been a collaborator in their transport.

I can't help but think about their journey to their makeshift ""homes"" which, historically speaking reminds one of another group of people who were forced out of their homes and relocated to ghettos.

LATEST: Trump says he will put an end to family separations on border

As a result of what I witnessed, I have made a decision that if I'm ever assigned to a flight with children who've been separated from their families, I will immediately remove myself from the trip due to the nature of this unconscionable act by my government and my employer's complicity.

I have told my story to many of my flight attendant colleagues and they have pledged to do the same.

Since sharing my story, I learned from a fellow flight attendant that he was lied to by an ICE agent who said the children on the flight were part of a soccer team. When pressed, the agent finally admitted that they were, indeed children who were being relocated to assigned camps.

This inhumane separation of migrant children from their families is against the morals and principles instilled in me, as well as my religious and spiritual teachings.

EXPLAINER: Must immigrant parents, children be separated at the border?

This is not the American citizen that I was raised to be nor the one that I will embrace. What we are experiencing is painful, unnecessary and completely unacceptable and I feel somewhat ashamed that it took me this long to process these feelings. I keep kicking myself for not trusting my gut and walk off of both of those flights.

I will no longer be complicit and will walk away from any future flight assignments that try to make me a pawn for this disgusting and deplorable cause.

STARI rashes take many forms.

The rash of STARI is a red, expanding “bull’s-eye” lesion that develops around the site of a lone star tick bite. The rash usually appears within 7 days of tick bite and expands to a diameter of 8 centimeters (3 inches) or more. The rash should not be confused with much smaller areas of redness and discomfort that can occur commonly at the site of any tick bite. Patients may also experience fatigue, headache, fever, and muscle pains. The saliva from lone star ticks can be irritating; redness and discomfort at a bite site does not necessarily indicate an infection.

Diagnosis

STARI is diagnosed on the basis of symptoms, geographic location, and possibility of tick bite. Because the cause of STARI is unknown, no diagnostic blood tests have been developed. Researchers once hypothesized that STARI was caused by the spirochete, Borrelia lonestari; however, further research did not support this idea.External

Treatment

It is not known whether antibiotic treatment is necessary or beneficial for patients with STARI. Nevertheless, because STARI resembles early Lyme disease, physicians will often treat patients with oral antibiotics."

German State TV Series: “Lindenstraße” Episode 1084 “Islam”

Murat (Erkan Gündüz is surprised how much Lisa (Santje Peplow) is defending Islam

That little schmaltzy video was a scene from a German State TV series, broadcast in 2006, one year after Angela Merkel became chancellor, and when she was still pretending to be for Germany and a “Conservative”. Then she met Sorros [sic], Erdogan, Obama etc….and the rest, as they say, is history. The number of Muslims in Germany then was around 3.3 million. While exact statistics today seem unreliable, a conservative estimate of over 4.7 million Muslims as of 2015 is said to be conservative.

The series was called “Lindenstrasse” and the young woman who “converted” – or “reverted” as Muslims call it – played the role of a young mother, Lisa, engaged to a Turkish Muslim, Murat, who was working very hard to earn the money for the wedding. I watched that episode and a few that followed, until I came close to a saccharine overdose. You got a taste of it in the video above.

“This legislation was introduced by Representative Karen Bass. It’s a five-year reauthorization. The gentlelady from Texas who just spoke, [Rep. Sheila Jackson] Lee, did a lot of work on this bill in the Judiciary Committee as well. I thank her for her leadership in this effort.”“[Rep. Bass’] bill would improve on current law by expanding existing grants that make communities safer and protect vulnerable populations, including Native American women. Why wouldn’t we do that? I can’t think of a reason. It would also improve economic assistance and security for survivors struggling with unemployment or financial hardship due to the abusive relationship to which they had been exposed. It would also ensure that the Department of Justice’s Office of Violence Against Women remains open and is not merged into another office or de-emphasized. And very importantly, the bill closes loopholes in gun laws to help prevent intimate partner homicides, an all too frequent happening.""“According to the National Coalition Against Domestic Violence, on average, nearly 20 people every minute, 20 people every minute, are physically abused by an intimate partner in the United States. That is a tragedy and a crisis. One-in-four women experience severe intimate partner physical violence, and one-in-seven have been stalked by an intimate partner to the point at which she felt very fearful, or believed that she or someone close to her would be harmed or killed. The presence of a gun in a domestic violence situation increases the risk – hear me – increases the risk of homicide by 500%.”“That is why we aim to close gun loopholes by expanding the definition of intimate partners to include dating or former dating partners. It is also why this bill has language preventing anybody convicted of a misdemeanor crime of stalking from obtaining a gun.”“I am deeply disappointed that some Republican Members of this House are using the NRA as cover to vote against this reauthorization, which has been overwhelmingly in a bipartisan fashion reauthorized over and over again. These are commonsense protections that prevent domestic abusers from obtaining the guns that have sadly been used so frequently to harm or kill their partners.”“My colleagues, I urge every Member to vote for this reauthorization. Let's make this renewal of the Violence Against Women Act as strongly bipartisan as the House's support for the law used to be.”“Let's send a resounding message that the House stands with the victims, and survivors, and law enforcement and will do its job to help them and prevent domestic violence and abuse, which have no place in our society, but are tragically, too often, per minute, perpetrated in our country. Let's make it safer for women, for families, the children they care for. Let's pass this bill, let’s reauthorize the Violence Against Women Act.”"	Hoyer Floor Remarks on the Violence Against Women Act Reauthorization of 2019	2019-04-03 15:52:33-04:00	[]	['lets', 'floor', '2019', 'act', 'women', 'bill', 'minute', 'domestic', 'remarks', 'intimate', 'prevent', 'violence', 'hoyer', 'partner', 'reauthorization']	"It would also ensure that the Department of Justice’s Office of Violence Against Women remains open and is not merged into another office or de-emphasized.

Understanding internalised concentrations in the organism could further improve the risk assessment process. The present study is concerned with the determination of several contaminant classes (107 compounds) in Gammarus pulex collected from 15 sites covering 5 river catchments across Suffolk, UK. Quantitative method performance was acceptable for 67 compounds including pharmaceuticals, pesticides, illicit drugs and drugs of abuse. A total of 56 compounds were detectable and ranged from <LOQ to 45.3 ng g−1, with cocaine and lidocaine being the most frequently detected compounds present in all biota samples (n = 66). For surface water, 50 compounds were detectable and ranged from <LOQ to 382.2 ng L−1. Additionally, some pesticides currently not approved for use were detected, including fenuron that reached a maximum of 16.1 ng g−1. The internal concentrations of pesticides were used to estimate toxic pressure which showed that for the measured pesticides toxic pressure was low ranging from logTU ≤−7 to ≤−2. This methodology was extended to pharmaceuticals and drugs of abuse in a novel approach that proposed the use of pharmacological data (human therapeutic plasma concentrations) to estimate the likelihood of an effect (or effect pressure) to occur based on the internal exposure of the organism. The quantified effect pressure ranged from logEU ≤−9 to ≤1 with haloperidol showing the largest likelihood for an effect.

An independently organized TEDx event recently posted, and subsequently removed, a talk from the TEDx YouTube channel that the event organizer titled: “Why our perception of pedophilia has to change.”

After reviewing the talk, we believe it cites research in ways that are open to serious misinterpretation. This led some viewers to interpret the talk as an argument in favor of an illegal and harmful practice. TED would like to make clear that it does not promote pedophilia.

In the TEDx talk, a speaker described pedophilia as a condition some people are born with, and suggested that if we recognize it as such, we can do more to prevent those people from acting on their instincts and harming children. This field of science is developing, and the definition of the condition is just one of many points that are in debate across the global scientific community (and even in standard reference works).

While there is much debate around this field, scholars in the field are united in their wish to keep children from coming to harm — as the speaker makes clear in her own talk, saying “Let me be very clear here. Abusing children is wrong without any doubt.”

TEDx events are organized independently from the main annual TED conference, with some 3,500 events held every year in more than 100 countries. Our nonprofit TED organization does not control TEDx events’ content.

After contacting the local TEDx organizer to understand why the talk had been taken down, we learned that the speaker herself requested it be removed from the internet because she had concerns about her own safety.

Our policy is and always has been to remove speakers’ talks when they request we do so. That is why we support this TEDx organizer’s decision to respect this speaker’s wishes and keep the talk offline.

Original, posted June 19, 2018: An independently organized TEDx event recently posted, and subsequently removed, a talk from the TEDx YouTube channel that the event organizer had titled: “Why our perception of pedophilia has to change.”

We were not aware of this organizer’s actions, but understand now that their decision to remove the talk was at the speaker’s request for her safety.

In our review of the talk in question, we at TED believe it cites research open for serious misinterpretation.

TED does not support or advocate for pedophilia.

We are now reviewing the talk to determine how to move forward.

Until we can review this talk for potential harm to viewers, we are taking down any illegal copies of the talk posted on the Internet."

Older people who received transfusions of young blood plasma have shown improvements in biomarkers related to cancer, Alzheimer’s disease and heart disease, New Scientist has learned.

“I don’t want to say the word panacea, but here’s something about teenagers,” Jesse Karmazin, founder of startup Ambrosia, told New Scientist. “Whatever is in young blood is causing changes that appear to make the ageing process reverse.”

Since August 2016, Karmazin’s company has been transfusing people aged 35 and older with plasma – the liquid component of blood – taken from people aged between 16 and 25. So far, 70 people have been treated, all of whom paid Ambrosia to be included in the study.

Karmazin spoke to New Scientist ahead of presenting some of the results from the study at the Recode conference in Los Angeles today. These results come from blood tests conducted before and a month after plasma treatment, and imply young blood transfusions may reduce the risk of several major diseases associated with ageing.

Blood biomarkers

None of the people in the study had cancer at the time of treatment, however Karmazin’s team looked at the levels of certain proteins called carcinoembryonic antigens. These chemicals are found in the blood of healthy people at low concentrations, but in larger amounts these antigens can be a sign of having cancer.

The team detected that the levels of carcinoembryonic antigens fell by around 20 per cent in the blood of people who received the treatment. However, there was no control group or placebo treatment in the study, and it isn’t clear whether a 20 per cent reduction in these proteins is likely to affect someone’s chances of developing cancer.

Karmazin says the team also saw a 10 per cent fall in blood cholesterol levels. “That was a surprise,” he says. This may help explain why a study by a different company last year found that heart health improved in old mice that were given blood from human teenagers.

They also report a 20 per cent fall in the level of amyloids – a type of protein that forms sticky plaques in the brains of people with Alzheimer’s disease. One participant, a 55-year-old man with early onset Alzheimer’s, began to show improvements after one plasma treatment, and his doctors decided he could be allowed to drive a car again. An older woman with more advanced Alzheimer’s is reportedly showing slow improvements, but her results have not been as dramatic.

Reversing ageing

Instead of halting the ageing process, Karmazin says he thinks plasma transfusions actually reverse it. But if this is true, the effects don’t last forever. “Some people have felt great since they had the treatment 9 months ago,” he says. “Others have felt the effects wore off after a few months.”

Neither the intensity nor staying power of the treatment’s effects seemed to have any obvious relationship to the age of the people treated. “Whether you’re 40 or 80, the effect is really similar,” says Karmazin. “Ageing is just wear and tear.”

We all age at different rates, but Karmazin thinks that, on average, people will benefit most from receiving the treatment around twice a year. “We haven’t treated enough people to say with certainty.”

Many researchers are currently trying to chase down individual factors in the blood that may be responsible for any anti-ageing affects young blood may have. But Karmazin thinks the plasma’s rejuvenating properties come from the cumulative effects of many aspects of blood. “It’s not just one thing, there’s a lot going on.”

Placebo problems

The company’s trial has been criticised for having no placebo group. “There is no telling what may be down to the placebo effect,” says Arne Akbar at University College London.

The placebo effect is known to be able to influence biochemistry in the body. Because the treatment cost the participants $8000 each, it’s possible those involved would imagine any effects they felt to be bigger than they really were.

David Gems, also at University College London, would like to see more tests. “It would be best to be tested at several time intervals before and after the treatment, and ideally to have the tests done under similar conditions,” he says. “A single test before and after will be too anecdotal.”

Karmazin wants to do placebo-controlled studies, but it will be more difficult to fund these as people aren’t likely to pay thousands of dollars to possibly receive a sham treatment instead of young plasma."

SUMTER, S.C. — A judge threw out the conviction Wednesday of black teen executed 70 years ago for the deaths of two white girls.

George Stinney Jr., 14, was convicted of the grisly murders of Betty June Binnicker, 11, and Mary Emma Thames, 7, in Alcolu, S.C. The girls had disappeared in March 1944 while riding their bicycles, and their bludgeoned bodies were found in a watery ditch along a road in the town, about 70 miles north of Charleston.

After hours of questioning without his parents or a lawyer present, George confessed to the killings and had a daylong trial in which the all-white jury found him guilty after 10 minutes of deliberation.

The teen's supporters have said he was forced to confess. When George was sent to the electric chair in June 1944, he was the youngest person in the country ever executed.

He weighed less than 100 pounds.

The teen's prosecution had ""fundamental, constitutional violations of due process,"" Judge Carmen Mullen of South Carolina's 14th Judicial Circuit said in her ruling that stemmed from a two-day hearing in January. Her decision effectively exonerates the child.

During the January hearing, Mullen called the situation a tragedy but said the proceeding was not happening to determine the teen's guilt or innocence.

Many of the records in the case, including the confession, have been lost. In January, lawyers for the Stinney family argued in court that the verdict needed to be dismissed because of the prosecution's errors.

But the victims' relatives and Third Circuit Solictor Ernest ""Chip"" Finney argued that the previous ruling was fair and should stand.

Records from that era were poor and scant, Mullen said. A lack of any transcript made it difficult to sort through some of the key details in the case.

However, Mullen, who is white, thought George's confession was compromised. During the trial, psychologist Amanda Salas, a defense witness, said he likely confessed because of the power differential between a 14-year-old black male and the white, uniformed law-enforcement officers in a small, segregated town who were questioning him.

""Methods employed by law enforcement in their questioning of the defendant may have been unduly suggestive, unrestrained, and noncompliant with the standards of criminal procedure as required by the Fifth and 14th amendments,"" the judge wrote. ""We know that law enforcement separated the defendant from his parents and otherwise took advantage of his age and stature to garner a result they determined to be true and just.""

His lawyer apparently did little to defend him during the trial and asked few questions on cross examination, she wrote. And no effort was made to move the trial even though much of the town likely was angry because of the deaths and the jury likely was not impartial.

His sentencing to death at age 14 amounted to cruel and unusual punishment, Mullen wrote."

Not long ago, she appeared on a TV show that was associated with modern fashion, but even there the Trump effect took a place. When she was asked about Trump’s activities as leader of our nation and everything that happened in our country so far, she came up with something amazing:

“You DEMOCRATS scraping the bottom of the barrel to make our President Donald Trump look bad. If you just spend that time and effort to come up with a political solution our country would be a paradise.”

“Just leave him, he’s doing important changes to improve our country. We’ve never had a president like Trump and we will never have again in the future, so just respect his efforts for this nation!”

The Earth is not warming. The White Cliffs of Dover are tumbling into the sea and causing sea levels to rise. Global warming is helping grow the Antarctic ice sheet.

Those are some of the skeptical assertions echoed by Republicans on the House Science, Space and Technology Committee yesterday. The lawmakers at times embraced research that questions mainstream climate science during a hearing on how technology can be used to address global warming.

A leading climate scientist testifying before the panel spent much of the two hours correcting misstatements.

The purpose of the hearing was to focus on how technology could be deployed for climate change adaptation. But the hearing frequently turned to the basics of climate science. Many of the questions by Republicans and Democrats alike were directed to Philip Duffy, president of the Woods Hole Research Center in Massachusetts and former senior adviser to the U.S. Global Change Research Program.

Rep. Dana Rohrabacher (R-Calif.) said he was bothered that established climate science has not been questioned more by the committee, which has accused federal climate scientists of fraudulently manipulating climate data and subpoenaed their records.

""I'm a little bit disturbed by, No. 1, over and over again, I hear, 'Don't ever talk about whether mankind is the main cause of the temperature changing and the climate changing,'"" he said. ""That's a little disturbing to hear constantly beaten into our heads in a Science Committee meeting, when basically we should all be open to different points of view.""

Rep. Lamar Smith (R-Texas), chairman of the committee, entered into the record an opinion piece published in The Wall Street Journal yesterday that claimed sea levels are not rising because of climate change, a view that rejects thousands of scientific studies. The piece was written by Fred Singer, who is affiliated with the Heartland Institute, which promotes the rejection of mainstream climate science.

""To solve climate change challenges, we first need to acknowledge the uncertainties that exist,"" Smith said in his opening remarks. ""Then we can have confidence that innovations and technology will enable us to mitigate any adverse consequences of climate change.""

At one point, Smith showed a slide of two charts that he said demonstrated how the rate of sea-level rise does not equal the sharp spike in the consumption of fossil fuels. When Smith pointed out that rates of sea-level rise have only increased slightly compared with the rate of fossil fuel use, Duffy pointed out that his chart was from a single tide gauge station, near San Francisco, and that sea levels rise at different rates around the world. Smith did not show rising atmospheric CO2 levels or temperatures, both of which have climbed steadily in recent decades as emissions have increased.

""The rate of global sea-level rise has accelerated and is now four times faster than it was 100 years ago,"" Duffy told Smith in response to the charts.

""Is this chart inaccurate, then?"" Smith asked.

""It's accurate, but it doesn't represent what's happening globally; it represents what's happening in San Francisco,"" Duffy said.

Rep. Mo Brooks (R-Ala.) questioned Duffy on the factors that contribute to sea-level rise, pointing out that land subsidence plays a role, as well as human activity.

Brooks then said that erosion plays a significant role in sea-level rise, which is not an idea embraced by mainstream climate researchers. He said the California coastline and the White Cliffs of Dover tumble into the sea every year, and that contributes to sea-level rise. He also said that silt washing into the ocean from the world's major rivers, including the Mississippi, the Amazon and the Nile, is contributing to sea-level rise.

""Every time you have that soil or rock or whatever it is that is deposited into the seas, that forces the sea levels to rise, because now you have less space in those oceans, because the bottom is moving up,"" Brooks said.

Duffy responded: ""I'm pretty sure that on human time scales, those are minuscule effects.""

Brooks added that Antarctic ice is growing. That was true a few years ago, and scientists say it does not disprove the theory of global warming because different factors affect the Arctic and Antarctic rates of melting.

""We have satellite records clearly documenting a shrinkage of the Antarctic ice sheet and an acceleration of that shrinkage,"" Duffy said.

""I'm sorry, but I don't know where you're getting your information, but the data I have seen suggests — "" Brooks said.

Duffy answered: ""The National Snow and Ice Data Center and the National Aeronautics and Space Administration.""

""Well, I've got a NASA base in my district, and apparently, they're telling you one thing and me a different thing,"" Brooks said. ""But there are plenty of studies that have come that show with respect to Antarctica that the total ice sheet, particularly that above land, is increasing, not decreasing. Now, you could make a different argument if you want to talk about Greenland or the Arctic.""

Earlier this year, NASA researchers determined that Antarctica's ice loss has accelerated in the last decade. More broadly, sea ice extent at both poles set a record low last year. Scientists are racing to better understand the changes occurring in Antarctica because much of its ice is land-based, meaning it could drive sea-level rise around the world as it melts.

Rep. Bill Posey (R-Fla.) said scientists said in the 1970s that the Earth was cooling, a popular talking point of climate skeptics and the subject of a fake Time magazine cover that has become a meme. Duffy corrected him and said that was essentially an outlier position at the time and that scientists long ago determined that humans were warming the planet.

Posey also asked how carbon dioxide could be captured in permafrost in the periods before humans existed. Duffy told him that it was from non-decayed organic matter. Human activity is now causing the Arctic to warm and thaw the ground, releasing the carbon into the atmosphere, Duffy said.

Posey then asked about theories related to warming being beneficial for habitats and to people.

""What do you say to people who theorize that the Earth as it continues to warm is returning to its normal temperature?"" Posey asked.

""Look, if you want to characterize a temperature above today's temperature as normal, you're free to do that, but that doesn't mean that's a planet we want to live on,"" Duffy said.

""I don't want to get philosophical; I'm trying to stay on science here,"" Posey said.

""I'm not getting philosophical; I'm getting extremely practical,"" Duffy said. ""I'm being extremely practical — if we let the planet warm 2 or 3 degrees, we will have tens of meters of sea-level rise, and the community where I live will essentially cease to exist.""

Posey responded: ""I don't think anybody disputes that the Earth is getting warmer; I think what's not clear is the exact amount of who caused what, and getting to that is, I think, where we're trying to go with this committee.""

Consumer products, medicines and drugs can end up in rivers after use and comprise thousands of different chemicals which have the potential to cause environmental harm. The team collected samples from five catchment areas, and 15 different sites across the county of Suffolk. Surprisingly, cocaine was found in all samples tested, and other illicit drugs such as ketamine, pesticides and pharmaceuticals were also widespread in the shrimp that were collected.

Lead author, Dr Thomas Miller from King’s said: “Although concentrations were low, we were able to identify compounds that might be of concern to the environment and crucially, which might pose a risk to wildlife.

“As part of our ongoing work, we found that the most frequently detected compounds were illicit drugs, including cocaine and ketamine and a banned pesticide, fenuron. Although for many of these, the potential for any effect is likely to be low.”

Professor Nic Bury from the University of Suffolk said: “Whether the presence of cocaine in aquatic animals is an issue for Suffolk, or more widespread an occurrence in the UK and abroad, awaits further research. Environmental health has attracted much attention from the public due to challenges associated with climate change and microplastic pollution. However, the impact of ‘invisible’ chemical pollution (such as drugs) on wildlife health needs more focus in the UK as policy can often be informed by studies such as these.”

Dr Leon Barron from King’s added: “Such regular occurrence of illicit drugs in wildlife was surprising. We might expect to see these in urban areas such as London, but not in smaller and more rural catchments. The presence of pesticides which have long been banned in the UK also poses a particular challenge as the sources of these remain unclear.”

By Jim Kouri A recent poll conducted by the National Association of Chiefs of Police indicated that almost 64 percent of police commanders and sheriffs favor a law allowing private citizens to carry concealed firearms for protection. Almost 73 percent said that citizens should not be restricted from purchasing more than one weapon, and 96 percent say they believe criminals obtain firearms from illegal sources.Unfortunately most states — especially those called Blue States due to their Liberal-leanings — continue to prohibit private citizens from carrying concealed handguns.At the same time, there are outspoken opponents of gun ownership, such as Senators Chuck Schumer (D-NY) and Diane Feinstein (D-CA), who are carrying concealed weapons, according to WABC Radio's Mark Levin. Levin, a recognized constitutional expert, heads the Landmark Legal Foundation. The LLF's goal is to protect American's from unreasonable and illegal government intrusions and violations of the US Constitution, including the Second Amendment.The mainstream news media have been aware that several antigun proponents are carrying concealed firearms but have failed to expose this hypocrisy. This writer's efforts to discover how many other anti-gunners are also packing heat — a right they wish to deny other citizens — met with limited results.Not only does Schumer carry a handgun, the New York City Police Department also provides armed escorts for the good senator. In fact, the Government Accounting Office — the investigative arm of the US Congress — slammed Schumer's use of police resources for personal protection. It's clear that Schumer believes he's special. He wishes to ban private citizens' ownership of firearms, while he enjoys layers of protection.""No wonder Chuckie Schumer shoots his mouth off so much — he's able to protect himself,"" says a 25-year police veteran.Also, a check of Pistol License records shows that Senator Schumer possesses an ""unrestricted"" pistol permit, a rarity in New York City. Licenses are distributed in different categories in the Big Apple: Target Permits allow only use of a firearm at a licensed firing range; Premises Permits allow weapons to be kept in a home or apartment; Restricted Permits allow the gunowner to carry their firearms concealed but only within the purview of their job (security, jewelers, armored car guards, etc.). So it's evident that Senator Schumer has two sets of rules — one for Americans and one for himself.And then we have Senator Diane Feinstein on the Left Coast who possesses something more rare than a conservative Republican in San Francisco — an unrestricted concealed weapons permit. Apparently without shame, she participated in a citywide gun turn-in program that was intended to create some kind of statue from the donated guns that were to be melted down. One of her police body guards let it slip that she contributed a cheap model for the meltdown, while retaining her .357 magnum revolver for her own personal self-defense.Hypocrisy is not limited to politicians when it comes to the Second Amendment. For Example, well-known Washington-based columnist, Carl Rowan, often wrote about the ills of firearms ownership. Until, that is, he shot and wounded a teenager who trespassed on his property. The white teenaged boy claimed he wanted to try Rowan's swimming pool. Rowan, an African-American, retaliated with deadly force using a firearm. That's when the news came out that Carl Rowan, gun-control advocate, actually possessed a license to own firearms.Another example is the loudmouth entertainer, Rosie O'Donnell, who once ran roughshod over conservative actor Tom Selleck because of his stance supporting the Second Amendment. Although Ms. O'Donnell doesn't carry a gun, she has three armed bodyguards who protect her, her wife and her children, something the vast majority of hardworking Americans could never afford. Isn't it comforting to know all these Liberals are looking out for us?© Jim Kouri"	Second Amendment hypocrites: Senators Schumer and Feinstein pack heat		[]	['feinstein', 'carry', 'amendment', 'protect', 'senator', 'schumer', 'weapons', 'citizens', 'firearms', 'rowan', 'second', 'concealed', 'pack', 'hypocrites', 'heat', 'senators']	"Second Amendment hypocrites: Senators Schumer and Feinstein pack heatBy Jim Kouri A recent poll conducted by the National Association of Chiefs of Police indicated that almost 64 percent of police commanders and sheriffs favor a law allowing private citizens to carry concealed firearms for protection.

But 17-year-old Noa Pothoven's tragic story of sexual assault and subsequent mental health problems did not come to an end with the state permitting a doctor to kill her—despite what many in English-language media have reported.

Pothoven did indeed apply with a clinic for The Netherlands' legal euthanasia process, but physicians reportedly denied her request, saying she was too young, her brain was not fully developed yet, and she should try more trauma treatment first.

Her recent death came after a long struggle with anorexia and depression, in which the teen ultimately refused to consume food, water, or anything to keep her alive.

News of this tragedy reached international audiences via a flurry of media reports that implied or outright said that the state had officially granted Pothoven's euthanasia application. But initial reports in Dutch media said no such thing, as POLITICO Europe reporter Naomi O'Leary was the first to point out.

Outlets such as The Daily Mail (London), The Daily Beast, and EuroNews ""are all wrong,"" tweeted O'Leary. On Wednesday morning ""It took me about 10 mins to check with the reporter who wrote the original Dutch story.""

Infuriatingly, it's too late: this misinformation has already spread all over the world from Australia to the United States to India. Her name, #noapothoven is even trending in Italy. pic.twitter.com/CN22J7xdkK — Naomi O'Leary (@NaomiOhReally) June 5, 2019

The Dutch reporter, Paul Bolwerk of De Gelderlander, wrote in a lengthy 2018 profile of Pothoven that she had previously requested legal euthanasia without her parents' knowledge but was turned down. Many on social media have been shaming the parents for allegedly ""allowing"" her to go through state-sanctioned assisted suicide; they did no such thing.

Hurling insults at Pothoven's poor parents is only one strain of the strange moral panic and tribal vitriol that this story quickly spawned.

Conservative writer David Marcus suggested the story was emblematic of the divide between newly popular Catholic theocrats and more traditional conservatives like David French, positing both that the very pro-life French and others like him would roll over for pro-teen euthanasia policies in America and that this will likely be on the liberal agenda soon.

Not only is that all bizarre and unlikely, it bears no relation to what actually happened in this extremely sad story that everyone wants to paint their culture war all over.

As Bolwerk's original story noted, and O'Leary summarized: ""The family had tried many kinds of psychiatric treatment and Noa Pothoven was repeatedly hospitalised; she made a series of attempts to kill herself in recent months. In desperation the family sought electro shocktherapy, which was refused due to her young age.""

Pothoven—who had been sexually assaulted as an 11- and 14-year-old and wrote a book about her struggles afterward—was set up with in-home care but, at the beginning of this month, began to refuse all food and fluids. After watching her struggle and trying so many different options for years (""we have tried everything,"" they told Bolwerk), her parents made what was surely a heart-wrenching decision not to keep her alive through force-feeding.

Decisions like these have long been controversial, and surely many will still disagree with (but can hopefully find compassion for) her parents and doctors in this situation. But as O'Leary pointed out, ""a decision to move to palliative care and not to force feed at the request of the patient is not euthanasia. Dutch media did not report Noa Pothoven's death as a case of euthanasia. This idea only appeared in English language pickups of Dutch reporting.""

How much privacy can we rightfully expect? Writer and Reason contributor Cathy Young asks an interesting question about media versus social media culture and the expectations of online activists and content creators.

Here's a question: Do you have a right to be an online activist and maintain anonymity? My inclination would be to say no. You participate in public life, your identity is fair game. In this case, I'm not sure what the guy was doing counts as ""public life."" — Cathy Young (@CathyYoung63) June 5, 2019

the global sea ice represents very well the state of the global climate, in the long run a warmer climate will lead to less to zero ice ( around the year ) and a cooler climate will lead to an ice age with a third of the planet covered by ice. in this context it think that global sea-ice is indeed the right long-term indicator when it comes to the state of the planet and the differences you mentioned are more of a different way how that shows short term.the reason why i predicted for years that there will be a mid-long-term turnaround in the antarctic as well is simply due to the fact that if the planet will be 5C warmer there will be no more sea ice in summer on both sides and once the land ice masses will be heavily reduced, also on both ends, even though that may take centuries if not millenia to get down to zero or close to zero as it has been in the past and who knows what kind of events will happen in the mean time.i say global sea-ice VOLUME is the ultimate way to measure what's happening long term, short term outliers to both sides on both ends are hype and have to be interpreted with care.again this is more as an add on to your post because as i know form many of your posts i agree to your general way to see things and very much appreciate your well founded contributions :-)cheers"	2016 sea ice area and extent data		[]	['antarctic', 'extent', '2016', 'way', 'area', 'ice', 'climate', 'arctic', 'sea', 'global', 'zero', 'data', 'planet', 'warming']	"The global sea ice anomaly is shocking.

Colorado ––(Ammoland.com)- Word of gun owners’ victory at the Iowa Straw Poll is spreading.

Even one of America’s premier political news sites, Politico.com, has picked up the story about how National Association for Gun Rights members just like you toppled Tim Pawlenty’s Presidential campaign.

The article even noted my subsequent call for NAGR members to lobby Governor Rick Perry to return the National Association for Gun Rights Presidential Candidate Survey.

However, Politco.com writer Maggie Haberman missed the mark when she noted that Perry has a concealed carry permit by assuming he must be pro-gun because he has a concealed weapon permit.

The Washington, D.C. elites just don’t get it. They think that simply having a concealed weapon permit automatically makes any politician pro-gun.

Do you think California Democrat Senator Barbara Boxer is pro-gun? No, I don’t think so, either.

But Barbara Boxer used her influence to secure an elusive concealed carry permit from California.

I can almost hear her trying to deceive gun owners… “Trust me, I have a permit.”

Or how about New York Democrat Senator Chuck Schumer?

Schumer himself is reported to possess a New York concealed handgun permit, and both U.S. Senators regularly employed armed guards for their personal protection.

Just because a politician recognizes that being armed makes THEM safer, doesn’t mean they support YOUR right to keep and bear arms. They think they’re different than you and me, that because of their title they’re entitled to MORE rights than we are.

The Second Amendment is about much more than just carrying concealed… or hunting… or sport shooting.

Your right to keep and bear arms is a bulwark against tyranny.

That’s why the National Association for Gun Rights sends Presidential Candidate Surveys to politicians like Tim Pawlenty and Governor Rick Perry.

Gun owners MUST know where they stand on important issues like banning magazine or bans on certain types of semi-automatic rifles, or opposing the United Nations’ Small Arms Treaty gun-grab.

Please call Rick Perry’s campaign RIGHT NOW at (858) 483-4300 and demand that he return the National Association for Gun Rights Presidential Candidate Survey.

I hope you’ll also take a moment and re-read my article about how AmmoLand readers like you toppled Tim Pawlenty’s Presidential aspirations.

https://www.snopes.com/fact-check/new-jersey-gun-confiscation/	the state of new jersey is currently conducting, or plans to conduct, house-to-house confiscations of banned high-capacity gun magazines.	false	['gun control']	2018/12/28	David Emery	['https://archive.li/zv3BU', 'https://www.ammoland.com/2018/12/new-jersey-magazine-ban-goes-into-effect/', 'http://archive.is/qZVwX', 'https://t.co/n73IPjRXHW', 'https://archive.is/dO0jJ', 'http://archive.li/qj3Xi', 'http://archive.is/5Bi3t']	https://www.ammoland.com/2018/12/new-jersey-magazine-ban-goes-into-effect/	https://www.ammoland.com/	"Opinion

Over one million New Jersey Gun owners defy Governor Murphy's gun magazine ban & turn in demands of what some estimate is easily more than ten million now illegal standard capacity gun mags.

New Jersey –-(Ammoland.com)- New Jersey's standard capacity magazine ban is now in effect making New Jersey's one million gun owners criminals in the eyes of the state. But in an act of mass definace, New Jersey residents refuse to comply.

Any magazine holding more than ten rounds is now illegal in the Garden State. The standard magazine for an AR-15 holds 30 rounds. Glock 19s, which is the most popular pistol in the United States, holds 15 rounds. Anyone who is possession of larger magazine is committing a fourth-degree felony.

Anyone caught with one of the now banned magazines in their possession faces up to 18 months in prison and up to $10,000 in fines or both for each magazine found.

The bill was signed into law last June by Gov. Phil Murphy (D). Residents had until December 11th, 2018, to turn over magazines to police or sell or store them out of state.

Pro-gun groups sued New Jersey to try to prevent the law from going into effect. Their attempt on blocking the law failed in a federal appeals court. The three-judge panel ruled that a law limiting the number of rounds a magazine holds did not violate the US Constitution and did not put an undue burden on New Jersey gun owners.

“New Jersey’s law reasonably fits the State’s interest in public safety and does not unconstitutionally burden the Second Amendment’s right to self-defense in the home,” the court wrote in their decision. “The law also does not violate the Fifth Amendment’s Takings Clause because it does not require gun owners to surrender their magazines but instead allows them to retain modified magazines or register firearms that have magazines that cannot be modified.” AG Gurbir Grewal applauded the ruling on Twitter stating: “This just in: for months, individuals have been challenging NJ’s limits on large capacity magazines—a sensible law to address mass shootings. Today, the court of appeals upheld the law. Big win for public safety and law enforcement safety!”

Residents of New Jersey on various message boards have called the magazine ban unenforceable. Some were going as far as laughing at Gov. Murphy and his attempt at regulating magazine size.

New Jersey is not saying how they plan to enforce the ban on standard capacity magazines. Gov. Murphy's office referred AmmoLand to the New Jersey Attorney General's office. The AG's office refused to comment.

Sharon Lauchaire, Director of Communications for the Office the Attorney General told AmmoLand: “We do not discuss law enforcement strategies.”

AmmoLand's sources within the New Jersey State Police that spoke on a condition of anonymity stated that they had not received any guidance on how to enforce the ban from the AG’s office. They said that there is currently no plan to investigate gun owners suspected of having the now banned magazines.

According to the source, the plan that has been discussed among officers is only to file charges against people who are guilty of other crimes. This plan might change once superiors give guidance on how to enforce the ban.

AmmoLand reached out to several local police departments in New Jersey to see how they plan on enforcing the ban and what the turn in numbers have been? Much like the New Jersey State Police, none of these departments have a concrete plan on how to proactively enforce the ban and none had a single report of magazines turned over.

From all Reports, NO Mags Turned In, Governor Murphy & His Law are Joke

AmmoLand also asked the Governor's office what Gov. Murphy thinks of users on the internet saying that the ban is unenforceable and laughing at the Governor's attempt at regulating magazine sizes.

Gov. Murphy and his office refused to comment on these gun owner's opinions.

AmmoLand also asked Gov. Murphy's office about the number of magazines turned in by New Jersey residents. Once again AmmoLand was referred to the New Jersey Attorney General's office.

In this case, Lauchaire would not offer a comment and referred AmmoLand to the New Jersey State Police. Lauchaire stated she was aware of AmmoLand's previous inquire to the State Police on the number of magazines turned in meaning that State Police contacted the AG’s office about our request for information.

The New Jersey State Police have not officially responded to our request on the number of magazines that were turned over by citizens.

Two sources from within the State Police, who spoke to AmmoLand on condition of anonymity, told AmmoLand News that they both do not know of any magazines turned over to their agency and doubted that any were turned in. They also stated that the State Police also engaged the AG's office for guidance on how to respond to inquiries such as ours. They were unaware if the Attorney General has returned to their request for guidance.

All the local police departments that AmmoLand contacted stated that they have not had any magazines turned into them.

AmmoLand has filed a Freedom of Information Act request with The New Jersey State Police to get an official count of the number of magazines turned in by New Jersey citizens. We will update the story if our FOIA request is fulfilled.

To our south, Antarctica has also just broken a new climate record, with record low winter sea ice. After a peak of 18.5 million square kilometres in late August, sea ice began retreating about a month ahead of schedule and has been setting daily low records through most of September.

It may not seem unusual in a warming world to hear that Antarctica’s sea ice – the ice that forms each winter as the surface layer of the ocean freezes – is reducing. But this year’s record low comes hot on the heels of record high sea ice just two years ago. Overall, Antarctica’s sea ice has been growing, not shrinking.

So how should we interpret this apparent backflip? In our paper published today in Nature Climate Change we review the latest science on Antarctica’s climate, and why it seems so confusing.

NASA, Author provided

Antarctic surprises

First up, Antarctic climate records are seriously short.

The International Geophysical Year in 1957/58 marked the start of many sustained scientific efforts in Antarctica, including regular weather readings at research bases. These bases are mostly found on the more accessible parts of Antarctica’s coast, and so the network – while incredibly valuable – leaves vast areas of the continent and surrounding oceans without any data.

In the end, it took the arrival of satellite monitoring in the 1979 to deliver surface climate information covering all of Antarctica and the Southern Ocean. What scientists have observed since has been surprising.

Overall, Antarctica’s sea ice zone has expanded. This is most notable in the Ross Sea, and has brought increasing challenges for ship-based access to Antarctica’s coastal research stations. Even with the record low in Antarctic sea ice this year, the overall trend since 1979 is still towards sea ice expansion.

The surface ocean around Antarctica has also mostly been cooling. This cooling masks a much more ominous change deeper down in the ocean, particularly near the West Antarctic Ice Sheet and the Totten glacier in East Antarctica. In these regions, worrying rates of subsurface ocean warming have been detected up against the base of ice sheets. There are real fears that subsurface melting could destabilise ice sheets, accelerating future global sea level rise.

In the atmosphere we see that some parts of the Antarctic Peninsula and West Antarctica are experiencing rapid warming, despite average Antarctic temperatures not changing that much yet.

In a rapidly warming world these Antarctic climate trends are – at face value – counterintuitive. They also go against many of our climate model simulations, which, for example, predict that Antarctica’s sea ice should be in decline.

Jan Lieser , Author provided

Winds of change

The problem we face in Antarctica is that the climate varies hugely from year to year, as typified by the enormous swing in Antarctica sea ice over the past two years.

This means 37 years of Antarctic surface measurements are simply not enough to detect the signal of human-caused climate change. Climate models tell us we may need to monitor Antarctica closely until 2100 before we can confidently identify the expected long-term decline of Antarctica’s sea ice.

In short, Antarctica’s climate remains a puzzle, and we are currently trying to see the picture with most of the pieces still missing.

But one piece of the puzzle is clear. Across all lines of evidence a picture of dramatically changing Southern Ocean westerly winds has emerged. Rising greenhouse gases and ozone depletion are forcing the westerlies closer to Antarctica, and robbing southern parts of Australia of vital winter rain.

The changing westerlies may also help explain the seemingly unusual changes happening elsewhere in Antarctica.

The expansion of sea ice, particularly in the Ross Sea, may be due to the strengthened westerlies pushing colder Antarctic surface water northwards. And stronger westerlies may isolate Antarctica from the warmer subtropics, inhibiting continent-scale warming. These plausible explanations remain difficult to prove with the records currently available to scientists.

Australia’s unique climate position

The combination of Antarctica’s dynamic climate system, its short observational records, and its potential to cause costly heatwaves, drought and sea-level rise in Australia, mean that we can’t afford to stifle fundamental research in our own backyard.

Our efforts to better understand, measure and predict Antarctic climate were threatened this year by funding cuts to Australia’s iconic climate research facilities at the CSIRO. CSIRO has provided the backbone of Australia’s Southern Ocean measurements. As our new paper shows, the job is far from done.

A recent move to close Macquarie Island research station to year-round personnel would also have seriously impacted the continuity of weather observations in a region where our records are still far too short. Thankfully, this decision has since been reversed.

But it isn’t all bad news. In 2016, the federal government announced new long-term funding in Antarctic logistics, arresting the persistent decline in funding of Antarctic and Southern Ocean research.

The nearly A$2 billion in new investment includes a new Australian icebreaking ship to replace the ageing Aurora Australis. This will bring a greater capacity for Southern Ocean research and the capability to push further into Antarctica’s sea ice zone.

Whatever the long-term trends in sea ice hold it is certain that the large year-to-year swings of Antarctica’s climate will continue to make this a challenging but critical environment for research."

According to the club's manager, Stacey Saccal, Sayoc had worked as a DJ for the past two months. She had received no complaints about him from other staff members and he seemed like a ""nice guy.""

""I never knew that his van was covered in political stickers. I thought it was an ice cream truck,"" Saccal told WPTV, noting that he parked far from the club.

Saccal also said her employees had no idea that Sayoc was political. He never talked about politics at work and no one noticed the stickers on his van because of how far away he parked when he had a shift.

Fellow DJ Scott Migs said Sayoc brought two duffle bags and a cooler to work with him on Thursday night. He stashed them behind the DJ booth. Migs said he's unsure if any weapons were in the duffle bags.

According to Saccal, employees were shocked when they learned about Sayoc's actions. Everyone felt he was a nice guy and they all thought they knew him.

Stormy Daniels performed at the same strip club back in April, which just so happened to coincide with President Donald Trump's visit. Interestingly enough, this strip club sits across the street from Trump's golf course.

My story:

Due to reasons you will come to understand as you read on I cannot reveal my identity at this time. Some months ago while trekking through a mountain range on an amateur photo shoot during my holidays, my attention was taken by a glint of light from under a shrub. I discovered it was the suns reflection off a piece of broken glass.

PHOTO

glass lens

By the curved polished surface on one side I thought it might have been from some type of magnifying lens. I rummaged around under the shrub wondering if someone had dropped their binoculars, but instead, to my surprise I found a badly damaged camera lens. I looked at the piece of glass in my hand. It was a fragment from the shattered lens. Beyond the shrub was a stony terrain that lead to the rock face of a sheer cliff towering high above the area. I spotted some other parts of the lens scattered between the rocks. Then I found the main body of the camera. It was an Olympus OM40 SLR, which was in production during the early eighties. The entire camera was smashed and covered in a silvery soot-like powder, as if it had been thrown onto a fire. Yet, on closer inspection, there was some oxidization on parts of the exposed metal casing. It had obviously been there for quite some time.

scorched camera PHOTO

Back of camera

My first thought was that someone must have dropped the camera from the top of the cliff causing it to shatter on the rocks below, and that there must have been a raging fire through the valley at some stage. Taking a closer look at my surroundings there were no signs of recent fires. Had someone tried to destroy the camera by burning it? When I sniffed the soot it had a pungent explosives-like smell to it. I turned it over and wiped the film cartridge display window. The hair on the back of my neck stood on end. There was still film in the camera.



It was late evening by the time I arrived home some days later. I'd been having mysterious dreams about the camera every night since I found it. Overwhelmed with curiosity and excited anticipation, I immediately took the camera to my darkroom. I had to pry the back open with a screwdriver as the plastic section of the outer casing had melted then solidified over the cover. Most of the film was badly damaged, parts of it having disintegrated due to extreme heat. I developed the strips of film that were salvageable. Nearly all of the negatives were color distorted. The images on the film sent chills down my spine. When I finally developed the photos and blew them up, I couldn't believe what I was seeing. It made me wonder what the hell was about to happen on the planet!

At 8:00 am on March 12, the Los Angeles Fire Department responded to “a medical request” at the Los Angeles home of Anderson. She had apparently collapsed in a bathroom. Firefighters attended to Anderson on the scene before transporting her to Cedars-Sinai Medical Center, where she was admitted with complications attributed to Hepatitis C. According to Chief Coroner Jonathan Lucas M.D., during the course of her treatment Anderson developed pneumonia and died at 10:04 this morning after going into cardiac arrest.

Anderson, a Canadian American actress and model, is best known for her roles on the television series Home Improvement, Baywatch and V.I.P. after rising to fame as Playmate of the Month for Playboy magazine in February 1990.

Anderson appeared as the cover girl on Playboy magazine’s October 1989 issue. She moved to Los Angeles to further pursue a modeling career. Playboy subsequently chose her as Playmate of the Month in their February 1990 issue, in which she appeared in the centerfold photo. Anderson has since appeared in Playboy several times in the 1990s and the 2000s.

Anderson’s Playboy career spans 22 years, and she has appeared on more Playboy covers than any other model.

After Anderson moved to Los Angeles, she won a minor role as Lisa, the original “Tool Time girl”, on the ABC comedy series Home Improvement. She left the show after two seasons and won the role of C. J. Parker on Baywatch, whom she played for five seasons between 1992 and 1997 making her one of the longest-serving cast members. This has been one of her best-known roles to date and has gained her a lot of popularity from international viewers. She reprised her role in a reunion movie, Baywatch: Hawaiian Wedding(2003), and also to star in commercials for DirecTV in 2007."

There is a certain sort of used clothing shop that has been booming in recent years.

The shop is one room in an apartment. There are two display cases, one on each side of the room, facing each other. There are mountains of underwear in every color. You begin to notice the 'abnormality' of the place. This is not a department where beautiful lingerie is sold. These items are all stained and soiled. In other words, they are used. Uniforms from famous middle and high school girls' schools are also on display. They are also dingy. This is place that sells items that should have been thrown away or sent to the cleaners.

Shorts (bloomers) which are used in physical education classes (known as Buruma in Japan), school uniforms, and sailor or middy clothes (known as sera) are in these stores. As a result these stores have come to be known as buru-sera shops.

The sellers are just common middle school and high school girls. They stop by on their way home, looking for a little pocket money. Some take out sundry items from their bags, while others take off their underwear on the spot. The clerks then check the amount of soiling and price them accordingly. Among other considerations are smell, and these items are ranked such as 'three day items,' 'one week items,' etc... An appropriate amount of residue of menstrual blood or excrement brings particularly high prices.

In the case of underwear 2000 yen ($20) is the general price. If there is a photo of the girl attached the price can more than double. The 'sailor' clothes are more expensive if they are from a school that is well known or from an 'uptown' girls school. There are some maniacs who will pay any price for a uniform from the Princess' home school.

The girls who come to sell are happy go lucky. ""We just want money. This is an easy way to get it and it's better than working part time.""

There is a never ending flow of white collar workers in their twenties and thirties and college students coming in to buy these unusual items.

The girls who come in to sell are not from poor families; on the contrary, they are from established households. It must be said that the monetary values of these ""neo-yamatonadeshiko"" (daughters of Japan) are severely warped. They have never had to endure anything and the carefree atmosphere has removed the boundaries of common sense. ""Get money. Have fun. What's wrong with that?"" is how it goes. This is the kind of value that is common to present day Japan.

The girls sell their bodies to get brand name items and have fun. ""Matter"" has overtaken ""Soul."" To state it plainly, this is bartering between bodies (matter) and brand name items (matter). There are such markets all over the place. They can sell their bodies as well as their underwear.

It goes without saying that the parents and adults who cannot say, ""Cut out this foolishness!"" are equally guilty. No one wants to think that selling underwear leads directly to prostitution. But the middle school girls in prostitution say, ""I'm not doing anything wrong. I'm keeping it a secret from my parents, but I'm not harming anyone.""

According to analysis by psychiatrists, the men who steal or buy or wear women's underwear view the underwear as a substitute for female genitals. This points to a lack of erotic communication between the sexes. There is also a great problem in the sudden increase in adults who buy this underwear and the sexual services of young girls.

Sexual perversion is related to the form of society. What must be pointed out is that there is something fundamentally wrong with this nation when 'buru-sera' shops flourish and 'neo-yamatondeshiko' are allowed to sell themselves without comment from their parents or older. It is a bartering session, one without a soul.

Lemming Suicide Myth

Disney Film Faked Bogus Behavior

By Riley Woodford

Lemmings do not commit mass suicide. It's a myth, but it's remarkable how many people believe it. Ask a few.

""It's a complete urban legend,"" said state wildlife biologist Thomas McDonough. ""I think it blew out of proportion based on a Disney documentary in the '50s, and that brought it to the mainstream.""

Lemmings are a kind of short tailed vole, a mouse-like rodent that favors tundra and open grasslands. Three kinds are found in Alaska, including the collared lemming, the only rodent that turns white in winter.

In 1958 Walt Disney produced ""White Wilderness,"" part of the studio's ""True Life Adventure"" series. ""White Wilderness"" featured a segment on lemmings, detailing their strange compulsion to commit mass suicide.

According to a 1983 investigation by Canadian Broadcasting Corporation producer Brian Vallee, the lemming scenes were faked. The lemmings supposedly committing mass suicide by leaping into the ocean were actually thrown off a cliff by the Disney filmmakers. The epic ""lemming migration"" was staged using careful editing, tight camera angles and a few dozen lemmings running on snow covered lazy-Susan style turntable.

""White Wilderness"" was filmed in Alberta, Canada, a landlocked province, and not on location in lemmings' natural habitat. There are about 20 lemming species found in the circumpolar north - but evidently not in that area of Alberta. So the Disney people bought lemmings from Inuit children a couple provinces away in Manitoba and staged the whole sequence.

In the lemming segment, the little rodents assemble for a mass migration, scamper across the tundra and ford a tiny stream as narrator Winston Hibbler explains that, ""A kind of compulsion seizes each tiny rodent and, carried along by an unreasoning hysteria, each falls into step for a march that will take them to a strange destiny.""

That destiny is to jump into the ocean. As they approach the ""sea,"" (actually a river -more tight cropping) Hibbler continues, ""They've become victims of an obsession -- a one-track thought: Move on! Move on!""

The ""pack of lemmings"" reaches the final precipice. ""This is the last chance to turn back,"" Hibbler states. ""Yet over they go, casting themselves out bodily into space.""

Life-loving lemming: lemmings do not commit mass suicide, although in lean times they may become cannibalistic. These mouse-like rodents are found in Alaska and in northern countries around the world, mostly favoring tundra and open grassland.

Lemmings are seen flying into the water. The final shot shows the sea awash with dying lemmings.

Certainly, some scenes in nature documentaries are staged. In Sir David Attenborough's recent documentary, ""The Life of Birds,"" the close-up footage of a flying duck, filmed razor-sharp from the bird's wingtip, was shot from a car using a mallard drake trained to fly alongside the car. But faking an entirely mythical event is something else.

""Disney had to have gotten that idea from somewhere,"" said Thomas McDonough, the state wildlife biologist. Disney likely confused dispersal with migration, he added, and embellished a kernel of truth.

Lemming populations fluctuate enormously based on predators, food, climate and other factors. Under ideal conditions, in a single year a population of voles can increase by a factor of ten. When they've exhausted the local food supply, they disperse, as do moose, beaver and many other animals.

Lemmings can swim and will cross bodies of water in their quest for greener pastures. Sometimes they drown. Dispersal and accidental death is a far cry from the instinctive, deliberate mass suicide depicted in ""White Wilderness,"" but Hibbler explains that life is tough in the lemmings' ""weird world of frozen chaos."" The voice-over implies that lemmings take the plunge every seven to ten years to alleviate overpopulation.

""What people see is essentially mass dispersal,"" said zoologist Gordon Jarrell, an expert in small mammals with the University of Alaska Fairbanks. ""Sometimes it's pretty directional. The classic example is in the Scandinavian mountains, where (lemmings) have been dramatically observed. They will come to a body of water and be temporarily stopped, and eventually they'll build up along the shore so dense and they will swim across. If they get wet to the skin, they 're essentially dead.""

""There's no question that at times they will build up to huge numbers,"" Jarrell added. ""One description from Barrow does talk about them drowning and piling up on the shore.""

Jarrell said when people learn that he works with lemmings, the mass suicide issue often comes up.

""It's a frequent question,"" he said ""'Do they really kill themselves?' No. The answer is unequivocal, no they don't.""

GLENDALE, CA—VeggieTales creators are celebrating the legalization of recreational cannabis use with a new character, Cannabis Carl. The character is a sign of the progress the United States has made on its views on the controversial plant. “Kids are ready for this,” said Dreamworks executive Brian Jones, who is overseeing production on the current series.

In his inaugural episode, Cannabis Carl will be at the border to the VeggieTales house property, trying to cross over to start a new life, only to be met by Pa Grape who is out patrolling for illegal vegetables. After Pa Grape puts Carl in custody for being an illegal plant, Mayor Archibald passes a new law that Cannabis Carl is a legal citizen. Carl is welcomed by the Veggie Cast as they sing a song about old laws and new covenants, drawing a powerful parallel from scripture that is easy for kids to understand. As the episode ends, Cannabis Carl helps Mayor Archibald cure glaucoma in his right eye and ends up becoming roommates with Mr. Lunt, buying snacks at Pa Grape’s store and living off of the town’s generous food stamp program.

“Mike and I have had this character in our back pockets since college,” Phil Vischer said at a press conference. “America wasn’t ready for Cannabis Carl then, but they’ve finally come around.” Mike Nawrocki, the voice of Larry the Cucumber also commented with a long, drawn-out, high-pitched giggle. His eyes appeared red.

Vischer and Narwocki say they have more characters in store for when all drugs become legalized, including a wizard mushroom named Morlock. “Bible college was a pretty crazy time for us, but eventually God uses all things to his glory,” Vischer said.

The new episode featuring Cannabis Carl will be released on the newest Netfix VeggieTales series titled “VeggieTales In the Haze.” Cannabis Carl will debut with his song “God Made All The Plants, Dude” and will be voiced by actor and director Kevin Smith, who is a devout Christian.

Addressing the Dell Issue. 2/26/02

This is the letter I posted in a few Firearms Forums and sent via e mail.

This is a true account of my dealings with Dell over the past few weeks.

I am writing this because I feel every Firearms owner should know

this story.

I placed an order for a Dell notebook computer on February 13 on line

with Dell. I was given a tentative delivery date of February 21st. I

was watching the order through the Dell on line tracking system; I

also opted for the automatic email notification of when the machine

was to be shipped. Well the 21st came and went, I am a Pistolsmith I

know things can happen. I made a phone call on the 25th, did a

voice mail message for my salesman to get back to me and I was

looking for the delivery date. The 25th came and went with no

callback. On the 26th I placed another call this time to cancel the

order. After a few hours I got a call back, with this amazing reason

for the delay. It seems someone in Dell had already canceled my

order, when I asked why I was told Dell was afraid I was going to

use the machine for illegal purposes. When I asked why someone

would think that I was told it was because of the name of my

business Weigand Combat Handguns Inc.. Because I am involved in

firearms I might be doing something illegal. Now keep in mind I was

never called or informed of this decision the order was just canceled.

Many of you know me personally and know I run my business about

as squeaky clean as possible. In addition being the President of the

American Pistolsmiths Guild I am under additional scrutiny as to how I

run my business, if I am not clean how can I be the President of an

organization that promotes just that! I was informed by a Dell

supervisor not long after all of this the reason I was refused was

because of their post September 11th policy of screening buyers.

I would like to respectfully ask the firearms community to do the

following. If you intended to buy a Dell and because of this letter you

do not, email Dell and let them know why. Feel free to distribute this

account to all you know in the Firearms community, I think they need

to know. I for one am sick and tired of people assuming just because

we are involved with firearms that we are doing something illegal. I

also do not believe Dell deserves our business if this is how they

intend to treat us.

God Bless

Jack Weigand

President

American Pistolsmiths Guild Inc.



The above is the only letter I have written. I have written comments on email I have received (that number is now in the hundreds). I would like to add the following.

I have spoken to Dell today 2/26/02

They informed me that the reason my order was cancelled was due to the new post 9/11 screening policy. The word

""Combat"" in my company name is what triggered the cancellation of my order. The cancellation was triggered automatically. When I asked why I was not called to clear this up I was told there was a breakdown in communications on Dells part.

Just for the record so everyone knows where I stand.

I have no intention of further dealings with Dell, they don't deserve my business.

I want nothing from Dell but I would gladly accept an apology to the Firearms community in general.

I posted this expressly to warn firearms owners of Dell policies PERIOD.

There are those that think I did this to generate traffic to my web site. All this traffic just made it hard for my customers to shop this evening. If you will notice there are no advertisements on my web so traffic is not a factor. It has also generated hundreds of email that I personally answered. Just so you all know I am not smart enough to do a publicity stunt of this magnitude on purpose, LOL!

I would humbly request the following.

Please, please refrain from making personal attacks on Michael Dell. I have received hundreds of e mails attacking Mr. Dell, please do not do this. I know we are all passionate about our right to keep and bear arms but please be as professional as possible.

I thank all of those that took the time to confirm that this story was true before spreading it, you all are to be commended!



Update 2/27/02

After fielding hundreds of emails and dozens of phone calls today my heart felt thanks to all who responded.

I was contacted by a Dell representative this morning a Mr. John Hood. John made the following remarks.

He extended Dells sincerest apologies for the incident.

He said Dell would review and possibly change the screening policies to prevent this from happening again.

Dell offered to ship the machine I ordered to me at no charge, I respectfully declined the offer.

John told me he would have a statement sent to me sometime Thursday morning the 28th stating Dells position on this issue for me to post here for all to see.

I will post the statement as soon as I receive it.



2/28/02 Update Statement from Dell

To Our Valued Customers and Friends:

U.S. export laws restrict the sale of technology to terrorists and to people

in countries that support terrorism. These laws also prohibit computer sales

to people who will use the technology in developing biological or nuclear

weapons. Dell strictly complies with our country's export laws in order to

ensure the safety of our customers and citizens around the world. When there

is reasonable cause for concern, we carefully review customer orders for

prohibited destinations and activities.

When additional follow-up on an order is required, our sales representatives

ask our customers four basic questions:

1. Who is the end-user?

2. Where will the product be used?

3. What will the product be used for?

4. What type of business or industry is involved?

The answers to these questions, like all customer information we gather, are

confidential and are not shared outside of Dell.

We recently received an order from Mr. Jack Weigand, whose company name,

""Weigand's Combat Handguns Inc."" included the word ""combat."" We cancelled

the order to give us enough time to follow up with the customer and be

assured that the sale would be in compliance with U.S. export law. However,

we failed to contact Mr. Weigand, and as a result, we did not deliver the

order as promised, and the customer did not know why. Once we discovered our

error, we apologized to Mr. Weigand for this misunderstanding, as well as

the inconvenience caused by the delay. This is not the service standard that

we hold ourselves to at Dell.

We at Dell feel a strong obligation to uphold our federal law, but we have

just as strong an obligation to be responsive to the needs of all our

customers. We want to assure you that the company does not discriminate

against any business, regardless of the products or services they sell, nor

do we discriminate against individual consumers. We do, however, sometimes

make mistakes - as we did in this case.

Thank you for your support.

Sincerely,

Dell Computer Corporation



This is the link that has been circulating

http://www.progressivefunds.com/hci/



I felt it was my obligation to post the following

The following is a portion of a Dell statement that addresses the above link This was added 3/02/02

We appreciate the opportunity to clarify the facts regarding a customer

issue reported in the media and Dell's position on political or social

issues that many of you care deeply about.

Regarding Handgun Rights/Handgun Control....

Dell is a publicly-traded, customer-focused company with customers,

shareholders and employees on both sides of many public, social and

political issues. Our place is to serve our customers rather than to

endorse or support one position over another in public debates outside the

scope of our industry.

We do not discriminate against any business, regardless of the products or

services they sell, nor do we discriminate against individual customers.

We do, however, respect the right of any organization or individual to

have their own point of view. We follow all laws, rules and regulations.

Regarding allegations that Dell supports Handgun Control organizations

through the Dell Affiliates program...

Dell as a company remains neutral on handgun rights and handgun control.

Dell customers can support causes and organizations, if they choose,

through Dell's affiliates program and charitable websites such as

igive.com and progressivefunds.com. These sites feature links to Dell's

website. Dell's affiliates program provides a way for customers to support

the cause or organization of their choice through their Dell purchases.

Affiliate participants, such as igive.com and progressivefunds.com,

include organizations and causes on different sides of nearly every social

issue.

Some of the organizations participating through Dell affiliates such as

igive.com and progressivefunds.com., promote handgun rights, others

promote handgun control. Handgun Control Inc. (HCI) has been reported as

one organization that participates in this program. Others including The

Gun Owners Foundation and the Michigan Coalition for Responsible Gun

Owners Foundation, Inc. also participate through Dell affiliate igive.com.



The only organizations prohibited from participating in Dell's affiliates

program are those that promote sexually explicit material; promote

violence; promote discrimination based on race, sex, religion,

nationality, disability, sexual orientation or age; or promote illegal

activities.



3/01/02 Update

The free computer offer from Dell is a hot topic in much of the email I have received to date. I have since purchased a notebook computer elsewhere so I hope that issue is settled.



Again I thank everyone for your thoughts and comments. I will say I don't agree with some of the letters but we are Americans, we have the right to free speech.

Please keep in mind when reading postings on my site. I have no public relations department to draft and polish my postings. I think long and hard about what needs to be said and I post it. Please forgive me for being a little crude in my writing, keep in mind I am a Pistolsmith not a writer.

I am doing my best to keep up with the email, over 1000 to date. I read every email I receive and respond to 99% of it.



3/02/02 Update

Please go to the following link at the NRA/ILA web site

http://www.nraila.org/ActionAlerts.asp?FormMode=Detail&ID=101

Title: DELL AND OUR RIGHT TO ARMS





Dell has issued a second statement, many of you have received via email. The letter contains the following statement:

""We have tried to make it right with our customer by giving him a free computer for his trouble and inconvenience .""

I have not accepted a computer from Dell. I have purchased a computer from another manufacturer.



Again I thank the Firearms community as a family for being so willing to come to my aid.

God Bless

Would the Last Honest Reporter Please Turn On the Lights?

An open letter to the local daily paper -- almost every local daily paper in America:

I remember reading All the President's Men and thinking: That's journalism. You do what it takes to get the truth and you lay it before the public, because the public has a right to know.

This housing crisis didn't come out of nowhere. It was not a vague emanation of the evil Bush administration.

It was a direct result of the political decision, back in the late 1990s, to loosen the rules of lending so that home loans would be more accessible to poor people. Fannie Mae and Freddie Mac were authorized to approve risky loans.

What is a risky loan? It's a loan that the recipient is likely not to be able to repay.

The goal of this rule change was to help the poor -- which especially would help members of minority groups. But how does it help these people to give them a loan that they can't repay? They get into a house, yes, but when they can't make the payments, they lose the house -- along with their credit rating.

They end up worse off than before.

This was completely foreseeable and in fact many people did foresee it. One political party, in Congress and in the executive branch, tried repeatedly to tighten up the rules. The other party blocked every such attempt and tried to loosen them.

Furthermore, Freddie Mac and Fannie Mae were making political contributions to the very members of Congress who were allowing them to make irresponsible loans. (Though why quasi-federal agencies were allowed to do so baffles me. It's as if the Pentagon were allowed to contribute to the political campaigns of Congressmen who support increasing their budget.)

Isn't there a story here? Doesn't journalism require that you who produce our daily paper tell the truth about who brought us to a position where the only way to keep confidence in our economy was a $700 billion bailout? Aren't you supposed to follow the money and see which politicians were benefitting personally from the deregulation of mortgage lending?

I have no doubt that if these facts had pointed to the Republican Party or to John McCain as the guilty parties, you would be treating it as a vast scandal. ""Housing-gate,"" no doubt. Or ""Fannie-gate.""

Instead, it was Senator Christopher Dodd and Congressman Barney Frank, both Democrats, who denied that there were any problems, who refused Bush administration requests to set up a regulatory agency to watch over Fannie Mae and Freddie Mac, and who were still pushing for these agencies to go even further in promoting subprime mortgage loans almost up to the minute they failed.

As Thomas Sowell points out in a TownHall.com essay entitled Do Facts Matter? ""Alan Greenspan warned them four years ago. So did the Chairman of the Council of Economic Advisers to the President. So did Bush's Secretary of the Treasury.""

These are facts. This financial crisis was completely preventable. The party that blocked any attempt to prevent it was ... the Democratic Party. The party that tried to prevent it was ... the Republican Party.

Yet when Nancy Pelosi accused the Bush administration and Republican deregulation of causing the crisis, you in the press did not hold her to account for her lie. Instead, you criticized Republicans who took offense at this lie and refused to vote for the bailout!

What? It's not the liar, but the victims of the lie who are to blame?

Now let's follow the money ... right to the presidential candidate who is the number-two recipient of campaign contributions from Fannie Mae.

And after Franklin Raines, the CEO of Fannie Mae who made $90 million while running it into the ground, was fired for his incompetence, one presidential candidate's campaign actually consulted him for advice on housing.

If that presidential candidate had been John McCain, you would have called it a major scandal and we would be getting stories in your paper every day about how incompetent and corrupt he was.

But instead, that candidate was Barack Obama, and so you have buried this story, and when the McCain campaign dared to call Raines an ""adviser"" to the Obama campaign -- because that campaign had sought his advice -- you actually let Obama's people get away with accusing McCain of lying, merely because Raines wasn't listed as an official adviser to the Obama campaign.

You would never tolerate such weasely nit-picking from a Republican.

If you who produce our local daily paper actually had any principles, you would be pounding this story, because the prosperity of all Americans was put at risk by the foolish, short-sighted, politically selfish, and possibly corrupt actions of leading Democrats, including Obama.

If you who produce our local daily paper had any personal honor, you would find it unbearable to let the American people believe that somehow Republicans were to blame for this crisis.

There are precedents. Even though President Bush and his administration never said that Iraq sponsored or was linked to 9/11, you could not stand the fact that Americans had that misapprehension -- so you pounded us with the fact that there was no such link. (Along the way, you created the false impression that Bush had lied to them and said that there was a connection.)

If you had any principles, then surely right now, when the American people are set to blame President Bush and John McCain for a crisis they tried to prevent, and are actually shifting to approve of Barack Obama because of a crisis he helped cause, you would be laboring at least as hard to correct that false impression.

Your job, as journalists, is to tell the truth. That's what you claim you do, when you accept people's money to buy or subscribe to your paper.

But right now, you are consenting to or actively promoting a big fat lie -- that the housing crisis should somehow be blamed on Bush, McCain, and the Republicans. You have trained the American people to blame everything bad -- even bad weather -- on Bush, and they are responding as you have taught them to.

If you had any personal honor, each reporter and editor would be insisting on telling the truth -- even if it hurts the election chances of your favorite candidate.

Because that's what honorable people do. Honest people tell the truth even when they don't like the probable consequences. That's what honesty means. That's how trust is earned.

Barack Obama is just another politician, and not a very wise one. He has revealed his ignorance and naivete time after time -- and you have swept it under the rug, treated it as nothing.

Meanwhile, you have participated in the borking of Sarah Palin, reporting savage attacks on her for the pregnancy of her unmarried daughter -- while you ignored the story of John Edwards's own adultery for many months.

So I ask you now: Do you have any standards at all? Do you even know what honesty means?

Is getting people to vote for Barack Obama so important that you will throw away everything that journalism is supposed to stand for?

You might want to remember the way the National Organization of Women threw away their integrity by supporting Bill Clinton despite his well-known pattern of sexual exploitation of powerless women. Who listens to NOW anymore? We know they stand for nothing; they have no principles.

That's where you are right now.

It's not too late. You know that if the situation were reversed, and the truth would damage McCain and help Obama, you would be moving heaven and earth to get the true story out there.

If you want to redeem your honor, you will swallow hard and make a list of all the stories you would print if it were McCain who had been getting money from Fannie Mae, McCain whose campaign had consulted with its discredited former CEO, McCain who had voted against tightening its lending practices.

Then you will print them, even though every one of those true stories will point the finger of blame at the reckless Democratic Party, which put our nation's prosperity at risk so they could feel good about helping the poor, and lay a fair share of the blame at Obama's door.

You will also tell the truth about John McCain: that he tried, as a Senator, to do what it took to prevent this crisis. You will tell the truth about President Bush: that his administration tried more than once to get Congress to regulate lending in a responsible way.

This was a Congress-caused crisis, beginning during the Clinton administration, with Democrats leading the way into the crisis and blocking every effort to get out of it in a timely fashion.

If you at our local daily newspaper continue to let Americans believe --and vote as if -- President Bush and the Republicans caused the crisis, then you are joining in that lie.

If you do not tell the truth about the Democrats -- including Barack Obama -- and do so with the same energy you would use if the miscreants were Republicans -- then you are not journalists by any standard.

You're just the public relations machine of the Democratic Party, and it's time you were all fired and real journalists brought in, so that we can actually have a daily newspaper in our city.

https://www.snopes.com/fact-check/generals-controversial-graduation-speech/	a commencement speech by the commanding officer of fort benning touched off riots that killed 11 people.	false	[]		David Mikkelson	['http://www.duffelblog.com/2012/07/general-gives-controversial-graduation-speech-riot-ensues/']	http://www.duffelblog.com/2012/07/general-gives-controversial-graduation-speech-riot-ensues/	http://www.duffelblog.com/	"SAND HILL, Fort Benning, Ga. — Many soldiers and family members are angry over reports of controversial remarks from the Commanding Officer of Fort Benning at a recruit graduation.

Speaking to an assembled crowd of new soldiers and their families at basic training graduation, Maj. Gen. Robert Brown was reported as “extremely hostile.”

His speech began with the “standard fluff” about duty, country, and the privileges of serving when such a small percentage of the country chooses a career in the Armed Forces. The speech took a turn, however, when the General reached a point in his remarks, obviously reused from previous ceremonies.

“Look to your left and right towards your brothers in arms,” said Brown. “You’re all now members of a proud warrior class, and heroes like your fathers before you who-”

The General stopped, took a deep breath and crumpled the sheet before flinging it to the ground.

“Fuck it! I can’t read shit like this anymore. Listen up you little bald bastards.”

The newly minted soldiers — trying to stay awake throughout the ceremony — shifted uncomfortably in their seats at the sudden change in tone.

“Some of you fucks won’t make it past AIT [Advanced Individual Training]. You’ll wash out with the rest of the weakness that never should have been here in the first place. Most of you who do graduate will immediately go to combat units and deploy overseas. Many of you will threaten to kill yourselves to get out of real work, although you wont have the balls to actually do it!”

Brown’s tone got softer as he attempted to clarify.

“Don’t get me wrong here. Many of you will actually go fight and engage the enemy in close combat. For that I salute you. It takes a hard motherfucker to go kill people you’ve never met just because we say so.”

The General then resumes his “motivational speech” to what he referred to as “the rest of you shit-stains.”

“You’ll most likely spend your deployment sitting on a FOB, manning guard towers, or waiting to go on patrols that get cancelled. I have a reality check for you all. Not everyone in this room is a hero. I don’t give a shit what the beer commercials say. You drag your buddy out of a grape hut after you’ve stabbed two Taliban in the eyes with a broken MRE spoon then you’re a motherfucking American Hero. You clear a trench with nothing but a sack of hand-grenades and your giant brass balls, then you’re a motherfucking hero! But walking through the desert for three months without hearing a shot fired in anger and posting pictures in your combat gear doesn’t make you a goddamned hero! I don’t care what your family says. They’re not heroes. Neither are your fucking wives. Hardest job in the Army, my ass! Damn it, I’m too old for this shit. Fuck you all.”

Gen. Brown then threw up his middle finger to the crowd and stormed off the stage, hustling into his waiting staff car.

The silence after his speech was soon broken by wild applause from the assembled Drill Sergeants and Officers responsible for training the young soldiers over the previous ten weeks.

Less enthusiasm was displayed by the families and the new graduates, who stormed the stage and attempted to destroy the auditorium to express their displeasure. The ensuing riot caused over a half-million dollars in damage, and Drill Sergeants were forced to kill 11 Privates in self-defense.

An Army spokesman has said that General Brown will not be scheduled as the keynote speaker for next week’s graduation ceremony."

 WWN Web Guide PLANET-DISSOLVING DUST CLOUD IS HEADED TOWARD EARTH!

Monday September 12, 2005





By MIKE FOSTER



CAMBRIDGE, Mass. -- Scared-stiff astronomers have detected a mysterious mass they've dubbed a ""chaos cloud"" that dissolves everything in its path, including comets, asteroids, planets and entire stars -- and it's headed directly toward Earth!



Discovered April 6 by NASA's Chandra X-ray Observatory, the swirling, 10 million-mile- wide cosmic dust cloud has been likened to an ""acid nebula"" and is hurtling toward us at close to the speed of light -- making its estimated time of arrival 9:15 a.m. EDT on June 1, 2014.



""The good news is that this finding confirms several cutting- edge ideas in theoretical physics,"" announced Dr. Albert Sherwinski, a Cambridge based astrophysicist with close ties to NASA.



""The bad news is that the total annihilation of our solar system is imminent.""



Experts believe the chaos cloud is composed of particles spawned near the event horizon of a black hole (a form of what's called Hawking Radiation) that have been distorted by mangled information spewed from the hole.



""A super-massive black hole lies about 28,000 light-years from Earth at the center of our galaxy,"" explained Dr. Sherwinski.



""Last year the eminent physicist Stephen Hawking revised his theory of black holes -- which previously held that nothing could escape the hole's powerful gravitational field. He demonstrated that information about objects that have been sucked in can be emitted in mangled form.



""It now appears that mangled information can distort matter.



""Just imagine our galaxy the Milky Way as a beautiful, handwritten letter.



""Now imagine pouring a glass of water on the paper and watching the words dissolve as the stain spreads. That's what the chaos cloud does to every star or planet it encounters.""



To avoid widespread panic, NASA has declined to make the alarming discovery public. But Dr. Sherwinski's contacts at the agency's Chandra X-ray Observatory leaked to him striking images of the newly discovered chaos cloud obliterating a large asteroid.



""It's like watching a helpless hog being dissolved in a vat of acid,"" one NASA scientist told Dr. Sherwinski.



Ordinarily, Hawkings Radiation is harmless.



""It's produced when an electron- positron pair are at the event horizon of a black hole,"" Dr. Sherwinski explained. ""The intense curvature of space-time of the hole can cause the positron to fall in, while the electron escapes.""



But when ""infected"" by mangled information from the black hole, the particles become a chaos cloud, which in turn mangles everything it touches.



""If it continues unchecked, the chaos cloud will eventually reduce our galaxy to the state of absolute chaos that existed before the birth of the universe,"" the astrophysicist warned.



Some scientists say mankind's best hope would be to build a ""space ark"" and hightail it to the Andromeda Galaxy, 2.1 million light-years away.



""We wouldn't be able to save the entire human population, but perhaps the best and the brightest,"" observed British rocket scientist Dr. David Hall, when asked about the feasibility of such a project.



But even if such a craft could be built in time, evacuating Earth might prove fruitless if theories about the origin of the chaos cloud are correct.



""A black hole at the center of Andromeda is about 15 times the size of the one in our own galaxy,"" Dr. Sherwinski noted. ""It might be like jumping out of the frying pan into the fire.""



Speaking under the condition of anonymity, a senior White House official said the president's top science advisors are taking the findings in stride.



""This is a lot like global warming, where the jury is still out on whether it's real or not,"" said the official.



""The existence of this so called chaos cloud is only a theory. Americans shouldn't panic until all the facts are in.""

https://www.snopes.com/fact-check/joe-biden-put-yall-back-in-chains/	"sen. joe biden told an audience which included hundreds of african americans that republican economic policies would ""put y'all back in chains."""	true	['joe biden']	2019/05/15	David Emery	['https://thecaucus.blogs.nytimes.com/2012/08/14/biden-warns-romney-policies-would-put-crowd-back-in-chains/', 'https://www.richmond.com/news/biden-we-need-to-finish-what-obama-started/article_54957b91-07f2-50f2-a964-7ad869c070d9.html', 'https://www.cbsnews.com/news/rangel-bidens-gaffe-was-clearly-about-slavery/', 'https://www.c-span.org/video/?307584-1/vice-president-joe-biden-danville-virginia', 'https://wtvr.com/2012/08/16/doug-wilder-on-joe-biden/']	https://thecaucus.blogs.nytimes.com/2012/08/14/biden-warns-romney-policies-would-put-crowd-back-in-chains/	https://thecaucus.blogs.nytimes.com/	"Vice President Joseph R. Biden Jr. created a stir Tuesday at a campaign speech in Virginia when he told the crowd that Mitt Romney’s policies would enable the banking and financial sectors to “put you all back in chains.”

The remark came roughly two-thirds of the way through Mr. Biden’s 30-minute speech, which was delivered to a crowd that included many African-Americans at the Institute for Advanced Learning and Research in Danville, Va.

“Romney wants to let the — he said in the first hundred days, he’s going to let the big banks once again write their own rules, unchain Wall Street,” Mr. Biden said. “They’re going to put you all back in chains.”

On a C-Span video of the speech, the audience does not appear to react negatively to Mr. Biden’s phrasing; indeed, laughter can be heard among the crowd.

President Obama and his surrogates have been campaigning heavily in Virginia, and the campaign’s strategy relies in part on energizing the black vote to take the traditionally Republican state, which moved to the Democratic column in the 2008 presidential election. According to the Census, the population of Danville is roughly 48.8 percent white and 48.6 percent black.

After Mr. Biden’s address, some Republicans assailed Mr. Biden’s remark. On Twitter, Ari Fleischer, a former press secretary for President George W. Bush, likened the comment to one made by Sarah Palin when she compared critical press coverage to “blood libel,” a term alluding to the false allegation that Jews once killed Christian children to use their blood for religious rituals.

“The press pounded Palin when she talked about ‘blood libel,’” Mr. Fleischer wrote. “What will they do about Biden’s ‘chains’ remark?”

Later Tuesday, both presidential campaigns responded to the vice president’s remarks, with Mr. Romney’s campaign calling the phrasing “not acceptable.”

“After weeks of slanderous and baseless accusations leveled against Governor Romney, the Obama campaign has reached a new low,” Andrea Saul, Mr. Romney’s press secretary, said in a statement. “The comments made by the vice president of the United States are not acceptable in our political discourse and demonstrate yet again that the Obama campaign will say and do anything to win this election. President Obama should tell the American people whether he agrees with Joe Biden’s comments.”

In a statement, Stephanie Cutter, Mr. Obama’s deputy campaign manager, defended Mr. Biden.

“For months, Speaker Boehner, Congressman Ryan and other Republicans have called for the ‘unshackling’ of the private sector from regulations that protect Americans from risky financial deals and other reckless behavior that crashed our economy. Since then, the vice president has often used a similar metaphor to describe the need to ‘unshackle’ the middle class. Today’s comments were a derivative of those remarks, describing the devastating impact letting Wall Street write its own rules again would have on middle class families. We find the Romney campaign’s outrage over the vice president’s comments today hypocritical, particularly in light of their own candidate’s stump speech questioning the president’s patriotism. Now, let’s return to that ‘substantive’ debate Mitt Romney and Paul Ryan promised 72 hours ago, but quickly abandoned.”

As he concluded his speech, Mr. Biden confused North Carolina with Virginia, where Danville is located.

“With you we can win North Carolina again, and if we do, we win the election if we win you,” Mr. Biden said.

The city of Danville abuts the northern border of North Carolina, which also went for Mr. Obama in 2008 but is considered a more challenging state for his campaign this time around.

At a second appearance on Tuesday, in Wytheville, Va., Mr. Biden said his remarks had merely alluded to a term used previously by Republicans, including Mr. Romney’s running mate, Representative Paul D. Ryan. In his response to Mr. Obama’s State of the Union address in 2011, Mr. Ryan said, “We believe a renewed commitment to limited government will unshackle our economy and create millions of new jobs and opportunities for all people, of every background, to succeed and prosper.”

“And I’m told that when I made that comment earlier today in Danville, Va., the Romney campaign put out a tweet,” Mr. Biden told the crowd in Wytheville. “You know, tweets these days? Put out a tweet, went on the airwaves saying, ‘Biden, he’s outrageous in saying that,’ I think I said instead of ‘unshackled,’ ‘unchained.’ ‘Outrageous to say that.’ That’s what we had. I’m using their own words.”

“I got a message for them,” Mr. Biden continued. “If you want to know what’s outrageous, it’s their policies and the effects of their policies on middle-class America. That’s what’s outrageous.”

Mr. Romney addressed Mr. Biden’s original remark in a speech Tuesday evening in Chillicothe, Ohio, calling it an indicator that Mr. Obama’s presidency had become “angry and desperate,” according to The Associated Press."

https://www.snopes.com/fact-check/is-company-turning-human-embryos-into-jewelry/	a jewelry company is making jewelry out of unwanted human embryos.	mostly true	['anonews.co', 'anti-abortion', 'bunker buster news', 'embryo jewelry', 'fetuses', 'outrage', 'pro life']	2017/08/09	Bethania Palma	['http://archive.is/Rdfxx', 'http://archive.is/bDgTq', 'https://www.rawglitter.com/products/chunky-link-chain-choker-necklace-gold', 'http://www.ncregister.com/blog/matthew-archbold/now-you-can-turn-extra-embryos-into-jewelry', 'https://www.lifesitenews.com/news/company-receives-backlash-for-turning-frozen-embryos-into-jewelry']	https://www.lifesitenews.com/news/company-receives-backlash-for-turning-frozen-embryos-into-jewelry	https://www.lifesitenews.com/	"May 8, 2017 (LifeSiteNews) — The Australian company that says it has pioneered a process to make frozen human embyros into jewelry is facing backlash after a story on it went viral last week.

Baby Bee Hummingbird, started by midwife Amy McGlade in 2014, has “crafted” 50 pieces of jewelry from “embryo straws,” which it preserves and cremates, making an “embryo ash” that can be preserved in resin, according to a report in Kidspot.

“I don’t believe there is any other business in the world that creates jewelry from human embryos, and I firmly believe that we are pioneering the way in this sacred art, and opening the possibilities to families around the world,” McGlade told Kidspot.

The jewelry costs “$80 to $600, depending on the piece, and can be sent worldwide.”

The article featured couple Belinda and Shaun Stafford, who used IVF to conceive a son, now four, and a twin boy and girl, who are almost two. They didn’t know what to do with the seven frozen embryos they had left.

“Donating our embryos wasn’t an option for us and I couldn’t justify the yearly storage fee,” Belinda told Kidspot. “I’d heard others had planted them in the garden, but we move a lot, so I couldn’t do this.”

So they opted to have the babies made into jewelry — in this case, a heart-shaped pendant.

“My embryos were my babies — frozen in time. When we completed our family, it wasn’t in my heart to destroy them,” Belinda told Kidspot. “ Now they are forever with me in a beautiful keepsake.”

Baby Bee Hummingbird’s Facebook page says it is “offering 15 percent off all Embryo Ashes Jewelry. We hope this will make the process more affordable & easier on families.”

It’s clear the company has been dealing with backlash from the Kidspot story.

Wesley Smith decried the practice in National Review as “illustrating the crassness of our age.” Matthew Archbold wrote in the National Catholic Register that he “had to read this headline twice (or three times) because I thought it had to be a twisted joke. Sadly, it's not.”

Added Archbold: “The more I read the more horrified I became.”

A post on Baby Bee Hummingbird’s Facebook last Wednesday said it was “taking a small break and going offline until tomorrow” after “a very draining 48 hours.” Two days later came the following response:

• t r u t h • l o v e • r e s p e c t • Truth • Many of you would be aware of the traumatic & soul destroying week we have endured. The truth is we have received thousands of vile, cruel & unimaginable emails & messages.

We hope you continue to follow our journey. As of Monday we will be back doing what we love ( with some help, so we can quickly filter our mail ).

Comments on the page defended the company’s “exclusive concept.”

Reads one post: “Unless you've been the IVF route SHUT YOUR UNEDUCATED MOUTH! If you've no part of this journey, You don't know anything. You don't know, Unless you live this horrific journey.”

Says another: “It’s not a baby yet, it's a bunch of cells. ... I'm also infertile and relied on donor eggs for me to have my family. …I personally would rather wear my embryo around my neck then it get thrown down the sink (because that's what happens believe it or not).”

And another: “How do you get the embrio's? Would we have to give you permission? I'm interested as we have 6 frosties we are still paying storage for.”

According to Pope Saint John Paul II: “A person’s rightful due is to be treated as an object of love, not as an object for use.”

Ultimately, IVF turns the human person, made in the image and likeness of God, into a commodity.

The “problem is so evidently apparent and sickening that it’s hard to know where to start,” says Marie-Claire Bissonnette, youth coordinator at Campaign Life Coalition.

That parents would make jewelry from the human embryos they created by in vitro fertilization is “emotional, narcissistic, unnatural and utilitarian,” she told LifeSiteNews.

“There’s no consideration for the babies, just how the parents feel. This is the antithesis of parenting: killing your children and using their bodies to create frivolous tokens in the name of ‘keeping them close,’” she added.

“When I consider where we are as a culture and how confused we are, in the end it really is so simple. Do we believe God created each and every human being? Do we believe life is sacred? Not just important. Sacred. Priceless,” wrote Archbold.

“There are no good solutions in cases like these for what to do with frozen embryos. Even when one of those solutions is on sale,” he added.

Born of unknown parentage and adopted in 1985 by the Borneman/Calhoun family of Rabbit Hash, Goofy was raised as any local dog-resident of the town. His early years were happy ones, playing with the Bornemans’ son, Mike Calhoun. According to Mike, it was the standard boy-dog relationship with Goofy a constant companion for Mike as they traveled up and down Lower River Road. While Mike was in school, Goofy would still take the familiar path between his home and the Rabbit Hash General Store visiting neighbors and eating any scraps along the way. In his adolescence, Goofy ran into trouble. Lounging in the road proved to be a dangerous past-time as he was hit by cars more than once. He also had a stinky reputation and fell into trouble with his owner, Ed Borneman, when Goofy was allegedly found to be poaching town chickens.

In his older years, Goofy settled down and was content to remain on the straight and narrow. In June 1998, upon Boone County, Kentucky’s bicentennial celebration, the Rabbit Hash mayor’s race was announced. Although initially open to anyone in the area, only humans entered the race. After Jane and Randy Cochran entered their black Labrador Retriever, Herb, in the race, the Borneman family, finding that everyone in the town already held a relationship with their aging dog, Goofy, decided to enter him. The charisma of the Borneman family and the notorious reputation of Goofy led to a triumphant result as Goofy beat out famed woodcarver “Crazy Clifford” Pottorf and fellow four-legger Herb Cochran.

Unfortunately for the town, the aging mayor did not get to serve an entire term, however long that may be, and passed away in July of 2001 at the astounding age of 16. Although his burial-in-landfill was lacking the traditional pomp and circumstance of a funeral for a notorious politician, he reign over the town was celebrated in a parade at the 2001 Old Timers Day. His legacy continued with the release of the 2004 documentary Rabbit Hash: Center of the Universe, which focused on his election, and the 2004 and 2008 runs and wins for Junior Cochran and Lucy Lou respectively. Having set the precedent for canine mayors, Goofy and his tradition has brought an overwhelming amount of positive attention and funds for the preservation of the aging river town. To Goofy and to the Borneman family, we are eternally grateful.

TO THE CONGRESS OF THE UNITED STATES:

Madam Speaker, Mr. Vice President, Members of Congress, the First Lady of the United States, and my fellow Americans:

We meet tonight at a moment of unlimited potential. As we begin a new Congress, I stand here ready to work with you to achieve historic breakthroughs for all Americans.

Millions of our fellow citizens are watching us now, gathered in this great chamber, hoping that we will govern not as two parties but as one Nation.

The agenda I will lay out this evening is not a Republican agenda or a Democrat agenda. It is the agenda of the American people.

Many of us campaigned on the same core promises: to defend American jobs and demand fair trade for American workers; to rebuild and revitalize our Nation’s infrastructure; to reduce the price of healthcare and prescription drugs; to create an immigration system that is safe, lawful, modern and secure; and to pursue a foreign policy that puts America’s interests first.

There is a new opportunity in American politics, if only we have the courage to seize it. Victory is not winning for our party. Victory is winning for our country.

This year, America will recognize two important anniversaries that show us the majesty of America’s mission, and the power of American pride.

In June, we mark 75 years since the start of what General Dwight D. Eisenhower called the Great Crusade — the Allied liberation of Europe in World War II. On D-Day, June 6, 1944, 15,000 young American men jumped from the sky, and 60,000 more stormed in from the sea, to save our civilization from tyranny. Here with us tonight are three of those heroes: Private First Class Joseph Reilly, Staff Sergeant Irving Locker, and Sergeant Herman Zeitchik. Gentlemen, we salute you.

In 2019, we also celebrate 50 years since brave young pilots flew a quarter of a million miles through space to plant the American flag on the face of the moon. Half a century later, we are joined by one of the Apollo 11 astronauts who planted that flag: Buzz Aldrin. This year, American astronauts will go back to space on American rockets.

In the 20th century, America saved freedom, transformed science, and redefined the middle class standard of living for the entire world to see. Now, we must step boldly and bravely into the next chapter of this great American adventure, and we must create a new standard of living for the 21st century. An amazing quality of life for all of our citizens is within our reach.

We can make our communities safer, our families stronger, our culture richer, our faith deeper, and our middle class bigger and more prosperous than ever before.

But we must reject the politics of revenge, resistance, and retribution — and embrace the boundless potential of cooperation, compromise, and the common good.

Together, we can break decades of political stalemate. We can bridge old divisions, heal old wounds, build new coalitions, forge new solutions, and unlock the extraordinary promise of America’s future. The decision is ours to make.

We must choose between greatness or gridlock, results or resistance, vision or vengeance, incredible progress or pointless destruction.

Tonight, I ask you to choose greatness.

Over the last 2 years, my Administration has moved with urgency and historic speed to confront problems neglected by leaders of both parties over many decades.

In just over 2 years since the election, we have launched an unprecedented economic boom — a boom that has rarely been seen before. We have created 5.3 million new jobs and importantly added 600,000 new manufacturing jobs — something which almost everyone said was impossible to do, but the fact is, we are just getting started.

Wages are rising at the fastest pace in decades, and growing for blue collar workers, who I promised to fight for, faster than anyone else. Nearly 5 million Americans have been lifted off food stamps. The United States economy is growing almost twice as fast today as when I took office, and we are considered far and away the hottest economy anywhere in the world. Unemployment has reached the lowest rate in half a century. African-American, Hispanic-American and Asian-American unemployment have all reached their lowest levels ever recorded. Unemployment for Americans with disabilities has also reached an all-time low. More people are working now than at any time in our history –- 157 million.

We passed a massive tax cut for working families and doubled the child tax credit.

We virtually ended the estate, or death, tax on small businesses, ranches, and family farms.

We eliminated the very unpopular Obamacare individual mandate penalty — and to give critically ill patients access to life-saving cures, we passed right to try.

My Administration has cut more regulations in a short time than any other administration during its entire tenure. Companies are coming back to our country in large numbers thanks to historic reductions in taxes and regulations.

We have unleashed a revolution in American energy — the United States is now the number one producer of oil and natural gas in the world. And now, for the first time in 65 years, we are a net exporter of energy.

After 24 months of rapid progress, our economy is the envy of the world, our military is the most powerful on earth, and America is winning each and every day. Members of Congress: the State of our Union is strong. Our country is vibrant and our economy is thriving like never before.

On Friday, it was announced that we added another 304,000 jobs last month alone — almost double what was expected. An economic miracle is taking place in the United States — and the only thing that can stop it are foolish wars, politics, or ridiculous partisan investigations.

If there is going to be peace and legislation, there cannot be war and investigation. It just doesn’t work that way!

We must be united at home to defeat our adversaries abroad.

This new era of cooperation can start with finally confirming the more than 300 highly qualified nominees who are still stuck in the Senate – some after years of waiting. The Senate has failed to act on these nominations, which is unfair to the nominees and to our country.

Now is the time for bipartisan action. Believe it or not, we have already proven that it is possible.

In the last Congress, both parties came together to pass unprecedented legislation to confront the opioid crisis, a sweeping new Farm Bill, historic VA reforms, and after four decades of rejection, we passed VA Accountability so we can finally terminate those who mistreat our wonderful veterans.

And just weeks ago, both parties united for groundbreaking criminal justice reform. Last year, I heard through friends the story of Alice Johnson. I was deeply moved. In 1997, Alice was sentenced to life in prison as a first-time non-violent drug offender. Over the next two decades, she became a prison minister, inspiring others to choose a better path. She had a big impact on that prison population — and far beyond.

Alice’s story underscores the disparities and unfairness that can exist in criminal sentencing — and the need to remedy this injustice. She served almost 22 years and had expected to be in prison for the rest of her life.

In June, I commuted Alice’s sentence — and she is here with us tonight. Alice, thank you for reminding us that we always have the power to shape our own destiny.

When I saw Alice’s beautiful family greet her at the prison gates, hugging and kissing and crying and laughing, I knew I did the right thing.

Inspired by stories like Alice’s, my Administration worked closely with members of both parties to sign the First Step Act into law. This legislation reformed sentencing laws that have wrongly and disproportionately harmed the African-American community. The First Step Act gives non-violent offenders the chance to re-enter society as productive, law-abiding citizens. Now, States across the country are following our lead. America is a Nation that believes in redemption.

We are also joined tonight by Matthew Charles from Tennessee. In 1996, at age 30, Matthew was sentenced to 35 years for selling drugs and related offenses. Over the next two decades, he completed more than 30 Bible studies, became a law clerk, and mentored fellow inmates. Now, Matthew is the very first person to be released from prison under the First Step Act. Matthew, on behalf of all Americans: welcome home.

As we have seen, when we are united, we can make astonishing strides for our country. Now, Republicans and Democrats must join forces again to confront an urgent national crisis.

The Congress has 10 days left to pass a bill that will fund our Government, protect our homeland, and secure our southern border.

Now is the time for the Congress to show the world that America is committed to ending illegal immigration and putting the ruthless coyotes, cartels, drug dealers, and human traffickers out of business.

As we speak, large, organized caravans are on the march to the United States. We have just heard that Mexican cities, in order to remove the illegal immigrants from their communities, are getting trucks and buses to bring them up to our country in areas where there is little border protection. I have ordered another 3,750 troops to our southern border to prepare for the tremendous onslaught.

This is a moral issue. The lawless state of our southern border is a threat to the safety, security, and financial well‑being of all Americans. We have a moral duty to create an immigration system that protects the lives and jobs of our citizens. This includes our obligation to the millions of immigrants living here today, who followed the rules and respected our laws. Legal immigrants enrich our Nation and strengthen our society in countless ways. I want people to come into our country, but they have to come in legally.

Tonight, I am asking you to defend our very dangerous southern border out of love and devotion to our fellow citizens and to our country.

No issue better illustrates the divide between America’s working class and America’s political class than illegal immigration. Wealthy politicians and donors push for open borders while living their lives behind walls and gates and guards.

Meanwhile, working class Americans are left to pay the price for mass illegal migration — reduced jobs, lower wages, overburdened schools and hospitals, increased crime, and a depleted social safety net.

Tolerance for illegal immigration is not compassionate — it is cruel. One in three women is sexually assaulted on the long journey north. Smugglers use migrant children as human pawns to exploit our laws and gain access to our country.

Human traffickers and sex traffickers take advantage of the wide open areas between our ports of entry to smuggle thousands of young girls and women into the United States and to sell them into prostitution and modern-day slavery.

Tens of thousands of innocent Americans are killed by lethal drugs that cross our border and flood into our cities — including meth, heroin, cocaine, and fentanyl.

The savage gang, MS-13, now operates in 20 different American States, and they almost all come through our southern border. Just yesterday, an MS-13 gang member was taken into custody for a fatal shooting on a subway platform in New York City. We are removing these gang members by the thousands, but until we secure our border they’re going to keep streaming back in.

Year after year, countless Americans are murdered by criminal illegal aliens.

I’ve gotten to know many wonderful Angel Moms, Dads, and families – no one should ever have to suffer the horrible heartache they have endured.

Here tonight is Debra Bissell. Just three weeks ago, Debra’s parents, Gerald and Sharon, were burglarized and shot to death in their Reno, Nevada, home by an illegal alien. They were in their eighties and are survived by four children, 11 grandchildren, and 20 great-grandchildren. Also here tonight are Gerald and Sharon’s granddaughter, Heather, and great‑granddaughter, Madison.

To Debra, Heather, Madison, please stand: few can understand your pain. But I will never forget, and I will fight for the memory of Gerald and Sharon, that it should never happen again.

Not one more American life should be lost because our Nation failed to control its very dangerous border.

In the last 2 years, our brave ICE officers made 266,000 arrests of criminal aliens, including those charged or convicted of nearly 100,000 assaults, 30,000 sex crimes, and 4,000 killings.

We are joined tonight by one of those law enforcement heroes: ICE Special Agent Elvin Hernandez. When Elvin was a boy, he and his family legally immigrated to the United States from the Dominican Republic. At the age of eight, Elvin told his dad he wanted to become a Special Agent. Today, he leads investigations into the scourge of international sex trafficking. Elvin says: “If I can make sure these young girls get their justice, I’ve done my job.” Thanks to his work and that of his colleagues, more than 300 women and girls have been rescued from horror and more than 1,500 sadistic traffickers have been put behind bars in the last year.

Special Agent Hernandez, please stand: We will always support the brave men and women of Law Enforcement — and I pledge to you tonight that we will never abolish our heroes from ICE.

My Administration has sent to the Congress a commonsense proposal to end the crisis on our southern border.

It includes humanitarian assistance, more law enforcement, drug detection at our ports, closing loopholes that enable child smuggling, and plans for a new physical barrier, or wall, to secure the vast areas between our ports of entry. In the past, most of the people in this room voted for a wall — but the proper wall never got built. I’ll get it built.

This is a smart, strategic, see-through steel barrier — not just a simple concrete wall. It will be deployed in the areas identified by border agents as having the greatest need, and as these agents will tell you, where walls go up, illegal crossings go way down.

San Diego used to have the most illegal border crossings in the country. In response, and at the request of San Diego residents and political leaders, a strong security wall was put in place. This powerful barrier almost completely ended illegal crossings.

The border city of El Paso, Texas, used to have extremely high rates of violent crime — one of the highest in the country, and considered one of our Nation’s most dangerous cities. Now, with a powerful barrier in place, El Paso is one of our safest cities.

Simply put, walls work and walls save lives. So let’s work together, compromise, and reach a deal that will truly make America safe.

As we work to defend our people’s safety, we must also ensure our economic resurgence continues at a rapid pace.

No one has benefitted more from our thriving economy than women, who have filled 58 percent of the new jobs created in the last year. All Americans can be proud that we have more women in the workforce than ever before — and exactly one century after the Congress passed the Constitutional amendment giving women the right to vote, we also have more women serving in the Congress than ever before.

As part of our commitment to improving opportunity for women everywhere, this Thursday we are launching the first ever Government-wide initiative focused on economic empowerment for women in developing countries.

To build on our incredible economic success, one priority is paramount — reversing decades of calamitous trade policies.

We are now making it clear to China that after years of targeting our industries, and stealing our intellectual property, the theft of American jobs and wealth has come to an end.

Therefore, we recently imposed tariffs on $250 billion of Chinese goods — and now our Treasury is receiving billions of dollars a month from a country that never gave us a dime. But I don’t blame China for taking advantage of us — I blame our leaders and representatives for allowing this travesty to happen. I have great respect for President Xi, and we are now working on a new trade deal with China. But it must include real, structural change to end unfair trade practices, reduce our chronic trade deficit, and protect American jobs.

Another historic trade blunder was the catastrophe known as NAFTA.

I have met the men and women of Michigan, Ohio, Pennsylvania, Indiana, New Hampshire, and many other States whose dreams were shattered by NAFTA. For years, politicians promised them they would negotiate for a better deal. But no one ever tried — until now.

Our new U.S.-Mexico-Canada Agreement — or USMCA — will replace NAFTA and deliver for American workers: bringing back our manufacturing jobs, expanding American agriculture, protecting intellectual property, and ensuring that more cars are proudly stamped with four beautiful words: made in the USA.

Tonight, I am also asking you to pass the United States Reciprocal Trade Act, so that if another country places an unfair tariff on an American product, we can charge them the exact same tariff on the same product that they sell to us.

Both parties should be able to unite for a great rebuilding of America’s crumbling infrastructure.

I know that the Congress is eager to pass an infrastructure bill — and I am eager to work with you on legislation to deliver new and important infrastructure investment, including investments in the cutting edge industries of the future. This is not an option. This is a necessity.

The next major priority for me, and for all of us, should be to lower the cost of healthcare and prescription drugs — and to protect patients with pre-existing conditions.

Already, as a result of my Administration’s efforts, in 2018 drug prices experienced their single largest decline in 46 years.

But we must do more. It is unacceptable that Americans pay vastly more than people in other countries for the exact same drugs, often made in the exact same place. This is wrong, unfair, and together we can stop it.

I am asking the Congress to pass legislation that finally takes on the problem of global freeloading and delivers fairness and price transparency for American patients. We should also require drug companies, insurance companies, and hospitals to disclose real prices to foster competition and bring costs down.

No force in history has done more to advance the human condition than American freedom. In recent years we have made remarkable progress in the fight against HIV and AIDS. Scientific breakthroughs have brought a once-distant dream within reach. My budget will ask Democrats and Republicans to make the needed commitment to eliminate the HIV epidemic in the United States within 10 years. Together, we will defeat AIDS in America.

Tonight, I am also asking you to join me in another fight that all Americans can get behind: the fight against childhood cancer.

Joining Melania in the gallery this evening is a very brave 10-year-old girl, Grace Eline. Every birthday since she was 4, Grace asked her friends to donate to St. Jude Children’s Research Hospital. She did not know that one day she might be a patient herself. Last year, Grace was diagnosed with brain cancer. Immediately, she began radiation treatment. At the same time, she rallied her community and raised more than $40,000 for the fight against cancer. When Grace completed treatment last fall, her doctors and nurses cheered with tears in their eyes as she hung up a poster that read: “Last Day of Chemo.” Grace — you are an inspiration to us all.

Many childhood cancers have not seen new therapies in decades. My budget will ask the Congress for $500 million over the next 10 years to fund this critical life-saving research.

To help support working parents, the time has come to pass school choice for America’s children. I am also proud to be the first President to include in my budget a plan for nationwide paid family leave — so that every new parent has the chance to bond with their newborn child.

There could be no greater contrast to the beautiful image of a mother holding her infant child than the chilling displays our Nation saw in recent days. Lawmakers in New York cheered with delight upon the passage of legislation that would allow a baby to be ripped from the mother’s womb moments before birth. These are living, feeling, beautiful babies who will never get the chance to share their love and dreams with the world. And then, we had the case of the Governor of Virginia where he basically stated he would execute a baby after birth.

To defend the dignity of every person, I am asking the Congress to pass legislation to prohibit the late-term abortion of children who can feel pain in the mother’s womb.

Let us work together to build a culture that cherishes innocent life. And let us reaffirm a fundamental truth: all children — born and unborn — are made in the holy image of God.

The final part of my agenda is to protect America’s National Security.

Over the last 2 years, we have begun to fully rebuild the United States Military — with $700 billion last year and $716 billion this year. We are also getting other nations to pay their fair share. For years, the United States was being treated very unfairly by NATO — but now we have secured a $100 billion increase in defense spending from NATO allies.

As part of our military build-up, the United States is developing a state-of-the-art Missile Defense System.

Under my Administration, we will never apologize for advancing America’s interests.

For example, decades ago the United States entered into a treaty with Russia in which we agreed to limit and reduce our missile capabilities. While we followed the agreement to the letter, Russia repeatedly violated its terms. That is why I announced that the United States is officially withdrawing from the Intermediate-Range Nuclear Forces Treaty, or INF Treaty.

Perhaps we can negotiate a different agreement, adding China and others, or perhaps we can’t –- in which case, we will outspend and out-innovate all others by far.

As part of a bold new diplomacy, we continue our historic push for peace on the Korean Peninsula. Our hostages have come home, nuclear testing has stopped, and there has not been a missile launch in 15 months. If I had not been elected President of the United States, we would right now, in my opinion, be in a major war with North Korea with potentially millions of people killed. Much work remains to be done, but my relationship with Kim Jong Un is a good one. And Chairman Kim and I will meet again on February 27 and 28 in Vietnam.

Two weeks ago, the United States officially recognized the legitimate government of Venezuela, and its new interim President, Juan Guaido.

We stand with the Venezuelan people in their noble quest for freedom — and we condemn the brutality of the Maduro regime, whose socialist policies have turned that nation from being the wealthiest in South America into a state of abject poverty and despair.

Here, in the United States, we are alarmed by new calls to adopt socialism in our country. America was founded on liberty and independence –- not government coercion, domination, and control. We are born free, and we will stay free. Tonight, we renew our resolve that America will never be a socialist country.

One of the most complex set of challenges we face is in the Middle East.

Our approach is based on principled realism — not discredited theories that have failed for decades to yield progress. For this reason, my Administration recognized the true capital of Israel — and proudly opened the American Embassy in Jerusalem.

Our brave troops have now been fighting in the Middle East for almost 19 years. In Afghanistan and Iraq, nearly 7,000 American heroes have given their lives. More than 52,000 Americans have been badly wounded. We have spent more than $7 trillion in the Middle East.

As a candidate for President, I pledged a new approach. Great nations do not fight endless wars.

When I took office, ISIS controlled more than 20,000 square miles in Iraq and Syria. Today, we have liberated virtually all of that territory from the grip of these bloodthirsty killers.

Now, as we work with our allies to destroy the remnants of ISIS, it is time to give our brave warriors in Syria a warm welcome home.

I have also accelerated our negotiations to reach a political settlement in Afghanistan. Our troops have fought with unmatched valor — and thanks to their bravery, we are now able to pursue a political solution to this long and bloody conflict.

In Afghanistan, my Administration is holding constructive talks with a number of Afghan groups, including the Taliban. As we make progress in these negotiations, we will be able to reduce our troop presence and focus on counter-terrorism. We do not know whether we will achieve an agreement — but we do know that after two decades of war, the hour has come to at least try for peace.

Above all, friend and foe alike must never doubt this Nation’s power and will to defend our people. Eighteen years ago, terrorists attacked the USS Cole — and last month American forces killed one of the leaders of the attack.

We are honored to be joined tonight by Tom Wibberley, whose son, Navy Seaman Craig Wibberley, was one of the 17 sailors we tragically lost. Tom: we vow to always remember the heroes of the USS Cole.

My Administration has acted decisively to confront the world’s leading state sponsor of terror: the radical regime in Iran.

To ensure this corrupt dictatorship never acquires nuclear weapons, I withdrew the United States from the disastrous Iran nuclear deal. And last fall, we put in place the toughest sanctions ever imposed on a country.

We will not avert our eyes from a regime that chants death to America and threatens genocide against the Jewish people. We must never ignore the vile poison of anti-Semitism, or those who spread its venomous creed. With one voice, we must confront this hatred anywhere and everywhere it occurs.

Just months ago, 11 Jewish-Americans were viciously murdered in an anti-semitic attack on the Tree of Life Synagogue in Pittsburgh. SWAT Officer Timothy Matson raced into the gunfire and was shot seven times chasing down the killer. Timothy has just had his 12th surgery — but he made the trip to be here with us tonight. Officer Matson: we are forever grateful for your courage in the face of evil.

Tonight, we are also joined by Pittsburgh survivor Judah Samet. He arrived at the synagogue as the massacre began. But not only did Judah narrowly escape death last fall — more than seven decades ago, he narrowly survived the Nazi concentration camps. Today is Judah’s 81st birthday. Judah says he can still remember the exact moment, nearly 75 years ago, after 10 months in a concentration camp, when he and his family were put on a train, and told they were going to another camp. Suddenly the train screeched to a halt. A soldier appeared. Judah’s family braced for the worst. Then, his father cried out with joy: “It’s the Americans.”

A second Holocaust survivor who is here tonight, Joshua Kaufman, was a prisoner at Dachau Concentration Camp. He remembers watching through a hole in the wall of a cattle car as American soldiers rolled in with tanks. “To me,” Joshua recalls, “the American soldiers were proof that God exists, and they came down from the sky.”

I began this evening by honoring three soldiers who fought on D-Day in the Second World War. One of them was Herman Zeitchik. But there is more to Herman’s story. A year after he stormed the beaches of Normandy, Herman was one of those American soldiers who helped liberate Dachau. He was one of the Americans who helped rescue Joshua from that hell on earth. Almost 75 years later, Herman and Joshua are both together in the gallery tonight — seated side-by-side, here in the home of American freedom. Herman and Joshua: your presence this evening honors and uplifts our entire Nation.

When American soldiers set out beneath the dark skies over the English Channel in the early hours of D-Day, 1944, they were just young men of 18 and 19, hurtling on fragile landing craft toward the most momentous battle in the history of war.

They did not know if they would survive the hour. They did not know if they would grow old. But they knew that America had to prevail. Their cause was this Nation, and generations yet unborn.

Why did they do it? They did it for America — they did it for us.

Everything that has come since — our triumph over communism, our giant leaps of science and discovery, our unrivaled progress toward equality and justice — all of it is possible thanks to the blood and tears and courage and vision of the Americans who came before.

Think of this Capitol — think of this very chamber, where lawmakers before you voted to end slavery, to build the railroads and the highways, to defeat fascism, to secure civil rights, to face down an evil empire.

Here tonight, we have legislators from across this magnificent republic. You have come from the rocky shores of Maine and the volcanic peaks of Hawaii; from the snowy woods of Wisconsin and the red deserts of Arizona; from the green farms of Kentucky and the golden beaches of California. Together, we represent the most extraordinary Nation in all of history.

What will we do with this moment? How will we be remembered?

I ask the men and women of this Congress: Look at the opportunities before us! Our most thrilling achievements are still ahead. Our most exciting journeys still await. Our biggest victories are still to come. We have not yet begun to dream.

We must choose whether we are defined by our differences — or whether we dare to transcend them.

We must choose whether we will squander our inheritance — or whether we will proudly declare that we are Americans. We do the incredible. We defy the impossible. We conquer the unknown.

This is the time to re-ignite the American imagination. This is the time to search for the tallest summit, and set our sights on the brightest star. This is the time to rekindle the bonds of love and loyalty and memory that link us together as citizens, as neighbors, as patriots.

This is our future — our fate — and our choice to make. I am asking you to choose greatness.

No matter the trials we face, no matter the challenges to come, we must go forward together.

We must keep America first in our hearts. We must keep freedom alive in our souls. And we must always keep faith in America’s destiny — that one Nation, under God, must be the hope and the promise and the light and the glory among all the nations of the world!

The slogan stands for “Make America Great Again,” which is President Donald Trump’s signature campaign motto.

The posts on the two Instagram pages attributed to Cruz appear fixated on weaponry, not politics, though. However, CNN gained access to an Instagram group in which the network claims Cruz wrote racist posts. Cruz allegedly “repeatedly espoused racist, homophobic and anti-Semitic views and displayed an obsession with violence and guns,” reported CNN, including writing that he hated “jews, ni**ers, immigrants” and talking “about killing Mexicans, keeping black people in chains and cutting their necks.” According to CNN, he also wrote that he had written a letter to Trump and wrote “I think I am going to kill people.”

The MAGA hat makes an appearance in a profile picture on one of the Instagram pages that Heavy has verified belonged to Cruz, 19, an expelled student who is accused of going on a rampage with an AR-15 weapon. On the page with the MAGA hat, the accused school shooter went by the handle @nikolascruzmakarov; MAGA stands for the slogan “Make America Great Again” and is President Donald Trump’s campaign motto. Makarov is the name of a Russian-made pistol. (You can read tributes to the victims here.)

CNN obtained a video the network said was of the shooter undertaking target practice while wearing a MAGA hat.

Instagram released a statement on the account with the MAGA hat, writing, “This is a terrible tragedy and our hearts go out to the people who have been affected. There is absolutely no place on our platforms for people who commit such horrendous acts. We have found and immediately deleted the shooter’s accounts on Facebook and Instagram.”

Instagram implicitly confirming that an account with a MAGA Trump hat avatar belonged to gunman Nikolas Cruz. Asked why the account was removed, spokesperson says: pic.twitter.com/LdXb73iCj8 — Jon Swaine (@jonswaine) February 15, 2018

President Trump expressed prayers for the victims. “My prayers and condolences to the families of the victims of the terrible Florida shooting. No child, teacher or anyone else should ever feel unsafe in an American school,” Trump wrote on Twitter. “Just spoke to Governor Rick Scott. We are working closely with law enforcement on the terrible Florida school shooting.”

Trump held a press conference on February 15, in which he said the shooter had “opened fire on defenseless students and teachers.” The president added, “Our entire nation with one heavy heart is praying for the victims and their families.” He pledged that the government “was here for you” to the victims’ families. “We are all joined together as one American family,” Trump said. “…No child, no teacher should ever be in danger in an American school.” The president said that “we hold onto God’s word in scripture.” He said he wanted to speak directly to “America’s children,” adding, “I want you to know that you are never alone, and you never will be.”

To be clear, authorities have not said that politics played any role in the shootings. They have indicated that they are not certain of the motive, and those who knew Cruz described him to various Florida and national media outlets as an odd loner obsessed with guns. His social media pages focus on weaponry, both guns and knives. However, the MAGA hat is one detail in the fuller biography of the accused shooter, and the social posts, in totality, help give a picture of the man.

There are unconfirmed allegations that the suspect held extremist views. Jordan Jereb told the Associated Press that Cruz was a member of the white supremacist militia group Republic of Florida and “participated in paramilitary drills in Tallahassee.” Jordan, a leader in the militia that has been described as similar to the Ku Klux Klan, told the AP that Cruz had previous trouble with a female and might have chosen Valentine’s Day for the massacre for that reason. According to Daily Beast, Jereb says a member of the group may have given Cruz a rifle. However, local authorities in Tallahassee, where the group is based now say they can find no link between Nikolas Cruz and the ROF militia group, according to Tallahassee.com. Authorities conducted a gun trace and say that Cruz bought the gun he used.

The ROF leader Jordan Jereb told the Associated Press that Cruz was a member of the ROF and “participated in paramilitary drills in Tallahassee.” He told AP that Cruz had previous trouble with a female and might have chosen Valentine’s Day for the massacre for that reason. “He acted on his own behalf of what he just did and he’s solely responsible for what he just did,” Jordan Jereb told the AP. ROF has its own YouTube channel. Jereb is a convicted felon. According to the Southern Poverty Law Center, Jereb once “professed his love for Molotov cocktails and shared a video that details an argument for when it’s okay to shoot a police officer.” His Twitter page has now been suspended.

Some people argued on social media that Cruz was actually a registered Democrat based on the voter registration of a Nicolas Cruz in Florida whose birthday is in May 1998. However, the Broward sheriff said in a press conference that the Nikolas Cruz accused of being the school shooter was born in September 1998, not in May (you can watch that comment below). The accused school shooter’s name is spelled Nikolas, not Nicolas, although many in the news media initially went with the latter. The New York Times also verified Cruz’s Instagram page. A check of the voter registration database in Florida using the DOB provided in court records for Nikolas Cruz shows he was not registered to vote in that state.

Sheriff Scott Israel on shooting suspect Nikolas Cruz: ""He is 19 years old. He was born in 1998, in September. He was a former student of Douglas High School. He got expelled for disciplinary reasons. I don't know the specifics."" https://t.co/1Y5NBGZMdE pic.twitter.com/50arcfyLuy — CBS News (@CBSNews) February 14, 2018

The Daily Beast reported that, according to Ocean Parodie, 17, “Cruz always had his hair short and had a penchant for wearing patriotic shirts that ‘seemed really extreme, like hating on’ Islam…The suspected gunman would also deride Muslims as ‘terrorists and bombers.’” Parodie also told Daily Beast: “I’ve seen him wear a Trump hat.”

The suspect posted on Instagram about a Google search for the phrase “Allahu Akbar” in 2015 but the caption said, “Well at least we now know what it means when a sand durka says ‘allahu Akbar’ ??????”

Some people have been using that post to argue the suspect supported ISIS or Islamic terrorism, but the post showed he was joking about terrorism and wanted to kill terrorists. He wrote: “Durka durka Mohamed jihad .. how do I work this oh oh I mess up cooo booom!!…durka durka … bam boom explosions,” and included a series of bomb smilies. The Sheriff said it’s too early to say whether there was a terrorism motive, but authorities haven’t found anything pointing to that. They have not yet released a motive. The alleged shooter was previously expelled from the high school in Parkland, Florida for disciplinary reasons.

A user named Nikolas Cruz left disturbing comments on Youtube videos, CNN reported. One, made seven months ago, was posted on a video clip from the NatGeo show “Alaska State Troopers: Armed and Dangerous.” It read: “I am going to kill law enforcement one day they go after the good people.” Six months ago, the user wrote, “Im going watch them sheep fall f*ck antifa i wish to kill as many as i can,” on a Youtube video titled “Antifa Gun Club.”

Also nine months ago, the user commented, “I am going to do what he did,” on a video about the 1966 sniper shooting at the University of Texas.

One man posted a video in which he claimed that the FBI had visited him about Cruz. The man said in the video that, in September 2017, he took a screenshot of a comment on one of his videos on YouTube. It came in under the name Nikolas Cruz and said “I am going to be a professional school shooter.” He reported the comment to YouTube and tried to email it to the FBI to no avail. Two FBI agents did come to talk to him, he says in the video.

The suspect made disturbing posts on Instagram and the pages attributed to him are filled with photos of guns. He posted a photo of a dead toad and wrote, “These things killed my dog. So I kill them pretty much. #killingtoads.” His Instagram profile contained the word: “Annihilator.” Cruz posted a series of photos of weapons with a message about shooting being a form of “group therapy” for him. Some news sites initially gave the suspect’s name as Nicolas de Jesus Cruz or Nicolas Cruz. He is also called Nick Cruz by some people who knew him.

Giovonni Watford, a former student at Marjory Stoneman Douglas High School, told BuzzFeed News that Cruz was in the Junior ROTC program but “was off. He was super stressed-out all the time and talked about guns a lot and tried to hide his face.” According to Buzzfeed, Watford says that Cruz complained he was bullied.

Other posts being circulated on social media are not Cruz’s. According to Buzzfeed, “A fake ‘antifa’ account is also a hoax about the suspect wearing an antifa T-shirt. However, the man in the picture is a 24-year-old named Marcel Fontaine, not the suspect.”

The world's chocolate supply could melt into a shortage within a few decades, and the maker of M&M's, Snickers and Twix hopes scientists can save humanity's sweetest invention.

Rising temperatures from climate change threaten to shrink the slim strip of rainforests around the equator where the cacao trees used to make chocolate thrive, according to a 2016 review from the National Oceanic and Atmospheric Administration (NOAA). And the two West African nations that produce over half of the world's chocolate — Ghana and Ivory Coast — would feel the heat.

""By 2050, rising temperatures will push the suitable cacao cultivation areas uphill,"" the article found, doubling the altitude needed for prime cacao production in the two nations. In nations like Ghana, moving cacao farming to higher ground could mean disrupting natural habitats and protected reserves.

That's why candy maker Mars pledged $1 billion last September toward sustainability efforts aimed at saving chocolate, Business Insider reports, with the corporation recruiting University of California researchers to develop a sturdier cacoa plant that won't wilt in drier climates.

It all could come down to CRISPR, a tool developed by UC Berkeley geneticist Jennifer Doudna that lets scientists tinker with DNA strands to potentially alter anything from produce to people. Already, genome researcher Myeong-Je Cho is growing cacao seedlings at the university that may let cacao farms stay put even as environmental shifts occur, according to the report.

Warnings of chocolate's precarious future aren't new: Years ago, Mars cautioned that consumer demand for cocoa would exceed supply by 2020, creating a chocolate deficit. Some at the time, including the International Cocoa Organization, called such doomsday predictions overblown.

However dire chocolate's state, the researchers whose work predicted the 2050 conditions signaled hope that the industry could change.

""These changes in climatic suitability are predicted to take place over a time period of almost 40 years, so they will mostly impact the next rather than the current generation of cocoa trees and farmers,"" Peter Läderach and his co-authors said in a 2013 study.

""In other words, there is time for adaptation.”

You can see some of his posts below, but be aware that they are troubling.

A fuller picture of the suspect, who is in custody, is emerging from his social media posts. The scene at the school was horrific and labeled by the Florida governor as an act of “pure evil”; one girl told WSVN7-TV: “People were halfway down the stairwell, it just stopped, the alarm stopped. And we heard gunshots coming from the first floor, the second floor and people were running upstairs. We all got upstairs and into our classroom. As (my teacher) was closing the door he was actually shot and killed right there.” Twelve of the victims were slain inside the high school, authorities said.

Nick Cruz had at least two Instagram pages. The Instagram pages show a fixation with guns and knives. In one, the profile picture includes a MAGA hat. Authorities say that he committed the massacre with an AR-15 semi-automatic rifle. Fifteen other people were wounded in what is Florida’s worst school shooting ever. (You can read tributes to the victims here.)

The Daily Beast reported that, according to Ocean Parodie, 17, “Cruz always had his hair short and had a penchant for wearing patriotic shirts that ‘seemed really extreme, like hating on’ Islam…The suspected gunman would also deride Muslims as ‘terrorists and bombers.’” Parodie also told Daily Beast: “I’ve seen him wear a Trump hat.”

In another, the page contains a photo of a dead toad and the caption, “These things killed my dog. So I kill them pretty much. #killingtoads.” His Instagram profile contained the word: “Annihilator.”

It couldn’t be more blatant; on one of the Instagram pages, there is a series of photos of weapons with a message about shooting being a form of “group therapy” for him. The 19-year-old accused school shooter went by the handle cruz_nikolas on one of the pages. The shooter is accused of stalking the halls of the high school right before classes were to be dismissed; U.S. Sen. Bill Nelson said Cruz pulled a fire alarm, threw smoke bombs, and shot people confused by the chaos.

On the page with the MAGA hat, the accused school shooter went by the handle @nikolascruzmakarov; MAGA stands for the slogan “Make America Great Again” and is President Donald Trump’s campaign motto. Makarov is the name of a Russian-made pistol.

Some news sites initially gave the suspect’s name as Nicolas de Jesus Cruz or Nicolas Cruz. He is also called Nick Cruz by some people who knew him.

Cruz is a former student at the Florida high school that has a student body of several thousand, according to The Miami Herald. He was previously expelled from the school. Broward Sheriff Scott Israel described a scene of carnage and tragedy; in addition to the 12 people killed inside the high school, two other people were found deceased outside the building, one victim was dead in the street, and two people made it to the hospital but died there.

Some of those who knew Cruz told the news media that they were aware of his fascination with weaponry – an obsession he amply displayed in public through the social media platform. One student told WSVN: “He’s been a troubled kid, and he’s always had a certain amount of issues going on. He shot guns because he felt it gave him, I guess, an exhilarating feeling.”

Cruz was open about his intentions to amass an arsenal. For example, in 2016, Cruz’s page posted a photo of a shotgun and the caption said he wanted to buy it: “I plan on getting this but I need more information on it so if someone could give advice on how much I’m spending and background cheeks please to god let me know.” Here’s that photo:

The latest school shooting to horrify the United States has ignited the gun control debate once again, and Nikolas Cruz’ social media posts are likely to add fuel to that discussion because they are filled with weaponry. Some people argued on social media that Cruz was actually a registered Democrat based on the voter registration of a Nicolas Cruz in Florida whose birthday is in May 1998. However, the Broward sheriff said in a press conference that the Nikolas Cruz accused of being the school shooter was born in September 1998, not in May (you can watch that comment here.) The accused school shooter’s name is spelled Nikolas, not Nicolas, although many in the news media initially went with the latter. The New York Times also verified Cruz’s Instagram page.

The sheriff told the news media that the suspect’s disturbing social media posts are under review. A youth named Oli wrote on Twitter: “I knew the kid who shot up the school he had a ton of mental health issues that just got ignored by all the adults. He literally had an Instagram where he posted pictures of animals he killed gruesomely and he physically assaulted one of my friends once.”

One page was more recent. On the second, the photos of weapons were posted in 2015 and 2016 to the Instagram page, including comments about wanting to purchase guns. The page has since been taken down, although Heavy has verified that it belonged to the school shooting suspect. Here is another one of the other troubling photos that were posted on the suspect’s Instagram page. He showed an interest in knives as well as guns:

The suspect posted about a Google search for the phrase “Allahu Akbar” in 2015 but the caption said, “Well at least we now know what it means when a sand durka says ‘allahu Akbar’ ??????” He also posted a graphic of a bull’s eye with bullet holes in it, that contains the phrase “Group therapy, sometimes it works.” He wrote in a caption: “It really does f*cking work give it a try ;).”

According to The Washington Times, Nikolas Cruz “has been identified as a former Army JROTC member wielding an assault rifle,” although authorities have not yet confirmed that account. Here is the Instagram post that mentions Allahu Akbar. Some people have been using that post to argue the suspect supported ISIS or Islamic terrorism but the post showed he was joking about terrorism and wanted to kill terrorists. He wrote: “Durka durka Mohamed jihad .. how do I work this oh oh I mess up cooo booom!!…durka durka … bam boom explosions,” and included a series of bomb smilies. The Sheriff said it’s too early to say whether there was a terrorism motive but authorities haven’t found anything pointing to that. They have not yet released a motive.

The suspect also showed anger in some of his Instagram posts. For example, he posted a photo of himself giving the middle finger to the world, writing, “F*ck youuuuuuuuuuuu allllll.” A horrific scene unfolded at the school on the afternoon of February 14, 2018 as students hid under desks, ran for their lives and waited for the SWAT team to clear their classrooms. Football coach Aaron Feis is being hailed as a hero for trying to protect students; his condition is not known.

According to The Miami Herald, Cruz was a known threat. “A teacher at the school told the Miami Herald that Cruz, 19, had been identified as a potential threat to fellow students in the past,” reported the newspaper, saying that Cruz was accused in the past of making threats. The eyewitness accounts were terrifying. Sarah Crescitelli hid in a bathroom and texted her parents: “If I don’t make it I love you and I appreciated everything you did for me,” according to The Herald.

Student Daniel Huerfano told Fox News that Nikolas Cruz “was that weird kid that you see…like a loner.” Another girl told Fox that Cruz was allegedly “expelled last year after fighting with his ex-girlfriend’s new boyfriend. She said Cruz was abusive to the girl.”

There were allegations that the suspect held extremist views. Jordan Jereb told the Associated Press that Cruz was a member of the white supremacist militia group Republic of Florida and “participated in paramilitary drills in Tallahassee.” Jordan, a leader in the militia that has been described as similar to the Ku Klux Klan, told the AP that Cruz had previous trouble with a female and might have chosen Valentine’s Day for the massacre for that reason. According to Daily Beast, Jereb says a member of the group may have given Cruz a rifle. However, local authorities in Tallahassee, where the group is based now say they can find no link between Nikolas Cruz and the ROF militia group, according to Tallahassee.com. Authorities conducted a gun trace and say that Cruz bought the gun he used.

The Sun-Sentinel reported that Cruz was adopted by a “loving older couple,” but his father had died years before and his mother died just over three months before the school shooting. His parents were named Lynda and Roger Cruz, and they also adopted his brother, the newspaper reported. She was a homemaker, and he worked in advertising, according to The Sun-Sentinel.

Trevor Hart, 16, told The Sun-Sentinel that Cruz “participated in Army ROTC at the high school,” had a “bunch of weapons” and Cruz had “talked about shooting lizards, squirrels and frogs.”

Other posts being circulated on social media are not Cruz’s. According to Buzzfeed, “A fake ‘antifa’ account is also spreading a hoax about the suspect wearing an antifa T-shirt. However, the man in the picture is a 24-year-old named Marcel Fontaine, not the suspect.”

Update via AP: Federal authorities announced on Tuesday they have ended their investigation of the fatal police shooting of John Crawford III in a Walmart store, concluding there wasn’t enough evidence to charge the white officer who killed him.​

Original reporting, Sept. 5, 2014: The phone call plays back in John Crawford Jr.'s head ""every day, all day"" since Aug. 5.

The mother of his son's young children – boys, five months and nearly 2 – was screaming.

Crawford Jr. was in Fairfield on business that Tuesday and had stopped by to see if his son, John Crawford III, would join him for dinner. But his son had already left for a cookout in Dayton, Ohio.

""Mr. John. Mr. John. They shot him. They shot him,"" Crawford recalls the cries from LeeCee Johnson.

She put her cell phone on speaker.

""You could hear in the background he was gasping,"" John Crawford Jr. told The Enquirer in a phone interview this week from his home in Jackson, Tenn. ""I'm virtually listening to my kid taking his last breath.""

Crawford Jr. painted the dramatic scene Thursday as he talked to The Enquirer about his son's life and what he wants from the investigation into his son's fatal shooting by police at a Walmart in the Dayton suburb of Beavercreek on Aug. 5.

The shooting has drawn national attention in the wake of the death of 18-year-old Michael Brown, who was gunned down by a Ferguson, Mo., police officer and a series of shootings of black males by police elsewhere. The Crawford investigation has even become an issue in the November election as Ohio Attorney General's Mike DeWine's contender David Pepper has suggested DeWine's involvement in the Crawford investigation is unethical.

The shooting came seven days after Crawford Jr. had celebrated his son's 22nd birthday together with a few rounds of pool at Memories Sports Bar in Fairfield, where Crawford III had resided for three or four years following graduation from Greensburg Christian Academy in Indiana.

Crawford III had lived in Cincinnati pretty much all of his life, attending at least 11 private, public or charter schools since entering the first grade in 1998, Cincinnati Public School records show. Crawford Jr., who had never married his son's mother, Tressa Sherrod of Fairfield, said he visited their only son nearly every weekend.

On that day at Memories, Crawford III, frustrated by not being able to find a job, had confided to his father that he wanted to start college. Crawford III, who had played football in high school, had shopped around for a football scholarship after high school, his father said. When that didn't happen, sons John IV and Jayden came along and plans for college were put on hold.

'He was figuring out his next step'

Crawford Jr. described his son as a typical 22-year-old who was laid back and very family oriented. He had once considered going into the military, following in the footsteps of a grandfather who served in the Army.

Hamilton County court records show that Crawford III had some minor scrapes with the law – two payout tickets for marijuana possession and a disorderly conduct charge.

He was charged with serious felonies in 2013 for allegedly carrying a concealed weapon and for aggravated robbery involving an incident at Clovernook Country Club. However, a Hamilton County grand jury declined to indict Crawford III. His father said Crawford III was wrongly accused and was charged because he was in a car with his cousin, but had no involvement in what happened.

""He was just figuring it out. He was figuring out his next step. I remember when I was 22,"" said Crawford Jr., a college graduate who worked in the court system in Tennessee for two decades. ""Unfortunately, all of that was cut down on the night of Aug. 5,""

That's when authorities have said that Crawford III was walking around the Walmart store with a MK-177 BB/Pellet Rifle. He was pronounced dead at Miami Valley Hospital around 9:25 p.m. shortly after police officers opened fire at the store.

Crawford Jr. said his son was at the store with a female friend to pick up picnic items on the way to a cookout in Dayton. Crawford III walked around the store and away from the female friend after receiving a call from Johnson. She could not be reached for comment.

Crawford Jr. has disputed that his son was waving the air rifle around and had refused to comply with police commands to drop it. Police responded when customers called 911, believing the gun was real. Police have said they repeatedly told Crawford III to put the gun down.

What does security footage show?

Crawford Jr. said security footage of the shooting and the time leading up to it – which he and family lawyer, Michael Wright, have viewed – shows that his son was standing in an aisle of the pet department holding the air rifle with his left hand with the barrel pointing to the floor. Crawford III was talking on his cell phone to Johnson with his back to the officers when he was shot, his father said.

""The footage we saw, he didn't know the officers were in the store. There was no reaction (from him) at all by the time the trigger was pulled,"" Crawford Jr. said.

""We were waiting to see him menacing, waving this thing in a threatening position with women or children. None of that happened from the footage we saw. He wasn't doing anything. He was just standing there. The final analysis is that my son was murdered.""

""All this nonsense of (them saying) 'Put the weapon down' two or three times. There was no reaction from him. There couldn't have been a cadence given.""

Ohio Attorney General Mike DeWine has refused to release the surveillance video to the public while the Ohio Bureau of Criminal Investigation (BCI), a branch of DeWine's office, investigates the shooting to determine if Beavercreek Officers Sean Williams or Sgt. David Darkow broke the law.

Wright said the coroner has told him that Crawford III was shot twice. The final autopsy report has not been completed. Crawford Jr. said the family has not been told which of the two officers shot his son. Williams remains off duty, while Darkow has returned to work.

The Greene County prosecutor has asked for a special prosecutor to avoid any appearance of a possible conflict of interest because DeWine – whose office would typically prosecute the case – used to be Green County prosecutor and his daughter now is an assistant prosecutor there.

Assistant Hamilton County Prosecutor Mark Piepmeier is now leading the prosecution team as special prosecutor. Wright has asked the U.S. Attorney's Office to take over the investigation and look into potential civil rights violation. He wants DeWine off the case altogether, saying DeWine is too close to people at the center of the investigation. It's a demand DeWine has refused.

DeWine's spokesman Dan Tierney said there's no conflict because DeWine is not directly involved in the investigation.

Beavercreek police officials asked for BCI to investigate the shooting because it was a conflict for them to fairly investigate their own officers, Tierney said. Greene County Prosecutor Stephen Haller sought a special prosecutor from the attorney general's office, but DeWine suggested Piepmeier because of his experience in prosecuting use of force cases.

Taking the investigation away from BCI and handing it over to another agency would cause a delay because the new agency would have to start from scratch, Tierney said.

""Our goal is to do a very thorough investigation but to make sure it is concluded in a compressed length of time to allow closure to the family,"" he said.

Crawford Jr. thinks that race played a factor in the shooting.

""I think there would have been more tolerance. We are not inside the cop's head. But I would be not honest with you if I didn't (say) there was a little bit of racial undertone in this whole situation,"" Crawford Jr. said.

That's why Wright and the family are trying to get the U.S. Department of Justice involved in the investigation.

""We do believe there was a violation of his civil rights and that does have to do with race,"" Wright said."

Charles M. Schulz

An Interview by Michael Barrier

[Click here to listen to a roughly one-minute/1,000 KB audio excerpt from the Schulz interview (MP3 player required); be prepared for rough sound quality.]

[My apologies to Jim Sasseville, who ghosted the ""Peanuts"" comic books for Schulz, for misspelling his name in the interview as originally posted. I spelled Sasseville's name phonetically, and incorrectly, in my 1988 transcript, and I somehow failed to correct that misspelling when I was editing and posting the interview. A full account of Sasseville's work with Schulz, by Derrick Bang, was published in The Comics Buyer's Guide No. 1473, February 8, 2002.]

In the late eighties and early nineties, I wrote features called ""Lessons of Leadership"" and ""Making It"" for Nation's Business, the magazine where I was a senior editor. The ""LOLs"" were about the heads of relatively large companies, the Making Its about the heads of relatively small ones. It was an enjoyable assignment, for the most part, one that involved lots of travel, some of it to places I actually wanted to go (Los Angeles, for instance, where I combined my work assignments with research for Hollywood Cartoons: American Animation in Its Golden Age). In choosing subjects for the features, I slipped in animation- and comics-related people as often as possible. Bill Melendez, director of the ""Peanuts"" TV shows, was a Making It, for example, as was Will Vinton, who was then still in charge of his Portland, Oregon, Claymation studio. I also wrote a Making It on Denis Kitchen, the publisher of alternative comics, and an LOL on Chet Krause, the publisher of Comics Buyer's Guide and other collector publications.

The subject of my only other comics-related LOL was Charles M. Schulz, whose ""Peanuts"" was by the late eighties generating licensing revenues, especially overseas, that made Schulz unquestionably a big businessmanalthough, as he made clear to me, ""businessman"" was not a title he would willingly accept. When I called his offices in Santa Rosa, California, about scheduling an interview, I was startled to be put through immediately to Schulz himself. Although Schulz worked in the same small building as Ron Nelson and Evelyn Ellison, who oversaw the licensing of his characters, the usual phalanx of assistants and PR people was missing. When my wife and I arrived for the interview, on August 1, 1988, it took place in the room where Schulz drew his comic strip, with him seated at the drawing board. In the interview, although Schulz professed no interest in business as such, he showed the same concern for the integrity of his ""product"" that any good businessman might show.

Schulz differed markedly in one respect from many of the people I interviewed, though. The typical entrepreneur is absorbed in his work almost to the point of self-parody. As I sometimes said in those days, I could have walked into most of my interviews wearing a grass skirt with a ring in my nose, and the person I was interviewing would have grabbed my arm and said, ""Let me tell you about my business."" Schulz, on the other hand, actually seemed interested in what Phyllis and I did and thought (there's some evidence of that in the excerpts that follow, and much more on the tape itself). I can't recall encountering a similar awareness of other people in anyone else I interviewed for an LOL, except for Julia Child, who like Schulz is a celebrity who is and is not a business person. As genuinely nice as Schulz was, though, he was also a very proud and competitive man, and that comes through clearly in the interview.

Schulz expressed skepticism about whether United Feature Syndicate would be able to successfully recycle old ""Peanuts"" strips after he retired. The last new ""Peanuts"" appeared early in 2000the last Sunday page appeared the day after Schulz's death on February 12 of that yearbut UFS is still distributing ""Classic Peanuts.""

The Schulz LOLbased not just on my interview with Schulz, but also on interviews with his associates Nelson and Ellison and Robert Roy Metz, head of United Media and its UFS subsidiaryturned out very well, I thought, but, sadly, it was mangled at the last minute in the editorial process. Scheduled to fill three pages, ""Working for 'Peanuts'"" was cut clumsily to make room for a half-page ad. I seem to have lost my copy of the article as I wrote it, but the first pagewhich was not damaged significantly in the editingis on display in Snoopy's Gallery in Santa Rosa, a block away from the new Charles M. Schulz Museum and Research Center that I write about in the Essays section of the site. For reasons best consigned to history, Nation's Business in those days sent the subjects of its LOLs the first page of each article as a metal plaque, and it is that plaque that is on display.

Excerpts from my interview with Schulz follow. For many more Schulz interviews, see Charles M. Schulz: Conversations (University Press of Mississippi), a collection edited by M. Thomas Inge.

BARRIER: My focus here is not on dollar figures, but on the way you have blended business and the creative side of your work. You've been able to balance the two over a long period of time, in a way that a lot of people in the comics haven't been able to do. The more typical thing seems to be like Jim Davis and ""Garfield,"" where you have essentially a corporate operation and a corporate comic strip.



SCHULZ: How'd you find that out?



BARRIER: There was a TV special; I didn't see it, but I understand they were quite explicit about the way the work is delegated. And, of course, you've had examples like Al Capp in the past. There were long stretches where Al Capp didn't do anything on the comic strip, except sign it.



SCHULZ: I never knew how Al worked; I never got to know him that well. He kept it pretty quiet.



BARRIER: People like Frank Frazetta, I know, drew the strip for a long time ...



SCHULZ: Probably drew all the girls.

BARRIER: I'm sure that's why he was hired. But from what I've heard about your work, you've always done everything on your strip. That must make you an exception, certainly among successful cartoonists.



SCHULZ: I suppose 1 or 2 percent. I just spent the last few hours with Pat Brady, who does ""Rose Is a Rose,"" and he does everything himself. I don't know the working habits of hardly any of the others; I know Lynn Johnston, who does all of her own thing. She's a wonderful lady, lives up in Canada; we talk to each other on the phone quite often. I don't know about Cathy Guisewite. I'm sure [Garry] Trudeau doesn't draw his strip.

[The conversation turned to Bill Watterson, whose comic strip ""Calvin and Hobbes"" was very popular at the time, and Schulz mentioned an Editor & Publisher item about Watterson's stipulation, for his appearance at a ""Pogo"" celebration in Ohio, that he would not be photographed or interviewed.]



BARRIER: That's kind of sad.

SCHULZ: Well, you know, you have an obligation, because this is not a pure art form. You have an obligation not only to the syndicate with which you work, but you have a strong obligation, I think, to the poor salesman out there who's marketing your work, going from newspaper to newspaper and setting up appointments with the hard-hearted editors and trying to sell your work. You have an obligation to a lot of people. If you're Picasso, or Andrew Wyeth, that's all right. But we're not Picasso or Andrew Wyeth.



[To Phyllis Barrier] Do you read the comics, too? There aren't very many worth reading.



BARRIER: One focus of this article, obviously, is going to be the licensing operation, because that's the real business side of your work. You were born in 1922, is that right?

SCHULZ: November 26.



BARRIER: So you would have been growing up in the early thirties, when the first wave of Disney licensed merchandise was coming through, and some other comic-strip licensing. You've mentioned in other interviews how much you were influenced by other comic strips, like ""Krazy Kat"" and ""Wash Tubbs""; but were you attracted by the licensed merchandise that was available then?



SCHULZ: I don't think we even paid any attention to it. I don't recall any licensing, except Mickey Mouse watches, which I never got. But I also recall that we always wanted some Buck Rogers things. Some of the other kids in the neighborhood and I loved Buck Rogers, and we always wanted a rocket pistol. I don't recall if they ever put out official rocket pistols or not. Beyond that, my only acquaintance with licensing would have been in comic magazines and Big Little Books. I used to buy every comic magazine that came out and every Big Little Book that came out, until finally they both became so popular and I was just overwhelmed and I couldn't keep up with them all. That was all, of course, just before the war. Then I was trying to think of how to get started, and I used to draw comic strips, and couldn't really establish myself in any particular direction, so I started drawing gag cartoons. I read all the magazines that published gag cartoons, and I used to buy all the gag-cartoon books that were reprintsthe New Yorker and Saturday Evening Post reprint books, and things like that. Books by George Price and all of those. I was concentrating on gag cartoons in those days. Then, of course, the war wiped me out for three years.



When I came back, that's when I got my job with Art Instruction. So I don't recall that much about licensing. I never even thought about it, and I certainly never thought about it when I began the strip. That was the farthest thing from my mind. I think the first thing that I was interested in was to get a reprint book, because along about '52, I suppose it was, Walt Kelly came out with Pogo, and I remember it had a writeup in Time magazine; I think it was just a dollar reprint in a small format. He had 80 papers, Time magazine said, and I thought that was astounding, because at the time I only had 40 and didn't think I'd ever get more than 40. Then one day I got a letter from the editor at Rinehart, and he had seen Schroeder play one of his first pieces, and being a pianist, had been quite impressed, because he'd never seen anybody use real music in a comic strip before. He began to read the strip, and I suppose he was influenced by the Pogo book, too, so he came out with our first dollar book. That was the first real licensed product. We had a regular series of them after that.

So, I never even thought about licensing; all I thought about was just trying to draw the strip as well as I could, each day. I realized this is a business, and I knew it was possible to make a lot of money at it, but I just wanted to draw something that was really good and was different. We never sought out any of the licensing, for years; everything that we ever did was the thought of someone else who came to us. Hungerford Plastics came to us with the idea to do that first set of dolls; I think there were six of them. Then he retired, and I don't know what happened to Hungerford Plastics; they just disappeared. Each person that came to us had a particular idea. Connie Boucher got the idea to do the datebooks, and that exploded; her company got bigger and bigger. Lee Mendelson was doing a series on Bay area personalities; he had done Willie Mays. He called me to see if I'd be interested, and I said yeah, I'd seen the Willie Mays, I thought it was wonderful. So he did a documentary, which never got on the air, but it opened up the chance to do A Charlie Brown Christmas.

Everything like that has always been somebody coming to me. Robert Short came to us with The Gospel According to Peanuts, Clark Gesner came to us with the idea for the play, the musical, You're A Good Man, Charlie Brown, the Ford Motor Company came to us with the big project to do those ads. We got criticized quite a bit for that, which is something that always puzzled me, why they thought that that should have been the wrong thing to do. We've received a little bit of criticism for doing the insurance ads. A lot of people apparently don't believe in insurance and hate insurance companies. Maybe they're justified; I hated them a couple of years ago when they were destroying skating rinks, too.



BARRIER: Oh, the liability insurance problem.



SCHULZ: Yeah. I suppose licensing now has become enormous; I don't think United Features even had a licensing department when I was drawing the first 20 years. They had a business manager, but that was it. I don't think he ever really went out and sought licensing; everything came to us. Now, this doesn't mean that he took everything, but the one thing that was different about mineand I'm not sure, there may have been others, but none that I know ofI think I was the first cartoonist who insisted that he see everything that was done. I tried to watch over all the products and make sure that what we did was right. I tried to make all the drawings that would appear, even though my contract didn't necessarily allow for that supervision. I've heard some cartoonists complain because their syndicate doesn't let them get involved. Well, I think they should just demand that they [be allowed to] get involved. Fortunately, I had good people to work with, they were understanding people, and they always let me see what they were discussing with other people, and I had a chance to meet with all the different licensees. They never did anything behind my back. At least, the first group of people. Later on, when those men all retired, another group of people came in, and they began to do some things behind my back, and that caused us a lot of trouble. Since then, within the past seven or eight years, I have a new contract. Again I'm dealing with reasonable people, and I now have the legal right to have complete control over everything's that done.

BARRIER: I was going to ask you about that, because I knew that traditionally when a cartoonist signed up with a syndicate, the syndicate owned the strip, and I guess in the fifties, technically, they could have fired you and hired somebody else to draw ""Peanuts.""



SCHULZ: They would have had to show, however, that I was not keeping up the quality. They would have had to show some justification for doing it, but I think legally they could have done that. But not any more.



BARRIER: Now around 1970 was when you had this fellow Warren Lockhart [working for Schulz as a business representative]; what has happened to him?

SCHULZ: I don't know. He got involved with a film projecthe was one of the producers, and it won an Academy Award, and he used that as a jumping-off point, to go off on his own. I haven't seen Warren for a couple of years.

BARRIER: How long was he with you?

SCHULZ: Boythe time goes by. He and Ron Nelson both had worked for Ice Follies, and Ron was just telling me yesterday that he now has been with me for 18 years. I suppose Warren was with me maybe 10 years. I can't remember.

BARRIER: According to a 1971 Newsweek article, the Creative Development Corporation, as I guess it was called originally [later Creative Associates], started in 1970, so that would have been 18 years ago. At that point, in 1970, how had things developed so that you werewell, let me put it this way. I read a story from 1965, and at that point you said that when people were calling you about licensing agreements, you would refer them automatically to United Features. You had nobody working with you, I guess, who could help you screen such licensing requests or handle them otherwise. You would refer them to UFS, which would decide if it wanted to do them or not, and then the licensees would get back to you as to exactly how the product would be handled. How had things developed by 1970 so that you felt the need to set up some other mechanism?



SCHULZ: It all started with the ice arena. The small arena across town had been forced to close because of structural difficulties, and my first wife, Joyce, came home one day and said, ""The ice arena's closed,"" and I said, ""That's terrible."" We had just started to skate there with our kids, and I wished there were something we could do about it, because we liked the two men who were running it, the Baxter brothers. She said, ""I was hoping you'd say that."" She already had in her mind, I'm sure, just in driving across the town, and two years later she had built what has been regarded as the world's most beautiful ice arena. She tried running it herself for a while, and then one dayI don't know how it happenedI think a couple of men came in and conned her into helping her promote the arena with shows. They got the Ice Follies to come in, and the Ice Follies had Warren Lockhart and Ron Nelson running that division. It was a smaller version of the larger Ice Follies show. Warren had always liked Snoopy, and said that if we had the Ice Follies here, we should also sell Snoopy to the Ice Follies. He arranged that, and so Joyce hired them both to help her run the arena; they were not hired to work for me.

She kept saying, ""These are bright young fellows. They can probably help you in your business, too."" I used to think in the back of my mind, oh, yeah, just what I need, somebody to help me run my business. As it turned out, Ron really was an enormous help. He sort of took over all the financial affairs, not only of the arena but our own financial affairs, and then eventually did come in to work in here, and we formed Creative Associates. I still don't know exactly why we did that; you'd have to ask Ron. I just don't pay any attention. He hands me pieces of paper, and I sign them, and that's it. Then we built this studio, and they've been working with me ever since. Ron now has become a real expert on all the ramifications of licensing and promotion. I trust him implicitly; he handles all of my business affairs. I rarely question him. He doesn't question my drawings, and I don't question the business part of it. And that's really how it happened. I didn't hire them at all to help me run the business; I was perfectly satisfied with the way things were going.

BARRIER: You were not swamped with too many distractions?



SCHULZ: No, I'm never swamped by that kind of distraction. The only kind of distractions that bother me are the continual requests for special drawings for my grandfather who's retiring, or the priest in our church who is retiring and who uses your cartoon, or so-and-so's birthday's coming up, or so-and-so is sick in hospital, and auctionswe get auction requests every day. Some are fine, and some are not; if they write ""Dear Celebrity,"" and it's a form letter, we throw it away. I cannot understand anybody wanting a favor from somebody and not only not evenmost of the time not spelling your name right, but not even using your name at all. But we try to do the best we can with all of these things. Those are the things that bother me the most.



BARRIER: I can't imagine that would be that much of a drain on your time. Are there so many that you have a blanket policy of saying no to every one of them?

SCHULZ: No; it's not the time, it's the anxiety and the guilt feelings that they give to you. Time is no problem with me. I actually don't even work very long hours. I start here at 9, and usually I go home at 4 o'clock. That's not bad. Five days a week; I don't work at night, or on the weekends. So it's not a matter of time, it's just a matter of the energy, I guess, plus the fact that it's not a job which depends strictly on the amount of hours you put in. It depends on what you can think of. The never-ending burden of having to do something day after day after day, and it never lets up. Plus there are the television shows and the other little side items that have to be thought of, and the requests for special drawings for program covers and different things like that. I was very flattered to be asked, for the third time, to do a cover for the AT&T golf tournament; it used to be the Crosby. I've been drawing golf cartoons for the Crosby tournament now for about 32 years. I enjoy that, but again, it's just another group of things that you have to think of. Always having to think of something funny. And the television shows: That's a monstrous medium, to try to write those stories. Right now we're in the midst of doing a special film on cancer for people who are relating to children who might have cancer. It's a difficult thing to write. So something's always in the back of my mind; I wake up at 3 o'clock in the morning, and I roll over in bed, and suddenly I'm awake. Well, what am I gonna do in the third scene in the cancer film? Maybe I can think of something before I go back to sleep. Then I wake up in the morning, and I haven't thought of anything. But that's the way it goes all the time.

But I purposely don't get involved in the business affairs. I never see any of the business people who come here to see Ron on things like investments or things that he might be buying. I never see those people; I don't even know who they are. Somebody asked me today, ""Who are these people that go into your studio that carry briefcases?"" and I say, ""I don't know."" If they're carrying a briefcase, that means they're trying to sell us something. And I would say that I attend maybe three quarters of the meetings with licensees. Sometimes I simply don't go in and get involved; I let the other people here do that. If I know it's something very important, if it's a new group, then I might do it. But again, I stay mainly in my own room here and draw the comics.



BARRIER: How much of the artwork for the licensed products do you do yourself?



SCHULZ: I don't but rarely make new drawings any more. We issued orders, a long time ago, that they use only pickup art from the strip. And then another man who does some special designing for us, on a free-lance basis, came up with the idea of creating a large booklet which has glossy reprints of all of the characters in a variety of poses, and the licensees are supposed to pick whatever drawings from that, and be inspired in some cases by those poses. In rare instances where it's something that I feel is very importantif it's a cover of a certain box or a book or something like that, and they want a drawing which would be unique, then I might make a special drawing, but I rarely do that any more.



BARRIER: Years agothis would be back in the early sixties, maybefor Hallmark, for example, they had other people actually drawing the characters



SCHULZ: No, never. Hallmark has never had anybody draw [the characters].



BARRIER: I worked with a fellow whose wife had worked for Hallmark in Kansas City, and she was speaking of having done art for ""Peanuts"" cards; this would have been in 1965, or something like that. I was startled, because it had never occurred to me that you had not done all the artwork.

SCHULZ: In fact, I did the first drawings myself. A man named Arnold Shapiro was the one who came up with the idea and finally sold Hallmark on doing it. I drew all the first cards. Some of them were foldout cards that had as many as four to six drawings. I was also doing all of the Ford ads at that time. Some of them would have as many as six drawings; it would be a whole newspaper ad. I was working with the J. Walter Thompson people, creating all of the ads. And I did the [drawings] for the billboards, and helped them do the television commercials. And I was doing the special drawings for Connie Boucher's Happiness Is a Warm Puppy books; we did six of those. I illustrated two books for Art Linkletter, on Kids Say the Darnedest Things. I did a couple of books on letters to President Johnson, things like that, and I was also doing teen-age cartoons for a church publication. Finally, I said, ""Forget it, this is too much."" I just couldn't stand it all. Now, if anybody said they did some drawings for Hallmark, what they did was to draw in some backgrounds and create the cards. I've always admired the way Hallmark created the cards, but no one ever drew the characters themselves. Since then, of course, there have been a few poses that might require an extra arm of Snoopy holding something or doing something, but beyond that, they rarely make any special drawings themselves, but they do make some wonderfully decorative backgrounds and things of that kind.



BARRIER: There was a series of comic books back in the late fifties; you couldn't have drawn all that.



SCHULZ: No. I had a very close friend named Jim Sasseville, who now lives down in the San Jose area some place, and he always wanted to draw comic strips and everything, and when United Features came up with the idea of having a few comic pages in the Nancy books and all of that, I said, ""I can't do those myself, but I have this friend who can really draw."" Jim did those for quite a while, and moved out here to California with his wife. Later on, he quit and went on to something else, and I had another man work with me for a while. It was just a good way to have somebody around who could help in the studio, to do all the little things like answer the letters. In those days, I had no secretary. This fellow who took Jim's place was named Tony; since then he has died, but he used to answer the fan mail for me, and do all the little extra thingsrun to the post officeand he drew all of the comic magazines. All of the money we got from the comic magazines went to pay Tony's salary, so that worked out fine. He liked doing it. But then, for some reason, they didn't want us any more, so we just stopped doing it.

BARRIER: In other words, the time pressures you've felt have never been from having to spend too much of your time being a businessman or a celebrity, but just from having to draw too many things.



SCHULZ: It probably wasn't so much a matter of choice as it was just plain ignorance or lack of ability. I don't know anything about business, I really don't; it doesn't interest me. If I were to have to sell a product, I wouldn't even know how much to charge for it. I don't know anything about it, and I refuse to get involved in something I don't know anything about. That was the syndicate's job; I would draw the comic strip and they would market it, they'd make the decisions. I always liked the people at United Features, the business manager and the president. The president was named Larry Rutman, [and] he treated me not unlike a father. We always got along well; we only had a couple of arguments in all those years. And now, again, they're a good group of people. I trust their judgment, although Ron, really, probably puts a lot of pressure on them now, too, I think. Ron has learned probably more about the business than they have.

BARRIER: But you said that at one point, I guess after Rutman had retired, that there was a period there when you were not happy with United Features.



SCHULZ: Oh, terribly unhappy.



BARRIER: When would this have been?

SCHULZ: I don't know; I can't remember dates.



BARRIER: Would this have been around the time that Ron

SCHULZ: Ron was working for me at the time.

BARRIER: Oh, it was in the seventies.



SCHULZ: Yeah. I think these new people mistrusted Warren, and maybe with justification; I have no idea. But there was really some mistrust there. I remember once they signed a contract with Random House for me to do eight books, and I said, ""Where in the world did that come from? I can't write eight books. Who said I was going to write eight books?"" And they said, ""Well, that's what the contract says."" I said, ""I can't write eight books."" They said, ""Well, okay, if you can't do it, we won't do it."" But why in the world some man would sign a contract for me to write eight books is beyond me. And then I remember they were selling Charlie Brown razor blades over in Germany. Whose idea was that? Charlie Brown shouldn't be selling razor blades. These were the things that were beginning to annoy me. I can't even remember the others.

I also, for a long period of time, even back in Larry Rutman's day, I remember talking with him down in his home in Monterey once, and I said, ""Larry, I think I have done more for you than any cartoonist you've ever had. I think I deserve something extra."" ""What do you mean?"" ""I don't even know, but I think I deserve a little something extra. How about a guaranteed income of a certain amount for the rest of my life?"" ""Oh, well, we can't do that. But you get more than the others."" ""No, I don't get any more, I just get 50 percent, that's what everybody else gets. If I get more, it's because I work harder."" He couldn't understand that; and the next man didn't even come close to being able to understand that. I kept saying, ""I want something more. I don't know what it is, but I want something more."" They just couldn't understand it. It was interesting that when the third president came in, Bob Metz, he understood it within five minutes. All I wanted was to control my property. I wasn't out to destroy it. I think the other people were afraid that I was going to run away with it, that if I got control of it I would go off and do all sorts of wild things. Well, it was just the opposite: I was afraid that was what they were going to do. And so I now have a contract which means that I can do anything that I want, as long as it does not destroy the property, which I'd been insane to do, anyway. I never asked for more money.

BARRIER: The 50 percent split is still



SCHULZ: I'll bet anything that I could have threatened them and said, ""From now on I want 70."" But why? That wasn't the object. The strip brings in plenty of money. That's not the object of the whole thing. There's plenty of money to go around for everybody. I just want to make sure that this product is not killed off and we can do everything properly. This doesn't mean I've always made the right decisions, but I bet I've made more right decisions than they have.



BARRIER: Have there been occasions when United Features has sent back a strip, or said, ""We're really worried about this one?""



SCHULZ: Yeah. There were only two occasions. One was a long time ago; Linus's blanket suddenly took on a life [of its own] and began to attack Lucy. Larry Rutman called; this scared him to death. He thought for sure that it would frighten children, that the blanket doing this would frighten the child reader. Which was ridiculous, when you think of the things that they see in other places. I remember I finished up the little series and let it go at that. Later on, when Franklin was introduced into the strip, the little black kidI could have put him in long before that, but for other reasons, I didn't. I didn't want to intrude upon the work of others, so I held off on that. But I finally put Franklin in, and there was one strip where Charlie Brown and Franklin had been playing on the beach, and Franklin said, ""Well, it's been nice being with you, come on over to my house some time."" Again, they didn't like that. Another editor protested once when Franklin was sitting in the same row of school desks with Peppermint Patty, and said, ""We have enough trouble here in the South without you showing the kids together in school."" But I never paid any attention to those things, and I remember telling Larry at the time about Franklinhe wanted me to change it, and we talked about it for a long while on the phone, and I finally sighed and said, ""Well, Larry, let's put it this way: Either you print it just the way I draw it or I quit. How's that?"" So that's the way that ended. But I've never done much with Franklin, because I don't do race things. I'm not an expert on race, I don't know what it's like to grow up as a little black boy, and I don't think you should draw things unless you really understand them, unless you're just out to stir things up or to try to teach people different things. I'm not in this business to instruct; I'm just in it to be funny. Now and then I may instruct a few things, but I'm not out to grind a lot of axes. Let somebody else do it who's an expert on that, not me.

BARRIER: I've read a number of interviews where you say in effect that social issues are not what

SCHULZ: What are called ""social issues"" in some of these strips I think are so obvious and so obnoxious thatI think the social issues that I deal with are much more long-lasting and more important than losing the White House. Those are easy targets, no matter which party is in the stew. People say, ""Don't you ever deal in social issues?"" ""Well, don't you read the strip?"" If you read the strip every day, you'll see that I deal with more social issues in one month than some of these deal [with] in a whole year. But you have to be a little more sensitive to it.



BARRIER: Watterson, when he was still doing interviews, had what I thought was a very interesting comment about you, and I wanted to get your response to this. He said, ""I have a tremendous amount of respect for 'Peanuts.' Every now and then I hear that 'Peanuts' isn't as funny as it was or it's gotten old or something like that. I think that what's really happened is that Schulz's 'Peanuts' changed the entire face of comic strips and everybody had now caught up to him. I don't think he's five years ahead of everybody else like he used to be, so that's taken some of the edge off it. I think it's still a wonderful strip in terms of solid construction, character development, the fantasy element... Things that we now take for granted-reading the thoughts of an animal, for examplethere's not a cartoonist who's done anything since 1960 that doesn't owe Schulz a tremendous debt."" I read another quotation from an interview with you, in which you described yourself as a very competitive person, and I wondered now that you've done the strip for almost 40 years, and there are cartoonists who are obviously tremendously in your debt, like Watterson, do you feel a certain satisfaction at seeing that kind of thing, or do you feel a certain edginess, like ""I want to get out there and knock these kids out of the park""?

SCHULZ: Well, in the first place, I'm always stunned to discover that I am now one of the old-timers. Somebody said, ""Now that Milt Caniff has died, that makes you kind of the dean of the comic-strip artists."" I still think of myself as being one of the young ones. Garry Trudeau stopped by here over 10 years ago, and he was doing an article for a magazine on the bright young cartoonists of the day, and I noticed that I was not in there; and then all of a sudden it occurred to me, I'm not one of the bright young cartoonists. It's flattering to think that these men were influenced by me, and for the good ones, I think that's fine. It's a little bit sad when I see some of the others that are imitating, or at least think they're imitating, what I am doing, by having little sly, philosophical remarks in the last panel which are neither sly nor philosophical, but are just plain dumb. They don't have the touch to know how to do that. And I think if you don't have the touch, you shouldn't do it. I see this so often.

I'm very proud of what I think is the most difficult thing to do in a comic strip, and that is to come up with the very broad theme on which the strip can be built. That I have created what has become part of the language, the term ""security blanket,"" the Great Pumpkin, just the term ""Charlie Brown""someone says, ""Oh, he's a real Charlie Brown."" I was stunned last night-it's about 10:30 at night, I'm lying in bed, and I'm reading the biography of Shirley Jackson, and right near the end, about 10, 12 pages from the end, she is talking about one of Shirley Jackson's friends, and she brings up Charlie Brown kicking the football. And I said to Jean, ""Look at this. This is astounding."" Here she's writing a serious biography, and yet she uses Charlie Brown to point up a certain point in this book. That makes me feel wonderful. Every now and then I'll be reading a detective novel or something like that, and Snoopy will be mentioned. John MacDonald used to mention Snoopy in his detective novels, the Travis McGee ones. But some of these other imitators, who try to do this little philosophical thing ... It's kind of sad; they should just try to be themselves and not try to imitate others. Of course, when ""Doonesbury"" became so successful, I could see in college papers and in submissions that young people would send to me hoping to get criticism, they were all imitating ""Doonesbury."" That's crazy, because every individual is unique, and you should just draw yourself.



BARRIER: You said something else, in another interview, about ""Peanuts"" that took me aback a little bit. You talked about the strip having ""a bitter feeling"" to it, and said it ""dealt in defeat."" I was thinking about that in connection with all the licensing of children's products in particular. There are certain ironies and paradoxes connected with ""Peanuts""; it's never been a children's strip, and yet Snoopy has become a sort of icon, like Mickey Mouse, divorced in a way from the strip itself.



SCHULZ: Oddly enough, I have fought against children's products all these years, because I do not consider it a children's strip. I have always said, ""If you have to do something for children, that's fine, but let's not forget that our main reading audience is out there among the college kids, and in the fathers and mothers and grandmothers. Let's not forget all of those products; I just don't want a bunch of children's things out there. But they keep coming out anyway. I have not been able to close the floodgates. The children's products just keep coming. And I guess it's all right; it doesn't hurt anything. But that always has been a personal problem with me.

BARRIER: Still, I would think there would be a certain satisfaction in seeing a child carrying a Snoopy doll, for example. It's kind of like seeing your audience ...

SCHULZ: Oh, yeah. If you go to a skating competition, invariably there will be two or three girls involved in the skating who are carrying their little plush Snoopy around with them. I think one of the most satisfying things is to pull up at a school stop sign early in the morning and see some school kids crossing in front of you, and one of them is carrying a Snoopy lunch box. There's something about that that's very satisfying. I mean, they have to carry something and they might as well carry mine.



BARRIER: What do you think people get out of having a product with a picture of Snoopy on it? What do you think makes them buy that sort of thing?

SCHULZ: I was driving along one day, and came to a stop sign, and there was a truck in front of me, and glued to the window of that truck was a little cartoon character of Yosemite Sam. Now, I defy you to tell me what Yosemite Sam has done. He's been in some animated cartoons, he was a funny character, but you can't tell me anything that he ever did, really, or that he ever said. And yet, this just showed to me that people like cartoon characters. They like to be able to try to draw them themselves, and they like all sorts of cartoon characters. I think this was the foundation of cartoon licensing; people just like cartoons, that's all, and they'll put anything on their refrigerator or on their car, their bumper sticker, anything that they happen to like. If you can come up with a cartoon character that is even more appealing than the others, then it's a real natural, and I think that's where it all starts.

Now, there are some people who are against licensing, and in a way, I suppose it should be flattering. They have become fond of your work, and they clutch it to themselves very selfishly. They want it to be theirs. They have discovered this new comic strip and they want to talk about it with their friends, and all of a sudden it becomes popular. It's like hearing a new singer for the first time, and you think she's just wonderful, and before you know it she's got four or five hit records and everybody in the country is talking about her. You've lost her-she's not yours any more. You've lost your discovery, and I suppose this is one of the things that people don't like. But we live in a culture where this is almost taken for granted. Everybody is involved in licensing. If Bill Cosby can sell chocolate pudding and all of the other things that he sells, and Willie Mays can sell things with his picture, and all the movie actors, everybody does it, why should I say, ""No, I'm too good for this sort of thing""? Because it's not all mine anyway. As I said back at the beginning, this is not a pure art form by any means, it's a commercial product, and I've always said, ""How can a commercial product be accused of turning commercial?"" It doesn't make sense. As I've also said, I've been very careful about all the things that we've done. Perhaps we've made some mistakes, but I don't think we've ever turned out anything that was offensive, and I know I've never drawn anything that was offensive. Our television cartoons are as inoffensive as we can make them, without being sugary sweet and dumb. All I can say is that I've just done the best that I can, that's all.

BARRIER: Have there been products that people on your staff have wanted to license and you have said, ""No, this makes me uncomfortable, I don't want to do it.""

SCHULZ: We talk about that every now and then, and I just can't remember which ones.



BARRIER: I've heard about some vacuum-cleaner company that wanted to use Pigpen as a mascot.

SCHULZ: I don't know why we turned that down. Maybe it just didn't interest me. Offhand, I just can't think of anything.

BARRIER: It sounds as if you and your people here are pretty much in sync ...



SCHULZ: Oh, yeah. Evelyn [Ellison], who handles the first look at the products that come in, always brings all the Hallmark cards in to me. They're doing a new line now, which are slightly religiously oriented, and I bet I turned down half of those, because I'm very sensitive to what we call ""spiritual humor,"" or something like that. I don't like phrases like ""the man upstairs,"" and things like that. I despise that kind of humor. So I turned down at least six of those cards. I also turn down anything where you're using a phrase that has become quite popular but created by somebody else. I want all of the phrases that are used to be mine, and not something that was created by some comedian.



BARRIER: You're not going to have Lucy saying, ""Make my day.""

SCHULZ: No, I don't think so. That would be a perfect example.

BARRIER: On the TV shows, I gather from what Bill [Melendez] told me that you've always kept very tight control over the scripting.



SCHULZ: Yes, I wish that I could live right in Hollywood and work in Bill's studio and not have to do all these other things, but be right there when all these shows are done, and be there every daywork with the animators, and look at every scene, and have absolute tight control over them. But I can't. I believe the strip is still the most important thing, so a lot of the things get away from me. He has a good group of animators, and I like them all; we get along well, but I still watch over things so that they don't do animators' tricks. My characters do not run into trees or go speeding off in different directions. It's a different type of animation. Our shows are very difficult to do, and I don't think Bill is given the credit most of the time for overcoming all of the difficulties, because these little characters act almost real, in the things that they do; they don't do many cartoon things, in the animation. Snoopy does, but not the kids.

BARRIER: Something I've always wonderedand this is more a matter of satisfying personal curiosity than for the articleis why, in the cartoons, you never hear Snoopy's thoughts as you do in the strip, or as you did on the stage, in the musical.



SCHULZ: That was a decision that was made years ago when we were doing the first animation, which was for the Ford commercials. J. Walter Thompson was the advertising company, and they had several people come out, and we discussed all of these things, and we actually made some tests of some Hollywood actors imitating what they thought Snoopy's thoughts might sound like, and all of that, but I just vetoed the whole thing. I said, ""We can get around it. We will lose something there, but we will gain something else in animation."" Which is the difference between the two mediums. As long as you know which medium you're working in, you're all right. You'll gain something in animation, and you'll gain something in strip; they're two different mediums. I'm glad that we stuck to that.



BARRIER: There have been fewer new ""Peanuts"" specials in the last few years, and Bill said that you were the reason, essentially, you were the bottleneck. One thing I wanted to get clear, you actually initiate the scripts yourself, is that right?

SCHULZ: Oh, that's an enormous problem. I like to initiate the scripts myself. I think that our best shows have been ones that have been created spontaneously by a certain thought which has come to me. Being forced to do a show because our producer, Lee Mendelson, has committed himself to the networks for a show, I have not always turned out our best work. We have done a show for virtually every holiday that is, and I think in some cases they have not been as good as they should have been, simply because we were forced to grind out a show on a subject which I was not ready to write about. Our best shows are shows which have come about because I just happened to make a trip to France and visit Omaha Beach and be inspired to do ""What Have We Learned, Charlie Brown?"" or read an article in Sports Illustrated once about sled dogs, and suddenly thinking to myself, ""Snoopy would make a terrible sled dog; he has to run on his two hind feet and he's too civilized."" That's always been one of the favorite shows of Bill and myself. And, of course, my acquaintance with ice skating prompted the Peppermint Patty ice-skating show, which we have been complimented on so often, because of the authenticity of the skating in it. We had real skaters perform for Peppermint Patty, and the animators followed their actions, so that when Peppermint Patty skated a third-test figure, it was absolutely authentic. This is the way shows should be done; shows should not be ordered by somebody else from the outside, and then ground out that way. That's the worst way of all to do them.



BARRIER: I did want to ask you about the arenadid I read that you had sold it?



SCHULZ: No. Nobody else could own it. Because it loses so much money.



BARRIER: It's more of a hobby than a real business.

SCHULZ: It's more of an obligation.

BARRIER: In what sense?

SCHULZ: Well, I don't want to let down all the people that love skating. Last week we finished our fourteenth Senior Hockey Tournament; we had 600 men 40 and over, on up into their seventies, come to play hockey. They look forward to this all year long. We gave them a barbecue one night, and we served 1,500 steaks. We gave them all nice jackets and shirts, and all sorts of things. I just don't want to let them down, that's all.



BARRIER: Why does it lose money?

SCHULZ: Because we run such a quality operation. We employ about 50 or 60 people over there. I don't think an arena could make money, anyway, even if we set it down to a bare operation. It's so expensive just to keep the ice going; that's quite a buildup.



BARRIER: That's on Steele Lane, is that right?



SCHULZ: You can't miss it; it's across the street. The big Swiss-style building. And then right across from it is our Snoopy Gallery, which we built because we didn't have room for the all the things that we sell and the skating equipment and all the Snoopy things. And then I had accumulated so many other gadgets and trophies and plaques and things that the whole upstairs is Snoopy's Gallery, which you'll enjoy visiting.



BARRIER: There was a lot of publicity, when you first moved to Santa Rosa, about the arena being a tourist attraction, and this place being a tourist attraction, and tourists were knocking on the door. Does that still happen?

SCHULZ: Well, it does if I go over there. It's almost impossible for me to go over there without somebody coming up for an autograph, or 15 Japanese students lining up, all giggling and wanting drawings. Drives me crazy. But we don't allow visitors here any more, unless they accidentally knock on the door and walk in. I just can't take it. The payoff, I think, was when a busload of Japanese tourists pulled up one day. Without even asking us, the driver was going to make this a curiosity stop. They all came roaring in, with all the little cameras. They wouldn't do that to a doctor or an attorney, but I'm supposed to go out there and pose for their pictures. Again, it just lays another guilt problem on me, because I'm thoroughly grateful for all the nice things that have happened to me, but I also am being driven by all of the obligations, too. I just can't do all these things. And I hate autographing. I just despise autographing. I get so annoyed. Every time you pick up the paper, it shows some athlete signing something; it's always a picture of so-and-so autographing something. What's so great about autographing? I declined yesterday at the county fair. We had some visitors from England, and Jeannie and I walked in the gate and walked down in the midway and were looking around, and some couple stopped me and said, ""Aren't you Charles Schulz?"" I said, ""Yeah."" ""Can we have your autograph?"" I said, ""No. Can't I just be left alone to enjoy the fair?""

BARRIER: You moved to California inwas it '58 or '59?

SCHULZ: '58. Jill was just a baby.

BARRIER: And you lived in Sebastopol at first, and then moved here.

SCHULZ: Yeah. And all the kids grew up and moved out into the country, for a while, and then Joyce and I separated. She lives in Hawaii, and I now live here right on the edge of town.

BARRIER: A former bishop's residence?

SCHULZ: We sold that. That was owned by the local bishop; beautiful place.

BARRIER: How did you settle on Santa Rosa as a place to live?

SCHULZ: Jeannie lived in Santa Rosa. Her kids were still teenagers, and were still going to school, so we just bought a house in Santa Rosa.



BARRIER: One more thing on the TV shows. Bill did the first ""Garfield"" special, and he said you had told him that was a conflict of interest and he should not be doing ""Garfield"" as well as ""Peanuts.""



SCHULZ: Not true. The president of United Features came to me one day and he said, ""I've got something very sensitive to ask you, and I'll understand whatever your response is. We have a chance now to sell a 'Garfield' show, and we think Bill is the best person to do it. Would you mind if we asked Bill to do it?"" I said, ""No, not really, because I know Bill always needs work to keep his animators going, and if Bill wants to do it, that's all right with me. I don't want to stand in the way of Jim Davis, if he has a chance to do a television show, as long as it doesn't interfere with Bill's doing 'Peanuts' things. If Bill suddenly decides he'd rather do 'Garfield' and forget me, then I would object."" I think Bill did the first one, then one of his animators broke away and took over doing the ""Garfield"" shows, so Bill didn't do any more after that.

Lee Mendelson's wife and another man, Ed Bogas, started to write the music for both shows, and one year ""Garfield"" and one of our shows were both competing for an Emmy, and they had written the music for the ""Garfield,"" and they won the Emmy. I said, ""Now we're getting to a conflict. Now we're competing. Before, we weren't competing, but I just don't think that you people can write music for both shows. Make up your mindeither you write for me or you write for 'Garfield,' because you can't do it for both."" It hasn't come out yet, but several months ago, there were two shows, there was a ""Garfield"" showI think he went to Hawaii, or something like thatand a Snoopy show. They ran the ""Garfield"" at 8 and they ran ours at 8:30. I thought the ""Garfield"" show was so terrible that I said, ""I don't want any more being paired with 'Garfield. '"" Maybe we lose viewers, maybe we don't, I don't know8:30 is supposed to be a better time slot. But I said, ""That show was so badnever again. Don't put me with 'Garfield. '"" That's the only conflict that has ever arisen. I like Jim Davis; I don't know him real well, but I think he's a nice fellow. But there comes a time when you do compete.

BARRIER: One thing I wanted to confirmI saw a cryptic reference to a story that there was a real Snoopy, you had a dog named Snoopy at some point, and you traded him for a truckload of gravel.



SCHULZ: Well, yeah, but that had nothing to do with it. The real Snoopy was based upon the dog I had whose name was Spike, who wasn't a beagle. Later on, after we moved out here, we had the two boys, and Craig wanted a dog. Craig was a year younger than Monte. So we went out to a puppy farm one Sunday morning and we got Craig a little beagle. I said to Craig, ""What are you going to name him?"" ""I'm going to name him Spike."" Then Monte suddenly decided he wanted a dog, too, so we bought another puppy, and Monte named his beagle Snoopy. They came back, and within the next few days they began to scrap. As the days went on, the fights got more ferocious. So we thought, this can't carry on. A guy came by one day who was delivering shale to some driveway they were putting in, and he saw the dog. He said, ""Boy, I'd sure like to have that dog."" So we traded Snoopy for a load of shale. And he loved that dog; every time we'd see him he'd say, ""Boy, that Snoopy is a real dog, he and I really get along."" So it was a good sale. But Spike outlived Snoopy, by quite a few years.

BARRIER: Something else I wanted to check with you, because it's such a wonderful story. I have an old press release here that United Features put out in 1959, about how you sold your first strips to them. It's the kind of anecdote that would be wonderful to use in the story, if it's true. Since it's a press release from the syndicate, I thought, well, the odds are maybe 50-50 it's true. [Reading from the press release] ""'My wife and I kept our fingers crossed, waiting for the reply,' he says, 'and when the syndicate wrote that they would be interested in seeing my funny youngsters developed in comic-strip form, rather than as single-panel cartoons, I really got excited. I had already developed some definite little characters that I thought would make a good daily strip, so I drew them up and left for New York.' It was a nasty, rainy morning when he arrived in New York, and to keep his drawings dry he tucked them under his coat and hurried to the syndicate office without pausing for breakfast. He was so early that none of the staff had arrived for the day, so he left the drawings with the receptionist and went out to eat. While he was gone, the editors arrived, and the receptionist gave them the samples. They looked them over, and by the time Schulz returned they had decided that his inimitable little charactersgood o1' Charlie Brown, Lucy, Patty, Violet, Schroeder and the otherswould indeed make a good comic strip. And thus was 'Peanuts' born.""



SCHULZ: [laughing] Not true at all. Basically, 80 percent of it is true. In the first place, I wasn't married.



BARRIER: I thought you got married in '49.



SCHULZ: Well, that's a lie, too [Schulz and Joyce Halverson married on April 18, 1951], but we won't go into that. That's not important. It was drizzling that morning, and I got to the syndicateI had sent them these wonderful panels; it was the best thing I had ever done. I took all of the best ""Li'l Folks"" ideas I had done for the Pioneer-Press and I put the title up here like this, and then I thought, I've got to do something that's a little bit different, I've got to give them an angle, and my drawing style is so simple, I know what I'll do: I'll draw two cartoons, I'll draw one here and I'll letter in the gag line, and I'll draw another one down here and letter in the gag line, and this will be sold just as a panel, the same size as ""Dennis the Menace"" and any others. It was really neat; I was very proud of that. I knew that this was going to come close, and I drew 15 of them, sent them to United Features, and never heard a word. In the meantime, I was working for Art Instruction, the correspondence school, and I waited for a month, never heard a word, which was typical of United Features. Since then, I've said, ""Couldn't you at least send people a postcard saying, 'Your drawings arrived, we'll be looking at them'?"" They never learned. Anyway, I wrote them a letter and I said, ""I mailed such-and-such drawings to you, I think perhaps they were lost in the mail, could you tell me if you received them because I'd like to put a tracer on them."" I got a letter from Jim Freeman; it said, ""I've been showing them around, and we kind of like them. Would you care to come to New York?"" Etcetera. So that was great. I took the train to New York.

In the meantime, I had been doing some other strips which were three panels. They were very brief incidents. Up until then, people drawing kid cartoons had used the old well-what-are-we-going-to-do-today sort of theme. Mine was very brief incidents; nobody had ever done things like this before. This is something that people forget about, too, if they talk about imitating me, or something. Nobody had ever done this type of humor before. There was a lot of gag-cartoon humor which was highly original, which I admired, but nobody had done anything like this in a strip, and I had about six of them that I had been working on, and I thought, well, if I'm going to New York I should show them some of the other things that I've been doing, just to show them how versatile I am. I had these in an envelope, and it was drizzling that morning, and I got to the office about 8 o'clock, or whenever it was, and there was nobody there except the girl at the switchboard. She said, ""They're not here,"" and I said, ""I'll go out and eat breakfast. It's raining out; can I just leave this package here?"" I didn't say what was in it, or for them to open it, or anything. I went out and had breakfast, and when I came back the sales manager was there, and the president, and they said, ""We've opened the package, and we kind of think we'd rather have a strip if you think you could draw a strip."" I said, ""Sure, I'd rather draw a strip."" They said, ""Could you create some definite characters?"" See, in there it says they were fascinatedthere was no Charlie Brown or anybody. They said, ""Could you create some definite characters?""

That's when I went back to Minneapolis and asked my friend Charlie Brown if I could use his name, and he said, ""What does he look like?"" He looked at it and he said, ""Oh, gee, I was hoping I'd look more like Steve Canyon."" And I drew the little puppy, Snoopy; originally he was to be called Sniffy, but I was walking uptown one day and I saw a comic magazine about a little dog named Sniffy, and I thought, oh, they broke my name. On my way back to my job, I remembered that my mother had said, ""If you ever have another dog, you should name him Snoopy."" I thought, hey, why didn't I think of that before? I named him Snoopy, and I had the little boy named Shermy, named after a friend of mine, and a girl named Patty, who was named after a cousin of mine. Those were the first four characters. That was it; that's how it started.



BARRIER: I've read that you are talking now about retiring.



SCHULZ: I don't know how I can. All of my friends are retiringeither retiring or dying. It's become a problem for me. I don't know what to do.

BARRIER: I've heard that you're concerned aboutand I noticed when you were drawing just now



SCHULZ: Oh, my hand shakes. It's been shaking for years.

BARRIER: You can see a little of that, comparing the strip now with years ago, you can see a little more wavering ...

SCHULZ: It's just annoying, that's all it is. It slows me down, and I have to letter very carefully. I'm learning to live with it. After my heart surgery, it was intolerable, and then I had knee surgery last September. I remember one day I came back, and I was so weak from the knee surgery I finally had to quit; I just couldn't hold that pen still. It's annoying, but I can live with that. I just don't know is it worth it. Am I supposed to sit here the rest of my life drawing these things while all my friends are retiring and everybody's doing different things?

BARRIER: I was looking back at some of the older interviews with you, and you sounded like you never wanted to quit ...

SCHULZ: I know, well...

BARRIER: ... And then some of the interviews I read recently, it's like all of a sudden you're saying to yourself



SCHULZ: I'm getting old. I'll be 66 years old; I can't believe it. Oh, it's not that I want to [retire], I just wish there were some way of getting rid of all the other things and just drawing the comic strip. But I don't see how it could be done.



BARRIER: It sounds like your people here, though, can do a pretty good job of ...



SCHULZ: Well, yeah, but you take a look at those storyboards that they try to do down there in Hollywood without me. I always tease Bill and Lee, and I look at the storyboards, and I say, ""This is what it's going to look like after I'm dead, isn't it?"" That's what's going to happen. It won't be the same, for better or for worse.

BARRIER: I've heard that United Features will recycle the strip rather than having anybody



SCHULZ: I don't see how they can. They say they will. If I die tonight, that's the end of the strip, as far as my drawing it, and I know the first thing they'll do is try to reprint things. But I seriously doubt that works. I know that's the first thing they'll try. But who knowsthat's all speculation.

BARRIER: I can't imagine anybody continuing your strip. The factory-produced strips""Garfield,"" yeswill continue, but yours, I can't imagine.

SCHULZ: And why? If Andrew Wyeth dies tonight, are they going to bring somebody else in? Everything has to end sooner or later.

BARRIER: How far ahead are you now? What kind of lead time do you have?



SCHULZ: I'm drawing the Sunday page, I think, for the second week of October, the daily strip-the next batch of strips would be the last week in September.



BARRIER: So you're not as far ahead as you used to be.



SCHULZ: No, I lost a lot after my knee surgery, and different things like that. I just haven't been able to recover; there are so many things that get in the way.

BARRIER: When did you have heart surgery?

SCHULZ: Seven years ago. There was my best lead. I had three months' lead, because I didn't know what was going to happen; and I only used a month of it. I wracked up my knee playing hockey. That was worse than the heart surgery; that just took all the life out of me. I haven't been able to come back. And then there are so many things that interfere.



BARRIER: Like interviews.



SCHULZ: Interviews; today. See, now this afternoon is gone. Wednesday, Bill Melendez is coming up to talk about the cancer movie, and he'll be here from 11 o'clock on. Friday I have to play in a charity golf tournament which I just can't avoid. August 15, Spanish TV is coming. August 22, the girl who's doing my biography is coming, and she'll be here all week long.



BARRIER: Oh, somebody is doing

SCHULZ: It's kind of a biography; more of an interpretation rather than a literal biography [Good Grief: The Story of Charles M. Schulz by Rheta Grimsley Johnson, was published in 1989]. It's that way all the time.



BARRIER: But you do interviews like this one out of a sense of obligation, I gather, to the people who are

SCHULZ: Well, I suppose this one I would do out of obligation to the licensees, I think, although I learned my lesson on that one with Advertising Age. Did you ever see that one? Ironically, it was written by a guy named [Bob]Garfield. The fellow calls up, and he does a column for Advertising Age; his name is Bill Garfield or something, I don't know. There was an article about him in Editor & Publisher last week. I thought, well, that's fine, Advertising Age, that's good for the licensing. He came up, we had a nice talk for about a half an hour or so. Pretty soon he says, ""I guess it's about time that I should tell you something. I don't read your strip any more. I don't think it's as good as it used to be."" ""Well, okay, I think you're wrong, but if that's what you believe, that's all right."" We talked a little bit more about that, and I defended my position. So he left, and as he went out the door, he said, ""In a way, I kind of apologize, because I've enjoyed talking with you and you seem to be a nice person."" Then he writes the whole column about the strip not being as good as it used to be. I don't see any object in that, unless it's to prove how wonderfully perceptive he is.



No, I enjoy interviews, and I like taking the telephone interviews; it's a good way to relax from the drawing.



BARRIER: I must admit I was surprised when I called here, and you were on the phone. I thought, gee whiz, how nice.



SCHULZ: I don't understand people that don't want to do that, because I think it's kind of fun. I enjoy talking to high school students, and college students; I want to do little things like that. I don't like the ones in grade-school classes where they broadcast your voice in the classroom and they have the kids ask the questions, because the questions are so obvious: Where did you get the idea for Snoopy? But I still do them. I also don't like all the commitments ahead of time; like my summer now has been committed. Here it is August 1, and my summer is virtually gone. I've gotten to do almost nothing that I wanted to do, because I'm committed to so many different things.



BARRIER: One last question about the TV shows, about the Saturday morning show. Bill said this was again a case where, I gather, it did not continue because there was a lack of scripts.

SCHULZ: Yeah; they just couldn't do them. I don't know many Bill sold originallyor Lee, Lee was the producer. Did he ever say how many? Was it l8?



BARRIER: I think it was 15.



SCHULZ: Which we just couldn'tBill couldn't do that many. And I couldn't write a whole bunch of original stories, so we went back and got the stories out of the various strips. Then he just couldn't keep up the schedule, so he trimmed it back, and back, and then finally just gave up. There was too much. He just couldn't do them all. It had nothing to do with me.



PHYLLIS BARRIER: I have a question: What type of music do you listen to?



SCHULZ: None.

PHYLLIS BARRIER: I thought maybe you were a music listener while you were drawing.



SCHULZ: I used to be, years ago, when I had my studio up in Sebastopol, in the woods. I just had the one secretary; she stayed at one end of the studio, and I was down at the other. We had the radio on to a kind of a quiet-music station all day long, but I don't do that any more. After my divorce, and the sadness of being separated from the kids temporarily and all of thatalthough they eventually all came back. But I used to get so depressed listening to songs and music that I stopped. Now it's just too much of an interruption. Most of my time is just sitting here trying to think of something. Then the phone rings, and the stereo's on too loud. I never listen to it.

https://www.snopes.com/fact-check/exceptional-proof/	the exception proves the rule means counterexamples verify the adages claim.	true (but not for the reason you think)	['Not What You Think']		David Mikkelson	['http://www.worldwidewords.org/qa/qa-exc1.htm']	http://www.worldwidewords.org/qa/qa-exc1.htm	http://www.worldwidewords.org/	"Jump to content

Q From Dave Dewhurst, British Columbia: How did the phrase, the exception that proves the rule come about? Would an exception to some pattern or consistency not prove the need for a rule, not the existence of one?

A You’re right to query the expression. It has caused as much confusion as any other in the language and is often argued about. The misunderstanding has been amplified by well-meaning but incorrect attempts going back a century to explain it.

These days it is often used sweepingly to justify an inconsistency. Those who use it seem to be saying that the existence of a case that doesn’t follow a rule proves the rule applies in all other cases and so is generally correct, notwithstanding the exception. This is nonsense, because the logical implication of finding that something doesn’t follow a rule is that there must be something wrong with the rule. As the old maxim has it, you need find only one white crow to disprove the rule that all crows are black.

It has often been suggested in reference works that prove here is really being used in the sense of “test” (as it does in terms like “proving ground” or “the proof of the pudding is in the eating”, or in the printer’s proof, which is a test page run off to see that all is correct with the typesetting). It is said that the real idea behind the saying is that the presence of what looks like an exception tests whether a rule is really valid or not. If you can’t reconcile the supposed exception with the rule, there must indeed be something wrong with the rule. The expression is indeed used in this sense, but that’s not where it comes from or what it strictly means.

The problem with that attempted explanation is that those putting it forward have picked on the wrong word to challenge. It’s not a false sense of proof that causes the problem, but exception. We think of it as meaning some case that doesn’t follow the rule, but the original sense was of someone or something that is granted permission not to follow a rule that otherwise applies. The true origin of the phrase lies in a medieval Latin legal principle: exceptio probat regulam in casibus non exceptis, which may be translated as “the exception confirms the rule in the cases not excepted”.

Let us say that you drive down a street somewhere and find a notice which says “Parking prohibited on Sundays”. You may reasonably infer from this that parking is allowed on the other six days of the week. A sign on a museum door which says “Entry free today” leads to the implication that entry is not free on other days (unless it’s a marketing ploy like the never-ending sales that some stores have, but let’s not get sidetracked). H W Fowler gave an example from his wartime experience: “Special leave is given for men to be out of barracks tonight until 11pm”, which implies a rule that in other cases men must be in barracks before that time. So, in its strict sense, the principle is arguing that the existence of an allowed exception to a rule reaffirms the existence of the rule.

Despite the number of reference books which carefully explain the origin and true meaning of the expression, it is unlikely that it will ever be restored to strict correctness. The usual rule in lexicography is that sayings progress towards corruption and decay, never the reverse. Unless this one proves to be an exception ..."

SUMMARY: In July of 2016, the GOP will host its convention at the Quicken Loans Arena in Cleveland, Ohio. Though Ohio is an open carry state, which allows for the open carry of guns, the hosting venue—the Quicken Loans Arena—strictly forbids the carry of firearms on their premises.

According to the policy on their website, ""firearms and other weapons of any kind are strictly forbidden on the premises of Quicken Loans Arena.""

This is a direct affront to the Second Amendment and puts all attendees at risk. As the National Rifle Association has made clear, ""gun-free zones"" such as the Quicken Loans Arena are ""the worst and most dangerous of all lies."" The NRA, our leading defender of gun rights, has also correctly pointed out that ""gun free zones... tell every insane killer in America... (the) safest place to inflict maximum mayhem with minimum risk."" (March 4, 2016 and Dec. 21, 2012)

Cleveland, Ohio is consistently ranked as one of the top ten most dangerous cities in America. By forcing attendees to leave their firearms at home, the RNC and Quicken Loans Arena are putting tens of thousands of people at risk both inside and outside of the convention site.

This doesn't even begin to factor in the possibility of an ISIS terrorist attack on the arena during the convention. Without the right to protect themselves, those at the Quicken Loans Arena will be sitting ducks, utterly helpless against evil-doers, criminals or others who wish to threaten the American way of life.

All three remaining Republican candidates have spoken out on the issue and are unified in their opposition to Barack HUSSEIN Obama's ""gun-free zones.""

Donald Trump said ""I will get rid of gun-free zones on schools—you have—and on military bases on my first day. It gets signed my first day...you know what a gun-free zone is to a sicko? That's bait."" (Jan. 8. 2016)

Ted Cruz has accurately pointed out ""shooting after shooting after shooting happens in so called gun-free zones."" He continued, ""look, if you're a lunatic ain't nothing better then having a bunch of targets you know that are going to be unarmed."" (Dec. 4, 2015)

And Ohio Governor John Kasich has been a leader in this movement to eliminate deadly ""gun-free zones"" starting with his brave decision to fight the Democrats and end ""gun-free zones"" at National Guard facilities in Ohio. (Dec. 18, 2015)

We are all too familiar with the mass carnage that can occur when citizens are denied their basic God-given rights to carry handguns or assault weapons in public. EVERY AMERICAN HAS THE RIGHT TO PROTECT AND DEFEND THEIR FAMILY. With this irresponsible and hypocritical act of selecting a ""gun-free zone"" for the convention, the RNC has placed its members, delegates, candidates and all US citizens in grave danger.

We must take a stand. We cannot allow the national nominating convention of the party of Lincoln and Reagan to be hijacked by weakness and political correctness. The policies of the Quicken Loans Arena do not supersede the rights given to us by our Creator in the U.S. Constitution.

THEREFORE, WE ARE CALLING TODAY FOR THE FOLLOWING FIVE POINTS OF ACTION:

1. From the Quicken Loans Arena in Cleveland: A suspension of their policy preventing the open carry of firearms on the premises of the arena from July 18-21, 2016 to coincide with the Republican National Convention.

2. From the National Rifle Association: An immediate condemnation of the egregious affront to the Second Amendment of the United States Constitution constituted by the ""gun-free zone"" loophole to the state law.

3. From Ohio Governor John Kasich: A concerted effort to use his executive authority to override the ""gun-free zone"" loophole being exploited by the Quicken Loans Arena in Cleveland, Ohio.

4. From Reince Priebus and the Republican National Committee: An explanation of how a venue so unfriendly to Second Amendment rights was chosen for the Republican Convention. Further, we demand a contingency plan to relocate the convention to another location should the Quicken Loans Arena refuse to honor the constitutional rights of the RNC guests to open carry firearms during the convention.

5. From all Republican candidates for President: You have been brave in raising awareness about the immense dangers posed by ""gun-free zones."" In order to ensure the safety of your supporters, delegates and all attendees at the convention in July, you must call upon the RNC to rectify this affront to our Second Amendment freedoms and insist upon a suspension of the Quicken Loans Arena's unconstitutional ""gun-free zone"" loophole. Every American is endowed with a God-given Constitutional right to carry a gun wherever and whenever they please."

""Couples are turning extra IVF embryos into jewelry.""

A website unironically named KidSpot says ""Couples are Turning Extra IVF Embryos into Jewelry.""

After a six-year IVF journey to receive miracles Lachlan, 4, and 21-month-old twins Charlotte and William, Belinda and Shaun Stafford didn’t know what to do with their remaining embryos. Their babies. Donation wasn’t an option, the annual storage fee was an added financial strain, and disposing of them unimaginable.

So when the NSW couple heard about Baby Bee Hummingbirds, an Australian company turning embryos into keepsake jewelley, they jumped at the chance. Now Ms Stafford has all of her babies with her every day – including seven embryos in her heart-shaped pendant worn close to her heart, always.

The mom said the financial strain would be too much to keep the embryos alive in perpetuity so the couple considered planting the embryos in a garden. But she said they move too much and she couldn't bear to leave them behind. Hence, the necklace.

In quotes that sound like a commercial for jewelry made from embryos, the mother said:

“My embryos were my babies - frozen in time.

“When we completed our family, it wasn’t in my heart to destroy them.

“Now they are forever with me in a beautiful keepsake.”

Amy McGlade, founder of Baby Bee Hummingbird, said that while they make thousands of keepsakes that include breast milk over placenta, they've made over 50 pieces of jewelry made of embryos in the past few years. “I don’t believe there is any other business in the world that creates jewellery from human embryos, and I firmly believe that we are pioneering the way in this sacred art, and opening the possibilities to families around the world,” she said.

Did she just say ""sacred art?"" Make. It. Stop. The more I read the more horrified I became. But wait, it gets worse. According to the group's Facebook page, they're running a sale!

The families we craft for are truly aware of the various world wide options for Embryos in storage. They are informed, educated & loving people who have made an educated decision. • • • • • • We are absolute experts & true original leaders in Embryo Ashes • DNA Jewellery. This is an exclusive concept unique Baby Bee Hummingbirds. We are working with a number of local & international fertility clinics to raise awareness of this option for families.

The next step in to create educational tools & information packs suitable reflective of this exclusive art. We are therefore offering 15% off all Embryo Ashes Jewellery. We hope this will make the process more affordable & easier on families. It is our wish that we can have these pieces professionally photographed & used for our resources.

EMBRYO15 This is the code. It only applies to pieces crafted with Embryos & will help raise much needed awareness.

Here's a rule of thumb. Any time someone talks about ""extra"" humans, take a step back. (Yes Bill Nye, you too.)

When I consider where we are as a culture and how confused we are, in the end it really is so simple. Do we believe God created each and every human being? Do we believe life is sacred? Not just important. Sacred. Priceless. (And fyi, priceless means you can't run a sale on it.)

I understand the sorrow of failed pregnancies. The pain of the family featured in that article is real. I have held in my hands my own stillborn child. My heart breaks for those with failed pregnancies or those unable to have children.

I know of a family that after several failed pregnancies opted for IVF and they now have a wonderful baby girl whom they adore. But now the mother is unable to carry children due to complications and they have these ""extra"" embryos frozen. They don't know what to do about them. Unfreeze them? Let them die? Keep them frozen? Heartbreaking decisions. I'm sure those who contact the company selling embryo necklaces are truly seeking solace. But healing comes from Christ, not a keepsake.

There are no good solutions in cases like these for what to do with frozen embryos. Even when one of those solutions is on sale."	Now You Can Turn ‘Extra’ Embryos into Jewelry!

Some consider carob an adequate substitute for chocolate…because it can, when combined with vegetable fat and sugar, be made to approximate the color and consistency of chocolate. Of course, the same arguments can as persuasively be made in favor of dirt.

—Sandra Boynton

CHOCOLATE: The Consuming Passion

For chocolate lovers, there is simply no substitute, and if cocoa beans could be cultivated anywhere, cocoa (Theobroma cacao) trees might outnumber apple trees in American yards. They would certainly outnumber any plants that produced vegetables.

Unfortunately, cacao trees don't thrive in the temperate climate of the continental United States. Chocolate grows best in the places where it would quickly melt in your hands. Over the next several decades, those places may grow warmer, drier, and less suitable to cacao cultivation. But with planning and adaptation, cacao farmers can keep producing our favorite treat.

The geography of chocolate

Cacao can only grow within about 20° north and south of the equator—south of the Mediterranean home of carob, in fact. Cacao trees only prosper under specific conditions, including fairly uniform temperatures, high humidity, abundant rain, nitrogen-rich soil, and protection from wind. In short, cacao trees thrive in rainforests.

Chocolate is now grown around the globe—typically within 10° north and south of the equator. The world's leading producers are Côte d’Ivoire, Ghana, and Indonesia. Côte d'Ivoire and Ghana produce over half of the world's chocolate. But research highlighted in the Intergovernmental Panel on Climate Change (IPCC) Climate Change 2014: Impacts, Adaptation, and Vulnerability report indicates that, under a “business as usual” scenario, those countries will experience a 3.8°F (2.1°C) increase in temperature by 2050, and a marked reduction in suitable cultivation area.

It’s not the heat, it’s the (lack of) humidity

Another staple of American consumption, coffee, suffers direct harm from rising temperatures, but chocolate is different. Rising temperatures alone won’t necessarily hurt cacao production. Cacao cultivation areas in Malaysia, for instance, already endure a warmer climate than in West Africa without any obvious negative effect.

The danger to chocolate comes from an increase in evapotranspiration, especially since the higher temperatures projected for West Africa by 2050 are unlikely to be accompanied by an increase in rainfall, according to business-as-usual carbon dioxide emissions scenarios. In other words, as higher temperatures squeeze more water out of soil and plants, it's unlikely that rainfall will increase enough to offset the moisture loss.

Some of the research highlighted by the IPCC 2014 report is a 2013 study headed by Peter Läderach. Läderach authored a 2011 paper giving a pretty dire forecast for cacao cultivation; the 2013 study reaches slightly less worrisome conclusions, though challenges to West Africa cacao growers remain.

An uphill battle

By 2050, rising temperatures will push the suitable cacao cultivation areas uphill. The IPCC reported that Côte d'Ivoire and Ghana’s optimal altitude for cacao cultivation is expected to rise from 350–800 feet (100–250 meters) to 1,500–1,600 feet (450–500 meters) above sea level.

These maps show suitability for cacao cultivation at present (left) and projected for 2050 (right). Image adapted from Läderach et al. 2013.

Läderach and his team report that areas expected to show improved cultivation conditions are often hilly terrain. One example is Ghana’s Atewa Range. It’s a forest preserve where cultivation isn’t permitted. Cacao-growing countries may have to choose which priority matters more: growing a product to meet a global demand, or preserving natural habitat.

In fact, Läderach and coauthors found that, of the 294 locations examined in the study, only 10.5% showed increasing suitability for cacao production; the remaining 89.5% were likely to become less suitable by 2050. The authors continued, “These changes in climatic suitability are predicted to take place over a time period of almost 40 years, so they will mostly impact the next rather than the current generation of cocoa trees and farmers. In other words, there is time for adaptation.”

Helping chocolate cope with climate change

One adaptation strategy could be providing cacao growers with selectively bred seeds that have superior drought resistance. Another strategy involves a traditional cacao cultivation method that takes advantage of the conditions under which cacao naturally grows.

Known in Brazil as cabruca, this approach involves retaining, or in some cases replanting, other rainforest trees, which provide cacao trees with shade. (Like Northern European tourists in the Mediterranean, cacao trees benefit enormously from shade.) This approach could help decrease both temperature and evapotranspiration.

The taller trees also provide protection from wind and soil erosion, and nutrient-rich leaf litter. Cacao trees cultivated in this approach appear less vulnerable to pests, and the soil better retains its ability to support cacao over the long term.

Cabruca offers one more advantage: Carbon that would otherwise be released into the atmosphere when forests are cleared isn't. It remains stored in the trees. A study conducted in southern Cameroon and published in 2009 found that cacao forests in that region store on average 243 metric tons per hectare (about 2.5 acres). (For comparison, in 2011–2015, the World Bank reported, U.S. citizens released about 17.0 metric tons of carbon dioxide per person per year.) Another study, conducted in Brazil and published in 2014, concluded that judicious cabruca practices could double cacao production in a climate-friendly manner.

So while you may not be able to grow your own chocolate in your own back yard, you can still enjoy this most delectable of treats, delivered from exotic lands. If cacao growers are able to plan for the future, that will be good news for your taste buds and our planet.

Wilson County District Attorney Audrey Louis said the Texas Crime Victims' Compensation Fund, part of the state attorney general's office, had approved distributing $6,500 per victim to help with funeral costs.

""In addition to that, there is a company that has come forward that has agreed to donate all their caskets to all of the victims, and we are grateful for that person and their service to our community,"" Louis said, according to NBC affiliate KXAN of Austin.

The Sutherland Springs Community Association, meanwhile, said it had set up a victims fund through a local credit union.

The church asked donors to be cautious of other online fundraising campaigns, saying it was setting up its own account on GoFundMe and was working to verify online campaigns set up by others.

Sherri Pomeroy, the wife of Pastor Frank Pomeroy, said Tuesday on Facebook that her husband was coordinating with the attorney general's office ""to make sure everything is done lawfully and carefully, so your generosity will not be compromised in any way.""

This left-side bias holds true for both men and women and it also applies to the skin cancer melanoma. Researchers Örjan Hallberg of Hallberg Independent Research in Sweden and Ollie Johansson of The Karolinska Institute in Sweden, writing in the June issue of the journal Pathophysiology, suggest a surprising explanation that not only points to a common cause for both cancers, it may change your sleeping habits.







For unknown reasons the rates of breast cancer and melanoma have both increased steadily in the last 30 years. Exposure to the sun elevates the risk of melanoma, but the sun's intensity has not changed in the last three decades. Stranger still, melanoma most commonly affects the hip, thighs and trunk, which are areas of the body protected from the sun. What is responsible for the left-side dominance and increasing incidence of these cancers?







An intriguing clue comes from the Far East. In Japan there is no correlation between the rates of melanoma and breast cancer as there is in the West, and there is no left-side prevalence for either disease. Moreover, the rate of breast cancer in Japan is significantly lower than in the West; only 3 percent of what is seen in Sweden, for example. The rate of prostate cancer in Japan is only 10 percent of that in the U.K. and U.S.







The researchers suggest an explanation based on differences in sleeping habits in Japan and Western countries. Previous research has shown that both men and women prefer to sleep on their right sides. The reasons for this general preference are unclear, but sleeping on the right side may reduce the weight stress on the heart, and the heartbeat is not as loud as when sleeping on the left. Still, there is no reason to suspect that people in Japan sleep in positions that are any different from those in the West. The beds in Japan, however, are different. The futons used for sleeping in Japan are mattresses placed directly on the bedroom floor, in contrast to the elevated box springs and mattress of beds used in the West. A link between bedroom furniture and cancer seems absurd, but this, the researchers conclude, is the answer.







The first line of evidence they cite comes from a 2007 study in Sweden conducted between 1989 and 1993 that revealed a strong link between the incidence of melanoma and the number of FM and TV transmission towers covering the area where the individuals lived. Despite epidemiological correlations like this one suggesting the possibility that electromagnetic radiation from FM and TV broadcasts stations could suppress the immune system and promote cancer, the strength of these electromagnetic fields is so feeble it has been difficult to imagine any biological basis for the correlation.







Consider, however, that even a TV set cannot respond to broadcast transmissions unless the weak electromagnetic waves are captured and amplified by an appropriately designed antenna. Antennas are simply metal objects of appropriate length sized to match the wavelength of a specific frequency of electromagnetic radiation. Just as saxophones are made in different sizes to resonate with and amplify particular wavelengths of sound, electromagnetic waves are selectively amplified by metal objects that are the same, half or one quarter of the wavelength of an electromagnetic wave of a specific frequency. Electromagnetic waves resonate on a half-wavelength antenna to create a standing wave with a peak at the middle of the antenna and a node at each end, just as when a string stretched between two points is plucked at the center. In the U.S. bed frames and box springs are made of metal, and the length of a bed is exactly half the wavelength of FM and TV transmissions that have been broadcasting since the late 1940s. In Japan most beds are not made of metal, and the TV broadcast system does not use the 87- to 108-megahertz frequency used in Western countries.







Thus, as we sleep on our coil-spring mattresses, we are in effect sleeping on an antenna that amplifies the intensity of the broadcast FM/TV radiation. Asleep on these antennas, our bodies are exposed to the amplified electromagnetic radiation for a third of our life spans. As we slumber on a metal coil-spring mattress, a wave of electromagnetic radiation envelops our bodies so that the maximum strength of the field develops 75 centimeters above the mattress in the middle of our bodies. When sleeping on the right side, the body's left side will thereby be exposed to field strength about twice as strong as what the right side absorbs.







If this study is correct, the solution is simple: Replace the metal in our beds with a nonmetallic mattress or orient your bed, like an antenna, away from the direction of the local FM/TV transmission tower. Call it high-tech feng shui if you like, but if this new study has not identified the cause of left-side cancer, it will, for some, be the cause of insomnia.

Its young protagonists are one moment reminiscent of the idealistic early Christians, yet they also urge violence and cry, ""Burn the system down!"" They have no illusions about the system, but plenty of illusions about the way to change our world. It is to this point that I have written this book. These words are written in desperation, partly because it is what they do and will do that will give meaning to what I and the radicals of my generation have done with our lives. They are now the vanguard, and they had to start almost from scratch. Few of us survived the Joe McCarthy holocaust of the early 1950s and of those there were even fewer whose understanding and insights had developed beyond the dialectical materialism of orthodox Marxism. My fellow radicals who were supposed to pass on the torch of experience and insights to a new genera- Prologue xiv tion just were not there. As the young looked at the society around them, it was all, in their words, ""materialistic, decadent, bourgeois in its values, bankrupt and violent."" Is it any wonder that they rejected us in toto. Today's generation is desperately trying to make some sense out of their lives and out of the world. Most of them are products of the middle class. They have rejected their materialistic backgrounds, the goal of a well-paid job, suburban home, automobile, country club membership, first-class travel, status, security, and everything that meant success to their parents. They have had it. They watched it lead their parents to tranquilizers, alcohol, long-term-endurance marriages, or divorces, high blood pressure, ulcers, frustration, and the disillusionment of ""the good life."" They have seen the almost unbelievable idiocy of our political leadership — in the past political leaders, ranging from the mayors to governors to the White House, were regarded with respect and almost reverence; today they are viewed with contempt. This negativism now extends to all institutions, from the police and the courts to ""the system"" itself. We are living in a world of mass media which daily exposes society's innate hypocrisy, its contradictions and the apparent failure of almost every facet of our social and political life. The young have seen their ""activist"" participatory democracy turn into its antithesis — nihilistic bombing and murder. The political panaceas of the past, such as the revolutions in Russia and China, have become the same old stuff under a different name. The search for freedom does not seem to have any road or destination. The young are inundated with a barrage of information and facts so overwhelming that the world has come to seem an utter bedlam, which has them spinning in a frenzy, looking for what man has always Prologue xv looked for from the beginning of time, a way of life that has some meaning or sense. A way of life means a certain degree of order where things have some relationship and can be pieced together into a system that at least provides some clues to what life is about. Men have always yearned for and sought direction by setting up religions, inventing political philosophies, creating scientific systems like Newton's, or formulating ideologies of various kinds. This is what is behind the common cliche, ""getting it all together"" — despite the realization that all values and factors are relative, fluid, and changing, and that it will be possible to ""get it all together"" only relatively. The elements will shift and move together just like the changing pattern in a turning kaleidoscope. In the past the ""world,"" whether in its physical or intellectual terms, was much smaller, simpler, and more orderly. It inspired credibility. Today everything is so complex as to be incomprehensible. What sense does it make for men to walk on the moon while other men are waiting on welfare lines, or in Vietnam killing and dying for a corrupt dictatorship in the name of freedom? These are the days when man has his hands on the sublime while he is up to his hips in the muck of madness. The establishment in many ways is as suicidal as some of the far left, except that they are infinitely more destructive than the far left can ever be. The outcome of the hopelessness and despair is morbidity. There is a feeling of death hanging over the nation. Today's generation faces all this and says, ""I don't want to spend my life the way my family and their friends have. I want to do something, to create, to be me, to 'do my own thing,' to live. The older generation doesn't understand and worse doesn't want to. I don't want to be just a Prologue xvi piece of data to be fed into a computer or a statistic in a public opinion poll, just a voter carrying a credit card."" To the young the world seems insane and falling apart. On the other side is the older generation, whose members are no less confused. If they are not as vocal or conscious, it may be because they can escape to a past when the world was simpler. They can still cling to the old values in the simple hope that everything will work out somehow, some way. That the younger generation will ""straighten out"" with the passing of time. Unable to come to grips with the world as it is, they retreat in any confrontation with the younger generation with that infuriating cliche, ""when you get older you'll understand. ""One wonders at their reaction if some youngster were to reply, ""When you get youngerwh\ch will never be then you'll understand, so of course you'll never understand."" Those of the older generation who claim a desire to understand say, ""When I talk to my kids or their friends I'll say to them, 'Look, I believe what you have to tell me is important and I respect it. You call me a square and say that Tm not with it' or I don't know where it's at' or I don't know where the scene is' and all of the rest of the words you use. Well, I'm going to agree with you. So suppose you tell me. What do you want? What do you mean when you say 'I want to do my thing.' What the hell is your thing? You say you want a better world. Like what? And don't tell me a world of peace and love and all the rest of that stuff because people are people, as you will find out when you get older — I'm sorry, I didn't mean to say anything about 'when you get older.' I really do respect what you have to say. Now why don't you answer me? Do you know what you want? Do you know what you're talking about? Why can't we get together?' "" Prologue xvii And that is what we call the generation gap. What the present generation wants is what all generations have always wanted — a meaning, a sense of what the world and life are — a chance to strive for some sort of order. If the young were now writing our Declaration of Independence they would begin, ""When in the course of inhuman events . . ."" and their bill of particulars would range from Vietnam to our black, Chicano, and Puerto Rican ghettos, to the migrant workers, to Appalachia, to the hate, ignorance, disease, and starvation in the world. Such a bill of particulars would emphasize the absurdity of human affairs and the forlornness and emptiness, the fearful loneliness that comes from not knowing if there is any meaning to our lives. When they talk of values they're asking for a reason. They are searching for an answer, at least for a time, to man's greatest question, ""Why am I here?"" The young react to their chaotic world in different ways. Some panic and run, rationalizing. that the system is going to collapse anyway of its own rot and corruption and so they're copping out, going hippie or yippie, taking drugs, trying communes, anything to escape. Others went for pointless sure-loser confrontations so that they could fortify their rationalization and say, ""Well, we tried and did our part"" and then they copped out too. Others sick with guilt and not knowing where to turn or what to do went berserk. These were the Weathermen and their like: they took the grand cop-out, suicide. To these I have nothing to say or give but pity — and in some cases contempt, for such as those who leave their dead comrades and take off for Algeria or other points. What I have to say in this book is not the arrogance Prologue xvm of unsolicited advice. It is the experience and counsel that so many young people have questioned me about through all-night sessions on hundreds of campuses in America. It is for those young radicals who are committed to the fight, committed to life. Remember we are talking about revolution, not revelation; you can miss the target by shooting too high as well as too low. First, there are no rules for revolution any more than there are rules for love or rules for happiness, butthere are rules for radicals who want to change their world; there are certain central concepts of action in human politics that operate regardless of the scene or the time. To know these is basic to a pragmatic attack on the system. These rules make the difference between being a realistic radical and being a rhetorical one who uses the tired old words and slogans, calls the police ""pig"" or ""white fascist racist"" or ""motherfucker"" and has so stereotyped himself that others react by saying, ""Oh, he's one of those,"" and then promptly turn off. This failure of many of our younger activists to understand the art of communication has been disastrous. Even the most elementary grasp of the fundamental idea that one communicates within the experience of his audience — and gives full respect to the other's values — would have ruled out attacks on the American flag. The responsible organizer would have known that it is the establishment that has betrayed the flag while the flag, itself, remains the glorious symbol of America's hopes and aspirations, and he would have conveyed this message to his audience. On another level of communication, humor is essential, for through humor much is accepted that would have been rejected if presented seriously. This is a sad and lonely generation. It laughs too little, and this, too, is tragic. Prologue xix For the real radical, doing ""his thing"" is to do the social thing, for and with people. In a world where everything is so interrelated that one feels helpless to know where or how to grab hold and act, defeat sets in; for years there have been people who've found society too overwhelming and have withdrawn, concentrated on ""doing their own thing."" Generally we have put them into mental hospitals and diagnosed them as schizophrenics. If the real radical finds that having long hair sets up psychological barriers to communication and organization, he cuts his hair. If I were organizing in an orthodox Jewish community I would not walk in there eating a ham sandwich, unless I wanted to be rejected so I could have an excuse to cop out. My ""thing,"" if I want to organize, is solid communication with the people in the community. Lacking communication I am in reality silent; throughout history silence has been regarded as assent — in this case assent to the system. As an organizer I start from where the world is, as it is, not as I would like it to be. That we accept the world as it is does not in any sense weaken our desire to change it into what we believe it should be — it is necessary to begin where the world is if we are going to change it to what we think it should be. That means working in the system. There's another reason for working inside the system. Dostoevski said that taking a new step is what people fear most. Any revolutionary change must be preceded by a passive, affirmative, non-challenging attitude toward change among the mass of our people. They must feel so frustrated, so defeated, so lost, so futureless in the prevailing system that they are willing to let go of the past and chance the future. This acceptance is the reformation essential to any revolution. To bring on this reformation re- Prologue XX quires that the organizer work inside the system, among not only the middle class but the 40 per cent of American families — more than seventy million people — whose incomes range from $5,000 to $10,000 a year. They cannot be dismissed by labeling them blue collar or hard hat. They will not continue to be relatively passive and slightly challenging. If we fail to communicate with them, if we don't encourage them to form alliances with us, they will move to the right. Maybe they will anyway, but let's not let it happen by default. Our youth are impatient with the preliminaries that are essential to purposeful action. Effective organization is thwarted by the desire for instant and dramatic change, or as I have phrased it elsewhere the demand for revelation rather than revolution. It's the kind of thing we see in play writing; the first act introduces the characters and the plot, in the second act the plot and characters are developed as the play strives to hold the audience's attention. In the final act good and evil have their dramatic confrontation and resolution. The present generation wants to go right into the third act, skipping the first two, in which case there is no play, nothing but confrontation for confrontation's sake — a flare-up and back to darkness. To build a powerful organization takes time. It is tedious, but that's the way the game is played — if you want to play and not just yell, ""Kill the umpire."" What is the alternative to working ""inside"" the system? A mess of rhetorical garbage about ""Burn the system down!"" Yippie yells of ""Do it!"" or ""Do your thing."" What else? Bombs? Sniping? Silence when police are killed and screams of ""murdering fascist pigs"" when others are killed? Attacking and baiting the police? Public suicide? ""Power comes out of the barrel of a gun!"" is an absurd rallying cry Prologue xxi when the other side has all the guns. Lenin was a pragmatist; when he returned to what was then Petrograd from exile, he said that the Bolsheviks stood for getting power through the ballot but would reconsider after they got the guns! Militant mouthings? Spouting quotes from Mao, Castro, and Che Guevara, which are as germane to our highly technological, computerized, cybernetic, nuclear-powered, mass media society as a stagecoach on a jet runway at Kennedy airport? Let us in the name of radical pragmatism not forget that in our system with all its repressions we can still speak out and denounce the administration, attack its policies, work to build an opposition political base. True, there is government harassment, but there still is that relative freedom to fight. I can attack my government, try to organize to change it. That's more than I can do in Moscow, Peking, or Havana. Remember the reaction of the Red Guard to the ""cultural revolution"" and the fate of the Chinese college students. Just a few of the violent episodes of bombings or a courtroom shootout that we have experienced here would have resulted in a sweeping purge and mass executions in Russia, China, or Cuba. Let's keep some perspective. We will start with the system because there is no other place to start from except political lunacy. It is most important for those of us who want revolutionary change to understand that revolution must be preceded by reformation. To assume that a political revolution can survive without the supporting base of a popular reformation is to ask for the impossible in politics. Men don't like to step abruptly out of the security of familiar experience; they need a bridge to cross from their own experience to a new way. A revolutionary organizer Prologue xxii must shake up the prevailing patterns of their lives — agitate, create disenchantment and discontent with the current values, to produce, if not a passion for change, at least a passive, affirmative, non-challenging climate. ""The Revolution was effected before the war commenced,"" John Adams wrote. ""The Revolution was in the hearts and minds of the people . . . This radical change in the principles, opinions, sentiments and affections of the people was the real American Revolution."" A revolution without a prior reformation would collapse or become a totalitarian tyranny. A reformation means that masses of our people have reached the point of disillusionment with past ways and values. They don't know what will work but they do know that the prevailing system is self-defeating, frustrating, and hopeless. They won't act for change but won't strongly oppose those who do. The time is then ripe for revolution. Those who, for whatever combination of reasons, encourage the opposite of reformation, become the unwitting allies of the far political right. Parts of the far left have gone so far in the political circle that they are now all but indistinguishable from the extreme right. It reminds me of the days when Hitler, new on the scene, was excused for his actions by ""humanitarians"" on the grounds of a paternal rejection and childhood trauma. When there are people who espouse the assassination of Senator Robert Kennedy or the Tate murders or the Marin County Courthouse kidnapping and killings or the University of Wisconsin bombing and killing as ""revolutionary acts,"" then we are dealing with people who are merely hiding psychosis behind a political mask. The masses of people recoil with horror and say, ""Our way is bad and we were willing to let it change, but certainly not for this murderous madness — no matter Prologue xxiii how bad things are now, they are better than that."" So they begin to turn back. They regress into acceptance of a coming massive repression in the name of ""law and order."" In the midst of the gassing and violence by the Chicago Police and National Guard during the 1968 Democratic Convention many students asked me, ""Do you still believe we should try to work inside our system?"" These were students who had been with Eugene McCarthy in New Hampshire and followed him across the country. Some had been with Robert Kennedy when he was killed in Los Angeles. Many of the tears that were shed in Chicago were not from gas. ""Mr. Alinsky, we fought in primary after primary and the people voted noov\ Vietnam. Look at that convention. They're not paying any attention to the vote. Look at your police and the army. You still want us to work in the system?"" It hurt me to see the American army with drawn bayonets advancing on American boys and girls. But the answer I gave the young radicals seemed to me the only realistic one: ""Do one of three things. One, go find a wailing wall and feel sorry for yourselves. Two, go psycho and start bombing — but this will only swing people to the right. Three, learn a lesson. Go home, organize, build power and at the next convention, you be the delegates. "" Remember: once you organize people around something as commonly agreed upon as pollution, then an organized people is on the move. From there it's a short and natural step to political pollution, to Pentagon pollution. It is not enough just to elect your candidates. You must keep the pressure on. Radicals should keep in mind Franklin D. Roosevelt's response to a reform delegation, ""Okay, you've convinced me. Now go on out and bring pressure on me!"" Action comes from keeping the heat on. Prologue xxiv No politician can sit on a hot issue if you make it hot enough. As for Vietnam, I would like to see our nation be the first in the history of man to publicly say, ""We were wrong! What we did was horrible. We got in and kept getting in deeper and deeper and at every step we invented new reasons for staying. We have paid part of the price in 44,000 dead Americans. There is nothing we can ever do to make it up to the people of Indo-China — or to our own people — but we will try. We believe that our world has come of age so that it is no longer a sign of weakness or defeat to abandon a childish pride and vanity, to admit we were wrong."" Such an admission would shake up the foreign policy concepts of all nations and open the door to a new international order. This is our alternative to Vietnam — anything else is the old makeshift patchwork. If this were to happen, Vietnam may even have been somewhat worth it. A final word on our system. The democratic ideal springs from the ideas of liberty, equality, majority rule through free elections, protection of the rights of minorities, and freedom to subscribe to multiple loyalties in matters of religion, economics, and politics rather than to a total loyalty to the state. The spirit of democracy is the idea of importance and worth in the individual, and faith in the kind of world where the individual can achieve as much of his potential as possible. Great dangers always accompany great opportunities. The possibility of destruction is always implicit in the act of creation. Thus the greatest enemy of individual freedom is the individual himself. From the beginning the weakness as well as the strength of the democratic ideal has been the people. Prologue xxv People cannot be free unless they are willing to sacrifice some of their interests to guarantee the freedom of others. The price of democracy is the ongoing pursuit of the common good by all of the people. One hundred and thirty-five years ago Tocqueville* gravely warned that unless individual citizens were regularly involved in the action of governing themselves, self-government would pass from the scene. Citizen participation is the animating spirit and force in a society predicated on voluntarism. We are not here concerned with people who profess the democratic faith but yearn for the dark security of dependency where they can be spared the burden of decisions. Reluctant to grow up, or incapable of doing so, they want to remain children and be cared for by others. Those who can, should be encouraged to grow; for the others, the fault lies not in the system but in themselves. Here we are desperately concerned with the vast mass of our people who, thwarted through lack of interest or opportunity, or both, do not participate in the endless re- * ""It must not be forgotten that it is especially dangerous to enslave men in the minor details of life. For my own part, I should be inclined to think freedom less necessary in great things than in little ones, if it were possible to be secure of the one without possessing the other. ""Subjection in minor affairs breaks out every day, and is felt by the whole community indiscriminately. It does not drive men to resistance, but it crosses them at every turn, till they are led to surrender the exercise of their will. Thus their spirit is gradually broken and their character enervated; whereas that obedience, which is exacted on a few important but rare occasions, only exhibits servitude at certain intervals, and throws the burden of it upon a small number of men. It is vain to summon a people, which has been rendered so dependent on the central power, to choose from time to time the representatives of that power; this rare and brief exercise of their free choice, however, important it may be, will not prevent them from gradually losing the faculties of thinking, feeling, and acting for themselves, and thus gradually falling below the level of humanity."" — Alexis de Tocqueville, Democracy in America Prologue xxvi sponsibilities of citizenship and are resigned to lives determined by others. To lose your ""identity"" as a citizen of democracy is but a step from losing your identity as a person. People react to this frustration by not acting at all. The separation of the people from the routine daily functions of citizenship is heartbreak in a democracy. It is a grave situation when a people resign their citizenship or when a resident of a great city, though he may desire to take a hand, lacks the means to participate. That citizen sinks further into apathy, anonymity, and depersonalization. The result is that he comes to depend on public authority and a state of civic-sclerosis sets in. From time to time there have been external enemies at our gates; there has always been the enemy within, the hidden and malignant inertia that foreshadows more certain destruction to our life and future than any nuclear warhead. There can be no darker or more devastating tragedy than the death of man's faith in himself and in his power to direct his future. I salute the present generation. Hang on to one of your most precious parts of youth, laughter — don't lose it as many of you seem to have done, you need it. Together we may find some of what we're looking for — laughter, beauty, love, and the chance to create. Saul Alinsky The Purpose The life of man upon earth is a warfare... —Job 7:1 WHAT FOLLOWS IS for those who want to change the world from what it is to what they believe it should be. The Prince was written by Machiavelli for the Haves on how to hold power. Rules for Radicals is written for the Have-Nots on how to take it away. In this book we are concerned with how to create mass organizations to seize power and give it to the people; to realize the democratic dream of equality, justice, peace, cooperation, equal and full opportunities for education, full and useful employment, health, and the creation of those circumstances in which man can have the chance to live by values that give meaning to life. We are talking about a mass power organization which will change the world into a place where all men and women walk erect, in the spirit of that credo of the Spanish Civil War, ""Better to die on your feet than to live on your knees."" This means revolution. The significant changes in history have been made by revolutions. There are people who say that it is not revolution, but evolution, that brings about change — but evolution is simply the term used by nonparticipants to denote a Rules for Radicals 4 particular sequence of revolutions as they synthesized into a specific major social change. In this book I propose certain general observations, propositions, and concepts of the mechanics of mass movements and the various stages of the cycle of action and reaction in revolution. This is not an ideological book except insofar as argument for change, rather than for the status quo, can be called an ideology; different people, in different places, in different situations and different times will construct their own solutions and symbols of salvation for those times. This book will not contain any panacea or dogma; I detest and fear dogma. I know that all revolutions must have ideologies to spur them on. That in the heat of conflict these ideologies tend to be smelted into rigid dogmas claiming exclusive possession of the truth, and the keys to paradise, is tragic. Dogma is the enemy of human freedom. Dogma must be watched for and apprehended at every turn and twist of the revolutionary movement. The human spirit glows from that small inner light of doubt whether we are right, while those who believe with complete certainty that they possess the right are dark inside and darken the world outside with cruelty, pain, and injustice. Those who enshrine the poor or Have-Nots are as guilty as other dogmatists and just as dangerous. To diminish the danger that ideology will deteriorate into dogma, and to protect the free, open, questing, and creative mind of man, as well as to allow for change, no ideology should be more specific than that of America's founding fathers: ""For the general welfare."" Niels Bohr, the great atomic physicist, admirably stated the civilized position on dogmatism: ""Every sentence I utter must be understood not as an affirmation, but as a question."" I will argue that man's hopes lie in the acceptance of the great law of change; that a general understanding of the The Purpose 5 principles of change will provide clues for rational action and an awareness of the realistic relationship between means and ends and how each determines the other. I hope that these pages will contribute to the education of the radicals of today, and to the conversion of hot, emotional, impulsive passions that are impotent and frustrating to actions that will be calculated, purposeful, and effective. An example of the political insensitivity of many of today's so-called radicals and the lost opportunities is found in this account of an episode during the trial of the Chicago Seven: Over the weekend some hundred fifty lawyers, from all parts of the country, had gathered in Chicago to picket the federal building in protest against Judge Hoffman's [arrest of] the four lawyers. This delegation, which was supported by thirteen members of the faculty of Harvard Law School and which included a number of other professors as well, submitted a brief, as friend of the Court, which called Judge Hoffman's actions ""a travesty of justice [which] threatens to destroy the confidence of the American people in the entire judicial process . . ."" By ten o'clock the angry lawyers had begun to march around the Federal Building, where they were joined by hundreds of student radicals, several Black Panthers, and a hundred or more blue-helmeted Chicago police. Shortly before noon, about forty of the picketing lawyers carried their signs into the lobby of the Federal Building, despite the notice posted on the glass wall beside the entrance, and signed by Judge Campbell, forbidding such demonstrations within the building. Hardly had the lawyers entered, however, than Judge Campbell himself descended to the lobby, dressed in his black robes Rules for Radicals 6 and accompanied by a marshal, a stenographer, and his court clerk. Surrounded by the angry lawyers, who were themselves encircled by a ring of police and federal marshals, the Judge proceeded to hold Court then and there. He announced that unless the pickets withdrew immediately, he would charge them with contempt. This time, he warned, there could be no question that their contempt would occur in the presence of the Court, and would thus be subject to summary punishment. No sooner had he made this announcement however, than a voice from the throng shouted, ""Fuck you, Campbell."" After a moment of tense silence, followed by a cheer from the crowd and a noticeable stiffening among the police, Judge Campbell himself withdrew. Then the lawyers, too, left the lobby and rejoined the pickets on the sidewalk. — Jason Epstein, The Great Conspiracy Trial, Random House, 1970. The picketing lawyers threw away a beautiful opportunity to create a nationwide issue. Offhand, there would seem to have been two choices, either of which would have forced the judge's hand and kept the issue going: some one of the lawyers could have stepped up to the judge after the voice said, ""Fuck you, Campbell,"" said that the lawyers there did not support personal obscenities, but they were not leaving; or all the lawyers together could have chorused, with one voice, ""Fuck you, Campbell!"" They did neither; instead, they let the initiative pass from them to the judge, and achieved nothing. Radicals must be resilient, adaptable to shifting political circumstances, and sensitive enough to the process of action and reaction to avoid being trapped by their own tactics and forced to travel a road not of their choosing. In The Purpose 7 short, radicals must have a degree of control over the flow of events. Here I propose to present an arrangement of certain facts and general concepts of change, a step toward a science of revolution. All societies discourage and penalize ideas and writings that threaten the ruling status quo. It is understandable, therefore, that the literature of a Have society is a veritable desert whenever we look for writings on social change. Once the American Revolution was done with, we can find very little besides the right of revolution that is laid down in the Declaration of Independence as a fundamental right; seventy-three years later Thoreau's brief essay on ""The Duty of Civil Disobedience""; followed by Lincoln's reaffirmation of the revolutionary right in 1861.* There are many phrases extolling the sacredness of revolution — that is, revolutions of the past. Our enthusiasm for the sacred right of revolution is increased and enhanced with the passage of time. The older the revolution, the more it recedes into history, the more sacred it becomes. Except for Thoreau's limited remarks, our society has given us few words of advice, few suggestions of how to fertilize social change. From the Haves, on the other hand, there has come an unceasing flood of literature justifying the status quo. Religious, economic, social, political, and legal tracts endlessly attack all revolutionary ideas and action for change as immoral, fallacious and against God, country, and mother. These literary sedations by the status quo include the threat that, since all such movements are unpatriotic, * Lincoln's First Inaugural. ""This country, with its institutions, belongs to the people who inhabit it. Whenever they shall grow weary of the existing government, they can exercise their constitutional right of amending it, or their revolutionary right to dismember or overthrow it."" Rules for Radicals 8 subversive, spawned in hell and reptilian in their creeping insidiousness, dire punishments will be meted out to their supporters. All great revolutions, including Christianity, the various reformations, democracy, capitalism, and socialism, have suffered these epithets in the times of their birth. To the status quo concerned about its public image, revolution is the only force which has no image, but instead casts a dark, ominous shadow of things to come. The Have-Nots of the world, swept up in their present upheavals and desperately seeking revolutionary writings, can find such literature only from the communists, both red and yellow. Here they can read about tactics, maneuvers, strategy and principles of action in the making of revolutions. Since in this literature all ideas are imbedded in the language of communism, revolution appears synonymous with communism.* When, in the throes of their revolutionary fervor, the Have-Nots hungrily turn to us in their first steps from starvation to subsistence, we respond with a bewildering, unbelievable, and meaningless conglomeration of abstractions about freedom, morality, equality, and the danger of intellectual enslavement by communistic ideology! This is accompanied by charitable handouts dressed up in ribbons of moral principle and * U. S. Supreme Court Justice William O. Douglas, ""The U. S. and Revolution,"" Center for the Study of Democratic Institutions Occasional Paper No. 116: ""On trips to Asia I often asked men in their thirties and forties what they were reading when they were eighteen. They visually answered 'Karl Marx'; and when I asked them why, they replied, 'We were under colonial rule, seeking a way out. We wanted our independence. To get it we had to make revolution. The only books on revolution were published by the communists.' These men almost invariably had repudiated communism as a political cult, retaining, however, a tinge of socialism. As I talked with them, I came to realize the great opportunities we missed when we became preoccupied in fighting communism with bombs and with dollars, rather than with ideas of revolution, of freedom, of justice."" The Purpose 9 ""freedom,"" with the price tag of unqualified political loyalty to us. With the coming of the Revolutions in Russia and China we suddenly underwent a moral conversion and became concerned for the welfare of our brothers all over the world. Revolution by the Have-Nots has a way of inducing a moral revelation among the Haves. Revolution by the Have-Nots also induces a paranoid fear; now, therefore, we find every corrupt and repressive government the world around saying to us, ""Give us money and soldiers or there will be a revolution and the new leaders will be your enemies."" Fearful of revolution and identifying ourselves as the status quo, we have permitted the communists to assume by default the revolutionary halo of justice for the Have-Nots. We then compound this mistake by assuming that the status quo everywhere must be defended and buttressed against revolution. Today revolution has become synonymous with communism while capitalism is synonymous with status quo. Occasionally we will accept a revolution if it is guaranteed to be on our side, and then only when we realize that the revolution is inevitable. We abhor revolutions. We have permitted a suicidal situation to unfold wherein revolution and communism have become one. These pages are committed to splitting this political atom, separating this exclusive identification of communism with revolution. If it were possible for the Have-Nots of the world to recognize and accept the idea that revolution did not inevitably mean hate and war, cold or hot, from the United States, that alone would be a great revolution in world politics and the future of man. This is a major reason for my attempt to provide a revolutionary handbook not cast in a communist or capitalist mold, but as a manual for the Have-Nots of the world regardless of the color of their skins Rules for Radicals 10 or their politics. My aim here is to suggest how to organize for power: how to get it and to use it. I will argue that the failure to use power for a more equitable distribution of the means of life for all people signals the end of the revolution and the start of the counterrevolution. Revolution has always advanced with an ideological spear just as the status quo has inscribed its ideology upon its shield. All of life is partisan. There is no dispassionate objectivity. The revolutionary ideology is not confined to a specific limited formula. It is a series of general principles, rooted in Lincoln's May 19, 1856, statement: ""Be not deceived: Revolutions do not go backward."" THE IDEOL OG Y OF CHANGE This raises the question: what, if any, is my ideology? What kind of ideology, if any, can an organizer have who is working in and for a free society? The prerequisite for an ideology is possession of a basic truth. For example, a Marxist begins with his prime truth that all evils are caused by the exploitation of the proletariat by the capitalists. From this he logically proceeds to the revolution to end capitalism, then into the third stage of reorganization into a new social order or the dictatorship of the proletariat, and finally the last stage — the political paradise of communism. The Christians also begin with their prime truth: the divinity of Christ and the tripartite nature of God. Out of these ""prime truths"" flow a step-by-step ideology. An organizer working in and for an open society is in an ideological dilemma. To begin with, he does not have a fixed The Purpose 1 1 truth — truth to him is relative and changing; everything to him is relative and changing. He is a politcal relativist. He accepts the late Justice Learned Hand's statement that ""the mark of a free man is that ever- gnawing inner uncertainty as to whether or not he is right."" The consequence is that he is ever on the hunt for the causes of man's plight and the general propositions that help to make some sense out of man's irrational world. He must constantly examine life, including his own, to get some idea of what it is all about, and he must challenge and test his own findings. Irreverence, essential to questioning, is a requisite. Curiosity becomes compulsive. His most frequent word is ""why?""* Does this then mean that the organizer in a free society for a free society is rudderless? No, I believe that he has a far better sense of direction and compass than the closed-society organizer with his rigid political ideology. First, the free-society organizer is loose, resilient, fluid, and on the move in a society which is itself in a state of constant change. To the extent that he is free from the shackles of dogma, he can respond to the realities of the widely different situations our society presents. In the end he has one conviction — a belief that if people have the power to act, in the long run they will, most of the time, reach the right decisions. The alternative to this would be rule by the elite — either a dictatorship or some form of a political aristocracy. I am not concerned if this faith in people is regarded as a prime truth and therefore a contradiction of what I have already written, for life is a story of contradictions. Believing in people, the radical has the job of organizing them so that they will have the power and opportunity to best * Some say it's no coincidence that the question mark is an inverted plow, breaking up the hard soil of old beliefs and preparing for the new growth. Rules for Radicals 12 meet each unforeseeable future crisis as they move ahead in their eternal search for those values of equality, justice, freedom, peace, a deep concern for the preciousness of human life, and all those rights and values propounded by Judaeo-Christianity and the democratic political tradition. Democracy is not an end but the best means toward achieving these values. This is my credo for which I live and, if need be, die. The basic requirement for the understanding of the politics of change is to recognize the world as it is. We must work with it on its terms if we are to change it to the kind of world we would like it to be. We must first see the world as it is and not as we would like it to be. We must see the world as all political realists have, in terms of ""what men do and not what they ought to do,"" as Machiavelli and others have put it. It is painful to accept fully the simple fact that one begins from where one is, that one must break free of the web of illusions one spins about life. Most of us view the world not as it is but as we would like it to be. The preferred world can be seen any evening on television in the succession of programs where the good always wins — that is, until the late evening newscast, when suddenly we are plunged into the world as it is."" Political realists see the world as it is: an arena of power politics moved primarily by perceived immediate self-interests, where morality is rhetorical rationale for expe- * With some exceptions. In one of America's Shangri-Las of escape from the world as it is, Carmel-by-the-Sea, California, on the coast of the beautiful Monterey Peninsula, radio station KRML used to broadcast the ""Sunshine News — which headlines the positive, only the good news of the world!"" Intellectuals, who would scoff, at ""Sunshine News,"" are no exception to the preference for already-formulated answers. The Purpose 13 dient action and self-interest. Two examples would be the priest who wants to be a bishop and bootlicks and politicks his way up, justifying it with the rationale, ""After I get to be bishop I'll use my office for Christian reformation,"" or the businessman who reasons, ""First I'll make my million and after that I'll go for the real things in life."" Unfortunately one changes in many ways on the road to the bishopric or the first million, and then one says, ""I'll wait until I'm a cardinal and then I can be more effective,"" or, ""I can do a lot more after I get two million"" — and so it goes.* In this world laws are written for the lofty aim of ""the common good"" and then acted out in life on the basis of the common greed. In this world irrationality clings to man like his shadow so that the right things are done for the wrong reasons — afterwards, we dredge up the right reasons for justification. It is a world not of angels but of angles, where men speak of moral principles but act on power principles; a world where we are always moral and our enemies always immoral; a world where ""reconciliation"" means that when one side gets the power and the other side gets reconciled to it, then we have reconciliation; a world of religious institutions that have, in the main, come to support and justify the status quo * Each year, for a number of years, the activists in the graduating class from a major Catholic seminary near Chicago would visit me for a day just before their ordination, with questions about values, revolutionary tactics, and such. Once, at the end of such a day, one of the seminarians said, ""Mr. Alinsky, before we came here we met and agreed that there was one question we particularly wanted to put to you. We're going to be ordained, and then we'll be assigned to different parishes, as assistants to — frankly — stuffy, reactionary, old pastors. They will disapprove of a lot of what you and we believe in, and we will be put into a killing routine. Our question is: how do we keep our faith in true Christian values, everything we hope to do to change the system?"" That was easy. I answered, ""When you go out that door, just make your own personal decision about whether you want to be a bishop or a priest, and everything else will follow."" Rules for Radicals 14 so that today organized religion is materially solvent and spiritually bankrupt. We live with a Judaeo-Christian ethic that has not only accommodated itself to but justified slavery, war, and every other ugly human exploitation of whichever status quo happened to prevail: We live in a world where ""good"" is a value dependent on whether we want it. In the world as it is, the solution of each problem inevitably creates a new one. In the world as it is there are no permanent happy or sad endings. Such endings belong to the world of fantasy, the world as we would like it to be, the world of children's fairy tales where ""they lived happily ever after."" In the world as it is, the stream of events surges endlessly onward with death as the only terminus. One never reaches the horizon; it is always just beyond, ever beckoning onward; it is the pursuit of life itself. This is the world as it is. This is where you start. It is not a world of peace and beauty and dispassionate rationality, but as Henry James once wrote, ""Life is, in fact, a battle. Evil is insolent and strong; beauty enchanting but rare; goodness very apt to be weak; folly very apt to be defiant; wickedness to carry the day; imbeciles to be in great places, people of sense in small, and mankind generally unhappy. But the world as it stands is no narrow illusion, no phantasm, no evil dream of the night; we wake up to it again forever and ever; and we can neither forget it nor deny it nor dispense with it."" Henry James's statement is an affirmation of that of Job: ""The life of man upon earth is a warfare..."" Disraeli put it succinctly: ""Political life must be taken as you find it."" Once we have moved into the world as it is then we begin to shed fallacy after fallacy. The prime illusion we must rid ourselves of is the conventional view in which things are seen separate from their inevitable counterparts. The Purpose 15 We know intellectually that everything is functionally interrelated, but in our operations we segment and isolate all values and issues. Everything about us must be seen as the indivisible partner of its converse, light and darkness, good and evil, life and death. From the moment we are born we begin to die. Happiness and misery are inseparable. So are peace and war. The threat of destruction from nuclear energy conversely carries the opportunity of peace and plenty, and so with every component of this universe; all is paired in this enormous Noah's Ark of life. Life seems to lack rhyme or reason or even a shadow of order unless we approach it with the key of converses. Seeing everything in its duality, we begin to get some dim clues to direction and what it's all about. It is in these contradictions and their incessant interacting tensions that creativity begins. As we begin to accept the concept of contradictions we see every problem or issue in its whole, interrelated sense. We then recognize that for every positive there is a negative,"" and that there is nothing positive without its concomitant negative, nor any political paradise without its negative side. Niels Bohr pointed out that the appearance of contradictions was a signal that the experiment was on the right track: ""There is not much hope if we have only one difficulty, but when we have two, we can match them off against each other."" Bohr called this ""complementarity,"" * For more than four thousand years the Chinese have been familiar with the principle of complementarity in their philosophical life. They believe that from the illimitable (nature, God or gods) came the principle of creation which they called the Great Extreme and from the Great Extreme came the Two Principles or Dual Powers, Yang and Yin, out of which came everything else. Yang and Yin have been defined as positive and negative, light and darkness, male and female, or numerous other examples of opposites or converses. Rules for Radicals 16 meaning that the interplay of seemingly conflicting forces or opposites is the actual harmony of nature. Whitehead similarly observed, ""In formal logic, a contradiction is the signal of a defeat; but in the evolution of real knowledge it marks the first step in progress towards a victory."" Everywhere you look all change shows this complementarity. In Chicago the people of Upton Sinclair's Jungle, then the worst slum in America, crushed by starvation wages when they worked, demoralized, diseased, living in rotting shacks, were organized. Their banners proclaimed equality for all races, job security, and a decent life for all. With their power they fought and won. Today, as part of the middle class, they are also part of our racist, discriminatory culture. The Tennessee Valley Authority was one of the prize jewels in the democratic crown. Visitors came from every part of the world to see, admire, and study this physical and social achievement of a free society. Today it is the scourge of the Cumberland Mountains, strip mining for coal and wreaking havoc on the countryside. The C.I.O. was the militant champion of America's workers. In its ranks, directly and indirectly, were all of America's radicals; they fought the corporate structure of the nation and won. Today, merged with the A.F. of L, it is an entrenched member of the establishment and its leader supports the war in Vietnam. Another example is today's high-rise public housing projects. Originally conceived and carried through as major advances in ridding cities of slums, they involved the tearing down of rotting, rat-infested tenements, and the erection of modern apartment buildings. They were acclaimed as America's refusal to permit its people to live in the dirty shambles of the slums. It is common knowledge that they have turned into jungles of horror and now confront us with the problem of how we can either convert or get rid of The Purpose 17 them. They have become compounds of double segregation — on the bases of both economy and race — and a danger for anyone compelled to live in these projects. A beautiful positive dream has grown into a negative nightmare. It is the universal tale of revolution and reaction. It is the constant struggle between the positive and its converse negative, which includes the reversal of roles so that the positive of today is the negative of tomorrow and vice versa. This view of nature recognizes that reality is dual. The principles of quantum mechanics in physics apply even more dramatically to the mechanics of mass movements. This is true not only in ""complementarity"" but in the repudiation of the hitherto universal concept of causality, whereby matter and physics were understood in terms of cause and effect, where for every effect there had to be a cause and one always produced the other. In quantum mechanics, causality was largely replaced by probability: an electron or atom did not have to do anything specific in response to a particular force; there was just a set of probabilities that it would react in this or that way. This is fundamental in the observations and propositions which follow. At no time in any discussion or analysis of mass movements, tactics, or any other phase of the problem, can it be said that if this is done then that will result. The most we can hope to achieve is an understanding of the probabilities consequent to certain actions. This grasp of the duality of all phenomena is vital in our understanding of politics. It frees one from the myth that one approach is positive and another negative. There is no such thing in life. One man's positive is another man's negative. The description of any procedure as ""positive"" or ""negative"" is the mark of a political illiterate. Once the nature of revolution is understood from the dualistic outlook we lose our mono-view of a revolution and Rules for Radicals 18 see it coupled with its inevitable counterrevolution. Once we accept and learn to anticipate the inevitable counterrevolution, we may then alter the historical pattern of revolution and counterrevolution from the traditional slow advance of two steps forward and one step backward to minimizing the latter. Each element with its positive and converse sides is fused to other related elements in an endless series of everything, so that the converse of revolution on one side is counterrevolution and on the other side, reformation, and so on in an endless chain of connected converses. CLASS DISTINCTIONS: THE TRINITY The setting for the drama of change has never varied. Mankind has been and is divided into three parts: the Haves, the Have-Nots, and the Have-a- Little, Want Mores. On top are the Haves with power, money, food, security, and luxury. They suffocate in their surpluses while the Have-Nots starve. Numerically the Haves have always been the fewest. The Haves want to keep things as they are and are opposed to change. Thermopolitically they are cold and determined to freeze the status quo. On the bottom are the world's Have-Nots. On the world scene they are by far the greatest in numbers. They are chained together by the common misery of poverty, rotten housing, disease, ignorance, political impotence, and despair; when they are employed their jobs pay the least and they are deprived in all areas basic to human growth. Caged by color, physical or political, they are barred from an opportunity to represent themselves in the politics of The Purpose 19 life. The Haves want to keep; the Have-Nots want to get. Thermopolitically they are a mass of cold ashes of resignation and fatalism, but inside there are glowing embers of hope which can be fanned by the building of means of obtaining power. Once the fever begins the flame will follow. They have nowhere to go but up. They hate the establishment of the Haves with its arrogant opulence, its police, its courts, and its churches. Justice, morality, law, and order, are mere words when used by the Haves, which justify and secure their status quo. The power of the Have-Nots rests only with their numbers. It has been said that the Haves, living under the nightmare of possible threats to their possessions, are always faced with the question of ""when do we sleep?"" while the perennial question of the Have-Nots is ""when do we eat?"" The cry of the Have-Nots has never been ""give us your hearts"" but always ""get off our backs""; they ask not for love but for breathing space. Between the Haves and Have-Nots are the Have-a-Little. Want Mores — the middle class. Torn between upholding the status quo to protect the little they have, yet wanting change so they can get more, they become split personalities. They could be described as social, economic, and political schizoids. Generally, they seek the safe way, where they can profit by change and yet not risk losing the little they have. They insist on a minimum of three aces before playing a hand in the poker game of revolution. Thermopolitically they are tepid and rooted in inertia. Today in Western society and particularly in the United States they comprise the majority of our population. Yet in the conflicting interests and contradictions within the Have-a-Little, Want Mores is the genesis of creativity. Out of this class have come, with few exceptions, the great world leaders of change of the past centuries: Rules for Radicals 20 Moses, Paul of Tarsus, Martin Luther, Robespierre, Georges Danton, Samuel Adams, Alexander Hamilton, Thomas Jefferson, Napoleon Bonaparte, Giuseppe Garibaldi, Nikolai Lenin, Mahatma Gandhi, Fidel Castro, Mao Tse-tung, and others. Just as the clash of interests within the Have-a-Little, Want Mores has bred so many of the great leaders it has also spawned a particular breed stalemated by cross interests into inaction. These Do-Nothings profess a commitment to social change for ideals of justice, equality, and opportunity, and then abstain from and discourage all effective action for change. They are known by their brand, ""I agree with your ends but not your means."" They function as blankets whenever possible smothering sparks of dissension that promise to flare up into the fire of action. These Do-Nothings appear publicly as good men, humanitarian, concerned with justice and dignity. In practice they are invidious. They are the ones Edmund Burke referred to when he said, acidly: ""The only thing necessary for the triumph of evil is for good men to do nothing."" Both the revolutionary leaders, or the Doers, and the Do-Nothings will be examined in these pages. The history of prevailing status quos shows decay and decadence infecting the opulent materialism of the Haves. The spiritual life of the Haves is a ritualistic justification of their possessions. More than one hundred years ago, Tocqueville commented, as did other students of America at that time, that self-indulgence accompanied by concern for nothing except personal materialistic welfare was the major menace to America's future. Whitehead noted in Adventures of Ideas that ""The enjoyment of power is fatal to the subtleties of life. Ruling classes degenerate by reason of their lazy indulgence in obvious gratifications."" In such a state The Purpose 21 men may be said to fall asleep, for it is in sleep that we each turn away from the world about us to our private worlds.* I must quote one more book pertinent to this subject: in Alice in Wonderland, Tiger-Lily explains about the talking flowers to Alice. Tiger-Lily points out that the flowers that talk grow out of hard beds of ground and ""in most gardens,"" Tiger-Lily says, ""they make the beds too soft — so that the flowers are always asleep."" It is as though the great law of change had prepared the anesthesization of the victim prior to the social surgery to come. Change means movement. Movement means friction. Only in the frictionless vacuum of a nonexistent abstract world can movement or change occur without that abrasive friction of conflict. In these pages it is our open political purpose to cooperate with the great law of change; to want otherwise would be like King Canute's commanding the tides and waves to cease. A word about my personal philosophy. It is anchored in optimism. It must be, for optimism brings with it hope, a future with a purpose, and therefore, a will to fight for a better world. Without this optimism, there is no reason to carry on. If we think of the struggle as a climb up a mountain, then we must visualize a mountain with no top. We see a top, but when we finally reach it, the overcast rises and we find ourselves merely on a bluff. The mountain continues on up. Now we see the ""real"" top ahead of us, and strive for it, only to find we've reached another bluff, the top still above us. And so it goes on, interminably. Knowing that the mountain has no top, that it is a perpetual quest from plateau to plateau, the question arises, ""Why the struggle, the conflict, the heartbreak, the danger, the sacrifice. Why the constant climb?"" Our answer is the * Heraclitus, Fragments: ""The waking have one world in common; sleepers have each a private world of his own."" Rules for Radicals 22 same as that which a real mountain climber gives when he is asked why he does what he does. ""Because it's there."" Because life is there ahead of you and either one tests oneself in its challenges or huddles in the valleys in a dreamless day-to-day existence whose only purpose is the preservation of an illusory security and safety. The latter is what the vast majority of people choose to do, fearing the adventure into the unknown. Paradoxically, they give up the dream of what may lie ahead on the heights of tomorrow for a perpetual nightmare — an endless succession of days fearing the loss of a tenuous security. Unlike the chore of the mythic Sisyphis, this challenge is not an endless pushing up of a boulder to the top of a hill, only to have it roll back again, the chore to be repeated eternally. It is pushing the boulder up an endless mountain, but, unlike Sisyphis, we are always going further upward. And also unlike Sisyphis, each stage of the trail upward is different, newly dramatic, an adventure each time. At times we do fall back and become discouraged, but it is not that we are making no progress. Simply, this is the very nature of life — that it is a climb — and that the resolution of each issue in turn creates other issues, born of plights which are unimaginable today. The pursuit of happiness is never-ending; happiness lies in the pursuit. Confronted with the materialistic decadence of the status quo, one should not be surprised to find that all revolutionary movements are primarily generated from spiritual values and considerations of justice, equality, peace, and brotherhood. History is a relay of revolutions; the torch of idealism is carried by the revolutionary group until this group becomes an establishment, and then quietly the torch is put down to wait until a new revolutionary group picks it up for the next leg of the run. Thus the revolutionary cycle goes on. The Purpose 23 A major revolution to be won in the immediate future is the dissipation of man's illusion that his own welfare can be separate from that of all others. As long as man is shackled to this myth, so long will the human spirit languish. Concern for our private, material well-being with disregard for the well-being of others is immoral according to the precepts of our Judaeo- Christian civilization, but worse, it is stupidity worthy of the lower animals. It is man's foot still dragging in the primeval slime of his beginnings, in ignorance and mere animal cunning. But those who know the interdependence of man to be his major strength in the struggle out of the muck have not been wise in their exhortations and moral pronouncements that man is his brother's keeper. On that score the record of the past centuries has been a disaster, for it was wrong to assume that man would pursue morality on a level higher than his day-to-day living demanded; it was a disservice to the future to separate morality from man's daily desires and elevate it to a plane of altruism and self-sacrifice. The fact is that it is not man's ""better nature"" but his self-interest that demands that he be his brother's keeper. We now live in a world where no man can have a loaf of bread while his neighbor has none. If he does not share his bread, he dare not sleep, for his neighbor will kill him. To eat and sleep in safety man must do the right thing, if for seemingly the wrong reasons, and be in practice his brother's keeper. I believe that man is about to learn that the most practical life is the moral life and that the moral life is the only road to survival. He is beginning to learn that he will either share part of his material wealth or lose all of it; that he will respect and learn to live with other political ideologies if he wants civilization to go on. This is the kind of argument that man's actual experience equips him to understand and accept. 777/5 is the low road to morality. There is no other. Of Means and Ends We cannot think first and act afterwards. From the moment of birth we are immersed in action and can only fitfully guide it by taking thought. —Alfred North Whitehead THAT PERENNIAL QUESTION, ""Does the end justify the means?"" is meaningless as it stands; the real and only question regarding the ethics of means and ends is, and always has been, ""Does this particular end justify this particular means?"" Life and how you live it is the story of means and ends. The end\s what you want, and the means is how you get it. Whenever we think about social change, the question of means and ends arises. The man of action views the issue of means and ends in pragmatic and strategic terms. He has no other problem; he thinks only of his actual resources and the possibilities of various choices of action. He asks of ends only whether they are achievable and worth the cost; of means, only whether they will work. To say that corrupt means corrupt the ends is to believe in the immaculate conception of ends and principles. The real arena is corrupt and bloody. Life is a corrupting process from the time a child learns Of Means and Ends 25 to play his mother off against his father in the politics of when to go to bed; he who fears corruption fears life. The practical revolutionary will understand Goethe's ""conscience is the virtue of observers and not of agents of action""; in action, one does not always enjoy the luxury of a decision that is consistent both with one's individual conscience and the good of mankind. The choice must always be for the latter. Action is for mass salvation and not for the individual's personal salvation. He who sacrifices the mass good for his personal conscience has a peculiar conception of ""personal salvation""; he doesn't care enough for people to be ""corrupted"" for them. The men who pile up the heaps of discussion and literature on the ethics of means and ends — which with rare exception is conspicuous for its sterility — rarely write about their own experiences in the perpetual struggle of life and change. They are strangers, moreover, to the burdens and problems of operational responsibility and the unceasing pressure for immediate decisions. They are passionately committed to a mystical objectivity where passions are suspect. They assume a nonexistent situation where men dispassionately and with reason draw and devise means and ends as if studying a navigational chart on land. They can be recognized by one of two verbal brands: ""We agree with the ends but not the means,"" or ""This is not the time."" The means-and-end moralists or non-doers always wind up on their ends without any means. The means-and-ends moralists, constantly obsessed with the ethics of the means used by the Have-Nots against the Haves, should search themselves as to their real political position. In fact, they are passive — but real — allies of the Haves. They are the ones Jacques Maritain referred to in his statement, ""The fear of soiling Rules for Radicals 26 ourselves by entering the context of history is not virtue, but a way of escaping virtue."" These non-doers were the ones who chose not to fight the Nazis in the only way they could have been fought; they were the ones who drew their window blinds to shut out the shameful spectacle of Jews and political prisoners being dragged through the streets; they were the ones who privately deplored the horror of it all — and did nothing. This is the nadir of immorality. The most unethical of all means is the non-use of any means. It is this species of man who so vehemently and militantly participated in that classically idealistic debate at the old League of Nations on the ethical differences between defensive and offensive weapons. Their fears of action drive them to refuge in an ethics so divorced from the politics of life that it can apply only to angels, not to men. The standards of judgment must be rooted in the whys and wherefores of life as it is lived, the world as it is, not our wished-for fantasy of the world as it should be. I present here a series of rules pertaining to the ethics of means and ends: first, that one's concern with the ethics of means and ends varies inversely with one's personal interest in the issue. When we are not directly concerned our morality overflows; as La Rochefoucauld put it, ""We all have strength enough to endure the misfortunes of others."" Accompanying this rule is the parallel one that one's concern with the ethics of means and ends varies inversely with one's distance from the scene of conflict. The second rule of the ethics of means and ends is that the judgment of the ethics of means is dependent upon the political position of those sitting in judgment. If you actively opposed the Nazi occupation and joined the underground Resistance, then you adopted the means of Of Means and Ends 27 assassination, terror, property destruction, the bombing of tunnels and trains, kidnapping, and the willingness to sacrifice innocent hostages to the end of defeating the Nazis. Those who opposed the Nazi conquerors regarded the Resistance as a secret army of selfless, patriotic idealists, courageous beyond expectation and willing to sacrifice their lives to their moral convictions. To the occupation authorities, however, these people were lawless terrorists, murderers, saboteurs, assassins, who believed that the end justified the means, and were utterly unethical according to the mystical rules of war. Any foreign occupation would so ethically judge its opposition. However, in such conflict, neither protagonist is concerned with any value except victory. It is life or death. To us the Declaration of Independence is a glorious document and an affirmation of human rights. To the British, on the other hand, it was a statement notorious for its deceit by omission. In the Declaration of Independence, the Bill of Particulars attesting to the reasons for the Revolution cited all of the injustices which the colonists felt that England had been guilty of, but listed none of the benefits. There was no mention of the food the colonies had received from the British Empire during times of famine, medicine during times of disease, soldiers during times of war with the Indians and other foes, or the many other direct and indirect aids to the survival of the colonies. Neither was there notice of the growing number of allies and friends of the colonists in the British House of Commons, and the hope for imminent remedial legislation to correct the inequities under which the colonies suffered. Jefferson, Franklin, and others were honorable men, but they knew that the Declaration of Independence was Rules for Radicals 28 a call to war. They also knew that a list of many of the constructive benefits of the British Empire to the colonists would have so diluted the urgency of the call to arms for the Revolution as to have been self- defeating. The result might well have been a document attesting to the fact that justice weighted down the scale at least 60 per cent on our side, and only 40 per cent on their side; and that because of that 20 per cent difference we were going to have a Revolution. To expect a man to leave his wife, his children, and his home, to leave his crops standing in the field and pick up a gun and join the Revolutionary Army for a 20 per cent difference in the balance of human justice was to defy common sense. The Declaration of Independence, as a declaration of war, had to be what it was, a 100 per cent statement of the justice of the cause of the colonists and a 100 per cent denunciation of the role of the British government as evil and unjust. Our cause had to be all shining justice, allied with the angels; theirs had to be all evil, tied to the Devil; in no war has the enemy or the cause ever been gray. Therefore, from one point of view the omission was justified; from the other, it was deliberate deceit. History is made up of ""moral"" judgments based on politics. We condemned Lenin's acceptance of money from the Germans in 1917 but were discreetly silent while our Colonel William B. Thompson in the same year contributed a million dollars to the anti-Bolsheviks in Russia. As allies of the Soviets in World War II we praised and cheered communist guerrilla tactics when the Russians used them against the Nazis during the Nazi invasion of the Soviet Union; we denounce the same tactics when they are used by communist forces in different parts of Of Means and Ends 29 the world against us. The opposition's means, used against us, are always immoral and our means are always ethical and rooted in the highest of human values. George Bernard Shaw, in Man and Superman, pointed out the variations in ethical definitions by virtue of where you stand. Mendoza said to Tanner, ""I am a brigand; I live by robbing the rich."" Tanner replied, ""I am a gentleman; I live by robbing the poor. Shake hands."" The third rule of the ethics of means and ends is that in war the end justifies almost any means. Agreements on the Geneva rules on treatment of prisoners or use of nuclear weapons are observed only because the enemy or his potential allies may retaliate. Winston Churchill's remarks to his private secretary a few hours before the Nazis invaded the Soviet Union graphically pointed out the politics of means and ends in war. Informed of the imminent turn of events, the secretary inquired how Churchill, the leading British anti-communist, could reconcile himself to being on the same side as the Soviets. Would not Churchill find it embarrassing and difficult to ask his government to support the communists? Churchill's reply was clear and unequivocal: ""Not at all. I have only one purpose, the destruction of Hitler, and my life is much simplified thereby. If Hitler invaded Hell I would make at least a favorable reference to the Devil in the House of Commons."" In the Civil War President Lincoln did not hesitate to suspend the right of habeas corpus and to ignore the directive of the Chief Justice of the United States. Again, when Lincoln was convinced that the use of military commissions to try civilians was necessary, he brushed aside the illegality of this action with the statement that it was ""indispensable to the public safety."" He believed Rules for Radicals 30 that the civil courts were powerless to cope with the insurrectionist activities of civilians. ""Must I shoot a simple-minded soldier boy who deserts, while I must not touch a hair of a wily agitator who induces him to desert..."" The fourth rule of the ethics of means and ends is that judgment must be made in the context of the times in which the action occurred and not from any other chronological vantage point. The Boston Massacre is a case in point. ""British atrocities alone, however, were not sufficient to convince the people that murder had been done on the night of March 5: There was a deathbed confession of Patrick Carr, that the townspeople had been the aggressors and that the soldiers had fired in self defense. This unlooked- for recantation from one of the martyrs who was dying in the odor of sanctity with which Sam Adams had vested them sent a wave of alarm through the patriot ranks. But Adams blasted Carr's testimony in the eyes of all pious New Englanders by pointing out that he was an Irish 'papist' who had probably died in the confession of the Roman Catholic Church. After Sam Adams had finished with Patrick Carr even Tories did not dare to quote him to prove Bostonians were responsible for the Massacre.""* To the British this was a false, rotten use of bigotry and an immoral means characteristic of the Revolutionaries, or the' Sons of Liberty. To the Sons of Liberty and to the patriots, Sam Adams' action was brilliant strategy and a God-sent lifesaver. Today we may look back and regard Adams' action in the same light as the British did, but remember that we are not today involved in a revolution against the British Empire. Ethical standards must be elastic to stretch with * Sam Adams, Pioneer in Propaganda, by John C. Miller. Of Means and Ends 3 1 the times. In politics, the ethics of means and ends can be understood by the rules suggested here. History is made up of little else but examples such as our position on freedom of the high seas in 1812 and 1917 contrasted with our 1962 blockade of Cuba, or our alliance in 1942 with the Soviet Union against Germany, Japan and Italy, and the reversal in alignments in less than a decade. Lincoln's suspension of habeas corpus, his defiance of a directive of the Chief Justice of the United States, and the illegal use of military commissions to try civilians, were by the same man who had said in Springfield, fifteen years earlier: ""Let me not be understood as saying that there are no bad laws, or that grievances may not arise for the redress of which no legal provisions have been made. I mean to say no such thing. But I do mean to say that although bad laws, if they exist, should be repealed, still, while they continue in force, for the sake of example, they should be religiously observed."" This was also the same Lincoln who, a few years prior to his signing the Emancipation Proclamation, stated in his First Inaugural Address: ""I do but quote from one of those speeches when I declared that I have no purpose, directly or indirectly, to interfere with the institution of slavery in the States where it exists. I believe I have no lawful right to do so, and I have no inclination to do so. Those who nominated and elected me did so with full knowledge that I made this and many similar declarations and have never recanted them."" Those who would be critical of the ethics of Lincoln's reversal of positions have a strangely unreal picture of a static unchanging world, where one remains firm and committed to certain so-called principles or positions. In the politics of human life, consistency is not a virtue. To Rules for Radicals 32 be consistent means, according to the Oxford Universal Dictionary, ""standing still or not moving."" Men must change with the times or die. The change in Jefferson's orientation when he became President is pertinent to this point. Jefferson had incessantly attacked President Washington for using national self-interest as the point of departure for all decisions. He castigated the President as narrow and selfish and argued that decisions should be made on a world-interest basis to encourage the spread of the ideas of the American Revolution; that Washington's adherence to the criteria of national self-interest was a betrayal of the American Revolution. However, from the first moment when Jefferson assumed the presidency of the United States his every decision was dictated by national self-interest. This story from another century has parallels in our century and every other. The fifth rule of the ethics of means and ends is that concern with ethics increases with the number of means available and vice versa. To the man of action the first criterion in determining which means to employ is to assess what means are available. Reviewing and selecting available means is done on a straight utilitarian basis — will it work? Moral questions may enter when one chooses among equally effective alternate means. But if one lacks the luxury of a choice and is possessed of only one means, then the ethical question will never arise; automatically the lone means becomes endowed with a moral spirit. Its defense lies in the cry, ""What else could I do?"" Inversely, the secure position in which one possesses the choice of a number of effective and powerful means is always accompanied by that ethical concern and serenity of con- Of Means and Ends 33 science so admirably described by Mark Twain as ""The calm confidence of a Christian holding four aces."" To me ethics is doing what is best for the most. During a conflict with a major corporation I was confronted with a threat of public exposure of a photograph of a motel ""Mr. & Mrs."" registration and photographs of my girl and myself. I said, ""Go ahead and give it to the press. I think she's beautiful and I have never claimed to be celibate. Go ahead!"" That ended the threat. Almost on the heels of this encounter one of the corporation's minor executives came to see me. It turned out that he was a secret sympathizer with our side. Pointing to his briefcase, he said: ""In there is plenty of proof that so and so [a leader of the opposition] prefers boys to girls."" I said, ""Thanks, but forget it. I don't fight that way. I don't want to see it. Goodbye."" He protested, ""But they just tried to hang you on that girl."" I replied, ""The fact that they fight that way doesn't mean I have to do it. To me, dragging a person's private life into this muck is loathsome and nauseous."" He left. So far, so noble; but, if I had been convinced that the only way we could win was to use it, then without any reservations I would have used it. What was my alternative? To draw myself up into righteous ""moral"" indignation saying, ""I would rather lose than corrupt my principles,"" and then go home with my ethical hymen intact? The fact that 40,000 poor would lose their war against hopelessness and despair was just too tragic. That their condition would even be worsened by the vindictiveness of the corporation was also terrible and unfortunate, but that's life. After all, one has to remember means and ends. It's true that I might have trouble getting to sleep because Rules for Radicals 34 it takes time to tuck those big, angelic, moral wings under the covers. To me that would be utter immorality. 777e sixth rule of the ethics of means and ends is that the less important the end to be desired, the more one can afford to engage in ethical evaluations of means. The seventh rule of the ethics of means and ends is that generally success or failure is a mighty determinant of ethics. The judgment of history leans heavily on the outcome of success or failure; it spells the difference between the traitor and the patriotic hero. There can be no such thing as a successful traitor, for if one succeeds he becomes a founding father. The eighth rule of the ethics of means and ends is that the morality of a means depends upon whether the means is being employed at a time of imminent defeat or imminent victory. The same means employed with victory seemingly assured may be defined as immoral, whereas if it had been used in desperate circumstances to avert defeat, the question of morality would never arise. In short, ethics are determined by whether one is losing or winning. From the beginning of time killing has always been regarded as justifiable if committed in self-defense. Let us confront this principle with the most awful ethical question of modern times: did the United States have the right to use the atomic bomb at Hiroshima? When we dropped the atomic bomb the United States was assured of victory. In the Pacific, Japan had suffered an unbroken succession of defeats. Now we were in Okinawa with an air base from which we could bomb the enemy around the clock. The Japanese air force was decimated, as was their navy. Victory had come in Europe, and the entire European air force, navy, and army were released for use in the Pacific. Russia was moving in for a Of Means and Ends 35 cut of the spoils. Defeat for Japan was an absolute certainty and the only question was how and when the coup de grace would be administered. For familiar reasons we dropped the bomb and triggered off as well a universal debate on the morality of the use of this means for the end of finishing the war. I submit that if the atomic bomb had been developed shortly after Pearl Harbor when we stood defenseless; when most of our Pacific fleet was at the bottom of the sea; when the nation was fearful of invasion on the Pacific coast; when we were committed as well to the war in Europe, that then the use of the bomb at that time on Japan would have been universally heralded as a just retribution of hail, fire, and brimstone. Then the use of the bomb would have been hailed as proof that good inevitably triumphs over evil. The question of the ethics of the use of the bomb would never have arisen at that time and the character of the present debate would have been very different. Those who would disagree with this assertion have no memory of the state of the world at that time. They are either fools or liars or both. The ninth rule of the ethics of means and ends is that any effective means is automatically judged by the opposition as being unethical. One of our greatest revolutionary heroes was Francis Marion of South Carolina, who became immortalized in American history as ""the Swamp Fox."" Marion was an outright revolutionary guerrilla. He and his men operated according to the traditions and with all of the tactics commonly associated with the present-day guerrillas. Cornwallis and the regular British Army found their plans and operations harried and disorganized by Marion's guerrilla tactics. Infuriated by the effectiveness of his operations, and incapable of coping with them, the Rules for Radicals 36 British denounced him as a criminal and charged that he did not engage in warfare ""like a gentleman"" or ""a Christian."" He was subjected to an unremitting denunciation about his lack of ethics and morality for his use of guerrilla means to the end of winning the Revolution. The tenth rule of the ethics of means and ends is that you do what you can with what you have and clothe it with moral garments. In the field of action, the first question that arises in the determination of means to be employed for particular ends is what means are available. This requires an assessment of whatever strengths or resources are present and can be used. It involves sifting the multiple factors which combine in creating the circumstances at any given time, and an adjustment to the popular views and the popular climate. Questions such as how much time is necessary or available must be considered. Who, and how many, will support the action? Does the opposition possess the power to the degree that it can suspend or change the laws? Does its control of police power extend to the point where legal and orderly change is impossible? If weapons are needed, then are appropriate weapons available? Availability of means determines whether you will be underground or above ground; whether you will move quickly or slowly; whether you will move for extensive changes or limited adjustments; whether you will move by passive resistance or active resistance; or whether you will move at all. The absence of any means might drive one to martyrdom in the hope that this would be a catalyst, starting a chain reaction that would culminate in a mass movement. Here a simple ethical statement is used as a means to power. A naked illustration of this point is to be found in Trotsky's summary of Lenin's famous April Theses, issued Of Means and Ends 37 shortly after Lenin's return from exile. Lenin pointed out: ""The task of the Bolsheviks is to overthrow the Imperialist Government. But this government rests upon the support of the Social Revolutionaries and Mensheviks, who in turn are supported by the trustfulness of the masses of people. We are in the minority. In these circumstances there can be no talk of violence on our side."" The essence of Lenin's speeches during this period was ""They have the guns and therefore we are for peace and for reformation through the ballot. When we have the guns then it will be through the bullet."" And it was. Mahatma Gandhi and his use of passive resistance in India presents a striking example of the selection of means. Here, too, we see the inevitable alchemy of time working upon moral equivalents as a consequence of the changing circumstances and positions of the Have- Nots to the Haves, with the natural shift of goals from getting to keeping. Gandhi is viewed by the world as the epitome of the highest moral behavior with respect to means and ends. We can assume that there are those who would believe that if Gandhi had lived, there would never have been an invasion of Goa or any other armed invasion. Similarly, the politically naive would have regarded it as unbelievable that that great apostle of nonviolence, Nehru, would ever have countenanced the invasion of Goa, for it was Nehru who stated in 1955: ""What are the basic elements of our policy in regard to Goa? First, there must be peaceful methods. This is essential unless we give up the roots of all our policies and all our behavior . . . We rule out nonpeace-ful methods entirely."" He was a man committed to nonviolence and ostensibly to the love of mankind, including his enemies. His end was the independence of India from foreign domination, and his means was that of passive re- Rules for Radicals 38 sistance. History, and religious and moral opinion, have so enshrined Gandhi in this sacred matrix that in many quarters it is blasphemous to question whether this entire procedure of passive resistance was not simply the only intelligent, realistic, expedient program which Gandhi had at his disposal; and that the ""morality"" which surrounded this policy of passive resistance was to a large degree a rationale to cloak a pragmatic program with a desired and essential moral cover. Let us examine this case. First, Gandhi, like any other leader in the field of social action, was compelled to examine the means at hand. If he had had guns he might well have used them in an armed revolution against the British which would have been in keeping with the traditions of revolutions for freedom through force. Gandhi did not have the guns, and if he had had the guns he would not have had the people to use the guns. Gandhi records in his Autobiography his astonishment at the passivity and submissiveness of his people in not retaliating or even wanting revenge against the British: ""As I proceeded further and further with my inquiry into the atrocities that had been committed on the people, I came across tales of Government's tyranny and the arbitrary despotism of its officers such as I was hardly prepared for, and they filled me with deep pain. What surprised me then, and what still continues to fill me with surprise, was the fact that a province that had furnished the largest number of soldiers to the British Government during the war, should have taken all these brutal excesses lying down."" Gandhi and his associates repeatedly deplored the inability of their people to give organized, effective, violent resistance against injustice and tyranny. His own experi- Of Means and Ends 39 ence was corroborated by an unbroken series of reiterations from all the leaders of India — that India could not practice physical warfare against her enemies. Many reasons were given, including weakness, lack of arms, having been beaten into submission, and other arguments of a similar nature. Interviewed by Norman Cousins in 1961. Pandit Jawaharlal Nehru described the Hindus of those days as ""A demoralized, timid, and hopeless mass bullied and crushed by every dominant interest and incapable of resistance."" Faced with this situation we revert for the moment to Gandhi's assessment and review of the means available to him. It has been stated that if he had had the guns he might have used them; this statement is based on the Declaration of Independence of Mahatma Gandhi issued on January 26, 1930, where he discussed ""the fourfold disaster to our country."" His fourth indictment against the British reads: ""Spiritually, compulsory disarmament has made us unmanly, and the presence of an alien army of occupation, employed with deadly effect to crush in us the spirit of resistance, has made us think we cannot look after ourselves or put up a defense against foreign aggression, or even defend our homes and families . . ."" These words more than suggest that if Gandhi had had the weapons for violent resistance and the people to use them this means would not have been so unreservedly rejected as the world would like to think. On the same point, we might note that once India had secured independence, when Nehru was faced with a dispute with Pakistan over Kashmir, he did not hesitate to use armed force. Now the power arrangements had changed. India had the guns and the trained army to use these Rules for Radicals 40 weapons.* Any suggestion that Gandhi would not have approved the use of violence is negated by Nehru's own statement in that 1961 interview: ""It was a terrible time. When the news reached me about Kashmir I knew I would have to act at once — with force. Yet I was greatly troubled in mind and spirit because I knew we might have to face a war — so soon after having achieved our independence through a philosophy of nonviolence. It was horrible to think of. Yet I acted. Gandhi said nothing to indicate his disapproval. It was a great relief, I must say. If Gandhi, the vigorous nonviolent, didn't demur, it made my job a lot • Reinhold Niebuhr, ""British Experience and American Power,"" Christianity and Crisis, Vol. 16, May 14, 1956, page 57: ""The defiance of the United Nations by India on the Kashmir issue has gone comparatively unobserved. It will be remembered that Kashmir, a disputed territory, claimed by both Muslim Pakistan and Hindu India, has a predominately Muslim population but a Hindu ruler. To determine the future political orientation of the area, the United Nations ordered a plebiscite. Meanwhile, both India and Pakistan refused to move their troops from the zones which each had previously occupied. Finally, Nehru took the law into his own hands and annexed the larger part of Kashmir, which he had shrewdly integrated into the Indian economy. The Security Council, with only Russia abstaining, unanimously called upon him to obey the United Nations directive, but the Indian government refused. Clearly, Nehru does not want a plebiscite now for it would surely go against India, though he vaguely promises a plebiscite for the future. ""Morally, the incident puts Nehru in a rather bad light.... When India's vital interests were at stake, Nehru forgot lofty sentiments, sacrificed admirers in the New Statesman and Nation, and subjected himself to the charge of inconsistency. ""This policy is either Machiavellian or statesmanlike, according to your point of view. Our consciences may gag at it, but on the other hand those eminently moral men, Prime Minister Gladstone of another day and Secretary Dulles of our day could offer many parallels of policy for Mr. Nehru, though one may doubt whether either statesman could offer a coherent analysis of the mixture of modes which entered into the policy. That is an achievement beyond the competence of very moral men."" Of Means and Ends 4 1 easier. This strengthened my view that Gandhi could be adaptable."" Confronted with the issue of what means he could employ against the British, we come to the other criteria previously mentioned; that the kind of means selected and how they can be used is significantly dependent upon the face of the enemy, or the character of his opposition. Gandhi's opposition not only made the effective use of passive resistance possible but practically invited it. His enemy was a British administration characterized by an old, aristocratic, liberal tradition, one which granted a good deal of freedom to its colonials and which always had operated on a pattern of using, absorbing, seducing, or destroying, through flattery or corruption, the revolutionary leaders who arose from the colonial ranks. This was the kind of opposition that would have tolerated and ultimately capitulated before the tactic of passive resistance. Gandhi's passive resistance would never have had a chance against a totalitarian state such as that of the Nazis. It is dubious whether under those circumstances the idea of passive resistance would even have occurred to Gandhi. It has been pointed out that Gandhi, who was born in 1869, never saw or understood totalitarianism and defined his opposition completely in terms of the character of the British government and what it represented. George Orwell, in his essay Reflection on Gandhi, made some pertinent observations on this point: ""... He believed in 'arousing the world,' which is only possible if the world gets a chance to hear what you are doing. It is difficult to see how Gandhi's methods could be applied in a country where opponents of the regime disappear in the middle of the night and are never heard of again. Without a free press Rules for Radicals 42 and the right of assembly it is impossible, not merely to appeal to outside opinion, but to bring a mass movement into being, or even to make your intentions known to your adversary."" From a pragmatic point of view, passive resistance was not only possible, but was the most effective means that could have been selected for the end of ridding India of British control.

in a little Texas town, and the boy went to work everyday protecting that little town. He was a police officer, and he loved his job and that sleepy little town. The boy also love his country, and became a soldier in the National Guard. Life was good, and they were happy, but something was missing. They began to pray for a baby. Time went on, days turned to months, and months to years. 7 years to be exact. And then the news came. That boy and that girl were having a boy of their own. This is the part of the story where you come in...

On September 15, 2012, at 34 weeks, while her husband Sean was serving our country in Afghanistan, Heather Brown went to the hospital with back pain and a headache. After arriving at the hospital, Heather began having seizures caused by a massive brain bleed. The baby, John Michael Thomas Brown, was taken by emergency C-section. Heather slipped into a coma. The baby was rushed to a neighboring hospital with a NICU.

It took 72 hours to bring our first Brown home from Afghanistan. The longest 3 days of his life. Flights that were hours on end with no communication. Not knowing how his wife and son were doing. Upon arrival at Tyler Pounds Field, Sean was given a police escort to the hospital, where his tiny newborn son was. That guy may be little, but he is strong like his daddy and the doctors and nurses say he is going to be okay, and soon, this little Brown will come home too.

After seeing his son, Sean went to his wife's side, where he has been constantly for the last month. Heather is still in a coma, and the doctor's tell us she may never come out. But we know our God is in the business of miracles. We believe through the power of prayer, Heather will wake up, and we believe this Brown is coming home, too.

This family needs all the prayer, encouragement and support they can get. That can't happen without people like you. Friends like you. Please follow this story. Share this story. Please put them on your church prayer list. Please join us in this journey as God creates an amazing testimony of ""Bringing Home the Browns"".

For all of our friends asking about updates on Heather. This journey is a marathon. It will take time, and we will need your constant support and prayer. As changes happen we will share it with our friends here. Thank you so much for your support and prayer!



Update:10/5/2012 John Michael Thomas Brown came home from the hospital at a little over 5 pounds and doctors are pleased with his development. He and Daddy are adjusting, and Sean tries to divide time at home with Baby John and time at the hospital with Heather.

https://www.snopes.com/fact-check/trump-taps-outspoken-climate-denier-to-oversee-epa-transition-team/	president-elect trump has selected a climate change skeptic to head the team in charge of the transition between obama and trumpâs environmental protection agencies.	true	['donald trump', 'environmental protection agency', 'EPA', 'president-elect trump']	2016/11/10	Alex Kasprak	['https://www.scientificamerican.com/article/trump-picks-top-climate-skeptic-to-lead-epa-transition/']	https://www.scientificamerican.com/article/trump-picks-top-climate-skeptic-to-lead-epa-transition/	https://www.scientificamerican.com/	"Donald Trump has selected one of the best-known climate skeptics to lead his U.S. EPA transition team, according to two sources close to the campaign.

Myron Ebell, director of the Center for Energy and Environment at the conservative Competitive Enterprise Institute, is spearheading Trump’s transition plans for EPA, the sources said.

The Trump team has also lined up leaders for its Energy Department and Interior Department teams. Republican energy lobbyist Mike McKenna is heading the DOE team; former Interior Department solicitor David Bernhardt is leading the effort for that agency, according to sources close to the campaign.

Ebell is a well-known and polarizing figure in the energy and environment realm. His participation in the EPA transition signals that the Trump team is looking to drastically reshape the climate policies the agency has pursued under the Obama administration. Ebell’s role is likely to infuriate environmentalists and Democrats but buoy critics of Obama’s climate rules.

Ebell, who was dubbed an “elegant nerd” and a “policy wonk” by Vanity Fair, is known for his prolific writings that question what he calls climate change “alarmism.” He appears frequently in the media and before Congress. He’s also chairman of the Cooler Heads Coalition, a group of nonprofits that “question global warming alarmism and oppose energy-rationing policies.”

Ebell appears to relish criticism from the left.

In a biography submitted when he testified before Congress, he listed among his recognitions that he had been featured in a Greenpeace “Field Guide to Climate Criminals,” dubbed a “misleader” on global warming by Rolling Stone and was the subject of a motion to censure in the British House of Commons after Ebell criticized the United Kingdom’s chief scientific adviser for his views on global warming.

More recently, Ebell has called the Obama administration’s Clean Power Plan for greenhouse gases illegal and said that Obama joining the Paris climate treaty “is clearly an unconstitutional usurpation of the Senate’s authority.”

He told Vanity Fair in 2007, “There has been a little bit of warming ... but it’s been very modest and well within the range for natural variability, and whether it’s caused by human beings or not, it’s nothing to worry about.”

Ebell’s views appear to square with Trump’s when it comes to EPA’s agenda. Trump has called global warming “bullshit” and he has said he would “cancel” the Paris global warming accord and roll back President Obama’s executive actions on climate change (ClimateWire, May 27).

Leading the Trump DOE team: GOP hired gun McKenna.

The president of MWR Strategies is well known in Republican energy circles. He was director of policy and external affairs for the Virginia Department of Environmental Quality under then-Gov. George Allen (R) and was an external relations specialist at the Energy Department during the George H.W. Bush administration.

His lobbying clients in 2016 include Koch Companies Public Sector LLC, Southern Company Services, Dow Chemical Co. and Competitive Power Ventures Inc., according to public disclosures.

And heading Interior’s transition effort is Bernhardt, co-chairman of the Natural Resources Department at the law firm Brownstein Hyatt Farber Schreck.

He served as Interior’s solicitor during the George W. Bush administration after holding several other high-ranking jobs at the department.

In addition to the EPA, Interior and DOE team leaders, GOP energy expert Mike Catanzaro is also working on energy policy for the Trump transition team (Greenwire, Sept. 14).

During the Obama transition in 2008, a relatively small team was assembled ahead of the election in order to map out broad policy goals.

Following the election, the operation expanded dramatically and teams were dispatched to work out of agencies to gather information from political staffers and career officials, write flurries of memos and compile thick binders of intelligence to hand over to the incoming leadership (Greenwire, Aug. 19, 2016).

Should Trump win in November, Ebell, McKenna and Bernhardt will likely be leading similar efforts to reform their respective agencies.

Ebell and McKenna directed questions about their roles to the Trump transition team. The Trump campaign and Bernhardt did not respond to requests for comment.

https://www.snopes.com/fact-check/titanic-pcp-chowder/	"dozens of people on the set of the film ""titanic"" were sickened after eating seafood chowder that had been spiked with the drug pcp on the final day of shooting."	mostly true	['historical pictures']	2019/05/01	Dan Evon	['https://www.vice.com/en_us/article/ypaq3g/remembering-when-everyone-filming-titanic-got-spiked-with-pcp']	https://www.vice.com/en_us/article/ypaq3g/remembering-when-everyone-filming-titanic-got-spiked-with-pcp	https://www.vice.com/	"It was the cream of insider Hollywood scoops of 1996—the cast and crew of Titanic had been poisoned with PCP-spiked clam chowder. Even Bill Paxton and James Cameron. But Leonardo DiCaprio and Kate Winslet were spared, as neither had any scenes on the Canadian set.

It all went down on the last night of filming in Nova Scotia. Five weeks of working up north was nearly over and the whole crew was about to decamp to the larger set down in Mexico. Everyone was in high spirits; the mood festive.

Then at around midnight, which was lunch hour for a filming schedule that started at dusk and went until dawn, the crew was called together for one last meal. Even James Cameron descended from his office to toast a successful wrap. The catering team turned out an impressive spread, crowned by a big batch of creamy clam chowder. People were lining up for seconds and thirds. And then it was back to work.

Marilyn McAvoy was one such crew member. A standby painter on the set, she used her background in fine art to paint forgeries, illustrate Jack's sketchbook, and age props. Now an artist in her own right, she talks to VICE about what it was like to get extremely and accidentally high on the night of the PCP-chowder incident.

All images by Ben Thomson

VICE: Hey Marilyn, so tell me, what was that chowder like?

Marilyn McAvoy: The chowder was unbelievable. People were going back for second bowls. I really thought about going back because it was so good. And I think that was part of the problem: People ate a lot more than usual because it was so delicious.

What else do you remember about that night?

There was no indication that there was anything strange happening... until the meal. By the time we got back from eating, after about 30 minutes, that's when I started noticing something was wrong. Everyone seemed confused. Everyone was having trouble getting their work done.

What were you doing at the time?

I needed some stuff upstairs as well as some other equipment down in another area. And I remember just walking around trying to figure out the best way to get my supplies. Things just seemed fuzzy.

How did the rest of the crew react?

While I was trying to figure out what was going on, everyone else seemed to be going outside. They were all gathering outside of the giant doors of the building we were working in.

I also heard later on that as soon as James Cameron realized something had been put in the chowder, he ran up to his room and forced himself to throw up.

When did everyone realize what had happened?

It was actually kind of comical. It was like that game kids play, Red Rover: There were the people who were ok, who hadn't gotten any effects yet, and the people who were getting high. And there were these two lines apart from each other, with some people in the ""good"" line slowly trickling into the ""bad"" line. It was at about this point that people realized that everyone who had eaten the chowder was experiencing the effects of some sort of hallucinogen.

So what happened next?

The crew vans came and picked everybody up and took us to the Dartmouth General Hospital. En masse, we went through these hospital doors at 1 AM in the morning. They did not know what to do with us. It became pretty chaotic. Some people were having a really hard time. I think maybe the people who had more experience with drugs were having flashbacks and bad trips.

How did it affect you?

For me, the whole situation was pretty surreal. But in terms of effects, it was kind of like a combination of being high on marijuana and being drunk; I was functioning, I was reading magazines. It was like a dream.

What was your experience with hallucinogens before this?

None. So when it started happening, I was pretty scared because I had no experience to base [this high] on. We didn't know then what it had been spiked with. But because it was such an unexpected thing to have happened, I didn't have time at the moment to fully take in how dangerous something like this could have been.

How did the hospital deal with all of you?

Well, we were there all night. Eventually, we all got put in these cubicles with the curtains around us, but no one wanted to stay in their cubicles. Everyone was out in the aisles and jumping into other people's cubicles. People had a lot of energy. Some were in wheelchairs, flying down the hallways. I mean, everyone was high! So they gave us this drink that had charcoal in it, to remove the toxins. By sunup, we had started to come down. People were playing hacky sack. Everyone just wanted to get home.

What was the aftermath like?

Well, we had to go home and get right to sleep and then back to work that night to finish the shooting that had been interrupted. It was very strange. In terms of what had happened, there were some investigations. Nothing was ever officially determined, as far as I know. Among the crew, there were rumors that it had been a disgruntled chef that had been let go, but nothing ever came of that.

It seems like since it happened at the end of the shoot, there wasn't much time for paranoia to brew among the crew.

Yeah, that's true. I never thought about that. I probably would have started bringing my own lunch. Because it was, while funny, pretty traumatic. So, you're right, it would have led to a very mistrustful situation.

Did this whole thing affect your attitude towards drug-taking, illegal or otherwise?

No, not really. Although it made me realize how fragile, and how delicate, these things can be. Had I gone back for that second bowl, I might have had an entirely different kind of experience.

https://www.snopes.com/fact-check/false-police-stop-leads-to-bizarre-arrest/	francis fasher was arrested on several charges, including public intoxication, transporting lab animals, and failure to pay of child support, after a bizarre traffic stop.	false	['Not Necessarily The News']		David Mikkelson	['https://web.archive.org/web/20111118101724/http://thedailycricket.com/2008/06/23/bizzare-arrest-on-rt-95/']	https://web.archive.org/web/20111118101724/http://thedailycricket.com/2008/06/23/bizzare-arrest-on-rt-95/	https://web.archive.org/	"Three people remain in custody after being arrested on Saturday morning following a traffic stop in Canton. In what was described by Lt. Paul Sullivan as “the most bizarre traffic stop” that he has seen in his 23 years on the force, Canton police responded to a report of a disabled vehicle traveling on Route 95. They came across the vehicle shortly after 2 a.m. traveling in the high-speed lane on the southbound side.

“We spotted the green Hyundai Elantra traveling at approximately five miles-per-hour in the passing lane with a huge shower of sparks coming from the rear of the vehicle. As we got closer we noticed that the rear end of the vehicle was dragging on the ground due to the fact that there were no rear tires or axle on the vehicle,” said Lt. Sullivan of the Canton Police. “After the vehicle pulled over, we approached it and found that the driver was not only drinking a can of beer, but that he was not wearing any pants and that he had urinated on himself.”

After not one, but two, brief foot chases, Francis Fasher, 45, of Foxboro, was placed under arrest.

“There were also two female passengers in the back seat,” stated Lt. Sullivan. “One of the females was asleep, partially clad. The other was extremely hysterical. At that time, we believed that she might have been under the influence of PCP, due to the fact that she claimed there were mice biting at her and climbing on her.”

Because of the size of the two women, police were unable to pull the women out of the rear doors of the vehicle. After members of the Canton Rescue Squad cut the roof off the vehicle, and with the help of a crane supplied by Shaugnessy Crane, the women were lifted out of the car. Police estimate the weight of each woman was between 300 and 450 pounds.

Shortly after being extracted from the vehicle, the two women began arguing with each other and blows were thrown. At that point, police arrested 17-year-old Tina “Pebbles” Zonfrelli of Foxboro and 56-year-old Donna Dyers of Lynn.

“We followed the drag marks and found that the axle and tires had separated from the vehicle some four miles back. The axle, wheels and tires were found in the parking lot of the Ancient Mariner Lounge located in Foxboro,” stated Canton police officer James C. West. “At this time we believe that the three individuals had patronized the Mariner Lounge for the better part of the day, and that at closing time, they decided to continue the party at Mr. Fasher’s apartment.”

Upon entering the vehicle, the combined weight of the occupants caused the axle and wheels to separate from the vehicle.

“It is unbelievable that an individual could drive over four miles and not realize that there were no rear tires on the car,” says West.

During the search of the vehicle, police came up with an unexpected find.

“The interior of the vehicle was very messy. There were beer cans, food wrappers, rib bones, and other rubbish in the car. Under the driver’s seat we found a nest of mice. I guess she did see a mouse,” West chuckled.

Police charged Fasher with driving while intoxicated, indecent exposure, urinating in public, disturbing the peace, failure to stay in marked lanes, destruction of public property, assaulting a police officer, driving an unregistered motor vehicle, driving an uninsured motor vehicle, non-payment of child support, public intoxication, evading police, passengers not wearing seat belts, transporting lab animals without proper permits and contributing to the delinquency of a minor.

“We’ve been after this guy for quite some time,” said West. “Mr. Fasher is well known to us. He is a renowned transvestite, and he’s been arrested a number of times for prostitution. In June of 1998, he was arrested six times in one week. In fact, three of those arrests occurred on one day.”

Fasher faces a number of complaints from business owners in Canton and charges have been filed against him by a number of citizens in the community. Four people have filed civil-damage lawsuits against him after their private property was damaged by Fasher. One person has alleged that he had sex with her prize-winning French poodle in her backyard.

Jimmy Chan, owner of Golden China restaurant claims that he assaulted an employee and caused damages to his establishment.

“He drink all morning,” said Chan. “He get crazy. I tell him no more beer for you and he throw Pu-Pu platter at waitress. He a very bad man. He broke very expensive mirror!”

James Marathas, owner of Marathas Carpets, alleges that he found Fasher sleeping in his store when he opened up for business one morning three weeks ago.

“He broke in through the back door and passed out right here,” pointing out the spot, said Marathas. “I threw him out but later I discovered that he had urinated all over our entire Persian rug collection, and I ended up with a cleaning bill for $2,600.

Fact or fiction? You be the judge. I'll never forget stumbling upon the wrinkled old photo that looked like something out of an old monster movie. The picture could have been titled, ""The Catfish That Could Have Eaten Hardin County, Tennessee."" It was in the mid-1990s, and I was working on a story about the National Catfish Derby, an annual catfishing derby and festival held on the Tennessee River. The derby president was the first to show me the black and white photo. ""What do you think?"" said the derby prez, Jay Barker. I looked at the photo and then at Barker, who was grinning mischievously like the Cheshire cat. ""Interesting,"" I said. ""Very interesting."" Whether the photo and the talk it has generated are fact or fishy fiction doesn't matter. The mystery is part of the tale itself  a tale that has more twists and turns than a hooked catfish. And, true or not, Barker has long known the stories would get plenty of news play and help promote the event.  Many people don't believe the photo is real, and that is all right. But my mother told me it was, and she had no reason to lie.   Faye Callens Barker told me he first learned of the photo from Betty Coleman, a fellow resident of Savannah, Tenn. She found it while gathering old photos for the Hardin County Historical Society. Since then, people have told Barker the photo was taken in the Hardin County community of Cerro Gordo in 1914. Barker also has been told the man standing alongside the catfish was Warren McConnell and that a copy of the picture hung for many years in Pitts General Store. The catfish has been estimated, by those who believe in the photo's authenticity, to weigh from 500 to 800 pounds. I interviewed the late Faye Callens, also of Savannah, who said his mother, Rilla Callens, handed down the photo to him. He said his mother had worked as a bookkeeper at Pitts General Store, and she told him the photo was genuine; a man named Green Bailey caught the fish on a trotline. Indeed Bailey's name is inscribed on the photo along with the date and place where the photo was taken, ""Cerro Gordo 1914."" Callens also said he visited Bailey's sister several years ago, and she told him her brother did catch the big fish. ""Many people don't believe the photo is real, and that is all right,"" Callens said. ""But my mother told me it was, and she had no reason to lie."" There is the rub. To call a fisherman a liar is one thing. But to say so about his mother is enough to get filleted, and fast.  Some people say it's fake, but others firmly believe the catfish was actually caught.   Jay Barker, president of Tennessee's National Catfish Derby As I continued to investigate, though, I found many other stories attached to the old photo. One was that the late Joe B. Pitts, proprietor of Pitts General Store, actually caught the fish. Another story claimed that the fish was caught during a dry summer after it became landlocked in shallow water (before dams regulated water levels on the Tennessee River). Then, too, there is the fishy side of the story. Barker said some Savannah residents have told him the photo was a fake. Many believe the catfish actually weighed 50-80 pounds and was placed on a child's wagon to be photographed as an optical illusion. To make the gag complete, a cardboard cutout of a man from a cigarette ad was placed on the wagon. Perhaps this is the real truth behind this fish tale, because Barker also has a copy of another photo of the same man and fish taken from a different angle. The man is posed exactly the same as he is in the other photo  one hand on his thigh and the other on his hip, as he stoops to admire the fish. The only difference is this photo was taken from the front of the wagon rather than from the side. ""Some people say it's fake, but others firmly believe the catfish was actually caught,"" Barker said. What does Barker believe? He'd never admit the old photo is too fishy. After all, can you get too fishy in a place that bills itself as the ""Catfish Capitol of the World""? ""Personally, I believe it is authentic, and it shows without a doubt why we're (Hardin County) the Catfish Capitol of the World,"" Barker proclaimed. (Perhaps it is no coincidence this promotions man has the last name ""Barker"".) Besides, he pointed out that there definitely are some big catfish swimming in the Hardin County waters of the Tennessee River, especially below Pickwick Dam. ""Probably are some catfish out there that are this big, but anglers just aren't rigged with tackle strong enough to land them,"" he said. What would happen if a cat as big as the one depicted in the old photo was caught during the county's annual National Catfish Derby? ""I'd try to find a swimming pool big enough to put it in,"" Barker laughed. ""A fish that big would be a tourist attraction all by itself."" At one time the famed photo had been made into a postcard used to promote the National Catfish Derby.

https://www.snopes.com/fact-check/ship-of-fools/	remains of a viking ship were discovered on the banks of the mississippi river near memphis.	false	['Not Necessarily The News', 'nucleation']		David Mikkelson	['http://worldnewsdailyreport.com/usa-viking-ship-discovered-near-mississipi-river/']	http://worldnewsdailyreport.com/usa-viking-ship-discovered-near-mississipi-river/	http://worldnewsdailyreport.com/	"Memphis, TN | A group of volunteers cleaning up the shores of the Mississippi River near the biggest city in Tennessee have stumbled upon the remains of an ancient boat encrusted in mud.

A team of archeologists from the University of Memphis that was rapidly called to the site, confirmed that the ship is most certainly a Viking Knarr, suggesting the Norse would have pushed their exploration of America a lot further than historians previously thought.

The heavily damaged ship was found near the confluence of the Wolf and Mississippi rivers and lies on a private property.

It has a length of about 16 meters, a beam of 4.5 meters, and a hull that is estimated capable of carrying up to 24 to 28 tons, a typical size for this type of ship.

Knarrs were naval vessels that were built by the Norsemen from Scandinavia and Iceland for Atlantic voyages but also used for trade, commerce, exploration, and warfare during an era known as the Viking Age, that goes approximately from 793 to 1066 AD.

They were clinker built, which means the overlapping of planks riveted together. It was capable of sailing 75 miles (121 km) in one day and held a crew of about 20 to 30 men.

This new discovery could be one of the oldest evidence of pre-Columbian trans-oceanic contact, and it certainly brings to mind the famous colony of “Vinland” mentioned in the Icelandic Sagas.

This mythical colony would have been established by Leif Ericson around the same period as the settlement at l’Anse aux Meadows, in the Canadian province of Newfoundland and Labrador, the most famous site of a Norse or Viking settlement in North America outside Greenland.

Butternuts found in the Newfoundland site had already suggested that the Norse had explored the continent because they do not grow naturally north of the Canadian province of New Brunswick, hundreds of kilometers away from any known Viking settlement.

The carbon dating of the new ship estimates that it dates from between 990 and 1050 AD, approximately the period associated with Vinland and the various Canadian sites (L’Anse aux Meadows, Tanfield Valley, Avayalik Islands).

This could mean that the that the Viking had actually developed a far wider trade network in the Americas that what was traditionally believed.

Unfortunately, very few other artifacts have yet been found on the site, suggesting the crew must have most likely abandoned the ship and continued on foot.

More searches are to be expected in the area over the next few years, as scientists will now certainly try to look for any artifacts or historical traces that could lead them to understand what happened to the crew of the ship.

Many myths from local native tribes will also be analyzed by historians from the team to see if they could hold useful information, as both Chickasaw and Choctaw mythologies include many stories of fights against “red-haired devils”."

Easter Island Statue Project Conservation Initiative Preliminary Report



July-August 2011



Project Target Statues

The target statues from the inception of this project are RR-001-156 and RR-001-157, both of which are located within Quarry 2 of Rano Raraku. RR-001-158 is adjacent to Quarry 2 on the eastward side and was selected by the conservators as a study control. All of these designations are given on EISP Map Sheet 1 (Van Tilburg and Arévalo Pakarati 2009). Rano Raraku, the quarry in which fully 95% of the known 1,042 monolithic sculptural objects documented to date by this project were carved, is a unit of the Corporación Nacional Forestal (CONAF; www.conaf.cl) and, as such, a World Heritage site.

Easter Island Statue Project

The Easter Island Statue Project (EISP) is a private research program and archive created by Jo Anne Van Tilburg, Principle Investigator and EISP founder and director, with Cristián Arévalo Pakarati, Rapa Nui artist and co-director of EISP. The profound and immediate need for conservation actions on the moai became apparent over the course of more than 20 years of subjective observation and field experience acquired by us during our island-wide archaeological survey, which was conducted in association with our Chilean and Rapa Nui colleagues.

The Easter Island Statue Project office is located at 225 Arizona Avenue, Studio 500, Santa Monica, CA, 90401. The EISP field office is located at the Mana Gallery, Petero Atamu s/n, Hanga Roa, Easter Island (Rapa Nui), Chile.

EISP and this AIA funded project are devoted to six discrete but intricately interwoven activities that are also AIA goals:

excavation,

conservation,

data collection and management,

preservation and stewardship advocacy

community outreach,

student opportunities and education

The excavation and conservation teams included in this project are made up almost exclusively of local members of the Rapa Nui community. To date, this project has

created research and design opportunities for interested members of our field teams and the Rapa Nui community, as well as UCLA students and volunteers,

supported the stewardship of the archaeological record by providing all field generated data to relevant or collaborating Chilean and Rapa Nui agencies,

employed 40 Rapa Nui people from the ages of 15 to 75, including distinguished elders and budding scholars,

sustained a modest portion of the local economy.

Preliminary Statement

This report is the fourth in an unpublished and selectively distributed series documenting the implementation of the first legally permitted excavations in Rano Raraku quarry since those conducted by Thor Heyerdahl and the Norwegian Archaeological Expedition to Easter Island, 1954-55. All previous reports were provided to the agencies above and, as such, are matters of public record. In addition, each one was filed on www.eisp.org at the end of each season and is widely available in that format to the interested public. Photographs and other data beyond that provided here are also available at www.eisp.org.

Each EISP report describes project participants, methods, goals and results and is a preliminary draft document. However, the report series as a whole contains our initial research proposal and gives the complete history and implementation context of the project (see below). All of the reports are archived by the Easter Island Statue Project (EISP) and copies are provided or available to our funders as well as to all relevant Chilean agencies. To date, Van Tilburg has presented the project and results at two AIA conferences and one UCLA event. Abstracts or details of these presentations are available on the web sites of these organizations.

Excavation

The excavations described here are integral to the conservation actions planned and undertaken by this project on statues RR-001-156 and RR-001-157. They have very specific research goals and are required in order to

record previously unrecorded, unique petroglyphs,

preserve the petroglyphs,

document statue details,

compare statue details and petroglyphs with existing records of other similar features throughout the island,

compare the same details with BM-LON-001 in the British Museum

establish previously unreported excavation levels, 1914,

establish previously unknown photographic levels, 1935,

establish previously unknown surface destruction, 1954,

retrieve and document stone tools for study and storage.

Environmental Monitoring

The conceptualization, implementation, and evaluation of conservation actions are the responsibilities of our colleagues Christian Fischer and Moníca Bahamondez P. in consultation with EISP and its data. As previous reports indicate, these actions include ambient environmental monitoring and environmental data collection as well as highly specific statue condition monitoring. The latter activity is unique to this pilot project and integral to the excavation plan. Data collection is carried out with the assistance of Rapa Nui scientist Tahira Edmunds, whose bi-weekly site visits allow her to download and send data to UCLA for analysis. Her visits are also part of our site monitoring plan.

Conservation Treatment

Statue stone condition data collection prior to and after excavation and specific types of conservation treatments are inherent in our pilot plan and crucial to our ability to generalize such actions to other statues in the interior of Rano Raraku. It is important to note here that the initially planned two-stage treatment plan was amended as a result of unfortunate vandalism to the site and illegal removal of the equipment in April, 2010. That vandalism, and the underlying social processes contributing to it, were neither caused nor created by this project. As befits the pilot project framework, a full assessment and evaluation of conservation actions will take place at the end of the data analysis phase, which we anticipate to coincide with backfilling of RR-001-156 in 2012.

Reports for three previous conservation seasons successfully carried out to date were generated and have been given under separate cover by our collaborators Dr. Christian Fischer, the Cotsen Institute of Archaeology at UCLA and Monica Bahamondez P., Director, Centro Nacional de Conservación y Restauración (CNCR). These reports with edifying illustrations are also posted at www.eisp.org.

Excavation Data Collection and Management

DATASHARE is a significant component of the Easter Island Statue Project and of this AIA funded Conservation Initiative. DATASHARE grew out of the original archive generated by personal field work between 1982 and 1986 (Van Tilburg 1986). However, its on-line potential was only recognized as a direct consequence of our Rano Raraku mapping project (Van Tilburg and Arévalo Pakarati 2009), which generated a mass of new data from 2000 to 2005. Our map is thus the organizing strategy for our entire data collection. Copies of our unpublished but copyrighted map, along with two volumes of our original Rano Raraku data, were provided to all Chilean authorities and today usefully facilitate the management of Rano Raraku by CONAF. Other full paper copies of our Rano Raraku portion of DATASHARE are held by all of the Chilean and Rapa Nui agencies copied here (Van Tilburg and Arévalo Pakarati 2009). The full on-line availability of DATASHARE requires further fundraising activity and its final content and scope is obviously dependent upon funding.

Excavation Collections Summary

DATASHARE contains, in addition to the records described above, a full and comprehensive record of the excavations we are conducting and the artifacts and eco-facts collected. Our series of linked reports includes an artifact database and an image database. Objects are collected in two ways: either within bags or as discrete objects. To date, two objects have been or are now being transferred to the local Museo Antropológico P. Sebastián Englert. These are a basalt stone with an incised curvilinear design (vaka; RR-001-157-478) and 800 g of concentrated red pigment (kie’a; RR-001-156-653; see below). Our identification system is sorted by the following traceable markers:

unit designation (the statue numbers as they appear on our EISP map;

squares(as they appear on our grid diagrams

levels within squares (recorded as cm)

30 materials and object type categories

To date our collections include

Season IV Field Work Narrative and Daily Events Log

Thursday July 7.

JVT arrives Rapa Nui via Tahiti. JVT met with Cristián Arévalo P. and Rosa Paoa Ika to deal with logistical plans for serving the crew a customary daily breakfast (coffee and bread) and also hot lunch (supper) at the end of each day. JVT and CAP met with students and others who wish to work on the field crew. JVT met with Sonia Haoa of the Consejo de Monumentos Nacional and Lili González.

Friday July 8

JVT and CAP met with Ninoska Cuadros Huke, director of the Rapa Nui unit of CONAF. JVT and CAP audit profile drawings for RR-001-157.

Saturday July 9

JVT met in the morning with Chris Stevenson. Rafael Paoa Rapu, who is working on the XRF sourcing of the basalt tools removed from our excavations, will be at Chris’s lab in the U.S. for one week in January. He has an opportunity, as well, to visit the EISP office and UCLA as a follow-up experience. Obsidian samples from the lowest, previously unexcavated levels of our RR-001-157 excavations, with permission, will be carried by Rafael to Chris’s lab for the benefit of his learning process and for potentially useful analysis. We have retrieved 509 tools (toki) during our Rano Raraku excavations to Season III, and Rafael has collected the XRF data on 179 of them. This large sample forms the nucleus of his lithics studies.

Site Visit

Niko Fredes Hey joins us and we pick up some of our field equipment at the Mana Gallery and purchase poles to take to Rano Raraku to erect a tent as insurance against rain. CAP and NiKo erect the tent while JVT documents the current status of the site.

Site Monitoring

CAP’s observations made and actions taken during weekly monitoring of the site between field seasons have been very useful. Guava is persistent and tiny plants that had sprung up in various areas have been removed throughout the time since Season III. The profiles are fully documented in our audited stratigraphic drawings, and after our final photo record is made we intend to close the excavation of RR-001-157 during this season. We plan for Monday’s first field day and schedule tasks, including the backfill of RR-001-157.

Site Condition: RR-001-157

Squares 16, 17, 18, and 19 were among the first excavated and are in good condition, but fragile. Some toki and flakes once present in the NE sidewall and shown in the profile drawings have weathered slightly out of the sidewall and we removed them and will add them to the object collection after they are properly registered. They will be stored with the toki in Square 30. A toki in the corner of Square 12 was photographed in more detail and will be removed while backfilling.

The current depth of Square 19 is 65 cm measured from the surface (originally, according to our notes, at 80 cm measured from the line). The first set of photos shows Square 16 at 60 cm deep. Square 8 is eroded from its original 50 cm width to about 45 cm. Square 12 is eroded from 50 cm to 47 cm width. This is negligible.

Photos were taken to document the colors of the back of RR-001-157 to compare them with those taken in February. There is essentially no change, except that the top of the head to the bottom of the ears seems to be darker since the application of the water repellent. The lichens on the back of the head are dying and some have changed color from white to gray and black. The next level of color is gray to the shoulders, then tan to the mid-point of the arm. The tan portion is quite dry.

Control statue RR-001-158 was photographed (Figure 3 above) and the damage inflicted on its face by vandals in April, 2010 is nearly invisible now. The fence is intact and monitoring equipment is in place. Final overviews of the site were taken once the tent was erected. Excavation tools and the portable table we use as an office are stored on site.

Sunday July 10

JVT works on the collections in the EISP Field Office (Mana Gallery) for most of the day. All of the collections made during the previous excavations for Seasons I, II, and III had already been washed, bagged and logged. A print-out of that log was included in the Season III report. Our next task is to generate museum accession numbers in the catalog and then to physically assign them to each bag. All collected materials are stored in their original bags and the bags are in individual, labeled plastic bins annotated by season. A major task for October-November field season is that each bag, once the museum number has been attached, will have to be photographed with its contents prior to moving it into museum storage. We are training two Rapa Nui field assistants this process, and their experience on the actual excavations will facilitate this lab work.

Monday July 11

RR-001-157 Square 4 100-200 cm

RR-001-157 Square 5 30-220 (stopped at 175 cm)

RR-001-156 Squares 10 and 13 Shovel Scrape

Bags Collected: 6

We (7 members of crew) arrived at Rano Raraku. Vai photographed the overall condition of the excavation site as well as the various squares and their sidewalls and the papa or bedrock in the west wall of the excavation, along with various petroglyph details. Nico began clearing RR-001-157 Squares 4 and 5. JVT with Tari clears Squares 10 and 13 extensions under the papa. Vai photographed details of the papa west wall. Our goal today is to excavate RR-001-157 Square 4 now at 30 cm deep on the south and 1 m deep on the north and to begin Square 5.

Tuesday July 12

RR-001-156 Square 11 170-220 cm

RR-001-156 Square 12 170-220 cm

Bags Collected: 20

A large number of tourists in big groups are in the interior today. It is very time consuming as they have a lot of questions for us. CAP and Nico begin digging Squares 12 and 13. During the afternoon JVT photographs previously mapped paenga (RR-001-179), taheta (RR-001-178) and umu pae (RR-001-177) features in the middle of the interior slope in order to amplify EISPMap Sheet 5 and Map Sheet 6 (Van Tilburg and Arévalo Pakarati 2009).

Wednesday July 13

RR-001-157 Square 4 170-230 cm

RR-001-156 Square 10 150-220 cm (half)

Bags Collected: 28

JVT begins excavating Square 10, 150-220 cm (see July 20 notes). Shovel scrape of the square revealed a few bone fragments (animal) and numerous pebbles. One large rock was removed from the NW corner of Square 10. It measures 25 x 30 x 30 and is of very porous light gray basalt and, with the others, is stored on site. We note that the wall of Square 13 extension is holding nicely after a recent light rain. Vai repeats many artifact photos of the previous day due to a camera focus problem now resolved. In Square 4 we find a large piece of metal fused with coral in proximity to the statue.

Notes on stratigraphy: NE wall to 220 cm

organic black to dark brown surface layer with vegetation extends as a lens about 30 cm deep into the next layer;

yellow-brown soil with lapilli;

lapilli layer is shot through with a thin inserted layer of brown-gray soil. Large pieces of basalt are present and there are vertical cracks throughout;

thin layer of gray, lumpy soil;

wide uneven layer of brown-gray soil has organic yellow-green material including pebbles; large piece of broken basalt and cultural material throughout;

layer of pebbles and organic material

ozidized metal associated with the Williamson, Balfour Company at about the 170 cm level (see earlier notes)

our historic level book shows the 1914 level very clearly and from it we have calculated the rate of deposition.

the 470 m deposit around RR-001-157 indicates the placement of the statue in an upright position at least 500 years ago.

Condition Notes: Dorsal View RR-001-157

The top of the head is ash gray and relatively smooth in appearance. White lichens on the upper half of the back of the head are spotted with gray-black pin pricks and appear to be dead or dying. There is a meandering patch of yellow-brown and thin, hair line cracks overall on the surface of both statues. The back of the head has an overall honey brown color and the surface is very even in texture. The raised spine is very apparent. The lower portion of the right ear has an overall gray and smooth surface but, just above it, there is a patch of brown and gray that seems to be an extension of the stratigraphy of the back of the head. The petroglyphs on the right side are visible. In general, the right side is more pulverized on the surface than is the left. The surface is dry thanks to the water repellant.

The shoulders are smooth with diagonal bands running right to left on the smoothed surface. The petroglyphs on the upper back are cut into this layer. There is a nearly rounded patch on the right back at the shoulder that is deep and reveals a thick conglomerate surface into which petroglyphs there are cut. The cupules on the left shoulder are in the lower eroded stone layer. Sheer plates and cracks both horizontal and vertical are present, and the petroglyphs are clearly etched into the previously eroded surface. The two vertical patches made on the loose slabs of tuff at the back of the head contrast in color with the current surface but will weather. Interestingly, not a single visitor has asked about them.

The EISP image database contains full documentation of the back of the statue and its condition to certain excavated levels. Images are on file from the Mana Expedition to Easter Island, 1914-1915; the Carnegie Expedition 1916; private collectors, 1914; the Norwegian Archaeological Expedition, 1954-1955 and several others (Figures 11, 12).

Condition Notes: RR-001-156 Ventral View

Some traces of original surface are still visible in the right eye socket and under the left brow. The top of the head is a very consistent ash gray in color and the same color is present on the left side of the brow. The brow itself has alternate lines of deep lapilli and smooth conglomerate. Diagonal and nearly horizontal lines of erosion cross the damaged face, which is dark gray to black. White spots of lichens on the left ear and the side of the face are present, along with a few spots on the bridge of the nose. The previously buried surface of the statue is an overall honey-brown color. Pieces of exposed basalt spot the lip. By far the best preserved surface is on the right side of the face below the ear. The surface there is plane and the Makemake petroglyph on it is very visible. The surface of the ear lobe just above is pulverized with visible conglomerate. The EISP image database contains documentation of the ventral side of the statue in the form of photographs or drawings made in 1914-1915, 1916, 1934-1935, 1954-1955, 1960, 1981 and following.

Thursday July 14 RR-001-156 Square 9 220-320 cm

Bags Collected: 19

We begin excavation (CAP with Nico) in Square 9. Small fragments of toki are relatively common, but intact or interesting specimens are rare. It may be that most of the toki from both statues were simply returned by Routledge to RR-001-157, whether or not they were originally removed from there. Unidentified fish bones are collected and the apparent remains of an umu are visible as a lens of black and gray in the soil. CAP clears the soil from near the right arm of the statue in Square 9. The stone is very yellow in color.

Friday July 15

RR-001-156 Square 8 220-320 cm (not completed)

Bags Collected: 13

Rain and drizzling all day makes it possible to view the highly successful results of the water repellant applied to the statues in May. The statues’ stone surfaces are soaked repeatedly, the beads of water simply cascade off and, if there is any sun at all, the entire exposed surface is dry within 10 minutes.

In Square 8 we exposed a deeply etched horizontal line drawn across the back of the statue precisely at the level of the top of the square. A single, large piece of carbon was collected at 54 cm deep near the back of the statue on the NW corner of Square 9 and just below the horizontal line. The soil is dark brown and heavy, and is water soaked with fine small pebbles throughout. A mass of animal bone (sheep?) is encountered. In Square 12 we uncover a thin but relatively even and consistent line of pebbles at the bottom of this level. When the soil was at this level (before 1914) there was an umu made (probably by men who worked for the Company).

Saturday July 16

Rain all day. Field work canceled. JVT meets with C. Stevenson, T. Ladefogel and their students to give an informal overview of the excavation prior to their site visit planned for July 19. CAP continues audit of profiles for RR-001-157.

Sunday July 17

JVT and CAP finalize profile drawings for RR-001-157. An interesting series of events is encoded in the stratigraphy and the various intrusions of excavations, especially by the Mana Expedition, are evident in the profiles.

Monday July 18

RR-001-156 Square 7 Shovel Scrape (I bag surface)

RR-001-156 Square 10 Shovel Scrape (1 bag surface)

RR-001-156 Square 8 Completed

Bags Collected: 6

Nico begins Square 9, which is wet but not flooded. JVT cleans the side of the papa on the west wall. The day is sunny and windy. Some more animal bone (sheep) is recovered in Square 8. Small stone rubble is found at 320 cm, including toki fragments and a quantity of black, decomposed basalt. A lens of this material is visible in the photograph of the square at 320 cm. Some small, thin roots of guava are attached to the sidewall but not to the statue back.

At about 4:00 PM today, which is very windy, a fire was accidentally started by someone employed to cut the grass and shrubbery. Flames, whipped by the wind, were sometimes over 4 m high and the smoke was very thick. Some of our crew went to help fight the fire, but it was obviously too dangerous. At the request of CONAF P. Hito, who arrived right away to try and control the fire, CAP drove to Hanga Roa to inform CONAF.

Tuesday July 19

RR-001-156 Square 11 220-320 cm

RR-001-156 Square 12 220-320 cm

Bags Collected: 16

JVT and CAP review RR-001-155, the remnants of a hare paenga. This feature, and another on the other end of the quarry (RR-001-212) were used as our GPS control points (Van Tilburg and Arévalo Pakarati 2009). Three of the stones (paenga) in RR-001-155 were visible during our mapping project, and one of them was used (Stone 3) the exact location of the point (Figures 17, 18). Three more stones are visible and we clear further vegetation and overburden to expose roughly half of the foundation.

Notes on RR-001-155 (hare paenga and survey control point)

The hare paenga is placed perpendicular to the slope and as exposed is 370 cm long, 156 cm wide at mid-point and 117 wide at the narrowest point (measured at Stone 4). It consists of 17 stones with an entrance and a portion of the poro paved terrace (taupea). Other stones from this structure are down slope. The stones are numbered from southwest to northeast and were documented consecutively.

Stone 1 Gray brown smooth basalt; total length 102 cm; width at widest point 16.5 cm; exposed 5 cm above ground; six holes on upper surface varying from 4 to 10 cm in diameter and from 2.5 to 7 cm deep.

Stone 2 Gray, porous basalt; total length 86 cm; width at widest point 15 cm; exposed above ground 5.5 cm; 3 holes varying from 4.5 to 5 cm in diameter and all about 4 cm deep.

Stone 3 Smooth, light gray and blue-gray basalt; 125 cm long; 19.5 cm wide at the top and 27 cm wide at the bottom including the beveled edge; 14 cm exposed above ground. There are two very small and shallow cupules on one end, one of which is broken; three cupules on the top range from 5 to 7.5 cm in diameter and from 2 to 6 cm deep. This stone is the EISP survey control point.

Stone 4 Gray-white crystalline basalt; the stone is in two pieces (A and B). Both of these stones are included in the EISP survey control point photographs. Stone A is 52 cm long and beveled. It is very well-made of a pock-marked, gray basalt. The top of it is 12 cm at the widest part and the base is 20 cm wide. Two shallow holes are 3.5 and 2 cm deep, respectively. Stone B is also beveled and of the same basalt type. It has one hole on the bottom that is 3.5 cm deep and two deep holes on the top (7 and 7.5 cm deep, respectively). The stone is 54.5 cm long and 39 cm wide.

Stone 5 is broken and 45 cm long. It is 11 cm wide and has two small and shallow holes.

Stone 6 is badly burned and discolored gray-black o top and reddish brown on the the sides. It is 68 cm long, 10 cm wide and 19 cm above the current ground level. There are 2 holes on top, one of which is 7 cm deep and the other 4 cm deep.

Stone 7 is 34 cm long and 16 cm above the current ground level. There are three holes, and the middle one is connected through another cupule on the site to another next to it. There appears to be a wear mark from the insertion of rope on the SE edge of one hole.

Stone 8 This stone may be part of Stone 7. I tis 37.2 cm long and 10 cm wide with two shallow holes

Stone 9 This stone may be part of Stone 10. It is very squared off, rectangular in shape and has two large holes. Total length is 40 cm long and 18 cm wide. It is only 7 cm above the current ground level.

Stone 10 is 30 cm long and has one broken edge and two holes. It may be part of Stone 9.

Stone 11 is an incomplete fragment that may be part of Stone 10. It is 17 cm long and 6.5 cm wide with three holes, one on each end is broken.

Stone 12 is 43.5 cm long and 16 cm wide. It has no holes and is located in front of the entrance to the structure.

Stone 13 is 30 cm long and 19 cm wide, with only 1 hole.

Stone 14 is 46 cm long, 14 cm wide, and has 3 holes

Stone 15 is 37.5 cm long and has 3 holes of different sizes and depths.

Stone 16 is 26 cm long and 14 cm wide with one shallow hole

Stone 17 is 21 cm long and 16 cm wide (exposed) with one hole.

The hare paenga foundation was excavated to 60 cm deep at the top of the slope and was exposed at ground level at the bottom of the slope.

The doorway is formed of 3 paenga and is 99 cm long from the curb and 48 cm wide. The exposed length of the structure is 7.80 m with a conjectured length of at least 10 m. It is 171 cm wide at the mid-point (exclusive of the entrance).

A curved endstone was brought from down slope and inserted back in the foundation at what we believe to be the approximately correct original location. The curbstone is 64 cm long, 29 cm wide and 12 cm height. It is formed of porous basalt similar to others in the foundation and has 1 broken post hole.

The significance of this structure is its relationship to RR-001-003.

RR-001-157 Square 5 180-220 cm

RR-001-157 Square 4 180-220 cm

Bags Collected: 6

CAP continues to clear the hare paenga. A photographic record is made to amplify the map and object record. Note: On the bags collected from Square 5 (July 11) the level was noted as 2m but digging stopped at 175 cm. Square 5 is brought down to the level of Square 4 to clean the dirt from the surface of RR-001-157. A large, apparently unworked basalt stone is present in the sidewall but not removed. We retrieve lithics as usual and scattered animal bone. We begin the second half of Square 10 (divided longitudinally on July 13) at 150-220 cm.

Notes on Backfill RR-001-157:

Ata will help Pato as he begins backfill of RR-001-157. Their first task is to clean and remove the vegetation (primarily roots) from the backfill pile and to remove the small stones so that all of the latter can all be deposited in the same layer at the same time. A portion of the east side of the enclosure fence is removed to accommodate the backfill process. The plan is to move the clean dirt from the pile by wheel barrow, deposit it in Square 19, and then to shovel it into the hole bit by bit. While time consuming, this will certainly protect the statue. This work begins at 12:20. The dirt is completely clean of refuse and stones. After several meters are deposited Pato compacts the soil.

Simultaneously, Tari and Nico continue the excavation of Square 4 at 220-320 cm. Martine, Margarita, and Melisanda with JVT are screening. The rain yesterday evening left everything damp or wet and we go extremely slowly so as not to overlook anything. The floor of Square 4 is smoothed to make it even with Square 12 at 320 cm. CAP and JVT discuss the curve of the statue’s back and consider constructing a frame that will allow us to measure it more closely.

In Square 4 at 300 cm we encountered an extremely large concentration of heavily weathered basalt (decomoposed) and large pieces of carbon near the SW corner of the square. The NE corner of Square 14 is eroded and uneven. A lens of charcoal is also present there. We create a step in which the ladder can be placed and then divide Square 6 in half with the top step being at 220 cm and the second at 270 cm down to Square 9 at 320 cm. CAP begins Square 7 at 220-270 cm at 3:45. Carbon and some animal bone is retrieved.

Rain off and on throughout the night has further compacted the backfill. Some rain appeared again at about 10:30 AM. The excavation is wet but not even close to being flooded. We begin in Square 7 at 220 cm exactly. In Square 4 at 220-320 we find a very unusual portion of what appears to be the jaw of either a lamprey or blow fish. Pato and Ata continue the backfill. We level Square 7 for photos. We bring buckets of water from the lake and wash everything in the field before collecting. One of the CONAF rangers volunteers to screen, which is very helpful on a day like this. Finally finish Square 10 (begun July 13) at 220 cm by removing 30 cm of soil to the west near the papa to even everything out and make the sidewall of 7 and 10 meet properly. Finished Square 7 at 220-320 cm and continued backfill.

Bags Collected: 16

Square 13 is measured at only 93 cm because one sidewall is slightly bowed. The 1 m measurement is accurate at the top of the square but slightly tilted inward. This is not a function of erosion or error, but during the original excavation Dario and we thought that the wall would be the tallest in the excavation and would need to be somewhat stronger or more stable. The area in question is thus 150 cm long across Squares 10 and 13 at the top. The extension under the papa was amplified on the drawing and new measurements were taken. Bone (animal) was found immediately we began Square 13. Our goal in Square 13 is to even the line that defines the edge of it with Square 10 before going under the papa via the mapped extension. Digging of the next level of Square 10 220-320 begins.

Simultaneously, backfill continues on RR-001-157 to the level of the “M” design on the statue’s back. Larger rocks, including cores and some with worked surfaces, which were earlier removed from the excavation and stored on site are now placed on the back dirt in the manner of a level pavement. Some small flakes and chips are included in this level.

JVT checks and records notes on the level of damage to the various statues that resulted by the accidental fire of a few days ago. It seems that about 10 statues, exclusive of worked features such as shaped blocks, quarry details, and papa may have suffered flame or smoke damage.

Informal Notes on Damage Due to Fire (July 18, 2011):

In 2002, the EISP mapping project was carried out after a major accidental grass fire. All of the vegetation and every single statue, quarry and feature we mapped was included in the burned area. The ash under foot was several centimeters thick. This fire was confined to a more limited area.

During the recent (2011) fires we note that the entire stone alignment (RR-001-197) was burned, as were the following: taheta 195; statue torso 198; moai 202 and all those above and to the east of this statue. Everything on EISP Map Sheets 9 to 13 and in EISP Quarry Sections 15 to 19 was in the fire zone.

Bags Collected: 9

Observations on RR-001-156, Dorsal View

From below the deeply etched horizontal line (220cm) a single strip of what appears to be moisture registers as a dark, wide line running from the right arm of the statues in an arc across the back and through the two circles to meet with a nearly square patch that is similarly dark. That patch extends from the spine to the arm and downward to the soil level. The lower portions of the circle and the arched lines on which they sit are now visible at 320 cm.

Coral is recovered in some quantity close to the moai in Square 9 at 340 cm. A large quantity of large pieces of carbon with mixed coral fragments, bone, obsidian flakes, and lapilli is collected, as are two molars (human?). Fowl and fish bone collected as well. Photos are taken at this point to document the accomplishment of our excavation of RR-001-157 and a bottle with the names of everyone on the crew (all four seasons) is buried in the soil at the middle of the circle.

Tuesday July 26

Heavy rain makes field work impossible today. JVT working on field notes; CAP on the second profile for RR-001-157.

Wednesday July 27

RR-001-155 : Surface to 60 cm (hare paenga)

Bags Collected: 2

We complete work on the hare paenga (see above). We surface clear most of the squares, which are still wet but undamaged and begin excavation of the extensions under the papa of Squares 10 and 13. Some bone (presumed to be human) is removed and stored in a separate box with a form given to us by the local museum. Once cataloged, the materials will be stored in the local museum with others previously retrieved (see November field report). Bone is all removed by JVT and CAP by hand. The rest were retrieved by Vai and Melisanda using tweezers at the field office at the back of the quarry. Privacy is ensured by blocking tourist access to that entire area.

In Square 10 at 166 cm we find metal. On another note, Margarita tells us today that last night an “old woman” cousin of Alberto Hotus told her that the name of the hare paenga we excavated (see above) is Hare Kai nga Poki.

Thursday July 28

Square 4 sidewall

Squares 7 and 9 surface 220 cm

Square 10 extension 120 cm

Square 13 extension 120 cm

Bags Collected: 14

Because portions of the excavation were wet due to rain we concentrated on the extensions of the squares under the papa, as they were nearly completely dry. All of the bones in these areas, some of which are human and most of which are sheep, were removed by CAP by hand.

Friday July 29

Square 4 extension 220 cm

Squares 7 and 10 extensions 220 cm

Bags Collected: 13

Shovel scrape surface of Square 10. CAP works on Square 10 extension under the papa while Ata continues the backfill of RR-001-157. We begin to remove a portion of Square 7 under the papa. Some red pigment is noted throughout the square and at 200 cm exactly Cristián found a large, egg-shaped quantity of pure red and still very bright pigment concentrate (kie’a).

Saturday July 30

Square 13 extension 175 cm

Bags Collected: 4

We begin removing Square 13 extension at 125 cm measured from the turf on the south wall and 120 cm from the papa on the same wall. The backfill of RR-001-157 is complete to just below the line of discoloration previously recorded by Routledge (1919), the Carnegie Expedition (1916) and later by the Norwegian Archaeological Expedition (1955-56). All surface erosion and other anomalies observed by the conservation process are contained above this line. Note the drying out of the left side of the back of the statue after exposure is proceeding nicely.

August 1

Square 13 extension to 220 cm

Bags collected: 6

Carbon is collected from three discrete lens in Square 13 extensions: one on the surface of the square at 220 cm; a second one on the same level but removed from the first, and a third at 194 cm in the sidewall of the same square.

August 2

JVT, Vai and Margarita meet with Francisco Torrres H., Director of Museo Antropolólgico P. Sebastián Englert (the local museum) to deposit the kie’a found (see above) and to discuss the curation of this fragile material. Later JVT, CAP, and Vai meet again with the director to finalize a system to expedite the cataloging of the collection of RR-001-157. We will insert a museum catalog number into our existing computerized catalog of bags collected and then also write the same number on the individual bag. The time consuming aspect of the process is then to photograph each bag and its contents and add that to the linked photo record. We have, including this field season, entered a preliminary count of 479 bags collected. A detailed listing of those objects by material is given in the Season III report and will be provided as an addendum to this report as well. The final days on the island are devoted to completing field records, closing the site and storing collections.

Jefferson, New York

2:53 P.M. EDT

THE PRESIDENT: Thank you everybody. It’s a great place; I’ve been here before. We love this location. We love this base and, most particularly, the people that are working so hard here and so effectively.

So I want to start by saying, “At ease.” Just relax. Do you have seats? You can sit down. Come on. Sit. If you want to stand, you can. We’ll just get one big standing ovation, right? (Laughter.) Sit down. Thank you. That’s pretty good. Everybody has got a seat. Thank you very much.

I want to thank our wonderful Vice President, Mike Pence, and say a special hello to the incredible patriots of Fort Drum and the 10th Mountain Division. Special people. Thank you. (Applause.)

A few moments ago, I witnessed your extraordinary capabilities firsthand during an artillery raid demonstration. So I’d like to begin by applauding the 10th Mountain Division Combat Aviation Brigade, along with the 3rd Battalion, 6th Field Artillery. (Applause.) I hate to say this, but nobody stands a chance against you folks. Nobody stands a chance. (Applause.)

I’m here today to sign our new defense bill into law and to pay tribute to the greatest soldiers in the history of the world: the United States Army. Thank you. Thank you. (Applause.)

The National Defense Authorization Act is the most significant investment in our military and our warfighters in modern history, and I am very proud to be a big, big part of it. It was not very hard. You know, I went to Congress; I said, “Let’s do it. We got to do it. We’re going to strengthen our military like never, ever before.” And that’s what we did. I want to say, very strongly, there is no better place than right here at Fort Drum to celebrate its passage. No better place.

After years of devastating cuts, we’re now rebuilding our military like we never have before, ever. Because we know that to survive and having that survival of our freedom, it depends upon the might of our military. And no enemy on Earth can match the strength, courage, and skill of the American Army and the American Armed Forces. Nobody is even close. They never will be.

We’re grateful to be joined today by many of our nation’s top military leaders. I’d like to recognize Deputy Secretary of Defense Shanahan, who’s with us. Please, Mr. Secretary. (Applause.) People I’ve heard about all my life — a very prestigious title; I always loved the ring: The Joint Chiefs of Staff. Right? That’s got a good ring. Anybody in the audience going to be a member of that someday? I think so. Raise your hand. If you think you’re going to make it, raise your hand. Go ahead. Oh, come on. That’s all? Only a few? I don’t know. (Applause.)

I want to thank General Dunford, General Milley, General Neller, Admiral Richardson, General Goldfein, General Lengyel, and Vice Admiral Ray. Thank you all for your leadership. You’re magnificent. We appreciate it very much. Thank you. (Applause.) Thank you.

A very special thank you to the commanding general of the 10th Mountain Division, Major General Walt Piatt. What a special man. Walt, I want to thank you. Where is Walt? Where is Walt? Walt, thank you very much. (Applause.) Thank you. Thank you. Walt is back on American soil after a deployment in Iraq. And I just want to welcome you home. You have tremendous respect. They have great, great admiration and respect for you, Walt. Thank you very much.

I also just had the chance to meet Division Command Sergeant Major Jason Roark, along with 10th Mountain Division Soldier of the Year, Michael Lima. Where’s Michael? Where is Michael? Soldier of the Year. (Applause.) Michael. Pretty good. And that’s Soldier of the Year, Michael, out of how many?

SERGEANT LIMA: Eighteen thousand

THE PRESIDENT: How many?

SERGEANT LIMA: Eighteen thousand

THE PRESIDENT: That’s a lot of soldiers. Eighteen thousand? Do you want to work for me? (Laughter.) Thank you, Michael. Great job.

We would not be here for today’s signing ceremony without the dedicated efforts of the members of Congress who worked so hard to pass the National Defense Authorization Act. I’d like to recognize Congresswoman Elise Stefanik, whose district proudly includes Fort Drum. And I have to tell you about Elise. She called me so many times. I said, I don’t want to take her call. She wanted me to be here. I said, I won’t be able to; we’ll have to change a lot of scheduling. But that didn’t suit her. She didn’t stop. And here I am. (Applause.) Here I am.

Elise, come here. Come here, Elise.

REPRESENTATIVE STEFANIK: Thank you, Mr. President. It is truly an honor to welcome you to Fort Drum, home of the historic 10th Mountain Division, the most deployed unit in the U.S. Army since 9/11. Thank you for being here to sign the historic National Defense Authorization Act, which includes the largest pay increase, support for our military families, and investing in our military readiness. Climb to glory, 10th Mountain Division! Thank you. (Applause.)

THE PRESIDENT: She’s an incredible representative.

I also want to thank Representatives Don Bacon, Dan Donovan, and Joe Wilson, who are with us today also. Thank you. Where are you? Stand up, please. Hi, Dan. Stand up. (Applause.) Thank you. Thank you, fellas.

There’s another member of Congress here today who is not only an Air Force veteran, but the first woman ever to fly a fighter jet in combat in U.S. history. And I’ve gotten to know her very well, and she is terrific. Congresswoman Martha McSally. Congresswoman. (Applause.) Thank you, Martha. Thank you for being here. Thank you very much.

Thank you all for fighting for our military and for fighting for our vets. Nobody has made more progress on anything than what we’ve done with our vets. We have Choice approved. You know that. We have so many other things approved for our vets, and it’s really moving along well.

I think, maybe, almost as important as Choice is Accountability. Now, when we find somebody not treating our vets probably, you know what we say, right? “You’re out. Get out. You’re fired. Get out.” (Laughter.) They couldn’t do that. They couldn’t do that. Now they can do it. (Applause.) Now they have to treat our vets properly. Our vets are our great people, and they get treated properly.

So you have Choice and you have Accountability, and nobody thought that would ever get approved. They’ve been trying for many, many decades.

Finally, I want to thank a very special group of patriots at Fort Drum: all of the amazing spouses and family members whose love and support make your service possible. Whether you like it or not, they make it possible. Please. Thank you. Thank you very much. (Applause.) They know. They know. Right? Look at them. He’s smiling. They know.

Last year, we secured a historic $700 billion to rebuild our military. And now, the National Defense Authorization Act paves the way for another 1,700 — listen to this now. So we’ve been trying to get money. They never gave us money for the military for years and years. And it was depleted. We got $700 billion. And next year, already approved, we have $716 billion to give you the finest planes, and ships, and tanks, and missiles anywhere on Earth. Nobody makes them like we do.

And very, very far distant, in this case — jobs are very important in all cases — but in this case, military might is more important than even jobs. But all of this equipment is made right here in the USA, and it’s the best equipment on Earth. Nobody makes it like we do. So you have $700 billion and now $716 billion. So congratulations. (Applause.)

America is a peaceful nation. But if conflict is forced upon us, we will fight and we will win. Right, General? Right? Right? Better believe it, generals. (Applause.) They’re the guys. We’re powered by the unstoppable force of the United States Army. Very special.

With this new authorization, we will increase the size and strength of our military by adding thousands of new recruits to active duty, reserve, and National Guard units, including 4,000 new active-duty soldiers. And we will replace aging tanks, aging planes and ships with the most advanced and lethal technology ever developed. And hopefully we’ll be so strong we’ll never have to use it. But if we ever did, nobody has a chance.

It all includes 135 brand-new, beautiful M1 Abrams tanks, 60 Bradley Fighting Vehicles, and over 3,000 Joint Light Tactical Vehicles for the Army Armored Brigade Combat Team. New Black Hawk and Apache helicopters — finest in the world — for the Army National Guard. Seventy-seven F-35 Joint Strike Fighters. You know, that’s stealth. I talked to a couple of pilots — great pilots — I said, “How are they?” They said, “They’re hard to beat because you can’t see them.” It’s always hard to beat the enemy when you can’t see it. The greatest in the world.

Full funding for the B-21 Raider bomber program. Thirteen new Battle Force ships and support ships, including a fourth Ford-class aircraft carrier and three additional Littoral Combat Ships.

Funding to modernize our nuclear arsenal is so important. We’re doing a major upgrade of our missile defense. We’re spending a tremendous amount of money on our nuclear arsenal. Nobody will have close. We will hopefully never, ever have to use it. But nobody will be close.

More than $11 billion for the military construction, including family housing. And we are proudly giving our troops the biggest pay increase in a decade. And I know you don’t want it because you’re very patriotic. You’ll say, just save the money. We’re going to pay down debt. Does anybody not want it? Please raise your hand. What’s going on here? (Laughter.) Are these real patriots? I don’t know, General. I don’t know. It’s the biggest increase in a decade.

A strong military also requires a strong economy, and our economy is setting records like never before. We have the great economy we’ve ever had. I think that’s going to help us a lot in a lot of ways. It also helps us a lot in funding and doing all of the things we’re doing for our great military.

We’ve created almost 4 million new jobs since the election. A number that the media in the back would never have said would be possible if during the campaign. (Applause.) I’m so proud of myself; I didn’t call them the “fake-news media.” I didn’t call them. (Applause.) I said to myself, I will not today, in front of our great armed forces, call them fake news. (Laughter.) We know the real truth, but we won’t say it today. (Laughter.) But they wouldn’t have believed it possible — 4 million new jobs. Nobody would have thought that possible on the campaign trail.

If when we were campaigning, Mike, if I would have said that — if I would have said, “Two million new jobs,” people would have laughed us off the stage. Well, we have 4 million new jobs.

Something I’m very proud of: the African American, Hispanic — Hispanic American, and Asian — Asian American — the unemployment rates for all three have reached the lowest levels in the history of our country. Unemployment for African Americans, Hispanics, Asians, the lowest level in the history of our country. (Applause.)

Women’s unemployment is not — I’m sorry — doing quite as well. It’s only the lowest level in 65 years. (Laughter.) So we’re not doing as well. (Applause.) But we’ll do better. I think within about three weeks, when the new numbers come out, you’ll probably be lowest in history also.

Very importantly, the veterans’ unemployment rate recently reached its lowest level in nearly 20 years. It’s a big one. (Applause.)

And we are creating manufacturing jobs again. Remember during the campaign, they said, “Oh, you can’t create manufacturing jobs.” I said, “Really? We’re not going to make things anymore? Is that what it’s come to? We’re going to have other country make things? They’re going to make things and we’re going to buy them? And they’re going to have the jobs and we’re not?” Doesn’t work that way. We’re doing manufacturing jobs at the fastest pace in many, many decades.

No longer are we apologizing for America. Instead, we are now standing up for America. It’s called “America First,” if that’s okay with you. (Applause.) We’re standing up for our military, and we’re standing up for our great American flag. We’re standing for our flag. (Applause.)

The armed forces have endured continuous combat for the past 17 years. Yet, since the 1990s, the number of soldiers on active duty was cut by more than one-third. Our bases and vital equipment were allowed to fall into a state of disrepair. And I saw some of them. Total disrepair. But those days are over. Every day the Army is fighting for us, and now we are fighting for you — 100 hundred percent. (Applause.)

No one better understands how stretched our military has become than the soldiers of the 10th Mountain Division. Is that right, General?

You were the first conventional combat force to deploy after 9/11. Since then, no division in the Army has been deployed more times to Iraq and Afghanistan than you. You’ve sent over 9,000 courageous soldiers to 26 different countries all around the world in the past year alone.

The 2nd Brigade Combat Team just returned from a rotation at the Joint Readiness Training Center, and later this year they will once again bravely answer our nation’s call and deploy to Afghanistan. Through it all, you’ve proven to the world, to our country, to your families, that Fort Drum soldiers aren’t just tough; you’re “mountain tough.” That’s what you are — you’re mountain tough. (Applause.)

I said to you, General, “What’s the difference?” He said, “Sir, trust me, there’s a difference.” So I said, “I trust you, General.” Right? I said, “Don’t go into it. I trust you.”

One of those soldiers is Specialist Brayden Cook, who is with us today. Where’s Brayden? Where’s — oh, Brayden — good location, Brayden. Very good. (Laughs.) (Applause.)

Last October, his team came under heavy fire while cleaning and clearing — clearing out Taliban strongholds in various locations in Afghanistan. An Afghan soldier fighting alongside U.S. troops was badly wounded when an explosive detonated nearby. Specialist Cook braved the hail of bullets and mortar rounds all over — they said it was all over; it was heavy fire — saving the life of that wounded soldier and earning a Bronze Star for Valor for his courageous action.

Brayden, I want to thank you. A brave young man. Thank you. Please, stand up again, Brayden. (Applause.) Great.

We’re also inspired by the devotion to duty shown by the family members who serve their nation here at home.

Ashley Shepard is one of those family members. She has been married to Sergeant First Class Ian Shepard for more than 14 years. Ashley supports military families in every way you can imagine. She has served as a Family Readiness Group leader, co-leader, treasurer, and assistant treasurer for three companies. She works hard. She raises money for scholarships, organizes charity events for Gold Star families, and feeds homeless veterans. Ashley, I want to thank you. Ashley? Where is Ashley? I had a feeling that was you, Ashley. Stand up, Ashley. (Applause.) Thank your husband too. Thank you.

America is eternally grateful for every soldier, service member, and family member here at Fort Drum. And we are forever in the debt of every American who has ever served our nation in uniform — from the snows of Valley Forge to the jungles of Vietnam and the mountains of Afghanistan. It’s just incredible what you do.

A few days ago, Vice President Pence flew to Hawaii to greet the remains of some of our nation’s greatest heroes: our fallen warriors who gave their lives many years ago in Korea. Now these American heroes are finally starting to come home. They will be laid to rest on American soil. We believe in no American left behind. (Applause.)

And we believe our warfighters deserve the tools, the equipment, and resources they have earned with their blood, sweat, and tears.

In a few moments, in honor of that sacred obligation, I will put my signature on the National Defense Authorization Act. This authorization will give America’s warfighters the firepower they need to win any conflict quickly and decisively.

Thanks to the leadership of Representative Stefanik, we’re also making an unprecedented commitment to developing our artificial-intelligence capabilities.

In order to maintain America’s military supremacy, we must always be on the cutting edge. That is why we are also proudly re-asserting America’s legacy of leadership in space. Our foreign competitors and adversaries have already begun weaponizing space, developing new technologies to disrupt vital communications, blind satellites, and just — I mean, you look at what they’re doing. They’ve given me rundowns. I’ve seen things that you don’t even want to see, what they’re doing and how advanced they are. We’ll be catching them very shortly. They want to jam transmissions, which threaten our battlefield operations, and so many other things. We will be so far ahead of them in a very short period of time your head will spin.

China even launched a new military division to oversee its warfighting programs in space. Just like the air, the land, the sea, space has become a warfighting domain. It is not enough to merely have an American presence in space. We must have American dominance in space.

So that is why, just a few days ago, the Vice President outlined my administration’s plan to create a sixth branch of the United States military, called the United States Space Force. (Applause.) Got to get it, Joe. Got to get it, Joe. Right, Joe? Right?

We will ensure that the next great chapter in history is written by the heroes of the United States military. America will always rise to every challenge and overcome every danger, because we are backed by the strength and power of the American soldier.

Speaking to his troops, General George Patton — a great one — once said: “We have the finest…equipment [and] the best spirit, and the best men in the world.” Now, if it were today, he would be saying “the best men and women” in the world. Things do change. But that was quite a statement many years ago.

Continuing his remarks, Patton then declared: “I don’t want to get any messages saying, ‘I am holding my position.’ We are not holding a [God]damned thing…We are advancing constantly.” That was Patton.

Nearly 75 years later, Patton’s words still ring true. America has the best equipment anywhere in the world. We have the best spirit, the best soldiers ever to set foot on any battlefield, anywhere, at any time. We are the most powerful. We are the best funded. We are the biggest. We are the strongest. We are the smartest.

And we are still not holding a damned thing, because America is on the move once again, and we are not backing down. Our country is respected again. I don’t know if you see it, but America is respected again. There’s a big difference, and a big difference in the air. You take a look around; there’s a big, beautiful difference.

We are advancing forward with our confidence renewed, our might restored, and the unwavering conviction that our destiny is our victory. America’s future is safe, sound, and brighter than ever, because each of you is Mountain tough, Mountain proud, and Mountain strong, and always will be climbing to glory. You will be climbing to glory.

Thank you again for the incredible men and women of Fort Drum. Special, special, great people. God bless our troops. And God bless the United States of America.

I’d now like to invite a few of our fantastic soldiers from the 10th Mountain Division 2nd Brigade Combat Team to join me onstage to sign the National Defense Authorization Act. It’s been an honor to be with you today. Thank you all very much. Thank you. (Applause.)

(The Act is signed.)

If the Guggenheim's plans stay as they are, the exhibit will feature several distinct instances of unmistakable cruelty against animals in the name of art.

In one example, artists Peng Yu and Sun Yuan tether four pairs of American pit bulls to eight wooden treadmills for a live exhibit. The dogs are faced off against one another, running ""at"" each other but prevented from touching one another, which is a stressful and frustrating experience for animals trained to fight. The dogs get wearier and wearier, their muscles more and more prominent, and their mouths increasingly salivate. At this live 2003 ""performance"" in China, a video was recorded, complete with close-up shots of the dogs' frantic, foaming faces. This 7-minute video will be on display at the Guggenheim exhibit (information from NY Times article ""Where the Wild Things Are: China’s Art Dreamers at the Guggenheim"").

In another example, artist Xu Bing stamped meaningless characters all over the bodies of two pigs, a boar and a sow, who were put on display, mating, in a museum exhibit in Beijing in 1994. The Guggenheim will feature the video of that ""performance"" as well.

Finally, this exhibit will feature live animals (reptiles, amphibians, insects) that are trapped in a glass enclosure for attendee viewing. According to the NY Times article, ""During the three-month exhibition some creatures will be devoured; others may die of fatigue. The big ones will survive. From time to time, a New York City pet shop will replenish the menagerie with new bugs.""

Help us send a message to the Guggenheim by signing this petition. Let them know that animal cruelty holds no place in art in the United States, nor should it anywhere in the world. This assault on animals in the name of art will not be tolerated or supported.

Guggenheim - please do what you know in your heart is right. Take a stand with our animal cohabitants of this planet, and pull the pieces employing these cruel methods from your upcoming show.

Guggenheim - tell the world what you stand for: bold, controversial art that breaks barriers and challenges social norms, which does NOT include the promotion of cruelty against innocent beings."

The video you are about to watch below is quite disturbing. For the last eight years Costco has claimed that their egg supply came from hens who were cage free. The picture used on their cartons depict chickens roaming free in a beautiful field of grass. An undercover investigation by the Humane Society of the United States, sadly uncovered quite a different reality.

If you are a Costco shopper, the shocking information reported in this footage, is critical for you to be aware of. It reveals that the egg suppliers for Costco keep their chickens in the very worst conditions imaginable.

These poor birds are packed so tightly in wire bottom cages, that they are unable to reach the food and water they need to survive, and can’t even spread their wings. Many die as a result of these inhumane conditions, and their corpses are left their for days, while live chickens lay their eggs on top of them.

Such inhumane conditions of keeping hens in cages is not only gravely sad for these poor animals, but according to The Center for Food Safety, doing so increases the risk of Salmonella. The cruel and unhealthy conditions for the chickens in the following footage, is not only harmful for the animals, but puts the consumer at great risk for Salmonella poisoning.

The video is hard to watch, but making consumers aware of what Costco is selling, is essential in forcing them to make a change in the brand of eggs they are selling and misrepresenting.

Fire ants have waxy bodies that allow them to repel water. Should a colony find itself waterlogged, ants will protect their queen by forming a mass around her, as well as eggs, larvae, and pupae (ants that are in between larvae and adults). As the ants float, they rotate, so that the underwater ants will get to the top and vice versa. This behavior is totally normal, Molly Keck, an entomologist at Texas A&M AgriLife Extension Service, tells The Verge. ""We usually call fire ants flood water species,” she says. “They've been known well before this hurricane to float on top of water like that.”

Pro tip: Don't touch the floating fire ant colonies. They will ruin your day. #Harvey pic.twitter.com/uwJd0rA7qB — Mike Hixenbaugh (@Mike_Hixenbaugh) August 27, 2017

Keck describes these clumps as “chain-link ants.” They hook their feet and hang onto one another to preserve their colony while flooded. “When the water recedes, or they float to a spot where they hit dry land, then they'll build their colony again in their spot,” Keck says. In a flood, this can be particularly scary if they choose to board a temporary sanctuary someone has taken refuge on — like a roof.

The ants, in fact, aren’t harmless, she says. People who come in contact with the colonies will get at least a few itchy, probably painful pustules. But how your skin reacts can differ from swelling to life-threatening allergic reactions. “Once they hit you, you're a solid surface so they're gonna crawl on you,” Keck says. “When the first one stings, they emit a pheromone that causes a chain reaction that tells everybody else to sting, so you're going to experience quite a few stings.” The best thing to do is to rub them off as quickly as possible. “They'll kind of roll up when you brush against them, and so that's an easy way to try and get them to detach from you,” she says.

Those looking to go on the offensive may want to spray the ants with dish soap to break down their waxy rafts, according to Wired. Of course, that means getting close to the adrift colony, which Larry Gilbert, a professor of integrated biology at the University of Texas at Austin, strongly advises against. “You protect yourself by avoiding them, not by messing with them,” he says. ""They don't come to attack you. They're just passively floating along. It's a matter of being just intelligent and evasive.”

But if you find yourself unable to escape their path, Keck suggests creating waves to wash them away from you. “They are pretty well globbed up, and so if you're quick enough, you can kind of move them a few inches away from you so you can avoid them,” Keck says. At the very least, their distinctive rust coloring makes them easy to spot for what they are and not a piece of debris.

Keck says there’s no danger of them spreading beyond states they already inhabit. That might not be comforting for those in Texas and Louisiana, but at least the fire ants are not building wriggling Eiffel towers. Yet."

He isn’t running a campaign, it is a movement. Movements start out small and grow because millions of others agree with the message and feel that same passion or anger towards an issue.

Since 2008, the United States has declined in nearly every aspect that made us great. Our allies don’t trust us, our enemies don’t fear us, we have domestic terrorist groups like Black Lives Matter being called heroic instead of our law enforcement officers, and we are allowing more than 12 million illegal immigrants to stay here undocumented.

What sense does that make? We used to stand for something. We used to pride ourselves on leading the world, on defending our allies, crushing our enemies, and thanking our brave men and women in uniform. Under Obama and with the help of Hillary Clinton, we haven’t been that America in quite awhile. But there is a new beacon of hope.

The Man That Will Make America Great Again!

Not only will Donald Trump make this country great again, he won’t have to worry about ever seeing Obama again, either. Obama admitted just last week that he and his family are “seriously considering” moving to Canada if Donald Trump is elected the 46th president of the United States.

The Obama’s had been expected to stay in Washington, DC at least until his daughter graduated from high school, but if they want to leave when Mr. Trump takes over, we encourage them to pack up and go.

In typical Obama fashion, he couldn’t just leave it there. Not only did he tell reporters that his family will likely move directly to Canada, he said there education system is far superior to ours.

“Their education system is clearly a lot better than ours anyway,” he accepted, shaking his head. “Canadians would never elect someone as buffoonish and incompetent as Donald Trump, at least outside Toronto.” Obama also added that “Canada is clearly a much safer place for a black person, especially one who’s surrounded by police 24/7.”

Trump Being Awarded By American Patriots Trying To DEFEAT Hillary Clinton

How can a sitting US president speak so badly about a country he has ran for eight years? So the problem he is running from were literally created by him. He allowed BLM to grow into a domestic terror group; he allowed ISIS to grow into a global threat; he did nothing to make our schools and colleges better. His “concerns” have been what we have been screaming for eight years now, but he refused to listen.

When Trump takes office in January, it will be imperative that we continue to grow our network of Americans tired of the corruption. Trump has thousands of grassroots networks that he uses to hear what the people are saying.

Our movement has grown into the hundreds of thousands, but if we get Trump elected, it could break well over a million and he listens to our platform through his associates. Please share this because we cannot continue to grow as quickly as we have without your voice. We have to get Obama AND Hillary out of this country after this election!

She experienced it all, including an entire year as a guest of the Trumps in Florida. According to the family’s Funeral Director, Art Tubolls:

“Penny had a hard tome after Shirley died. First Joannie, then Shirley? Mr. and Mrs. C were gone…Winkler was doing stupid shit and getting covered in bees…Penny sank pretty far pretty fast. Had it not been for her friendship with Trump, she may not have made it through.”

The concierge at Mar a Lago confirms that Penny Marshall was a guest there, without fee, for 357 days in 2011. Her daily regimen included walking, swimming, opiate sessions with Dr. Sanjay Gupta and a motorcycle ride weekly with Eric Trump, who denies their relationship was anything other than platonic.

Marshall has shown her gratitude in death by donating her entire estate to the Trump 2020 re-election campaign. Marshall never married or had children, and grew up in the New York orphanage near where Trump went to business school. The two were lifelong friends. It was an unlikely companionship that kept going, even after she realized he was being a little bit racist about those Central Park Five kids.

Penny once told a friend of someone who may or may not have worked at the Trump Foundation:

“He once told me I was too horse-face for him otherwise I’d smash that sexy thing. Marla would no chance. That new girlfriend, though…what’s her name?”

They couldn’t recall the rest of the conversation, when where or if it actually happened, meaning Trump can still run for Supreme Court someday. That was one of Penny Marshall’s dreams. Donald Trump on the Supreme Court of the United States. No. Seriously. Ask anyone. Big news in New York. The city can now use Penny’s money to rally behind her idol.

White House staff failed to squash the story as the press release was intended to be distributed late in the day on Friday, after the deadline when most news agencies are able to publish breaking news stories.

Critics of the President’s executive order say the move makes Obama seem “politically tone deaf” because he gave himself a raise at a time when the federal government is arbitrarily cutting services and benefits due to sequestration.

Presidential pay raises are usually approved by Congress, the last increase being authorized by both Congress and Bill Clinton in 1999 and went into effect in 2001.

Most Serene, Most Powerful Prince Regent! Most Gracious Regent and Lord!

I was born in Kallstadt on March 14, 1869. My parents were honest, plain, pious vineyard workers. They strictly held me to everything good — to diligence and piety, to regular attendance in school and church, to absolute obedience toward the high authority.

After my confirmation, in 1882, I apprenticed to become a barber. I emigrated in 1885, in my sixteenth year. In America I carried on my business with diligence, discretion, and prudence. God’s blessing was with me, and I became rich. I obtained American citizenship in 1892. In 1902 I met my current wife. Sadly, she could not tolerate the climate in New York, and I went with my dear family back to Kallstadt.

The town was glad to have received a capable and productive citizen. My old mother was happy to see her son, her dear daughter-in-law, and her granddaughter around her; she knows now that I will take care of her in her old age.

But we were confronted all at once, as if by a lightning strike from fair skies, with the news that the High Royal State Ministry had decided that we must leave our residence in the Kingdom of Bavaria. We were paralyzed with fright; our happy family life was tarnished. My wife has been overcome by anxiety, and my lovely child has become sick.

Why should we be deported? This is very, very hard for a family. What will our fellow citizens think if honest subjects are faced with such a decree — not to mention the great material losses it would incur. I would like to become a Bavarian citizen again.

In this urgent situation I have no other recourse than to turn to our adored, noble, wise, and just sovereign lord, our exalted ruler His Royal Highness, highest of all, who has already dried so many tears, who has ruled so beneficially and justly and wisely and softly and is warmly and deeply loved, with the most humble request that the highest of all will himself in mercy deign to allow the applicant to stay in the most gracious Kingdom of Bavaria.

Your most humble and obedient,

They had gone to the flat - a refuge for victims of domestic violence - to investigate thousands in rent arrears.

Police believe she died of natural causes probably in December 2003 and an inquest recorded an open verdict.

Some of Ms Vincent's relatives, including her sisters, attended the inquest at Hornsey Coroner's Court, held by Deputy Coroner Andrew Walker.

Dental records

Ms Vincent's body, found in January this year at the flat in Wood Green, north London, was so decomposed that the only way to identify her was to compare dental records with a holiday photograph.

A spokesman for the coroner said she had apparently been placed in the women's refuge accommodation as a victim of domestic violence.

I did notice a kind of rotten smell but the bins downstairs are strong and the stairwells smell with junkies

Michael Dobbs

Neighbour

When staff from the Metropolitan Housing Trust (MHT) arrived at the flat on 25 January they drilled the door open and discovered piles of mail - some marked February 2003 - plus medication and food with February 2003 expiry dates, the spokesman said.

Pathologist Dr Simon Poole told the inquest he had been unable to establish the cause of death because the remains were ""largely skeletal"", but police did not regard the circumstances as suspicious.

MHT issued a statement which read: ""Ms Vincent moved into the property, which is general needs rented accommodation, in February 2003.

""Housing benefit was in part paying Ms Vincent's rent, therefore, given her age, there was no reason to suspect anything unusual had happened.

""During this period our records show MHT were not contacted by neighbours or family to raise any concerns and so we were only alerted when significant arrears built up and we tried to gain access.""

The flat is part of a complex build above a shopping complex in Wood Green. Neighbours told the Guardian newspaper whenever they knocked at the door, no-one answered, so they assumed it was unoccupied.

No family shock

Michael Dobbs, who moved in in summer 2004 said: ""I always thought it was an empty house. It's a shock to think that she had family and nobody came.

""It's also a puzzle how her electricity was not cut off because her TV was on all this time.

He told the paper it was a noisy building frequented by drug addicts, which could explain why no-one noticed the noise from the TV.

He said he had discovered someone dead, clutching a bottle of drink, in the lift weeks ago.

From Neal Knox: ""Tell Gary that we're starting to put State Farm's name up in lights, and they won't like the color.""

From Angel Shamaya: ""I can't apologize for State Farm's stupidity, shortsightedness, or extremely poor business sense, of course, but I can help chop their head off, and I shall. We'll use 'em as bait for the next ignorant company that thinks they can infringe on our God given rights.

Keep shootin', partner. Let's see how many customers we can take away..., and give 'em to the intelligent person who covered you as a responsible, lawful, peaceable gun owner, yes? Like shootin' fish in a barrel.

Thanks for telling your story. We needed another sacrifice - for the movement - and it might as well be a former good neighbor.

State Farm is going to regret this move for a very, very long time. Unless we see a formal apology, this one is going to be like getting kicked in the xxxx.

I guess some companies just gotta learn the hard way."" -Angel

Q: After reading your story regarding State Farm, I will be changing my insurance carrier tomorrow. Those people have no right, whatsoever, to dictate to us how we should be living our lives. As long as we are not breaking laws, it is no concern of theirs. -Best Regards, Amin.

A: Thank you for your support. When you mention this to your agent be ready for some bigtime backsliding. It's all likely to be postured as a big misunderstanding. There is none. Everything in the GRSC / RKBA web articles are as they happened. FACT. My range is 100% in compliance with all local, state and SCDNR regulations. It is absolutely private... not commercial. All I look for in this is a clear, written statement of State Farm policy on hunting and shooting on policy holder property. We'll let our free enterprise system take its course after that. -Gary

Q: I spoke with Renee Wilder who claims that there is another side to the story which she cannot disclose because of litigation... she apparently needs your authority to disclose the actual facts to us. She mentioned several times that State Farm does not cover commercial gun ranges, however, no specifics as your file is confidential.

She further claimed that she is pro-Gun, owns several firearms, insures her secretary who own firearms & shoots on their private property, & that State Farm has never been nor will it ever be Anti-Firearm.

I've asked my agent for State Farm's official policy on this, but he had no idea about your case or what had happened. I faxed him the article from RKBA. No reply as of yet.

I also faxed a copy of your email to Renee Wilder. No reply from her either... I doubt I will hear from her again. Good Luck to you & keep the Faith!

A: Thank you for the input. My range is NOT commercial and never has been. I did form a six-member club after threat of cancellation by SF to secure shooting liability coverage through NRA-endorsed underwriter. However this was done only AFTER after threat of cancellation from SF and because it was necessary to meet the guidelines for NRA Club Insurance. -Thanks, Gary

Q: I just read an article on a shooters forum that I frequent about your problems with State Farm. As a SF policy holder and an avid shooter/hunter, I am very interested in getting more details regarding their handling of your situation. I intend to contact my SF agent and confront them with this information. My policies are due for renewal soon and if I am not satisfied with the answers my agent can give, then I will be canceling all of them. I would also like any information on the ""gun owner friendly"" companies that you chose to move your policies too. I refuse to do business with organizations that do not support my rights as a law abiding gun owner. Keep up the good fight.

A: You will probably do all right with Allstate, Farm Bureau or American National. As for State Farm, just get your agent to give you written confirmation that you can hunt, shoot, target practice, etc. within legal constraints on your present property, or that which you might obtain, without jeopardizing your good standing with the company and their coverage of your homeowner policy. That's all I ever wanted from State Farm. Certainly a ""Good Neighbor"" shouldn't have a problem with a simple request like that. If State Farm can't grant us us that simple request, in writing, then let's see if our free enterprise system will reveal a prominent insurance carrier that can. -Best Regards, Gary J. Atkinson

Q: I host a radio program in Portland , Oregon. Can I get you on the air? How about Thurs 10/ 5 @ 2:30 Pacific or 10/6 Fri. @ 3:30 pacific? -Thanks, M

A: This is the second invite I've had this week. One is for tonight at 11:00PM. I'd be happy to talk with you on the air. I've had some practice. Friday at 3:30 Pacific would be fine. Please call me at home XXX-XXX-XXXX

Q: ""I have some more information from Mr. White of State Farm and my own agent in Texas. In summary, if my shooting range is for personal use only (for example, I do not teach self-defense classes on the range), I will be covered under my homeowner's policy. State Farm has no position either way on guns; for them, any coverage related to firearms is strictly a business decision. There is no blanket prohibition at State Farm against personal, private shooting ranges. Each individual situation is assessed on a case by case basis by the underwriting agent. In my specific case, my agent welcomes the business I bring her, including my homeowner policy for the property that has the shooting range. Out of respect for Atkinson's privacy, the specifics of his account won't be discussed by State Farm, which I understand. However, at this point I retract my intention to cancel my business with State Farm. Unless Atkinson steps forward to release more details about his situation, I cannot conclude that State Farm is against gun owners per se; perhaps the only thing he needed to do was find another State Farm agent.""

A: I don't know what more ""specifics"" anyone needs that haven't been discussed. But, will add that I personally sat in Renee Wilder's office on July 20th when we called another SF agent who is a shooter. I believe his name is Roe Young. He advised that there is NO way SF would cover a shooting range on my property. He told me and Renee that he would look into what options I might have. He never called me back. Subsequent calls to SF headquarters' Mr. Ted Loy confirmed that SF would not cover shooting ranges on policy holder property. He did say that it was handled on a case by case basis. Renee Wilder went on to say that SF precludes hunting on a policy holder's land, as well, except very occasional use. Again, nothing in writing. My supervisor called his State Farm agent in West Columbia to confirm my story, as well. The answer, absolutely no shooting range, private or otherwise, on a SF policy holder's property. PERIOD. So let's cut to the chase. Anyone got a tape measure? Bring it and yourself to Chapin for a guided tour of my place. I DID NOT get that review from anyone at SF or any such offer to the effect. -Gary

Q: My SF agent here in TX was very concerned about what happened to you. He said if you had a public range that he could understand what happened to you. I've called State Farm and no one seemed to want to talk to me about what happen and all I ever got was you need to talk to so & so and I never was able to talk to anyone. I will drop SF in the future,because of what happen to you and the way I was treated by SF representatives that I called. In other words all that I received from SF was the ""shuck and jive"". Keep their feet to the fire! -Owen, Madisonville TX

A: Brother, I really appreciate your support. Get your agent to tell you what type and volume of shooting / hunting is OK and drop me a line. -Thanks, Gary

Q: Subject: Re: Is it True? Hi Gary, Thank you for your prompt reply! I just sent this information to Game Wardens in every state and several other countries by email. Good luck and God bless you! -David, Iowa Conservation Officer

A: The information, as supplied by me and appearing at scfirearms.org is factual. Look at GrassRoots South Carolina website and click on the attachments in FAQ. No need for apology, if you shoot or hunt on your own land... this is YOUR issue. I would only ask that you stay tuned to GRSC and support our cause with as much enthusiasm as possible. Please spread this story to your hunting and shooting friends and anyone else who places a value on freedom.

Q: State Farm canceled our insurance in Pennsylvania because of guns. We had their insurance on our home and our in home business. We had a federal firearms license and the agent who issued the business liability policy in 1983 knew that. No problem. In 1995, due to a regulation in the Brady Bill that you have a letter from your local zoning board to renew your ffl, the borough tried to take that ffl away from us (partly because we were within 1000 feet of an elementary school).

Well, we won the court case. Cost us $25,000 in legal fees and we lost at least that in lost business. The ATF was nicer to us than anyone else, believe it or not... And once we won the case, State Farm canceled our insurance. We appealed it to the PA State Insurance commission, who sided with State Farm saying due to all the publicity, we were a ""risk"".... State Farm also has stopped insuring gun dealers and home businesses because of ""risk"". Somehow, I thought ""risk"" was why we were buying insurance!! Without ""risk"", we wouldn't need it! -Karen, WV

A: Karen, I deeply appreciate the time you've taken to write me. There is a growing group in SC that is winning the battles in our state, GrassRoots South Carolina. Please check their website at scfirearms.org Best Regards, -Gary

Q: Hi Gary, my name is Brad Robertson and I am a concerned gun owner who also has multiple policies underwritten by State Farm Insurance . However, I'm also concerned about BS emails and spam so before I act on this information and forward this email to others, I'd like to verify that this actually transpired the way it was written. It is for this reason that I am writing to you.

Did this actually happen as written? Who do you use for insurance coverage now? (if you don't mind me asking)

A: Go to scfirearms.org That site has the information I supplied to GrassRoots South Carolina. If you see the photo of a guy in a green chamois shirt, blue jeans and holding a GLOCK 24C, you can trust three things as follows:



1) The info is accurate

2) I'm not smiling about State Farm

3) I look better in person



Get SF to tell you their policy on SHOOTING / HUNTING.... not merely gun ownership.... and put it in writing. Let me know for sure what you get back. Thanks for your time.- Best Regards, Gary J. Atkinson

Q: Gary, My agent said that about anything that I want to do within the law and it's not a public firing range is OK. That means myself and friends can come over here to my house and sight in our rifles for Deer season, or shoot BP rifles and pistols or whatever as long as its not a public range. I've called the main offices and they tell me a different story than what I read in your web page! I'm not disbelieving you! I want something in writing also as my carrier is SF also and has been for 40 years. However I'm ready to drop the $%&#@ and find another carrier. I had a company man call me this afternoon and I got him going hard. I belong to the Special Forces List on the internet and this thing has gone to the Special Forces Assoc. also. I think they're going to be hurt badly by this incident with you. Give them Hell -Owen

A: Thanks for your support. See if you can get SF to put it in writing and drop me a line with the result. Their responses appear to be all over the map. Beware... there is a big difference between covering guns for loss of theft or fire. Get policy in writing regarding legal discharge. -Thanks, GJA

Q: What do you want from State Farm now that you have secured coverage elsewhere?

A: ""All I want is State Farm to clearly state in writing what their policy is towards legal, safe non-commercial hunting and shooting activities on policy holder property. It makes no particular difference to me whether State Farm's WRITTEN policy is pro- or con- towards our sports and the Second Amendment. That is their business decision to make. I have EVERY confidence that the shooting / hunting / gun owner populace will then choose the companies that best suit their needs based on fully informed decisions. We will simply let our free enterprise system sort this matter out in the market place.""

That's all I need unless someone else has something I'm missing. It might take them a day to put this entire matter to rest.

But, here's a little reality check to make your day, from my son, Tom, 10.

Tom learned to shoot on our range when he was five, along with other ""braves"" in his Indian Guide tribe. Tom and his 9-year old brother, Yates, love to shoot. But, Tom has a lot on his plate these days. He has a healthy concern with earning straight-A's. This fall he is sharing the quarterback duties of his 3-0 football team. They are facing another 3-0 team from Irmo, tonight. Tom also is wrestling with how to address one of his fifth grade classmates next week. Seems that boy's dad killed himself and estranged wife in a murder / suicide last weekend.

From my phone conversations, Tom is also puzzled about what State Farm has done. Last night, he asked me why they don't like our ""rifle range?"" I said State Farm thinks it's dangerous. A puzzled look.

Tom asked, ""Dad, are we were going to loose the rifle range?"" I said, ""Tom, is it important to you that we keep the rifle range?"" ""Yes, Dad, we HAVE to keep it!"" ""OK, Tom, then don't worry. We won't loose the rifle range.""

So there it is, gentlemen. That's what we're working for. Thanks for your support. -Best Regards, Gary J. Atkinson

Now let's post some remarks GrassRoots has received and our responses Note color changes for change in person speaking:

From a State Farm Agent:

Just so all State Farm Agents don't get painted with the same brush, you need to know that I, for one, have a SC Concealed Weapons Permit, as does my wife, my son, my daughter and her husband, AND, I'm a member of Grassroots, HOWEVER, the title of your article is misleading, as are the conclusions you draw, and you need to clear the air.

Gun ownership and discharging fire arms in a populated area are two quite different issues. There is an ordinance on the Richland County books which requires that any shooting be at least 100 yards from the closest residence. Is that the case in this situation?

More to the point, your article and it's title seem to suggest that gun ownership is an issue with State Farm. I have been with State Farm for 33 years and NEVER has gun ownership been a factor in determining if an individual qualifies for State Farm Insurance. Whether or not you own firearms simply has nothing to do with being insured by State Farm. In fact, State Farm has a variety of low-cost options whereby a gun owner can adequately insure his guns--hardly something an anti-gun insurance company would do.

Grassroots has already done much good, and can do much more, but frothing at the mouth and making unfounded statements that are inflammatory at best, and outright lies at worst simply do not help our cause. Are there issues involved in this case? You bet. But gun ownership is not one of them!

Again, the title of your article is flat out untrue, and the conclusions it tries draw are misleading and a manipulation of the facts. At a minimum, you need to print my response and then you need to get the facts by getting up with someone in State Farm Management to find out what really happened in this case. I suspect you will find that reality is more than the fiction that you just printed.

Incidentally, if Grassroots is going to be as dishonest and misleading in our pro-gun efforts as are our anti-gun fanatics, then I will need to look for another organization.

GrassRoots Response:

I'll pass this on to leadership. Perhaps the title should read: State Farm Dumps Gun Owner in South Carolina for Shooting on Rural Property

As for ordinances. Gary checked. He was in compliance will all ordinances. His activity was completely legal and allowable on his property.

The article was not intended to harm State Farm agents at all. We understand that agents are not the issue here. This is apparently a State Farm policy. Can you provide us with more info from State Farm regarding the issue of shooting on property on which they carry the coverage?

Gary has said nothing but good things about his agent. He is not upset with her. He is upset with State Farm Policy and wants everyone to be aware of this policy. His primary interest is preventing this type of exclusion from becoming the ""standard"" for insurance companies.

Again, the point of this article is not to malign State Farm Agents.

I am willing to take a suggestion from you for the appropriate title of the piece. Thanks,

State Farm:

Without being too repetitive, I want to point again that this issue is not about gun ownership and I think your article should have so stated. Our membership--many of who are insured with State Farm, some of whom may by my clients--should not be confused by thinking that their insurance company has taken sides on the gun ownership/control issue. That simply is not the case.

GrassRoots:

I can attempt to make changes to the article to reflect that we are not upset or attacking agents nor are we referring to anything other than the activity of shooting on one's property.

Your logic is what we repeatedly hear from Merchants that post against Concealed Carry. They say they are not anti-gun, frequently say they own guns, hunt, shoot, and may have a CWP. However they post against CWP because the law allows them that privilege. Basically our position is to acknowledge that they are right on all points - however our membership wants to know about businesses that take their position.

State Farm:

Without speaking for State Farm, but only as an insurance agent, I can understand what has happened in this situation. If I were your insurance agent and came to your house and saw a broken front step, I would ask that you repair it. There is certainly nothing illegal with your having a broken step. It is your right as a homeowner to either repair that step or not. No one, not the local or even the federal government is going to make you repair it. BUT, your insurance company, any insurance company, will ultimately cancel your insurance if you don't fix it. Why? Simply speaking, you have a substantially increased risk of loss over folks with homes just like yours where the steps are in good repair.

GrassRoots:

I agree with all you say. I am sure every insured has an inherent degree of risk even with steps in good repair. State Farm has decided it doesn't want to insure a property where a personal range is located, shooting takes place, or hunting. Okay, fine. Maybe a great idea from a risk standpoint. Shouldn't our membership know that? Shouldn't they be given this information and the option to take their coverage to an insurance company that IS willing to insure the activity they enjoy on their property. I am not angry with State Farm - it just seems they don't want to insure properties that involve shooting activities. This definitely IS relevant and something members of an organization such as ours would want to know about.

State Farm:

Does having an unlicensed shooting range on a piece of property in a highly populated area increase the risk of loss? Yep, absolutely. Is it legal? Just like the step, it is (if it's over 300 feet from the nearest residence it is in Richland County. And, by the way, good journalism would dictate that YOU measure the distance before writing the article).Will any insurance company cancel your insurance for any substantial increase in potential liability loss? Yep, absolutely. And, it is in your best interest, as it is in mine as a homeowner to support this stance since our rates depend upon losses which are paid.

GrassRoots:

Reread the article. Contact Gary. Gary agreed to give 100% exclusion to SF for the property in question. As for your ""if"" situations above, I am not an insurance agent and I do not have a trained eye to look at what they are looking for. I could spend hours looking and measuring Gary's property and still a trained eye like yours would ask yet another question of me. Perhaps Renee or State Farm can give us a more detailed answer why his policy was canceled. I would look forward to publishing their statements. Then we could revise and say State Farm doesn't want to insure policyholders what meet such-and_such criteria. I have contacted State Farm and have not received a response to the article one way or the other. Can you help?

State Farm:

If I were a betting man, I would be willing to bet a fair sum that the COMPANY who now insures this individual does not know of the existence of the shooting range. The agent may know, but without a doubt any major, responsible company simply will not be willing to accept this substantial increase in exposure.

GrassRoots:

Reread the article. Gary has gladly given out the name of the company that holds his insurance. He has advised me that this was his first question to alternate companies after State Farm gave him 7 days to find alternative coverage. Also, Gary now has coverage specifically for the range in the amount of 1,000,000 through NRA referred insurance company. Yes, they know they are insuring a range.

State Farm:

Here's the major point. If a stray shot hits and injures someone else on their own property, the fact that this individual who has done nothing illegal and was simply plinking away as he has many, many times before will probably loose everything he has--the insurance company will certainly loose the limits of the liability, and whether or not he had the ""right"" has absolutely nothing to do with it.

GrassRoots:

You are correct. No argument here. Don't you think GrassRoots members that have State Farm should know that State Farm would rather not be their carrier if they are shooting on their property? Doesn't State Farm want these types of risky folks off their policyholder list?

State Farm:

So, if you were the insurance company and you know all of this, would you continue to accept the exposure?

GrassRoots:

If I was the insurance company I would insure anyone and everyone based on financial actuarial risks. If there is increased risk then your premium increases such that it matches the risk involved. Isn't this what insurance companies do?

State Farm:

Like I said in the beginning, it has nothing to do with gun ownership. And it really doesn't have anything to do with whether or not shooting a gun on your own property is legal or not.

GrassRoots:

It has a lot to do with gun ownership if you want to exercise shooting your gun on your property. If you just like to look at them and clean them on your property you'd be correct.

I agree it has nothing to do with legalities. It is solely a decision of State Farm.

State Farm:

Finally, just for perspective: insurance companies require that swimming pools be fenced, will not allow homeowners to own trampolines, refuse to let you keep junked cars on your property, require that you remove discarded refrigerators, and regularly inspect homes to be sure that--horror of horrors--your home is maintained and kept in good order--none of which is required by law, or written into your policy. You can also keep a bad dog--its perfectly legal--but just as soon as your insurance company--any company--finds out, they will cancel your policy. I'm glad that they do, and so are you, but you just have never thought about it, because if the companies were not about reducing their exposure, which means that they often must ""infringe on your rights as a homeowner,"" all of our rates would substantially higher than they are now. Any insurance company is required to do all it can to limit exposure. The states require it, the stockholders require it, and good business requires it.

GrassRoots:

Yes, you are correct. I don't argue this point. State Farm has decided it doesn't want to cover certain activity it considers risky. Okay. Both our membership as well as State Farm should be happy we are getting the word out.

State Farm:

If you would like to talk more about this, give me a call at x-xxx-xxx-xxxx.

GrassRoots:

I'm late with the newsletter. Please feel free to call Ed Kelleher. I'll cc: him on this as well as your last correspondence. His number is your newsletter.

State Farm:

A good title for your article might be: State Farm Continues Try to Keep Homeowner Rates Affordable and Cancels Gunowner Who Has Unlicensed Shooting Range. That's a lot more truthful than first title.

GrassRoots:

How about ""State Farm Cancels Gunowner Who Has Shooting Range."" Gary was not given the option of paying more so keeping rates affordable doesn't apply - he would have paid more - money wasn't an issue here. As for ""Unlicensed"" there is no such thing as a ""Licensed Range"" so how can there be an ""Unlicensed Range?"" Gary's range was covered under the current Range Protection Law in South Carolina so as far as it goes towards some sort of ""licensing"" he was in compliance with current standards as set forth.

State Farm:

""State Farm Cancels Homeowner Who Has Gun Range"" is a truthful title.

By the way, I would be writing you if the same article had been written about Allstate, Nationwide, Farm Bureau, etc.

Not to be flip with you, but what part of 100 yards is hard to understand. The article states that the range is in compliance with all laws. Do you know that fact, or have you just accepted the word of the homeowner? There is nothing else necessary to be in compliance with the law--EXCEPT that if it is open to the public as the homeowner has stated that it is, there is a WHOLE BUNCH else.

GrassRoots:

Gary has stated that this is NOT open to the public and is not a commercial range. If he is violation of the law he show be arrested and charged accordingly. Since he has not I would not put the cart before the horse and find him guilty beforehand.

State Farm:

Hey, I'm trying to help our organization here. The shooting range is no different from the trampoline and we are going to look pretty silly when you do find out that all insurance companies manage risks and a gun range, a swimming pool and a bad dog are all the same to them. Take time and do the homework. This homeowner gets canceled by every major insurance company in America. But it's not a vendetta against gun ownership.

GrassRoots:

I agree. I'm not trying to make it out as such. State Farm simply does not want to insure this particular risk. Okay, fine. Gun owners should know. State Farm should be happy as mud pies that we are separating the wheat from what they consider the chaff. If State farm has 1,000 gun owners come forward and say, ""Hey this applies to me"" then our article has saved State Farm a bunch of money and headache since they don't want to be involved in these types of risks.

State Farm:

Now, if there are insurance companies who openly advertise that's it is OK to conduct public shooting on your home property, then, by all means we need to let our members know. I'll still bet that the insurance company doesn't know all of the details.

GrassRoots:

The Insurance Company that Gary signed on with within the few days following notice of intent to cancel was Insurance Specifically for Ranges. Gary said he had to jump a few hurtles to qualify the range according to the group range insurance plan in accordance with NRA but that once done the Insurance was written like all the other Range Insurance plans. I am a member of Mid-Carolina Rifle Club. MCRC has similar coverage in the amount of 2,000,000. This isn't strange, just straightforward actuarial coverage for a given risk known, no doubt, to insurance companies. Call the NRA and ask about Range Insurance. They will direct you to the Insurance carrier.

I have the option of obtaining similar insurance coverage specifically for Firearms Instructors and the inherent risks associated. It's easy, call the NRA training department and get the number. Call the carrier and tell them you want Firearms Instructor coverage and off you go.

Insuring ranges, instructors, etc. isn't objectionable to all insurance companies.

Thanks,

Now for some general comments received...

My father has been a State Farm Agent for 35 years. Like many large companies, his company has seen many changes over the years. Most old agents talk about the ""old days."" It's not just State Farm, many large companies have seen significant changes over the past decade.

I've always thought of State Farm as the people's insurance company. I have very strong doubts that that particular agent was acting within company guidelines. I think the problem was with the AGENT, not the company. The fact that she even came out there to see where you practiced is HIGHLY unusual and shows how obsessed she is with your gun ownership. My dad wouldn't have done that in a hundred years! My father and I both own guns. I further feel that there are STRONG grounds for a discrimination lawsuit. The silliness must be stopped. Law abiding citizens must not be persecuted.

Lately our society has been changing quite a bit; rather notably as a culture intolerant of guns. Clinton's insane propaganda has done wonders depict any possible gun related incidents as fuel for his anti-gun rhetoric and to criminalize responsible gun owners. He even went on national television and claimed the Oklahoma City bombing as a reason for tighter gun control when the place was blown up with fertilizer! THERE WERE NO GUNS INVOLVED! Hillary Clinton began her nationally televised unveiling of her proposed healthcare reform policy with a case against handguns. It was the first thing out of her mouth, as if handguns were the number one problem with healthcare. The whole rest of her healthcare plan took a backseat! Does any one remember that!?? Wake up America!

Your former insurance agent should cough up the any print that prohibits gun use/ownership or find a different occupation. No one must EVER criminalize or discriminate against responsible gun ownership for lack of a more creative solution to crime and violence. Please contact me if I can be of any service. I'd love to see this resolved.

More...

Gary, I am sorry you were treated so badly by State Farm, hopefully your story will be forwarded to all the gun rights organizations and we can make it hot for them. I also have State Farm here in NC. I read that you had a list of ""gun friendly"" insurance companies. If you get a chance I wouldn't mind a copy. I will be changing insurance companies just as soon as I find a reasonable alternative and after I write State Farm and talk with my local agent. -Ken, Shelby N.C.

State Farm's Response to an inquiry from South Carolina Policyholder...

Dear Carol:



It is State Farm's policy not to discuss individual policyholder situations unless they have given us permission in writing to do so. State Farm Insurance has no political stance on the gun issue. We do not take issue with a person's right to own guns. We do offer insurance on guns.

State Farm is in the business of selling insurance to protect people against the risks of everyday life. We are the nation's leading homeowners insurer because we strive to provide the best mix of coverage, service and price. In order to provide a competitive product, we have to carefully consider all risks we are undertaking when we choose to provide coverage. We recognize there are some cases that provide exposures that fall outside of typical homeownership. Liability for these cases cannot affordably be included in the cost of homeowners insurance.



Thank you for your inquiry.



Sincerely,

Jairon L. Wills

State Farm Corporate Customer Service Supervisor



GrassRoots:

Maybe someone needs to tell State Farm it's about more than gun ownership unless you just like to hold them, clean them, and watch them collect dust! Personally I like to SHOOT THEM! Too bad State Farm draws the line at actually shooting them!

State Farm:

From our friends in Illinois:

CCRA contacted State Farm Insurance and was referred to the Executive offices to speak with Dan Hadaway, a company spokesman (309 766-6674). Hadaway tried diligently to return a voice mail message and when contacted he clarified ""the other side of the story,"" so to speak.

Hadaway said, ""State Farm doesn't really care what you do on your private property, as long as it's legal and doesn't increase the risk of a loss."" Recreational shooting on your property, by yourself, or with friends and guests is just fine and is not at all considered to increase the risk of a loss.

Hadaway said the Atkinson cancellation was based upon the policyholder (Atkinson) forming a ""formal"" gun club, complete with dues paying memberships there on his property. ""All kinds of people were out there,"" the State Farm representative said, including police departments doing training, neighborhood groups and others. Apparently Atkinson was very liberal about who used the range.

Homeowners insurance was never meant as gun club insurance, Hadaway said. For this reason, the policy was terminated.

GrassRoots:

Thanks, Looks like the State Farm people are all over the place again. If one excuse doesn't work then let's try another. Of course maligning the victim always works for... should I say it? Geez! Ask Mr. Hadaway for a written statement from SF on paragraph two above and we'll be getting somewhere. Just call him back and say, ""Hey, I'm having some friends over this weekend for a dove shoot out back. Can you fax me a statement or copy of my coverage that covers me?"" I'll hold my breath.

Mr. Hadaway, you're either 1) Not telling the truth OR 2) In Violation of Customer Confidentiality Guidelines. Neither is a good position.

I'll not ask you to fax me Gary's specifics because I know you wouldn't ever risk your job on violation of customer confidentiality. But I will ask you to start coming clean with gun owners. Let's start by seeing how long it takes you to fax GrassRoots a written statement that says State Farm policy holders are covered if they choose to have a few friends over this weekend for some plinking on the back forty. Do that and I'll put it up here immediately and eat crow for all to see! My fax number is 803-755-1201. I'm holding my breath!

WANTED!

Any State Farm Employee to Fax GrassRoots a Copy of any internal policy, internal memo, or other documentation indicating State Farm discriminates against lawful use of firearms on policyholder's property.

Fax to: 803-755-1201

Your identity may remain anonymous at your discretion.

Gary may be contacted for further information including the termination letter from State Farm (with reason sited) as well as a detailed events write-up describing how State Farm handled this case start to finish. There's no hidden agenda here. Gary's letter of cancellation is available for concerned policyholders who believe they may also be at risk for non-coverage by State Farm. Gary's range was a private range, not commercial, and not open to the public. Gary was in compliance with all local, county, and state laws regarding shooting ranges and the use of his property.

BREAKING : Pepsi STOCK Plummets After CEO Tells Trump Supporters to “Take Their Business Elsewhere”

Pepsi should have taken a look at Macy’s and what happened to them after they irrationally attacked Trump and his supporters.However, they’re ignoring Macy’s plight and attacking Trump supporters and telling us to “Take our business elsewhere.”

However, Pepsico is ignoring Macy’s plight and attacking Trump supporters and telling us to “Take our business elsewhere.”

Well, ok then…..

PepsiCo’s CEO said the election of Donald Trump as president was terrifying her employees. “I had to answer a lot of questions from my daughters, from our employees. They were all in mourning,” PepsiCo CEO Indra Nooyi told Andrew Ross Sorkin at The New York Times’ DealBook conference on Thursday. “Our employees were all crying,” she said. “And the question that they’re asking, especially those who are not white, ‘Are we safe?’ Women are asking, ‘Are we safe?’ LGBT people are asking, ‘Are we safe?’ I never thought I would have to answer those questions.” 

These people are low-info idiots.

We are calling on ALL TRUMP supporters to BOYCOTT Pepsi and all of their products.

These are the products we’re asking you to stop buying:

The 5 simple ways to help end the stigma around mental illness

Together, we can all help end the stigma around mental illness with the 5 simple ways developed by Dr. Heather Stuart, the Bell Mental Health and Anti-Stigma Research Chair at Queen’s University:

Language matters – pay attention to the words you use about mental illness

Educate yourself – learn, know and talk more, understand the signs

Be kind – small acts of kindness speak a lot

Listen and ask – sometimes it’s best to just listen

Talk about it – start a dialogue, break the silence

WASHINGTON — Congressional Democrats blasted President Donald Trump on Friday night for circumventing Congress in authorizing U.S. strikes against Syria, calling it ""unconstitutional"" and questioning the strategy.

Many Republicans, on the other hand, applauded the president's move.

Sen. Tim Kaine, D-Va., who has pushed Congress to pass a new authorization for the use of military force, deemed the president's action ""illegal"" because he proceeded without approval from lawmakers.

""President Trump's decision to launch airstrikes against the Syrian government without Congress's approval is illegal and — absent a broader strategy — it's reckless,” Kaine, the 2016 Democratic vice presidential nominee, said in a statement. ""Today, it's a strike on Syria — what's going to stop him from bombing Iran or North Korea next? The last thing Congress should be doing is giving this president a blank check to wage war against anyone, anywhere.""

House Minority Leader Nancy Pelosi, D-Calif., said in a statement that the Syrian regime's chemical weapons attack was a ""brutally inhumane war crime that demands a strong, smart and calculated response."" However, she said Trump must present a more comprehensive strategy on Syria to Congress and seek lawmakers' approval.

Rep. Eric Swalwell, D-Calif., tweeted that it was the same as when Trump struck Syria last year without congressional approval.

""What changed? Zero,"" Swalwell tweeted. ""They're still using chemical weapons. This is the result of a failure to have a strategy and engage Middle East countries to solve this problem.""

Senate Minority Leader Chuck Schumer, D-N.Y., said, ""A pinpointed, limited action to punish and hopefully deter Assad from doing this again is appropriate, but the administration has to be careful about not getting us into a greater and more involved war in Syria.""

The president announced in an address to the nation from the White House that U.S. airstrikes, in tandem with the United Kingdom and France, were underway in Syria, in response to an alleged chemical attack near Damascus last weekend.

At a later Pentagon briefing, Defense Secretary James Mattis said that the president had the authority to launch the strikes under Article II of the Constitution because Mattis said Trump was defending U.S. interests.

Key Republicans on Capitol Hill said Friday night that they supported Trump's decision.

""The United States has taken decisive action in coordination with our allies,"" said Speaker Paul Ryan, R-Wis., who said at his weekly news conference Thursday that he believed that Trump had authority to act against Syria with any new congressional approval. ""We are united in our resolve that Assad's barbaric use of chemical weapons cannot go unanswered. His regime's unconscionable brutality against innocent civilians cannot be tolerated.""

Senate Majority Leader Mitch McConnell, R-Ky., said he supports ""both the action and the objective.""

""I applaud the president for taking military action against the Assad regime for its latest use of chemical weapons, and for signaling his resolve to do so again if these heinous attacks continue,"" said Sen. John McCain, R-Ariz., chairman of the Senate Armed Services Committee.

Of note was Sen. Bill Nelson, D-Fla., who faces a tough re-election fight against Florida's Republican Gov. Rick Scott, and who backed Trump's response to Syria, tweeting, “I support the attack because Assad must be held accountable for the use of chemical weapons."""

The day after the Sept. 11 terrorist attacks, Steve Buscemi, who worked as a firefighter from 1980-1984, showed up at his old fire station, Engine Company No. 55 in the Little Italy section of New York. For the next week he worked 12-hour shifts, digging through the rubble trying to find the bodies of missing firefighters, all the while refusing to do interviews or have his picture taken. ""It was a privilege to be able to do it,"" the 45-year-old actor said. ""It was great to connect with the firehouse I used to work with and with some of the guys I worked alongside. And it was enormously helpful for me because while I was working, I didn't really think about it as much, feel it as much. ""It wasn't until I stopped that I really felt the full impact of what had happened. It would have been much harder for me to get through it if I hadn't been able to do that.""























Steve Buscemi might have been a senior firefighter by now - if only he had stuck with it. He's still in touch with friends at the New York Fire Department, and went back there for a medal ceremony only recently in honour of a lieutenant who took part in a rescue last year. But Steve Buscemi played his part with ""the bravest"", as America's firemen are known, from 1980 - 1984 and moved on. Yet, he continues to support his firefighter brothers whenever they are in need. Doomed Fire Heroes' Rig Unburied at Ground Zero By ANGELINA CAPPIELLO and WILLIAM NEUMAN

Courtesy of The New York Post Recovery crews combing through debris from the north tower at Ground Zero found a firetruck yesterday - buried some 40 below street level. ""I just think it's ironic that it's appearing now [six months after Sept. 11],"" said Robin Freund, whose husband, Peter, a lieutenant, was one of five men killed from Engine Co. 55 in Little Italy. She said members of her husband's company had been out to Fresh Kills landfill in Staten Island to look for the company's missing truck - little suspecting it was still buried deep within the wreckage at Ground Zero. The members of Engine 55 parked the truck next to the north tower before rushing in to help rescue the people inside - and when the building collapsed it apparently sucked the empty truck down with it. ""They were one of the first two companies there. That's probably why [the truck was buried so deep],"" said Freund, who is raising the couple's four children. She said her husband's colleagues called her after going to Ground Zero to look at the buried truck and told her it was ""unrecognizable."" But they did manage to remove a door and take it back to the firehouse, where they included it in a memorial to Lt. Freund, 46, and the others who perished with him, firefighters Faustino Apostol, 56, Stephen Russell, 38, Robert Lane, 30, and Christopher Mozzillo, 28. The bodies of all but Mozzillo have been recovered from the rubble. ""We're very happy we found the rig, we just hope we can find our last man,"" said firefighter Rich Cipoletti, at the firehouse. ""We hope we can bring him back home."" Firefighter Paul Acciarito said of the find, ""I'm ecstatic. It's almost like she was waiting for us to find her."" He said having a piece of the truck in the firehouse ""brings back the horrible memories of that day but I'm glad its back. A part of our heart came back."" Songs of Freedom/Tears of Remembrance The following is an excerpt from a five-part journal detailing one man's crusade to bring healing to a New York firehouse after Sept. 11, and in doing so, heal himself. Barrington stockbroker Joe Cantafio is on a year-long concert tour to raise money for the widows and bereaved families of Engine Company 55, who lost five men at the World Trade Center on Sept. 11. In July 2002, Cantafio went to New York City to spend a week with Engine 55 and raise money with several club appearances. Daily Herald staff writer Jim Fuller and photographer Mark Welsh went along. They stayed in the firehouse in Little Italy, sleeping and eating alongside the men of Engine 55. Fuller kept a journal of that extraordinary week. In part one, they arrive in New York, meet the firefighters and see ground zero for the first time. At night, it's show time. Joe plays his first show at an Irish tavern called ""Molly Wee,"" where many of the Chicago rescue crews would go for a break after digging. It's not a neighborhood bar. Salt and pepper shakers sit on the tables and the waiters wear shirts and ties. Waiting inside is a face from Engine 55's past. Steve Buscemi was with Engine 55 before Hollywood came calling. His face is recognizable to millions, but tonight he's just a firefighter again. At one point he blends in so well that a woman asks him to watch the men's room door for her while she goes in to use the facilities instead of the crowded ladies room. He's not dressed for the red carpet tonight with black pants and a short-sleeve, deep-orange, button-up shirt. But tonight, class has no position. Some Budweiser reps show up in their suits and ties, but they mix right in with the jean shorts and sandals and start buying beer for everyone. Buscemi put on his gear and dug at ground zero with the rest of them. Tonight, he sings almost every song from ""We Won't Get Fooled Again"" to ""Born to Run."" There are smiles again. As they sing, footage of Sept. 11 plays on MSNBC during a story about the attacks. The firefighters don't see it - the television is over their heads. It is an odd mix of tragedy and recovery. Joe does a four-hour set, without a break, finally wrapping up close to 1 a.m. Buscemi walks over to Joe and hugs him at the end. ""I didn't get it before, but now I do. This is a great thing you're doing for New York."" Firefighters: Show Us The Money By William Murphy, Vera Haller and Mike October 11, 2002 A relentless rain did little to dampen the mood of thousands of firefighters rallying for higher wages in Central Park Friday, their anger stoked by a profanity-laced speech from bad-boy comedian Denis Leary. “Take the 11 percent and stick it ... , Mr. Mayor,” Leary said, delighting the soaked crowd. “I’m tired of presidents, governors, senators, politicians, getting your pictures taken at —— wakes and funerals. Actions speak louder than words, ” he said. The firefighters union Thursday rejected of a contract offering an 11.5 percent raise over 30 months. The union’s executive board had approved the agreement in August of last year — before the World Trade Center attack the following month that left 343 members of the fire service dead. Leary, who lost his cousin, firefighter Jerry Lucey, in a warehouse fire in Worcester, Mass., in 1999, said the public did not understand how underpaid firefighters were. “These guys shouldn’t have to worry about second and third jobs and their kids’ tuition, and they should be able to see their kids,” Leary said. The rally was a prelude to Saturday’s memorial service for fallen firefighters at Madison Square Garden, expected to draw emergency workers from around the nation. While the East Meadow was a sea of umbrellas and rain slickers, the rally clearly fell short of the turnout expected by the Uniformed Firefighters Association. “This is just a little water,” said the Stephen Cassidy, president of the union. “We’ve been through much more. Let’s get a raise.” Many of the protesters carried placards, including one that read “I’m a New York City firefighter. I can’t afford an umbrella.” Another sign read, “A million thanks won’t pay a mortgage.” Speakers included politicians, widows and celebrities. Actor Steve Buscemi, who once worked at Engine 55 in Manhattan, got a particularly warm welcome. “We could never thank you enough,” Buscemi yelled to the crowd from a podium inside the park at 98th and Fifth Avenue. “We can never pay you enough.” Firefighters, who after five years on the job make about $59,000 annually including overtime and some benefits, said they just wanted to be compensated fairly. “I’m out here because we need a raise,” said Frank Doherty of Ladder Company 162 in Queens. “The city always has excuses why not to give us one. We’re out here to tell them the excuses are over.” Marian Fontana, the widow of firefighter David Fontana and president of the Sept. 11 Widow and Victims Family Association, told the crowd how she and her husband struggled to survive on a firefighter’s salary. She drew rousing applause when she called New York City’s firefighters “the underpaid soldiers on the front line” in the war against terrorism. The city’s deepening fiscal crisis — which has even included talk of possibly closing select fire companies — may make any resolution tough to come by. Cassidy said he would reopen talks with the city, but a spokesman for Mayor Michael Bloomberg held out little hope that anything would change. “We will continue to negotiate in good faith, but the city’s fiscal crisis really limits what we can afford,” mayoral spokesman Jerry Russo said Friday. Copyright © 2003, Newsday, Inc. Excerpt from Salon.com Interview You were once a fireman in Manhattan. Were you also acting during that time? I was a fireman for four years, from 1980 to '84. My first year on the job, I didn't do any acting, even though I had gone to school for acting and had done some stand-up comedy before I took the job. But after I had been on the job for about a year, I started going back to acting classes. It was around that time that I met Mark Boone and we started doing our own work. And then I started working with the theater group Willem Dafoe was with. I was constantly doing theater, and the first couple of films I did, I was still with the fire department -- Engine 55, in Little Italy. I was in the engine company, which means we were responsible for getting in there with the hose and putting out the fire. Were there any situations that were particularly hairy? Well, they're all frightening. Any time you go into a burning building, there's the potential for disaster. I never had any real close calls, though there's no such thing as a routine fire. Why did you become a firefighter? My dad had encouraged me to take the civil service test when I was 18. So I did, and I kind of forgot about it until my name came up on the list four years later. By then I was living in Manhattan, working as a furniture mover during the day, doing stand-up comedy at night and looking for a change. I liked the job -- the guys I worked with and the nature of the work. I think I would have been happy doing it if I hadn't had a greater passion for acting.

The NFL may refuse to listen when Donald Trump says that until players stop disrespecting our national anthem, our veterans, and our flag, team owners should fire people, but Fox Sports is helping him send the message.

Pointing out that “NFL attendance and ratings are WAY DOWN” because Americans “love our country” and have been avoiding them ever since Colin Kaepernick and his friends have been kneeling during the National Anthem, Trump suggested Americans as a whole boycott games.

If NFL fans refuse to go to games until players stop disrespecting our Flag & Country, you will see change take place fast. Fire or suspend! — Donald J. Trump (@realDonaldTrump) September 24, 2017

Fox Sports took things a step farther Sunday morning with a bombshell announcement that until players either stop disrespecting our country or are fired to do so, they will not be airing any games.

“President Trump is right that this has gone on for far too long,” Fox Sports spokeswoman Holly McGee told Fox And Friends Sunday. “We are standing with him and refusing to air the games until the 12 teams who have attacked the President apologize and players who disrespect our nation are punished.”

“I have to ask, what are we kneeling for at this point?” host Brian Kilmeade said later in the segment . “Because you talk about social injustice, this is the least sexist, least racist, most free, most equal, most prosperous country in the history of humankind.”

NFL fans would be wise to call their favorite teams and urge them to get rid of players who hate our country.

https://www.snopes.com/fact-check/hockey-pucks-shooting-defense/	students and faculty at oakland university were given hockey pucks to use in the event of a mass shooting attack.	true	['']	2018/11/28	Arturo Garcia	['https://www.oakland.edu/giving/ways-to-give/individual-giving/', 'https://www.freep.com/story/news/local/michigan/oakland/2018/11/27/oakland-university-hockey-pucks/2129677002/']	https://www.freep.com/story/news/local/michigan/oakland/2018/11/27/oakland-university-hockey-pucks/2129677002/	https://www.freep.com/	"Oakland University using hockey pucks to protect against active shooters

To prepare for an active shooter, faculty and students at Oakland University are arming themselves — with hockey pucks.

The idea of using the quirky self-defense tool grew out of a training session Police Chief Mark Gordon led in March for faculty members on what they should do if a gunman enters their classroom.

A participant asked what people could bring to campus to be better prepared in case they need to fight back. The university has a no-weapons policy.

Gordon's advice? Be ready to throw something — anything — that could distract a shooter, even a hockey puck, as a last resort if fleeing or hiding aren't an option.

""It was just kind of a spur-of-the-moment idea that seemed to have some merit to it and it kind of caught on,"" Gordon said.

Following up on the suggestion, Tom Discenna, a professor of communication and president of the faculty union, spearheaded an effort by the union to purchase 2,500, 94-cent hockey pucks — 800 for union members and another 1,700 for students. Distribution of the pucks on campus began earlier this month.

""It’s just the idea of having something, a reminder that you’re not powerless and you’re not helpless in the classroom,"" Discenna said.

The little black discs have a dual purpose: They are also part of a campaign to raise funds to install interior locks on classroom doors. Some doors are only lockable from the hallway.

The pucks are imprinted with a number that people can enter on the university's website to donate money toward the new locks.

""We know locking the classroom, in and of itself, is a big deterrent"" to a shooter being able to enter the room, Gordon said.

The American Association of University Professors union has donated $5,000 toward new inside locks for the 37 classrooms in South Foundation Hall. The student government, Oakland University Student Congress, has made a donation in the same amount for new locks in an as-yet-to-be-determined building.

The student congress also recently ordered 1,000 hockey pucks that it intends to distribute to students.

Gordon said the 2007 shootings at Virginia Tech inspired Oakland University's efforts to help students, faculty and staff prepare for a possible active shooter and how to defend themselves. At Virginia Tech, a 23-year-old student went on a shooting spree that left 32 people dead before he killed himself.

Gordon said his experience as a youth hockey coach — he once got hit in the head with a puck — gave him the idea that pucks could be a possible self-defense tool.

He said there are no studies or research on using pucks in active shooter situations. They are simply part of a defense posture, he said, such as throwing a stapler, a laptop, ""or anything that has weight"" and could hurt and distract a shooter so he or she could be disarmed.

“Anything that you can throw that’s heavy and will cause damage, cause injury is the bottom line of what you’re trying to do,"" he said. ""(A hockey puck) was just a thing that was suggested that could possibly work, especially when you have 20 or 30 people in a classroom and they all throw hockey pucks at the same time, it would be quite the distraction.""

Gordon stressed that the university's active shooter training sessions, which are held several times a year, focus on fleeing first and then, if that's not possible, hiding. Fighting back by throwing a hockey puck or through other means should be ""an absolute last strategy.""

Student body vice-president Brittany Kleinschmidt, a junior, said the pucks are raising awareness about the need for the new door locks and generating a lot of buzz on campus.

""It gets people talking,"" she said.

The stunning announcement came after Malia was caught in a Boston hotel lounge vaping marijuana with friends. Harvard has a strict no drug policy. Massachusetts is one of the states that now allows for recreational marijuana and the hotel is “weed friendly,” but that doesn’t change the fact that she broke the rules.

Malia’s lawyer has pointed out that the school has turned the other way on the marijuana issue when their entire rowing team, made up of 14 white males, was caught selling and smoking marijuana cigarettes during the offseason. Chancellor Little remarked that the difference was that the members of the rowing team are hard-working, established students whose parents are paying cash for their education while Malia hasn’t attended yet, isn’t planning on playing a sport and is going to the school on a combination of a scholarship from the Clinton Foundation and taxpayer-funded grants.

""I also had 36 Posts on my video 10 minutes before it was posted...Long before the Employees began showing up to work the FBI was busting down doors and seizing computers.Accompanying these FBI Agents was Dr William Thompson - who is a CDC Whistle Blower.The raid was ordered by the President and was led by Sally Yates - Acting Attorney General and part of the King and Spalding Law Group, which was also working with President Trump’s huge law firm: “Jones Day.”All of the records for the Vaccines - what is in them, what they have done to people across the globe - it is all being seized as you read this.As soon as President Obama took office he granted both the CDC and Monsanto protection in their massive use of GMO Foods and Vaccines to kill people world wide. That protection is now gone. The employees involved in murder and disabling people world wide have two choices: Become a whistle blower or face 20 years to life in prison.There is no place you can hide on this planet or in this planet.So what is in Vaccines that make them so deadly???Of the 202 children we have worked with 2 were autistic due to Vaccines given to the Mothers while she was in the military. The other 200 became autistic the day they were vaccinated and all have Indigo Aura.All of the Autistic Children had, after the vaccinations: High levels of Mercury, Uranium, Nangalese (Destroys Nerve Cells), Malaria, Relapsing Fever (Mostly Lyme Disease), and a host of other diseases like Babesiosois, Erhlichiosis, etc.Those with Chrystaline Aura’s were killed outright. This author has a Chrystaline Aura.So this morning President Trump ordered a raid on the CDC Headquarters in Atlanta and the Intelligence Office below the CDC Headquarters.The penalty for purposely murdering and crippling American’s is covered in USC 18 and is 20 years in jail to death.The arrests begin today - the Tribunals (Trials) of these “Paid Terrorists” will begin in late March. They may be televised or they may be very quiet.So now what do you do if your child was made autistic.First - Realize moms that YOU did not do this to your child. Autism is not genetic, period. They were made Autistic by some really sick people who need to be thrown in jail for life.Second - Go to You Tube and watch the video THE CURE FOR AUTISMThird: Most likely you were never given a Vaccine Information Sheet when your child was vaccinated. This gives you grounds for a Law Suit. Against the company that gave your child the vaccination. Unfortunately you are fighting the Vaccine Companies and they are notorious for paying off judges and witnesses.Fourth - Seek the truth - this is hard to find. If you produced the truth you will be attacked over and over again.Of all the videos I have produced this one is attacked by the “CIA Trolls” the most. We had over 80 Trolls hit this video in the last two months alone.Firth - Moms - this is how you reverse the effects of Autism:…a) No more GMO Foods, no more Food Colorings and no more chemicals for you or your children.…b) For bread - Eat Spelt and Spent alone.…c) For Oil - Use Coconut oil, Period, Too many Olive Oils contain Canola Oil - a GMO Rapeseed Plant - which makes Cows sick. What do you think it does to your child???…d) Sweetener - No Sugar, no artificial sugars. Some Pure Cane Brown Sugar and Birch Wood Xylitol Sugar to harden their teeth is good.…e) Tooth Paste - No More Fluoride Tooth Pastes. Period.…f) Immusist - follow the instructions closely. This is the Surfactant identical to what we take out of Kelp and, in my opinion, the only product that will walk your child out of Autism.…g) Citric are - be careful as it is very powerful. Both Citricare and Immusist maybe purchased at Vim and Vigor. I make no money off any of these companies. This is my country and YOU have a RIGHT to reverse what these Vaccine Companies did to you.…h) Eat Sea Weed…i) PrayIt will be a long road but worth while moms. When your non-speaking Autistic Child looks up for the first time and says: “Moooooom Iiou Loovvve Yououou” it will bring tears to your eyes.There is no other method to remove Autism - no other method.Not mud baths, not eating clay, not cold lasers. Until the Surfactant in Immusist breaks down the Nangalase and disperses the Viral toxins so your own White Blood Cells can destroy the diseases in your child’s little body - they will always be autistic.==========================What You Can Expect:A non-speaking autistic male age 12 named “Sam” (Name Changed to protect them) began eating Immusist. He has now graduated from High School and is almost normal - except his Emotional Age is only about 10.As for a 5 or 6 year old child with Extreme Autism - by the time they are 12 to 13 almost all effects are eliminated.If you catch a partially Autistic child at, say, age 10 by the time he is 20 the All Effects of the Autism will be completely and forever more erased. This is so common.This “Curing” Autism is a new Field so expect the unexpected.=========================Please pray that your family has the Wisdom to start reversing Autism in any of your children.Pray that your family is ready for what the Bankstas are about to throw at America.=========================----SAVING’S TIP OF THE DAY----Two Cirticare and one Immusist $152.Anti-aging - I now sleep around 5-6 hours a day - lots of energy.Hair Restoration - Nothing YetTooth Reminerilization: We will now after a dental appointment tomorrow but so far so good.===========================The News You NeedDr William B.

https://www.snopes.com/fact-check/tetanus-vaccine-sterilization/	ongoing tetanus vaccine campaigns in kenya are a ruse to sterilize women of childbearing age.	false	['Disease']	2014/11/10	David Mikkelson	['https://www.lifesitenews.com/news/a-mass-sterilization-exercise-kenyan-doctors-find-anti-fertility-agent-in-u', 'http://archive.is/psBXr']	https://www.lifesitenews.com/news/a-mass-sterilization-exercise-kenyan-doctors-find-anti-fertility-agent-in-u	https://www.lifesitenews.com/	"UPDATE (Nov. 12): Kenya's government has launched an investigation into the Catholic Church's allegations. See follow up article here.

Kenya’s Catholic bishops are charging two United Nations organizations with sterilizing millions of girls and women under cover of an anti-tetanus inoculation program sponsored by the Kenyan government.

According to a statement released Tuesday by the Kenya Catholic Doctors Association, the organization has found an antigen that causes miscarriages in a vaccine being administered to 2.3 million girls and women by the World Health Organization and UNICEF. Priests throughout Kenya reportedly are advising their congregations to refuse the vaccine.

“We sent six samples from around Kenya to laboratories in South Africa. They tested positive for the HCG antigen,” Dr. Muhame Ngare of the Mercy Medical Centre in Nairobi told LifeSiteNews. “They were all laced with HCG.”

Dr. Ngare, spokesman for the Kenya Catholic Doctors Association, stated in a bulletin released November 4, “This proved right our worst fears; that this WHO campaign is not about eradicating neonatal tetanus but a well-coordinated forceful population control mass sterilization exercise using a proven fertility regulating vaccine. This evidence was presented to the Ministry of Health before the third round of immunization but was ignored.”

But the government says the vaccine is safe. Health Minister James Macharia even told the BBC, “I would recommend my own daughter and wife to take it because I entirely 100% agree with it and have confidence it has no adverse health effects.”

And Dr. Collins Tabu, head of the Health Ministry’s immunization branch, told the Kenyan Nation, that “there is no other additive in the vaccine other than the tetanus antigen.”

Tabu said the same vaccine has been used for 30 years in Kenya. Moreover, “there are women who were vaccinated in October 2013 and March this year who are expectant. Therefore we deny that the vaccines are laced with contraceptives.”

Newspaper stories also report women getting pregnant after being vaccinated.

Responds Dr. Ngare: “Either we are lying or the government is lying. But ask yourself, ‘What reason do the Catholic doctors have for lying?’” Dr. Ngare added: “The Catholic Church has been here in Kenya providing health care and vaccinating for 100 years for longer than Kenya has existed as a country.”

Dr. Ngare told LifeSiteNews that several things alerted doctors in the Church’s far-flung medical system of 54 hospitals, 83 health centres, and 17 medical and nursing schools to the possibility the anti-tetanus campaign was secretly an anti-fertility campaign.

Why, they ask does it involve an unprecedented five shots (or “jabs” as they are known, in Kenya) over more than two years and why is it applied only to women of child-bearing years, and why is it not being conducted without the usual fanfare of government publicity?

“Usually we give a series three shots over two to three years, we give it anyone who comes into the clinic with an open wound, men, women or children.” said Dr. Ngare. “If this is intended to inoculate children in the womb, why give it to girls starting at 15 years? You cannot get married till you are 18.” The usual way to vaccinate children is to wait till they are six weeks old.”

But it is the five-vaccination regime that is most alarming. “The only time tetanus vaccine has been given in five doses is when it is used as a carrier in fertility regulating vaccines laced with the pregnancy hormone, Human Chorionic Gonadotropin (HCG) developed by WHO in 1992.”

It is HCG that has been found in all six samples sent to the University of Nairobi medical laboratory and another in South Africa. The bishops and doctors warn that injecting women with HCG , which mimics a natural hormone produced by pregnant women, causes them to develop antibodies against it. When they do get pregnant, and produce their own version of HCG, it triggers the production of antibodies that cause a miscarriage.

“We knew that the last time this vaccination with five injections has been used was in Mexico in 1993 and Nicaragua and the Philippines in 1994,” said Dr. Ngare. “It didn’t cause miscarriages till three years later,” which is why, he added, the counterclaims that women who got the vaccination recently and then got pregnant are meaningless.

Ngare said WHO tried to bring the same anti-fertility program into Kenya in the 1990s. “We alerted the government and it stopped the vaccination. But this time they haven’t done so.”

Ngare also contrasted the secrecy of this campaign with the usual fanfare accompanying national vaccination efforts. “They usually bring all the stakeholders together three months before the campaign, like they did with polio a little while ago. And they use staff in all the centres to give out the vaccine.” But with this anti-tetanus campaign, “only a few operatives from the government are allowed to give it out. They come with a police escort. They take it away with them when they are finished. Why not leave it with the local medical staff to administer?”

Brian Clowes of Human Life International in Virginia told LifeSite News that WHO was not involved in the Nicaragua, Mexican and Philippines campaigns. “They try to maintain a spotless record. They let organizations like United Nations Population Fund and USAID do the dirty work.”

In the previous cases, said Clowes, the vaccinators insisted their product was pure until it was shown not to be. Then they claimed the positive tests for HCG were isolated, accidental contaminations in the manufacturing process.

LifeSiteNews has obtained a UN report on an August 1992 meeting at its world headquarters in Geneva of 10 scientists from “Australia, Europe, India and the U.S.A” and 10 “women’s health advocates” from around the world, to discuss the use of “fertility regulating vaccines.” It describes the “anti-Human Chorionic Gonadotropin vaccine” as the most advanced.

One million Kenyan women and girls have been vaccinated so far with another 1.3 million to go. The vaccination is targeting women, according to the government, in order to inoculate their children in the womb against tetanus as well. The government says 550 children die of tetanus yearly.

In covering the contest of words the pro-government Nation found plenty of women who had been vaccinated and were now pregnant, even one who was the wife of a former Catholic priest who left the Church to marry. The paper ignored Kenya’s reliance on the Catholic medical system, while setting the bishops’ stand in a questionable historical context of irrational responses “largely based on religious beliefs,” the more recent murder of vaccination teams in Nigeria, and even of CIA conspiracy theories.

Why would the UN want to suppress the population in developing countries? “Racism,” is Brian Clowes’ first explanation. “Also, the developed countries want to get hold of their natural resources. And lately, there is the whole bogus global warming thing.”

Dr. Ngare said it was the Catholic Church’s hope that the government could have resolved the matter quietly by testing the vaccine. “But the government has chosen to be combative,” forcing Kenya’s bishops and Catholic doctors to go public.

ELEPHANT BUTTE LAKE, NM: The dead body of the elusive Sasquatch was recently discovered on a northern shore at Elephant Butte Lake on Wednesday by a camper and his wife. The campers, who wish to remain anonymous, are from Albuquerque, NM and have heard of the reports of recent sightings of the Bigfoot in the Monticello area at Elephant Butte Lake.

The campers described the creature as being between 8 and 8.5 feet tall, and between 600 to 800 pounds in weight Covered with black hair, and possessing broad, muscular shoulders. Slim waist. Long legs. Arms reaching the knees. Ape-like hands (no opposable thumb). Palms and base of feet hairless. Feet very large (18 to 24 inches long) with five toes.

The camper, an avid outdoorsman and hunter, told the Sierra County Sheriff Investigators that ""I was skeptical about all the recent stories I heard of Bigfoot here at The Butte, but after actually seeing one in the flesh, it scared the hell out of me!"" he admitted.

He did state to this reporter that the creature had a compound fracture of its right leg and cause of death may have been due to infection. We must also report that the remains were removed under tight security by the military to an undisclosed location.

(NaturalNews) Ten brands of baby wipes produced by the Pennsylvania-based Nutek Disposables, Inc., were recalled on January 25, 2017, following complaints of foul odor and discoloration.

Upon further testing, the baby wipe and adult washcloth manufacturer discovered that some of their products contained Burkholderia cepacia, a species of antibiotic-resistant bacteria frequently found in soil and water, according to the U.S. Centers for Disease Control and Prevention (CDC).

Known for its vinegar-like odor, B. cepacia has emerged as a human respiratory pathogen in people with weakened immune systems or chronic lung disease, especially cystic fibrosis patients.

Pulmonary infections involving these bacteria are capable of causing accelerated decline in lung functions and can induce “cepacia syndrome,” a progressive form of pneumonia that can be fatal and untreatable, according to MicrobeWiki.

Resistant bacteria found in baby wipes prompts mass recall

“After receiving a small number of complaints of odor and discoloration, Nutek conducted microbial testing that showed the presence of a bacteria, called Burkholderia cepacia (B. cepacia), in some of these products,” according to the company’s press release.

“Soon after, on January 3, 2017 the company initiated a voluntary withdrawal of lots that had tested positive for the bacteria, as well as other baby wipes in the surrounding time frame. After some additional lots were tested, as a precautionary measure, Nutek believed it was a prudent decision to withdraw all its baby wipe products.”

The following brands are included in the nationwide recall:

Cuties

Diapers.com

Femtex

Fred’s

Kidgets

Member’s Mark

Simply Right

Sunny Smiles

Tender Touch

Well Beginnings

The baby wipe brands are sold at a variety of retailers including Walgreen’s, Family Dollar, Sam’s Club and internet retailer Diapers.com. Reports confirm that some of the packages distributed prior to January 21, 2017, contained B. cepacia, prompting the company to halt shipping of all baby wipes produced at the facility.

Before October 3, Nutek Disposables says they only received one report of irritation; however, many more complaints emerged following the recall announcement.

Consumers reported side effects including rash, irritation, infections, fever, gastrointestinal issues and respiratory issues; however, these reports “have not been confirmed to be related to the use of these products,” according to Nutek officials.

The U.S Food and Drug Administration (FDA) says the company is still unable to determine the cause of the problem but is continuing to investigate, and the administration will work closely with Nutek to communicate the issue with affected retailers and distributors.

“Nutek takes the safety of consumers and the quality of its products very seriously and is taking all appropriate steps to address the issue and ensure this does not happen again,” according to the FDA.gov.

“Consumers who have purchased this product can return it to the place of purchase for a full refund,” or contact the company with questions at 1-855-646-4351 Monday through Friday 10 AM – 4 PM EST.

Mouthwash and contaminated medical equipment tied to previous B. cepacia infections

This isn’t the first time a personal care product has been contaminated with B. cepacia. In 2005, the CDC learned that several states had clusters of pneumonia and other infections caused by the bacteria, which ended up being connected to contaminated mouthwash.

Over-the-counter nasal spray was linked to B. cepacia infections in 2004, while that same year medical equipment and solutions used for intensive care unit patients were associated with the gram-negative bacteria.

The antibiotic-resistant bacteria can be transferred by direct contact with contaminated surfaces, exposure to B. cepacia in the environment and through person-to-person contact, according to the CDC.

Good hand hygiene and infection-control practices are recommended for successfully preventing infection from this bacterium.

A shooting was reported just after 12:30 p.m. Friday at 4801 Plaza Dr.

Fort Wayne police were called just after 12:30 p.m. Friday to an address at 47o1 Plaza Dr., near Standish Street just south of McMillen Park, on a report of a shooting there. When police arrived they found a man down on the sidewalk in critical condition.

Fort Wayne Police Department spokesperson Michael Joyner said a white colored suv pulled up alongside of the clown. A man was driving. Joyner said the man got out of the car and fired several shots. The man then got back in the suv and headed north on Plaza.

“This isn’t the first shooting that’s happened on this street,” neighbor Joe Wright said. “They happen often down the street.”

Joyner said he doesn’t know why people are dressing as clowns, but he said he suspects fear is a factor across the city.

“I just think it’s crazy. People better take those clown mask off… before the coroner does,” Wright said.

The victims’ names have not been released at this time. Anyone with information is asked to call Crime Stoppers at 436-STOP.

ROCKLAND — 14-year-old Amanda Peters hid her pregnancy from her mother for nearly three months until she began to show. When her mother Judy confronted her, Amanda denied having sexual intercourse and was taken immediately to a doctor who concluded she had likely been sexually active.

That’s when Amanda’s mother begged God to forgive her sinful daughter. However, her prayers were met strangely: Judy claims God came to her in a vision and said he had impregnated Amanda through immaculate conception and that she was to give birth to Jesus.

“At first I was confused, ” Mrs. Peters said. “Jesus was born to the Virgin Mary thousands of years ago, why was Amanda going to give birth to him again? But God explained this was how Jesus was to return to Earth as promised.”

Judy told her daughter who was overjoyed that she was no longer grounded and had regained her phone privileges.

“Things are the double bomb right now,” Amanda said. “My mom’s totally supportive and buying me lots of cool stuff I want and said she is going to pay for everything Jesus needs.”

“I was so sick with grief over Amanda having sex,” Judy said. “And I’m now so happily relieved to know she’s still a virgin and this was all God’s doing. I can’t believe I’m going to be Jesus’ grandma… actually, I don’t know how that will work, but I’m just extremely happy my daughter isn’t having premarital sex and Jesus is coming back in less than a month.”"	14-Year-Old Girl Pregnant with Baby Jesus	2014-09-30 08:30:14+00:00	[]	['having', 'judy', '14yearold', 'im', 'mother', 'pregnant', 'virgin', 'girl', 'jesus', 'going', 'god', 'baby', 'daughter', 'amanda']	"14-Year-Old Girl Pregnant with Baby JesusROCKLAND — 14-year-old Amanda Peters hid her pregnancy from her mother for nearly three months until she began to show.

LP Ranch also sells horses who are “ready for any ranching task that may be asked of them” and cattle who they “treat in a way that will allow them to be ready for any conditions.” According to his nephew Madison who is LP’s “Cattle Manager,” McConaughey is a “big beef man” who “feels it’s important to raise Angus cattle and support the beef industry.” In fact, McConaughey was a beef industry spokesman in 2010:"	Matthew McConaughey's Texas Ranch Sells Canned Hunts	2015-02-02 00:00:00	['Donny Moss', 'Terry Russo', 'John J Pippin', 'Denise Bongiovanni']	['spokesman', 'mcconaugheys', 'beef', 'canned', 'cattle', 'hunts', 'matthew', 'sells', 'ranch', 'texas', 'ready', 'mcconaughey', 'lp', 'website', 'media']	"His photo was removed from the website on the day the news broke in the mainstream media.

Twitter user Christa Peterson discovered that you can just tell Twitter you’re in Germany, and it will try to hide Nazi accounts and tweets:

Twitter lists these instructions on a support page, but it doesn’t mention that you can hide Nazis this way. (A separate page explains content withholding.) Here’s how to do it:

1. From the Twitter homepage, click your avatar on the top right.

2. From the drop-down menu, select “Settings and privacy.”

3. In the third section, “Content,” change your country to Germany.

Now any new page will load with Germany’s content filters in place.

Of course, because Twitter is awful, it only hides some of the Nazis, but it’s better than nothing. Here’s a comparison of the top profile results for “National Socialism” before and after I changed my settings:

The filter also applies to specific flagged tweets. Here’s conservative Christian author and convicted felon Dinesh D’Souza lying about the Holocaust, before and after:

Your trending topics and language preference stay the same. So does the location displayed on your profile page. We’ve noticed one bonus: The Moments tab disappears.



As user CanolaYogurt points out, Twitter saves the setting in your browser, not your account. So you can log into other accounts and you’ll still get German filtering. But you’ll need to re-apply the setting in every different browser or computer you use.

12. AFTERMATH



As the Allies swept through Europe to victory over the Nazi regime in early 1945, hundreds of thousands of concentration camp prisoners were liberated. The Allied Military Government of Germany repealed countless laws and decrees. Left unchanged, however, was the 1935 Nazi revision of Paragraph 175. Under the Allied occupation, some homosexuals were forced to serve out their terms of imprisonment regardless of time served in the concentration camps. The Nazi version of Paragraph 175 remained on the books of the Federal Republic of Germany (West Germany) until the law was revised in 1969 to decriminalize homosexual relations between men over the age of 21.



The continued legal and social prohibitions against homosexuality in Germany hindered acknowledgement that homosexuals were victims of Nazi persecution. In June 1956, West Germany's Federal Reparation Law for Victims of National Socialism declared that internment in a concentration camp for homosexuality did not qualify an individual to receive compensation. Homosexuals murdered by the Nazis received their first public commemoration in a May 8, 1985, speech by West German President Richard von Weizsäckerthe fortieth anniversary of the war's end. Four years after reunification in 1990, Germany abolished Paragraph 175. In May 2002, the German parliament completed legislation to pardon all homosexuals convicted under Paragraph 175 during the Nazi era.







Since 1984, memorials to homosexual victims of the Nazi regime have appeared in various cities and memorial sites at former concentration camps, including: ""Homomonument,"" Westermarkt, Amsterdam, 1987; Nollendorfplatz, BerlinSchöneberg, 1989; Sachsenhausen Memorial and Museum, Oranienburg, 1992; ""Angel,"" Platz Schäfergasse/Alte Gasse, Frankfurt, 1994; and on the bank of the Rhine River at the WallrafRichartsMuseum, Cologne, 1995.

It's time for deniers of human-caused global warming to stop using an old magazine story against climate scientists.

Peter Gwynne, Contributor

Inside Science Minds presents an ongoing series of guest columnists and personal perspectives presented by scientists, engineers, mathematicians, and others in the science community showcasing some of the most interesting ideas in science today. The opinions contained in this piece are those of the author and do not necessarily reflect those of Inside Science nor the American Institute of Physics and its Member Societies.

(Inside Science) -- ""The central fact is that, after three quarters of a century of extraordinarily mild conditions, the Earth seems to be cooling down. Meteorologists disagree about the cause and extent of the cooling trend, as well as over its specific impact on local weather conditions. But they are almost unanimous in the view that the trend will reduce agricultural productivity for the rest of the century."" – Newsweek: April 28, 1975

That's an excerpt from a story I wrote about climate science that appeared almost 40 years ago. Titled ""The Cooling World,"" it was remarkably popular; in fact it might be the only decades-old magazine story about science ever carried onto the set of a late-night TV talk show. Now, as the author of that story, after decades of scientific advances, let me say this: while the hypotheses described in that original story seemed right at the time, climate scientists now know that they were seriously incomplete. Our climate is warming -- not cooling, as the original story suggested.

Nevertheless, certain websites and individuals that dispute, disparage and deny the science that shows that humans are causing the Earth to warm continue to quote my article. Their message: how can we believe climatologists who tell us that the Earth's atmosphere is warming when their colleagues asserted that it's actually cooling?

Well, yes, we should trust them, despite the views of detractors such as comedian Dennis Miller, who brought my story to The Tonight Show in 2006. Several atmospheric scientists did indeed believe in global cooling, as I reported in the April 28, 1975 issue of Newsweek. But that was then.

[Photo removed May 2, 2019]

In the 39 years since, biotechnology has flowered from a promising academic topic to a major global industry, the first test-tube baby has been born and become a mother herself, cosmologists have learned that the universe is expanding at an accelerating rate rather than slowing down, and particle physicists have detected the Higgs boson, an entity once regarded as only a theoretical concept. Seven presidents have served most of 11 terms. And Newsweek has become a shadow of its former self.

And on the climate front? The vast majority of climatologists now assure us that Earth's atmosphere is not cooling. Rather it's warming up. And the main responsibility for the phenomenon lies with human activity.

""There's no serious dispute any more about whether the globe is warming, whether humans are responsible, and whether we will see large and dangerous changes in the future – in the words of the National Academy of Sciences – which we didn't know in the 1970s,"" said Michael Mann, a climatologist at Pennsylvania State University in University Park. He added that nearly every U.S. scientific society has assessed the evidence and come to the same conclusion.

The recent National Climate Assessment takes an equally emphatic view.

""What is new over the last decade is that we know with increasing certainty that climate change is happening now,"" it states. ""While scientists continue to refine projections of the future, observations unequivocally show that climate is changing and that the warming of the past 50 years is primarily due to human-induced emissions of heat-trapping gases.""

I'm sure it's clear by now that I accept the views of the National Academy, National Climate Assessment, Mann, and the huge majority of his fellow climatologists. Nevertheless, websites devoted to denying the existence of human-caused climate change – or at least promoting the idea that nothing should be done about it – continue to use my article to validate their thinking. In fact the article has reportedly become the most-cited article in Newsweek's history.

Those that reject climate science ignore the fact that, like other fields, climatology has evolved since 1975. The certainty that our atmosphere is indeed warming stems from a series of rigorous observations and theoretical concepts that fit into computer models and an overall framework outlining the nature of Earth's climate.

These capabilities were primitive or non-existent in 1975. In fact my report reflected a real strand of climatological thinking back then. I was far from the only science writer to cover the possibility of global cooling. Time, Science News, and the New York Times, among other media outlets, wrote about it, because some climate scientists had genuine reasons to believe that the global climate might be cooling and had published scholarly papers on the matter.

Speaking personally, though, I accept that I didn't tell the full story back then. Indeed, the issue raises questions about the relationship between science writers and scientists as well as the attitudes toward science of individuals with political agendas.

""Three independent strands of science at the time got conflated in the articles: analyses of direct temperature data that showed a decline in temperatures particularly over the Northern Hemisphere since the 1940s; a very high level of pollution by sulfate aerosols that cooled the planet; and evidence that the timing of ice ages was caused by wobbles in Earth's orbit,"" explained Gavin Schmidt, deputy chief of NASA's Goddard Institute for Space Studies, in New York. Indeed, he added, ""some parts of the article are OK even today.""

At the same time, however, evidence had emerged of increases in the atmospheric concentration of carbon dioxide, a gas known to warm the atmosphere.

""The science was sort of speculative [in 1975],"" Mann recalled. ""A National Academy of Sciences report concluded there wasn't enough information at that particular time because we had two competing forces – aerosols and greenhouse gases. It wasn't entirely clear which would win out.""

Ironically, efforts to clean up the atmosphere made it possible to resolve the scientific mystery and convince climatologists that human activity is warming the planet. Policy actions such as the Clean Air Act of 1970 in the United States and similar initiatives in other countries aimed to reduce the amount of sulfate aerosols in the atmosphere. Since those compounds primarily reflect heat, their reduction effectively gave carbon dioxide and other greenhouse gases more control over the Earth's temperature.

NASA scientist James Hansen was the first to sound the alarm. In 1988, he pointed out that a sort of Faustian bargain had cleaned up the atmosphere but at the cost of worsening the greenhouse problem.

(Click image to enlarge)

Hansen and other climatologists began to develop models of the climate which showed the influence of human activity, via the burning of fossil fuels, on global temperatures.

Observations and analyses since then have confirmed and strengthened the models and the broad understanding of climate change, along with the portion that's due to human activity. Richard Somerville, a climate scientist at the Scripps Institution of Oceanography and the University of California, San Diego, summarized the findings in an email. ""There are many lines of observational evidence that the world is warming, including globally rising air and ocean temperatures, retreating glaciers worldwide, increasing sea level, decreasing Arctic Sea ice extent, and mass loss on the ice sheets of Greenland and Antarctica,"" he wrote. ""In addition, an entire new body of climate science called 'detection and attribution' convincingly shows that the observed climate changes have distinctive space-time patterns that are consistent with causes due to human activities."" The counterattack had started by the beginning of the 1990s. The purported evidence against global warming included the news articles on cooling by myself and others.

Some commentators, such as Dixy Lee Ray, former chair of the Atomic Energy Commission, asserted that the articles represented climate scares that inevitably turned out to be untrue – as would the idea of global warming, they asserted.

Others took a less subtle route. The articles proved, they argued, that the atmosphere was cooling and that there was no reason to change that conclusion. In that view, climate science never changes.

However, both types of warming deniers, along with policymakers who have consistently opposed any regulation designed to reduce acid rain, the destruction of the ozone layer, and other perceived ills, have consistently used the articles – particularly mine – as ammunition.

But that's just one line of attack. Mann suffered another starting in 1998, after he published an article in the journal Nature; that included a ""hockey stick"" model that demonstrated a dramatic increase in the rate of recent global warming.

""I was at the receiving end of the attacks from many of the same individuals, think tanks, and organizations implicated in past attacks on other climate scientists, such as [late] climatologist Steve Schneider,"" he wrote in an email. ""The attacks on climate science and on me specifically have escalated for a simple reason: As the scientific evidence becomes clearer and the threat becomes clearer, it takes yet more disinformation and propaganda to obscure the truth. Hundreds of millions of dollars have been spent by fossil fuel interests seeking to muddy the waters. That has, in turn, provided cover for politicians doing their bidding in opposing any attempts to regulate carbon emissions.""

Opponents of Mann and his fellow climatologists also seek to highlight areas of disagreements among climatologists. Certainly those disagreements exist. But they don't affect the reality that human activity is the primary trigger of warming in recent decades.

Take, for example, research on the relationship between climate change and extreme weather.

""It is a very nuanced subject, and a legitimate controversy,"" Mann said in an interview. ""There really are different schools of thought, each of which are credible and making arguments in good faith. Jennifer Francis at Rutgers argues that there is a connection with loss of sea ice, and others are skeptical."" Schmidt agrees.

""It is a genuine debate,"" he said. ""Scientists don't just sit around congratulating ourselves on what we've done. We look for things at the cutting edge between known and unknown. It's a complex terrain and that's what makes it interesting.""

Certainly, the disputes have become more nuanced. But their existence provides opponents of scientific findings that they find unpopular with opportunities to muddle the facts.

""The American political system has always had a rather odd connection to the role of expertise,"" Schmidt added. ""There's a clear strand in American discourse that is anti-intellectual and anti-expertise.""

While the affair reveals much about the relationship between politics and science, it also casts a shadow on science writing.

""There's too much handwaving in science journalism,"" Schmidt noted. ""Scientists don't spend a lot of time when talking to journalists about what their research doesn't mean. One of the fault lines between science and journalism is how you pull together the bigger picture. So a reticence on the part of scientists to fill in the big picture, and over-enthusiasm on the part of journalists to say what does it all mean, means that the journalists don't get it quite right.""

Here I must admit mea culpa. In retrospect, I was over-enthusiastic in parts of my Newsweek article. Thus, I suggested a connection between the purported global cooling and increases in tornado activity that was unjustified by climate science. I also predicted a forthcoming impact of global cooling on the world's food production that had scant research to back it.

The messages for science writers are to ask questions beyond the obvious and to seek out what the science doesn't imply as well as what it does. If I had applied those lessons back in 1975, I might not now be in the embarrassing position of being a cat's paw for denial of climate change.

Over my career I've covered subjects as diverse as cell biology, the world of physics a century after Einstein's birth, space commerce, and World Cup soccer. I've won prizes for my writing, including a lifetime award from the American Chemical Society. But I fear that my obituary will be dominated by that single article in Newsweek."

One easily remembers how tense and long-lasting the Cold War was, and it left Russia very angry that they suffered such a demoralizing defeat as a world power.

While the United States should not become Vladimir Putin’s best friend, we also have to realize that Russia is a super power in this world and we must take them seriously.

Hillary and Obama dislike Putin because he only answers to strength and toughness, which is exactly why it is evident he likes Donald Trump.

As a way to project strength, Obama and Hillary continue to call Putin every name in the book while blaming him for cyber attacks and WikiLeaks.

On Friday, October 21, Putin issued a global message that if Hillary Clinton and Barrack Obama continue to slander Russia, he was going to shoot down U.S. jets in the Middle East and begin to prepare for World War III.

Putin, Fearing For His Country, Declares War Is Coming If Hillary Continues

But now, As of Sunday, October 23, Putin has ordered the Russian Defense Ministry to begin training and managing all local authorities, law enforcement, and state security as they are preparing for a nuclear war with the United States.

And with the United States at the eve of war, Hillary Clinton has spent the last two days blaming Putin and Russia for WikiLeaks and continues to call him a “thug puppet.”

Moscow is sending a blunt message to Obama and Hillary by purposefully stationing dozens of large aircraft carriers to conduct operations in Syria. On top of that, Putin is set to deploy more Russian spy ships to survey underwater internet cables in the region, as well.

This move originally began as the U.S. and Russia continued to disagree over Syria, but not it has become the first step into World War III.

Putin has told Obama that if he does not begin to cooperate and allow Russia to help, he will begin to shoot down American jets as well as aim his missiles towards the United States.

This has nothing to do with whether or not Russia could defeat the United States. This is a result of Obama and Hillary risking war with Russia just because they want to blame Putin for WikiLeaks rather than take blame for their leaked emails.

She’s Very Friendly With Russia

As we all recall, Hillary Clinton sold Russia 20 percent of our uranium a few years ago in exchange for $145,000,000 to the Clinton Foundation. So if Russia did not possess enough uranium to bolster their nuclear arsenal then, they have been sufficiently equipped thanks to Hillary Clinton.

No, Russia cannot defeat the United States, but why not attempt to make the relationship better? Donald Trump has openly stated he will work with Russia to eliminate ISIS from the Middle East. According to Hillary and Democrats, that is a terrible idea.

Vladimir Putin will continue to take precautions for nuclear war with the United States because they know if Hillary Clinton wins this election, she will engage in warlike conflicts. As Secretary of State, she created wars in Libya, Syria, and Iran while also creating ISIS.

Who can blame Russia for taking precautions? If a President Clinton scares Russia so badly that they are preparing their entire country for nuclear war, imagine how scared we should be as Americans."

Yes You Can!



In the spring of 1977, Rick Hoyt told his father, Dick Hoyt, that he wanted to participate in a 5-mile benefit run for a lacrosse player who had been paralyzed in an accident. Far from being a long-distance runner, Dick agreed to push Rick in his wheelchair and they finished all 5 miles, coming in next to last. That night, Rick told his father, “Dad, when I’m running, it feels like I’m not disabled.”



This realization was just the beginning of what would become over 1,000 races completed, including marathons, duathlons and triathlons. Also adding to their list of achievements, Dick and Rick biked and ran across the U.S. in 1992, completing a full 3,735 miles in 45 days.



In a triathlon, Dick will pull Rick in a boat with a bungee cord attached to a vest around his waist and to the front of the boat for the swimming stage. For the biking stage, Rick will ride a special two-seater bicycle, and then Dick will push Rick in his custom made running chair (for the running stage).



Rick was once asked, if he could give his father one thing, what would it be? Rick responded, “The thing I’d most like is for my dad to sit in the chair and I would push him for once.”

​Four Multi-sport Legends Inducted into USA Triathlon Hall of Fame



TEMPE, Ariz. — USA Triathlon and the multi-sport community celebrated the achievements of four triathlon legends Friday night, as Cherie Gruenfeld, Richard Eugene “Dick” Hoyt and Richard Eugene “Rick” Hoyt, Jr. , and Mike Plant (posthumous) were inducted into the USA Triathlon Hall of Fame. The gala and ceremony, benefiting the USA Triathlon Foundation, were held in Tempe in conjunction with the inaugural Endurance Exchange conference hosted by USA Triathlon and Triathlon Business International this week.



USA Triathlon Hall of Fame member and longtime Boston Marathon race director Dave McGillvray introduced the Hoyts, telling the story of how he met the famous push-assist team at the Boston Marathon — the iconic race the duo would go on to run 37 times.



“I looked upon them with bewilderment. What is this? Someone is actually pushing another person in a wheelchair? I’d never seen that before. I waited for them at the finish line as I just had to find out who they were and what this was all about. That began a 40-year relationship and friendship between us,” McGillivray said. “I asked Dick if he wanted to do my Bay State Triathlon. He said, ‘Not without Rick.’ I thought, ‘how is he going to do this?’ As we all know, the rest is history. They did it and never looked back.”



“Team Hoyt” became the first duo ever to complete the IRONMAN World Championship in Kailua-Kona, Hawaii, in 1989, and repeated the feat in 1999. Over three decades, they have paved the way for the countless push-assist teams around the world who participate in endurance sports today.



“This is what we did together, as a father and son. Rick is such a great kid. He’s just like you and me, he lives on his own. He’s just a great kid and now we’ve got all these Team Hoyt organizations in different states. That is something I’m very proud of,” said Dick Hoyt, who spoke on behalf of himself and his son, Rick.



Unable to attend, Rick Hoyt addressed the crowd in a recorded video message.



“Thanks for the honor. Wish I could be there. Dad, I love you,” he said.

They lose their humanity and drift farther away from self awareness. They sexualize any female they see, whether she’s an adult or a peer, as long as they match the idea of society’s beauty standards of course. They don’t see those they perceive as woman as humans, but objects to fulfill sexual desire. They spend hours and hours a day locked in their room watching porn.

On the one hand, being a sex worker is an empowering and noble career but men enjoying porn is problematic. Having infinite pornographic videos at his fingertips, it creates the illusion that the women he sees are his slaves. That they exist to serve him. He thinks of them as whores but ejaculates to them anyway, during this release his brain can’t differentiate imagination from reality. Make no mistake, he doesn’t log on to Pornhub to watch humans make love, but to watch a woman be exploited. He’ll need to watch kinker and kinker content as the years go on until heterosexual sex with a real woman are no longer stimulating. I’m not saying we make porn illegal altogether but men should not be allowed to log on to the sites. Men shouldn’t be able to direct, produce, or star in pornography either. The entire industry should be run by women, for women. We don’t need actual men, there are plenty of strap-ons and women with penises.



Without porn to look at, more men will just masturbate to fantasies they create in their mind of women they know in real life. This is even worse than just jacking it to porn. Sex workers are aware that their image will be sexualized and accept that but when a man masturbates to a woman he know in real life without her consent, that is telepathic rape. It’s sick. It even affects the victim although she may be unaware but it lowers her energy.



Drugs could be given to men to lower their sexual drive so they would no long need to masturbate, similar to how a male dog gets fixed so he’s not aggressive and humping everything. This will finally solve our problem on toxic masculinity and create a more peaceful world. This would make men more docile and less animalistic. I guarantee that this would lower the rate of sexual assault and rape victims. It would also lower violent attacks because men’s need to compete for dominance with one another comes from all the testosterone. The uncomfortable truth is that all the world’s problems rape, terrorism, war, violence come back to men. This could be a step in the right direction if we as a society are ready to evolve."

“In Colorado, legalizing marijuana generated $2.4 billion in economic activity and created more than 18,000 new jobs in a single year alone,” Cruz said.

The bill introduced includes providing employment and benefit protections for marijuana users, requiring insurance coverage for medicinal marijuana for terminal illnesses and incorporating marijuana into current alcohol and tobacco educational curricula in schools.

Praise God. Michael is currently on Chemotherapy and will start a stronger dose. We Thank everyone for their prayers and Hope everyone will continue to pray. We would also like to thank everyone who signed his guest book or submitted a prayer. May God bless you.

Nina



The test of true prayer and faith is when we have the strength to continue to uphold our love and determination to see any given situation through. While Michael has seen miraculous prayer bring him back physically time and again, it is by God's grace he is still with us.



I implore all those of faith who have been following Michael's progress to continue to pray as fervently each day as they did from the first time they heard about Michael; regardless of whether his health has stab i lized or growth on some level is identified. Until the tumor is completely healed and gone from his body, our petitions in prayer are the only medicine Michael can never have too much of. May God recognize the resolve in our hearts and bless Michael with perfect and complete healing. Beautiful words from Brother Henry: Praying for Michael. We serve a God who cannot fail. Ask, He says, and you will receive. Seek, He says, and you will find. Knock, and the door will be opened... Father, We ask in Jesus' Name, the Name above all names, that you would

touch young Michael. Send Your Holy Spirit to remove the tumor completely and restore him to perfect health. And, Father, we know that You are omnipotent and can do anything and that it is not your will that little ones should suffer. So, Father, grant the request of Your humble servants I pray, and let not Your Holy Name be evil spoken of for denying it. Also, Lord Jesus, I humbly remind You that You have promised us that if we ask anything in Your Name that it would be done for us by Our Father, which is in heaven. Amen In Christ, Bro. Henry True miracles, the type the church investigates and verifies, really do exist. Every day waits for the power of our combined faith for one to occur. I believe there is one such miracle waiting for Michael out there, just waiting to be realized. And so it is very important now that we continue to pray, say novenas, light candles, and send our healing energies not only out of love for Michael, but because Michael is so loved by God. Please, continue to pray as fervently as ever before for Michael. Our prayers have been heard, and as I said before the more prayer -the more power, the more power - the greater the miracle. Thank you all very much. Michael still contends with the daily threats that any challenged immune system must deal with, such as fighting off fever, colds and sinus infections. Michael has a bubble in his head from his shunt and hopes some day to be free of this debilitating illness. All of us who know the joy of watching our children run wildly around the house in play can appreciate the depth of Michael's wish to no longer be ill and to play with the freedom and total abandonment that childhood allows. Please pray for Michael's complete and perfect healing. If you can, please send a short prayer request to those you know will take it to heart and have time to pray, say a novena, light a candle, send healing love and good vibrations for little Michael and his family during this fight for Michael's life, as prayers are seen in the heavens as music to God's ears.

On Sunday, the Steelers had decided as a team to remain in the locker room and not come to the sidelines for the playing of the national anthem, with one notable exception. The team understood that tackle Alejandro Villanueva, a former Army Ranger and Afghan war veteran, would still come out to show respect for the flag. The exception was made for Villanueva due to the fact that he risked life and limb defending that flag and what it stands for, a factor obvious enough that really shouldn’t have to be explained.

Except for one factor: it’s the NFL in 2017.

The reasons why Villanueva should be exempted from his team’s disgusting display of disrespect were apparently lost on their head coach. When answering questions from reporters after the game, Tomlin seemed to rap Villanueva, repeating the claim that the team was looking for “100% participation,”

Tomlin said, “Like I said, I was looking for 100 percent participation, we were gonna be respectful of our football team.”

Apparently, in Tomlin’s world, respect for team is over and above respect for someone who risked his life to defend his country.

According to Fox, “Tomlin told the media that, prior to kickoff Sunday, the Steelers held a team meeting and decided, though not unanimously, to not come out of the locker room for the national anthem. Tomlin added the intent was to have his team focus on the game and not President Trump’s comments blasting players who chose to protest during the playing of “The Star-Spangled Banner.”

Tomlin said after the game:

Many of them felt like something needed to be done. I asked those guys to discuss it and whatever they discussed that we have 100 percent participation or we do nothing. They discussed it for an appropriate length of time and they couldn’t come to an understanding, so they chose to remove themselves from it. They were not going to be disrespectful in the anthem so they chose not to participate, but at the same time many of them were not going to accept the words of the president.

Villanueva clearly had a different mentality about what the anthem meant for him.

Tomlin continued, “We’re not politicians. We’re coaches and professional athletes. If those of us or individuals choose to participate in politics in some way, I’m going to be supportive of that. But when we come out of locker rooms, we come out of locker rooms to play football games.”

Villanueva was critical of the Colin Kaepernick, the former 49er who launched the current NFL protest movement. In 2016, Villanueva said , “I don’t know if the most effective way is to sit down during the national anthem with a country that’s providing you freedom, providing you $16 million a year … when there are black minorities that are dying in Iraq and Afghanistan for less than $20,000 a year.

“I will be the first one to hold hands with Colin Kaepernick and do something about the way minorities are being treated in the United States, the injustice that is happening with police brutality, the justice system, inequalities in pay. You can’t do it by looking away from the people that are trying to protect our freedom and our country.”"	Steelers Coach Rips Afghan War Vet Villanueva for Standing for the Anthem	2017-09-26 20:56:21+00:00	[]	['coach', 'tomlin', 'afghan', 'steelers', 'vet', 'villanueva', 'come', 'way', 'rips', 'standing', 'team', 'locker', 'anthem', 'national', 'room', 'war']	"In what might just be the most 2017 NFL story ever, Steelers coach Mike Tomlin ripped one of his players, an Afghan war veteran, for coming out of the locker room for the national anthem.

Taco Bell, the pseudo Mexican restaurant popular among college students, poor people, those without taste buds, and individuals with bad taste in general, has recently been put on the stand for allegations regarding false advertisement.

On Friday, the law firm of Beasley, Allen, Crow, Methvin, Portis, Miles and another partner whose name no one can spell or pronounce, filed a law suit against the Mexican wannabe claiming that the meat mixture contains too many fillers and binders to be labeled as beef.

The majority of the time the meat mix is doused with so much cheese, salsa, and sour cream it is a wonder that anyone could tell it was beef flavored, much less question the authenticity of the meat itself.

Weekly Would News knew that these allegations could only be just the tip of the iceberg so we sent our crack team of reporters to the streets to find out what else could be behind these allegations.

It did not take long for our team to discover that the meat that Taco Bell uses for its beef based products is imported from China. This set off a myriad of bells and whistles on our end so we asked our Japanese WWN affiliates to check out the Kuang Ren factory in the Zhejiang province where the beef is packaged. Within hours our Japanese colleagues were back in touch with a shocking discovery, the so called beef is actually cat and dog meat.

We all know that that the Chinese have been known to eat cat and dog meat but we never thought that they would have the cajones to import the goods to the US. Taco Bell would not return our phone calls, which leads us to believe that this must be true.

Upon the discovery of the news, we immediately did the right thing and informed the FDA. The FDA has since mandated that all Taco Bells must be closed forever.

Just as this Venus Retrograde began to take us all deeper into the darkness of the underworld, the Divine Feminine Maha Shakti, goddess of spiritual death, destruction and resurrection, rode the zeitgeist straight onto the face of the Empire State Building and into the heart of collective consciousness.

This Kali apparition over Manhattan may be our last warning. Fierce protectress of truth, she tells it like it is, she beckons us to dive into the dark, to face the stark reality of the global ecological crisis upon us, and to let heartbreak be the ground from which we awaken and serve.

Perhaps it is even too late now, perhaps only calamity can make us silence the ego and hear the cries of the World Soul, perhaps destruction must be our baptism into change, but this is the time and we are the ones summoned to be the shamans of the Shift.

Never underestimate the power of holy darkness to reveal the Soul of all matters. The dark is where illusions are shattered, where false certainties are broken; the dark is where the mind is cut off so that only the heart can see… It is time to let holy darkness be our medicine. The world as we know it must change or perish.

In an unprecedented and awe-inspiring public display of art by filmmaker Louie Psihoyos and his team, Projecting Change, projected onto the NYC skyline by Obscura Digital, was meant to spark awareness of massive wildlife extinction, and be a chilling call to conservation turning the Empire State Building, New York’s brightest and most recognizable symbol and capitalism’s earliest totem, into the worlds greatest canvas, as well as its most epic tombstone and oracle of the Dark Feminine.

From the colossal projection of Cecil the Lion, whose recent tragic death provoked a mass outpouring of love and outrage, to the images of hundreds of nameless endangered animals, finned ones and scaled ones, horned ones and winged ones, two-legged and four, creeping and crawling and running for their lives across the Empire State Building, this revolutionary and heart-rending project, will not soon be forgotten.

“If you are not heartbroken, you are not paying attention!” this project seems to scream from its illustrious rooftop. For as the parade of near-extinct animals appear on the screen, it is impossible not to face the crushing realization that it is not a question of if hundreds of species will continue to go extinct, but when… Our shiny unsustainable systems based on glamour and greed have taken us to a world on the edge of collapse — only holy darkness can save us now.

And it was Kali, the dark mother, the destroyer of illusions and the personification of time, death and holy change, by Android Jones, that stole the show in New York, as the final, spectacular image of the installation, leaving her fierce gaze to peer into our souls.

If there was ever a sign of the times, this is it. In our bones we all recognize, we are in the death pangs of the old world, and that we make it through is anything but certain.

It is time to get our Kali on inside and out; to cut off the head and commit to the heart on all levels. So many of us are shedding our false selves, empty certainties and small lives, and no matter how much we wish for the safety of the old, the more desperately we hold on, the hotter the fires of the Real.

The quickening of the New Earth is upon us and what is needed now is the fierceness of Ma Kali. A holy oracle of change, her medicine is darkness, her initiation is by fire — she calls upon us to rise from our own ashes, to speak truth to power, take on all our shadows and take up the arms that we have, our own, to hold, serve and protect all life as we would our own child.

The Divine Feminine energy is pulsing through every pore of the planet right now, every whisper of the world soul is one intimately connected to our ecology. The ecological consciousness is feminine consciousness, systemic, interconnected, relational and embodied; nature and psyche, body and soul, the spiritual and the political can no longer remain apart.

May we burn up the convoluted narratives of separation, deprivation and control, cut off the dead promises of capitalism, step fully into our dharma, and let the Mother guide us through the fires of transfiguration. May all beings be happy. One Body. One Heart. Jai Ma!

“In preparation for the birth of the Divine, the entire human race is now going through a global dark night, which will result in a new humanity that has been humbled and chastened by tragedy, so that it may open completely to the mystery of divine grace. This dark night cannot be bargained with, explained away, leapt over or mitigated. It is the destined crucifixion of a communal human ego now clearly revealed to be suicidal, matricidal, dangerous to itself and to the whole of creation. No one and nothing will stop Kali dancing Her terrible dance of destruction and re-creation. There will be no resurrection of an embodied divine humanity without a systematic, perfectly organized, brutally complete crucifixion of everything in us that keeps us addicted to the systems of illusion that are now rapidly destroying everything.” ~ Andrew Harvey

that he was never in the Oval Office without a coat and tie. Bill Clinton has

such disrespect for the presidency that he was often in the Oval Office without

his pants.

The president who thus exposed himself has now been exposed to the entire

world: Behold Bill Clinton, the shining hero of liberalism! Behold the

self-anointed messiah of the progressive movement! Behold the leader of ""the most

ethical administration in history.""

Though it is too early to say if he will be impeached, the jury is in on

Bill Clinton's character. We know beyond a reasonable doubt that Bill Clinton

is an out-of-control sexual predator who publicly posed as the feminists' best

friend while secretly using Monica Lewinsky.

His real attitude toward women comes through loud and clear now.

TRENDING: Trump lawyer: Mueller's intent was 'monstrous lie and scheme to defraud'

With their standard-bearer exposed as a yet-to-be-convicted felon, the

Democratic Party has no one to lift up as an example and a hero. So, in a

squalid attempt to justify the most corrupt President in American history,

Bill Clinton's defenders now drag the entire history and tradition of the

presidency into the gutter. They have slimed Washington, Jefferson, FDR, Eisenhower,

and even Ronald Reagan.

Typical of these defenders of the indefensible is Mario Cuomo, who on CNN's

""Larry King Live"" said, ""I liked President Reagan. I certainly wouldn't

have trusted him if he said to me I never had an extramarital affair."" (On

behalf of the Reagan family, I have publicly demanded an apology from former Gov.

Cuomo. We shall see if he has the decency to offer one.)

Those who claim the President's sex life is personal and none of our

business conveniently forget one thing: A President whose sex life is outrageous,

out of control, and out of bounds is a threat not only to the nation's morals, but

to the nation's security. During l'affair Lewinsky, Clinton was clearly aware

of this fact, which underscores (if underscoring is needed) his utter

recklessness.

In the 445-page Starr report, we read that Bill Clinton told Monica

Lewinsky that ""he suspected that a foreign embassy (he did not specify which one)

was tapping his telephones, and he proposed cover stories. If ever

questioned, she should say that the two of them were just friends. If anyone ever asked

about their phone sex, she should say that they knew their calls were being

monitored all along, and the phone sex was just a put-on.""

Does this sound like a man who is worthy to be the leader of the Free

World?

The Code of Federal Regulations provides rules for issuing security

clearances. Is Bill Clinton qualified to hold the most sensitive national security post

in our government? Read this excerpt from the federal regulations-and you tell me:

Code of Federal Regulations, Title 32, Chapter 1, Part 147

SEXUAL BEHAVIOR ""Sexual behavior is a security concern if it involves a criminal offense,

indicates a personality or emotional disorder, subjects the individual to

undue influence or coercion, or reflects lack of judgment or discretion. ""NOTE: The adjudicator should also consider guidelines pertaining to

criminal conduct (criterion J); or emotional, mental, and personality disorders

(criterion I), in determining how to resolve the security concerns raised

by sexual behavior. ""END NOTE: (Sexual orientation or preference may not be used as a basis for

or a disqualifying factor in determining a person's eligibility for a security

clearance.) ""Conditions that could raise a security concern and may be disqualifying

include: ""(1) sexual behavior of a criminal nature, whether or not the individual

has been prosecuted; ""(2) compulsive or addictive sexual behavior when the person is unable to

stop a pattern of self-destructive or high-risk behavior or that which is

symptomatic of a personality disorder; ""(3) sexual behavior that causes an individual to be vulnerable to undue

influence or coercion; ""(4) sexual behavior of a public nature and/or that which reflects lack of

discretion or judgment.""

Federal regulations couldn't be more clear: Bill Clinton wouldn't even

qualify for a national security clearance.

Much like her spontaneous trip, the statement on the back of her jacket was also a surprise—to say the least.

Before leaving Andrews Air Force Base in Maryland, the First Lady was photographed wearing a $39 Zara military trench coat from last season that sent a stupefying, yet clear message: “I Really Don’t Care. Do U?”

The text is inscribed in graffiti-like script on the back of the green parka, but what is she really trying to tell us? Trump’s surprise trip to Texas was an opportunity for her to get a first-hand glimpse at the conditions where immigrant children are held as a result of President Donald Trump’s “zero tolerance"" immigration policy, which has resulted in the separation of thousands of children from their parents. He ended Wednesday via executive order.

But the First Lady—and her close circle of advisors—somehow failed to realize that photos of her in the Zara design would be seen and critiqued. Regardless of whether or not the optics of wearing the trench was an oversight, the message seems to be that she’s apathetic toward the nation’s immigration crisis.

CNN's Jim Accosta reports that the First Lady's spokesperson confirmed the text on the jacket. They added, ""It's a jacket. There was no hidden message. After today's important visit to Texas, I hope the media isn't going to focus on her wardrobe.""

And fortunately, there is now REAL HOPE …

A completely natural medicine science is pointing to as THE SOLUTION to surviving the coming epidemic .

In fact, this unique treatment has already shown it can wipe out some of the deadliest drug-resistant superbugs on the planet

It’s a medically verified, oral immune booster known as AC-44 .

And the more scientists study it, the more they’re amazed by the results…

For starters… AC-44 has been scientifically verified to be 100 times more powerful than some of the most popular antibiotics available .

To demonstrate this, researchers at the University of London put AC-44 to the test against the most antibiotic resistant strain of staph infection known to man…

A “superbug” known as MRSA that kills tens of thousands of patients in UK and US hospitals every year…

This infection swats away antibiotics like a gorilla shooing a fly.

That’s why researchers were stunned when lab studies showed AC-44 can kill the deadly infection in just weeks .

Giving new hope to millions around the world.

How is it able to achieve such unheard of results? By doing something antibiotics simply can’t …

AC-44 is able to completely shut down superbugs’ ability to grow and spread throughout your body on a cellular level…

Weakening the virus…so your immune system can finally keep up.

But is AC-44 powerful enough to halt the spread of Mexican “Blood Flu?”

Thank God —YES!

In fact, when AC-44 was specifically tested on the Mexican “Blood Flu” the results were amazing.

Lab studies show that…

AC-44 is able to kill the Mexican “Blood Flu” virus in less than 6 hours

Yes, one of the most feared and drug-resistant superbugs on the planet can be wiped out in mere hours .

So why haven’t you heard of it?

Why on Earth aren’t they express shipping palettes of AC-44 to hospitals around the country?

Because the more scientists study it, the more they find it can do.It’s not just “Blood flu,” this natural breakthrough is being proven effective against some of the most deadly and common diseases of our time...

Which is why big pharma executives are willing to risk a pandemic to keep a lid on it and protect their profits…

Studies show it can slash both diastolic and systolic blood pressure, lower cholesterol and even wash away deadly artery plaque.

But that’s only the beginning…

Research shows it can destroy infections, germs and bacteria of all kinds…

Scientists at Bringham Young University found that AC-44 kills nearly 100% of the rhinovirus responsible for common colds and flu.

They also found it’s 90%-100% effective against both the Herpes and Polio viruses.

It’s so strong it’s been used to ward off things like gangrene, the plague, and cystic fibrosis .

But here’s where Big Pharma is really threatened…

It’s even being used against some of the deadliest cancers in the world .

Studies show it can slash lung cancer risk nearly in half…

It can destroy deadly glioblastoma brain cancer cells by the millions…

And it’s also being used to prevent prostate, breast, stomach, rectal and colon cancer .

In fact, AC-44 is so promising that as we speak… Big Pharma is in the process of synthesizing this natural miracle into a pill they hope to sell for billions in profit.

Which is exactly why they don’t want the public to know that there’s a natural version available RIGHT NOW .

It couldn’t be more obvious…

In order to protect yourself and your family from the deadly Mexican “Blood Flu”…

As well as skyrocket your immune system to fend off cold, flu and deadly staph infections…

Or even fight some of the deadliest cancers ever recorded…

You have to get your hands on a life-saving supply of AC-44 .

And you have to do it RIGHT NOW .

Shortages of this natural breakthrough are already being reported around the world…

And when the Mexican “Blood Flu” explodes in 2019, those shortages will surely skyrocket .

Meaning you and your loved ones could find yourself empty-handed and unprotected at the worst possible time.

That’s why I want to provide you with everything you need to obtain your very own personal supply of AC-44 immediately .

Where to find it… and the most potent source.

You’ll discover every single life-saving detail inside Forbidden Miracles: Natural Healing Secrets to the World’s Deadliest Diseases

A 504 page book personally compiled by the health researchers at the Institute for Natural Healing …

And in a minute, you’ll discover how you can receive a bound and printed copy absolutely FREE .

Inside you’ll find full details on how to protect yourself and your family from the Mexican “Blood Flu” using AC-44…

But that’s not the only thing you’ll learn about today because…

The Mexican “Blood Flu” is FAR from the only threat facing American seniors in 2019.

In fact, you face one that’s arguably bigger.

A mainstream medical “industrial complex” that’s actively ignoring natural cures and treatments to some of America’s most deadly and debilitating diseases.

Why is this happening?

Because the American medical system is more concerned with profit than patients…

Last year alone, American pharmaceutical companies pocketed a mind-blowing $458 billion .

That’s more than double drug sales in China, Russia, Brazil and India put together!

And they’ll do anything to protect their money.

Which means silencing natural alternatives with the power to stop their endless cycle of dangerous prescriptions…

Because to them, a cured patient is no longer a paying customer.

Which is why mainstream medicine desperately doesn’t want you to hear what I’m about to tell you…

There are currently 5 new natural treatments you can have today with the power to reverse or even cure America’s most deadly and debilitating diseases

A secret breakthrough that kills 10,000 times more cancer cells than standard methods alone, used by an underground network of American oncologists. The brand new “Sabin Technique” that completely reverses arthritis, eliminates pain and repairs damaged joints . It’s so powerful it’s even been shown to reverse paralysis! Rare Chinese “Acetyl Moss” that blows away top-selling Alzheimer’s drugs and improves memory function by 460% . (Supplies are limited but we’ll tell you how to secure your very own.) The liquid Israeli cardio solution that reverses heart disease and clears clogged arteries 5 times better than any prescription . (And tastes delicious!) The simple solution for reversing type II diabetes in as little as 8 weeks that’s stunning European scientists. (It tricks your body into creating its own insulin again!)

Across America, doctors have been raided, black-listed and even jailed for promoting the same type of natural alternative treatments we’re about to expose…

But at INH we’ve realized there is strength in numbers …

Which is why we’ve developed a vast network of 280,000 independent medical researchers, doctors and like-minded individuals like you.

And just like we’ve been tracking the spread of the Mexican “Blood Flu” and the AC-44 breakthrough that can stop it…

We’ve also been using our rapidly expanding resources and connections around the world to uncover the most powerful cures to some of today’s most common (and deadly) diseases…

And while you’ll find countless of them in your free copy of Forbidden Miracles …

We feel the five I mentioned above are so important, you absolutely must see them today.

We call them the INH Top Five .

And I’m going to reveal them to you right now, starting with…

A cancer-starving miracle used by an exclusive group of American oncologists

It’s been scientifically proven 10,000 times more powerful than standard methods alone in in-vitro studies…

One doctor is even reporting full remission rates of up to 95% ...

And even better, it also shields your healthy cells from harm!

That means you can now destroy 10,000 times more deadly cancer cells …

Without the agonizing side effects of conventional treatments.

And no matter how bleak your diagnosis… or advanced your cancer…

There is now real hope for complete and total remission.

Because this unique method is being used by doctors around the world to treat some of the most aggressive cancers known to man including…

Lung

Uterine

Bone

Lymphoma

Sarcoma

Hodgkin’s Lymphoma

Pancreatic

And that’s just a small sample.

Yes, right now patients are reporting recoveries from cancers once considered a death sentence as easily as if they were shaking off a bad cold.

And here’s the sad part…

Mainstream medicine has known about this method for decades. But instead of ending the suffering of tens of millions and promoting what many consider a real cure …

They chose to protect the profits of the cancer industry while your friends, family and acquaintances slowly succumbed to this horrible disease.

That ends today.

I’m going to fill you in on every last detail about this groundbreaking cancer breakthrough right now…

The scientific proof, the secret behind how it works and real-life patients who are cheating death by using it right now.

So let’s dive in.

In 1923, Canadian scientists received a Nobel Prize for the discovery of a natural protein they called Insula Peptide …

Researchers around the world were first stunned by its ability to treat everything from Diabetes to Syphilis.

But it was another 70 years before its true potential became clear.

Doctors believe Insula Peptide kills cancer cells in droves

It exploded in popularity in South America where patients used it to make full recoveries from their cancer…

All without the burning, scarring and disfiguring side effects of conventional treatments.

And that’s when The National Cancer Institute took notice…

In a peer reviewed study… they took aggressive cancer cells and treated them with one of the most widely prescribed chemotherapies on the market…

But then they did something else…

They added Insula Peptide …

And were bowled over by the results.

Insula Peptide obliterated 10,000 times more cancer cells than the chemotherapy alone

Think about that… a natural treatment proven 10,000 times stronger than one of the most popular chemotherapies on the market.

You’d think the National Cancer Institute would have touted this study in every major American news outlet…

And urged oncologists to start adding it to their treatment regimens immediately .

But that’s not what they did at all.

Because even though they knew Insula Peptide had proven the ability to save millions of lives , they also knew something else…

Results like this would mean a roughly 90% drop in conventional treatments for cancer… and tens of billions in lost profit .

So they didn’t even publish the study in the United States.

Instead it was relegated to a small European medical journal, where it gathered dust and was quickly forgotten.

But a tight circle of forward thinking American oncologists still managed to find the results—and quietly started treating patients of their own.

And the results they’re reporting are mind-blowing … After years of treating patients, one doctor reported…

A 95% full remission rate for tumors smaller than 4 cm



An 80% full remission rate for tumors larger than 4 cm



And remission rates of up to 70% for recurrent cancers (consistently the most difficult of cancers to treat)

How does Insula Peptide achieve such incredible results?

By essentially starving cancer cells to death.

Cancer cells crave glucose and they need to gobble it up to survive…

In fact, cancer cells consume 20 times more glucose than normal cells…

Insula Peptide works by denying these cells access to glucose and starving them completely…

Even better, the starving cancer cells start gobbling up anything they can for food… including standard cancer treatments…

This causes cancer cells and tumors to shrivel away to nothing like magic.

And because Insula Peptide acts like a cancer seeking missile … your healthy cells stay out of the line of fire and are left to thrive.

Which is why patients recover with none of the debilitating side effects experienced by conventional treatments…

In fact, one doctor’s patients report quality of life improvements of 98% .

And while American doctors using this method are flying under the radar to avoid possible consequences from the FDA and big pharma…

Thankful patients are singing its praises online…

Like Carrie T. from Montana who says, “I was diagnosed with breast cancer. It was a 6mm malignant tumor.

After Insula Peptide, my prognosis now is very good…

“Ultrasounds revealed the tumor is nothing but a shell.”

I had absolutely NO side effects , continued working, home schooling and lived life!

I have NEVER felt sick or run-down. I actually felt as healthy, if not more, while undergoing treatments.”

And then there’s Tracy M from San Antonio, who was facing a terrifying lung cancer diagnosis. She says…

“After my diagnosis, I felt that my life was finished and that I would probably not see my family again.”

But after trying Insula Peptide, everything changed for the better…

As she puts it…

“I had a CAT scan of the lung at the South Texas Scan Center and the radiology specialist reported that the mass had disappeared .

I could not believe that I had been successfully treated.

Six months later another x-ray reported the absence of cancerous tumors .

At the moment (15 years later) I continue to enjoy life and good health.”

“My lung cancer disappeared.”

And then there’s James U. from Connecticut who writes…

“I had stage 4 prostate cancer. Very serious.

Because it had spread, (metastasized) the urologist suggested I start an anti- androgen therapy, commonly called chemical castration.

He explained there is no cure, I would lose my hair and go through menopause.

I was willing to do it if there was no option but… my wife Teresa called a friend that knows a lot about medicine. They recommended Insula Peptide.”

And that’s when everything changed for James. As he puts it…

“The size of my prostate is now near normal and no traces of other tumors can be seen in ultrasound scans.”

“There is no cancer activity and the tumors are gone.”

And when Allison C. was diagnosed with breast cancer, doctors told her she’d be dead in 6 months when she chose Insula Peptide over more conventional methods…

In fact, as she puts it...

“Insula Peptide made the cancer a non-event! I never lost my hair, and I never got sick.”

I am now totally cancer free and all my scans are clear. This quite simply saved my life. I will always be grateful.”

And these are just a handful of countless testimonials found online.

For years this revolutionary therapy was extremely difficult to obtain…

In fact, if you asked your doctor about it today he probably wouldn’t know what you’re talking about.

And that’s exactly why the Institute for Natural Healing is releasing Forbidden Miracles: Natural Healing Secrets to the World’s Deadliest Diseases .

Forbidden Miracles will also bring you complete details on countless more life-saving breakthroughs that mainstream medicine and big pharma have been suppressing for decades.

I’m going to tell you exactly how to get your free, 504 page copy in just a moment…

But first, I’m going to fill you in on the 2nd in our INH Top Five list…

And if you or a loved one have been suffering from debilitating pain then you’ll want to pay close attention because this proves…

Full recovery from arthritis and chronic pain is now a reality

It’s all thanks to a brand new treatment known as the Sabin Technique , after one of its earliest pioneers.

And you’re about to see how it’s not just healing a lucky few… but achieving unheard of recovery rates of up to 100% in scientific studies.

It’s quietly being used right now for conditions such as…

Osteoarthritis

Damaged Knee Cartilage

Degenerative Discs

Torn ACLs

Shoulder Rotator Cuff Tears

And even Paralysis due to Stroke

And whether your pain is in your hips, back, shoulders, or knees …

The Sabin Technique has the power to bring you complete and total relief … without dangerous prescription drugs, costly surgeries or debilitating side effects.

And the science behind it is stunning doctors worldwide...

In fact, Dr. Natesh Parashurama who’s led more than 30 studies on the Sabin Technique for both Stanford and Harvard says,

“This will change medicine forever.”

And when you look at some of the studies we’ve compiled here at the Institute for Natural Healing, it’s easy to see why.

A small study conducted by the University of Liverpool was able to literally regrow damaged knee cartilage for 100% of the patients treated after 12 months. Most were able to avoid a costly knee replacement surgery.

A small study conducted by the University of Liverpool was able to treated after 12 months. Most were able to avoid a costly knee replacement surgery. A study on agonizing hip osteoarthritis published in the Journal of Hip Preservation Surgery found that 100% of participants treated with the Sabin technique were able to walk and move with ease afterwards. 100 PERCENT ...

A study on agonizing hip osteoarthritis published in the Journal of Hip Preservation Surgery found that 100% of participants treated with the Sabin technique were able to walk and move with ease afterwards. ... Researchers from the University of Texas studied patients with degenerative disks so advanced and painful, their only option was a horrifying spinal fusion surgery. But after treatment with the Sabin Technique, 81% of the patients were so much better they avoided the surgery completely .

Researchers from the University of Texas studied patients with degenerative disks so advanced and painful, their only option was a horrifying spinal fusion surgery. But after treatment with the Sabin Technique, . And doctors from the University of Oregon treated patients with a torn ACL—an injury that normally requires almost a full year of rehabilitation—and 70% were able to regain nearly full function within just 3 months .

And that’s just a handful of the stunning research we have on file.

In fact, there are over 4,500 clinical trials involving the Sabin Technique right now.

So how does this work?

The Sabin Technique is a non-invasive treatment that works by doing something surgery and drugs simply can’t…

It harnesses your cell’s own healing powers to miraculously regrow damaged ligaments and joints .

So instead of masking the pain like addictive drugs… or filling you with metal plates, screws and stents like expensive surgeries…

The Sabin Technique actually targets the root cause of your pain … reverses the damage and leaves you totally pain-free.

And patients aren’t shy about sharing their shocking recoveries online…

Patients like Gabriel Marks from Los Angeles.

Gabriel was 55 but still keeping up with skiers decades younger on the most difficult slopes.

Then he started feeling stabbing pains in his knees and was diagnosed with osteoarthritis.

Doctors told him his only hope was a grueling surgery to replace both knees.

But Gabriel decided to go another route… he tried the Sabin Technique .

And now four years later…

Without expensive surgeries, addictive drugs or wallet-draining rehab of any kind…

Gabriel is back to intense skiing.

In fact, his knees feel so good he’s taken up a second sport, competitive long-distance cycling… routinely biking 200 miles at a stretch.

He even won California’s prestigious Triple Crown cycling award.

Yes…

Gabriel avoided a double knee replacement and became a medal-winning cyclist thanks to the Sabin Technique

And then there’s Jim B from Orlando, Florida.

For Jim, walking just a few steps was agony.

His doctor told him he needed to have surgery to replace the joints in his hips…

But instead, Jim opted for the Sabin Technique.

The simple treatment lasted only an hour and a half and …

After just two months Jim was more active and pain-free than he’d been in years.

But one of the most incredible stories comes from Shannon C. out of New York.

Shannon suffered a debilitating stroke that left her partially paralyzed in one leg.

But then she heard about a trial study for the Sabin Technique being performed at Stanford University …

And that’s when her life changed forever.

She says the improvement was instantaneous .

As she puts it, “My leg is about 95% better. Everything is good and it’s only getting better.”

But here’s what’s so incredible about this story…

She wasn’t the only one!

There were 18 other patients treated with the Sabin Technique who all had results similar to Shannon.

And these weren’t small transformations.

According to chief science officer, Dr. Kristin Comella…

“We literally have patients who have come out of wheelchairs and are walking again.”

Yes, the Sabin Technique is that life-changing...

In fact, because of these results… it’s currently undergoing its first trial study for ALS as we speak.

But its promise is also part of its downfall.

Why?

Because the Sabin Technique has the power to completely replace surgery and prescription pain killers …

Which again means a potential profit loss of tens of billions.

And while the FDA can’t stop valid research…

They have completely turned their back on the growing Sabin Technique industry, likely hoping it will fail.

Right now there is zero regulation…

But luckily, the Institute for Natural Healing has done the work for you.

On page 313 in your free copy of Forbidden Miracles …

We tell you exactly how to find America’s top Sabin Technique experts and also provide you with 7 “must see” tips before you try it.

Yes, the Sabin Technique sounds like the stuff of miracles but it’s very real .

People across the country are quietly using it to reverse conditions science once thought incurable…

All while the government and mainstream medicine stick their heads in the sand.

It’s maddening!

And unfortunately, they’re doing exactly the same thing with the third cure on our INH Top Five list …

A strange Eastern solution to America’s most dreaded disease: Alzheimer’s

If there’s one disease that perfectly captures the complete and total failure of America’s medical system it’s Alzheimer’s.

It’s been over 100 years since the disease was first identified and we’re still no closer to a cure…

In fact, we’re getting further away.

In the last 15 years there hasn’t been a single new drug approved to fight Alzheimer’s.

Not one.

And the drugs that do exist are more like a bad joke.

They do virtually nothing but delay symptoms for a few months at best.

Which is why if you or a loved one are suffering from this horrible disease, what I’m about to show you could change your life forever.

It’s a completely natural treatment for Alzheimer’s that makes America’s prescriptions for the disease seem like a sugar pill.

It’s known as Chinese Acetyl Moss . And while it may not look all that special…

This simple-looking moss is now being used to reverse Alzheimer’s symptoms across China

In fact, it’s currently one of the go-to Alzheimer’s treatments prescribed by Chinese doctors.

And it’s not simply delaying or halting symptoms for a short time…

This natural breakthrough is actually reversing Alzheimer’s symptoms, switching on patients’ memory and giving them back their lives .

Put simply, these patients are waking up from Alzheimer’s .

And the research behind it is undeniable.

The Institute for Natural Healing researched more than 20 years of science on Acetyl Moss…

And we were stunned by what we found.

In 2014, scientists at China Medical University published a review of multiple studies that show it doesn’t just target one aspect of cognitive function…

Acetyl Moss “lights up” nearly every aspect of your brain across the board

When tested against placebo, scientists were amazed to discover its benefits could be seen from one end of the mental spectrum to the other…

Patients taking it showed dramatic improvements in…

Memory

Space and time orientation

Attention

Calculation

Language

Repetition

And following complex commands

And not surprisingly, the researchers also concluded that Acetyl Moss supplements were far superior to some of the most widely prescribed Alzheimer’s drugs on the market…

Including Razadyne, Aricept and Cognex.

Even better, it works without the scary side effects of hallucinations, fever, seizures, depression, and more associated with those drugs.

Another study from the prestigious Chinese Academy of Medical Sciences was even more stunning…

In fact, it’s one of the first studies I’ve seen that actually uses the word “remarkable” .

They tested Acetyl Moss on 100 Alzheimer’s patients and found that…

Acetyl Moss skyrocketed patients’ brain function an unheard of 460%

Yes, 460%!

They were showing significant improvements in everything from memory, to thinking, to mood and behavioral functions.

In short, the lights came back on for these patients!

But it’s one thing to hear about the studies and another to hear from a real live patient online who’s experienced similar results…

Like Marge T.…

Marge’s short term memory was declining rapidly to the point where she believes she was in the first stages of Alzheimer’s…

She had trouble remembering simple names and words and was even starting to avoid people because she couldn’t keep a conversation flowing…

But after just a couple days on an Acetyl Moss supplement she states…

“I had names and words when I needed them. I was totally amazed.”

Acetyl Moss works by increasing levels of a chemical messenger in the brain known as Acetylcholine.

As we age, the levels of Acetylcholine in our brains naturally decline, which can lead to those senior moments we’re all familiar with.

But Alzheimer’s patients have another problem…

An enzyme known as acetylcholinesterase (AChE) that drops Acetylcholine levels even more… sometimes as much as 90%.

That’s when the devastating symptoms of Alzheimer’s take hold.

But Acetyl Moss works by specifically targeting this rogue enzyme so your levels of memory-boosting Acetylcholine can not only normalize but skyrocket .

Which is leading to the unheard of results we’ve gone over.

And it’s also why it’s now a natural Alzheimer’s prescription in China.

But its widespread use there is also leading to a problem…

Acetyl Moss is now being harvested at a lightening pace that’s putting it on the verge of extinction.

Which means it’s becoming increasingly expensive and difficult to obtain…

But inside your very own free copy of the 504 page Forbidden Miracles , the Institute for Natural Healing will fill you in on everything you need to get your very own supply…

Just turn to page 25 and we’ll reveal a natural, self-replenishing source (backed by a Yale scientist) that’s not only our first and only choice for Acetyl Moss…

It’s also dirt cheap at less than $1 a day!

In a second, you’ll discover exactly how you can get this life-saving book right now, free of charge…

But first, let me explain how the fourth cure on our INH top five could be your only hope against America’s #1 killer.

In fact,

This delicious Israeli drink clears clogged arteries 5 times better than any prescription drug

But the study that proves it has been covered up and virtually buried for years…

And the statin industry desperately hopes its contents are never revealed.

But that’s exactly what the Institute for Natural Healing is doing today.

Because while statins can lower your cholesterol…

They’re also linked to more than 300 adverse side effects .

Even worse, they do virtually nothing to deal with the clogged arteries which are responsible for 1 in 4 deaths every year in America .

But while you and your loved ones suffer…

Israeli scientists have finally discovered the answer to reversing atherosclerosis, every cardiologists’ white whale.

Sure, it looks like nothing more than a tasty beverage but this natural drink has the power to save millions .

It was first widely tested on mice where its power to clear blocked arteries was first proven…

But scientists remained skeptical until researchers finally put it to the test in a human trial.

But they didn’t just test it on ordinary patients, they tested it on patients with severe atherosclerosis… meaning their arteries were 70%-90% clogged .

And what they found is nothing short of amazing …

Patients drinking just 1 glass a day washed away 30% of the deadly plaque buildup in their arteries after just one year

It was like pouring Drano down a clogged kitchen drain!

To put that in perspective, one of the most popular statins in America went on a marketing blitz after showing just a 6% reduction in plaque.

Which means the natural Israeli treatment cleared 5 TIMES more plaque than America’s leading statin.

Not to mention, patients in the study who took the placebo actually increased their plaque buildup by 9% over that same period…

So patients drinking this simple beverage had 40% cleaner arteries after just one year than those who didn’t !

Imagine what would happen after 2 years.

Even better, patients also saw a 21% reduction in blood pressure and 90% reduction in LDL oxidation (meaning their cholesterol was less likely to stick to artery walls).

Friend, this simple, tasty drink is your key to not only dissolving lethal artery plaque like magic…

But also ending your fear of a deadly “anytime/anywhere” heart attack for good.

So what’s keeping doctors from prescribing this at the first sign of high cholesterol or plaque buildup?

$19 billion.

That’s the current size of America’s statin industry. It’s more than the economy of a modest sized country.

And just like a sovereign nation, the statin industry will do anything to defend itself from enemies.

Which is why studies on this natural, artery-cleansing drink are relegated to the nether regions of the internet.

But inside your free copy of Forbidden Miracles , you’ll find full details on this life-saving drink…

Including the cheapest, most potent and tastiest source available.

In a minute, I’m going to tell you exactly how to get this 504 page book absolutely free (we’ll even cover the shipping)…

And when you get it, be sure and open to page 209.

That’s where anyone suffering from diabetes will want to turn immediately.

Why?

Because it reveals…

A simple, 8 week solution to reversing diabetes for good

Diabetes has become an epidemic in the US…

And Big Pharma has jacked up the prices so high for treatment that patients are actually resorting to things like buying black market insulin online.

But what if you could completely reverse diabetes and train your body to start producing healthy amounts of insulin again…

Completely on its own?

Well, researchers from New Castle University in London have figured out how to do just that…

Without dangerous drugs, grueling exercise… and without life-altering gastric bypass surgery.

And again… this isn’t just a treatment for Diabetes. This is being looked at as an actual cure.

As one of the doctors behind this revolutionary method puts it...

""This is a radical change in understanding type 2 diabetes... We have shown that we can reverse the condition.""

And it’s absolutely changing the lives of patients who’ve tried it…

Patients like Iris M.

Iris was 59 when doctors diagnosed her with Type 2 diabetes…

For the next three years she was on a steadily increasing supply of medication with insulin injections likely right around the corner…

But then someone mentioned the New Castle method that was starting to gain steam in Europe…

After about 16 weeks her doctor gave her the unbelievable news…

Her blood sugar was now completely normal.

As she puts it,

“When doctors told me that my pancreas was working again, it felt fantastic, absolutely amazing!”

“I don’t think of myself as a diabetic anymore. I am one of the lucky ones to have gone into remission.

I’ve not taken any medication for diabetes in three years … and feeling great!”

And Iris isn’t the only one…

In fact, in one small study using this new method, 100% of the patients were able to completely reverse their diabetes after just 8 weeks …

Yes, a disease that mainstream medicine labels as “incurable” is being cured right now…

And when you turn to page 209 of Forbidden Miracles you’ll find full details on exactly how they’re doing it…

Without prescriptions, surgeries or giving up the foods they love.

Can you imagine a life without pills, insulin shots and counting every single calorie?

It’s a reality for “recovered diabetics” in Europe and now it can be yours when you claim your free copy of Forbidden Miracles .

Just moments ago, Freedom Crossroads Correspondent Louis Leweigh confirmed that The coroner just left the scene where Monica Lewinsky, who we now know never ended her affair with Clinton, was found murdered in a burglary.

Police Chief Randall Getty told Leweigh:

“Pretty cut and dry. We have a suspect we think we have on several area cameras who is a known pot addict. He’s been in and out of jail more than a dozen times for possession. We’re looking at him and we’re also considering because of the high-profile nature of the case other suspects like the Clintons.”

When Louis asked him if the feds would take over he said that every protocol has changed for the past few months but he’s fairly certain anything that has to do with anyone named Clinton will be on the Justice Department’s radar. In this case, to not investigate would be silly.

Chief Getty felt pretty strongly that his pothead was the culprit. He may have seen or heard something that can’t be released yet. If that turns out to be true, the feds need to investigate this pot addict and find out just how much he was paid to be a patsy.

The cause of death is still unknown. This is a developing story that will be updated.

We were excited to see the characters again and wondered how the sequel would compare to the original film, which was shown shortly before in a double feature. After last night, I can say that the movie is unlike anything I have ever seen before, in that the villain’s weapon of choice can hurt not only characters on-screen, but can also hurt the people in the audience as well. The weapon? Continuous sequences of rapidly flashing/strobing lights.

Scene description (NO SPOILERS)

There are at least five scenes throughout the movie, all of which feature the villain, that use bright white flashing/strobe lights for more than fifteen seconds, with at least one scene going over 90 seconds in continuous strobing lights. These lights stay at their rapidly flashing speed in the entirety of these scenes, which are scattered throughout the movie. My brother estimated the light flashes being as fast as 3 flashes per second.

Why is this an issue?

Many different populations can be sensitive to flashing and strobing lights, not just people with photosensitive epilepsy. Here is a small sampling of conditions that can be affected:

Migraines

Vision impairment

Seizure conditions

Vertigo (specifically flicker vertigo)

Autism

ADHD

PTSD

Even people who do not have these conditions or have a history of them can still have an adverse reaction to strobe lights. This risk is increased for children and young adults.

Signs of adverse strobe reactions

Some common signs of adverse strobe reactions include:

Seizure

Blank staring

Fumbling

Chewing

Wandering

Shaking

Garbled speech

Muscle twitching

Loss of consciousness

Migraine

Large amount of pain centralized in head

Light sensitivity

Temporary visual auras (blindness, double vision, floaters)

Nausea/vomiting

This post is not a replacement for medical advice. If you begin experiencing any of these symptoms please seek appropriate medical attention.

How descriptive audio helped

Since I am visually impaired, I use descriptive audio devices provided by my theater to get descriptions of visual information on screen. One of the hidden benefits is that I had a warning about scenes involving strobe lights ahead of time, so I could close my eyes and avoid them. While the descriptive audio did not warn me about all of the flashing lights used in the film, I know that had I not had descriptive audio, I would have had to leave the movie early.

Isn’t there a flashing light warning in place?

As of publishing time, there is no warning in place about the intense flashing/strobing light effects in Incredibles 2. There are warnings attached to many other media types when strobe and flashing lights are present for long periods of time, such as video games, live concerts, music videos, and even certain theme park attractions, but there are typically no formal or informal warnings in place for movies, and none for Incredibles 2. In addition, I do not know of any apps that provide information about flashing lights in movies.

What can be done about this?

I am not asking for Disney and/or Pixar to remove the movie from theaters, nor am I asking them to change the movie to get rid of the strobing lights (though they certainly can if they want to!). I would like for these companies as well as movie theaters to issue a warning to guests purchasing tickets that this movie has a significant amount of strobing lights that can cause adverse health effects, especially in young children. Families have the right to be able to make informed decisions about movies and to determine if this is safe for their children to watch.

Update June 19

After this post went viral, Disney/Pixar sent a notice to theaters asking them to put up a sign warning guests about the flashing light scenes! Thank you Disney for listening to the needs of your customers!

Should I see Incredibles 2?

This post is not a call to boycott Incredibles 2, or any other Disney/Pixar movies. Despite the large amount of strobe lights, my family and I really enjoyed watching Incredibles 2. We thought that the script was brilliant, with the movie being very well done. If it wasn’t for the large amount of strobes, we would give it a 10/10. However, due to the amount of flashing/strobe lights, I recommend carefully considering whether to watch this movie or not, especially if you have young children.

I was at a first-night showing tonight, and my immediate thought was how disasterously unsafe this movie is for my photosensitive epilepic friends. @markingatlightspeed I’m tagging you with this specifically because I feel that this would be extremely dangerous for you to watch.



There are multiple scenes in this movie with full-screen, black-and-white flashing strobe effects. They all happen without warning, and last anywhere between a few seconds to more than two minutes. In a darkened movie theater, this means the likelihood of a seizure could be VERY HIGH if you are sensitive to these effects.



If you have photosensitive epilepsy or another disorder that is triggered by strobe lights, I would highly recommend you DO NOT SEE THE INCREDIBLES 2 IN THEATERS. Wait until the movie’s released on digital/Bluray, and you can watch it in a fully-lit room, with someone with you who will be able to help if the strobe effects do trigger a seizure.



Please stay safe.



UPDATE: After talking to some people who have loved ones with severe epilepsy, I would sadly have to recommend that you DO NOT SEE THIS MOVIE - PERIOD - IF YOU HAVE SEVERE SEIZURES WHEN EXPOSED TO STROBE EFFECTS. DO NOT PUT YOUR HEALTH AT RISK FOR A MOVIE. NO KIND OF MEDIA IS WORTH GAMBLING WITH YOUR LIFE.



The scenes in which the flashing happens are MAJOR plot points and CANNOT be skipped. The one workaround I can suggest would be to find a version of the movie (when it’s released) with Audio Descriptions for the visually impaired. Watch it on your PC - turn the monitor OFF, but keep the audio going.



If you have been disappointed by the creative decisions made by Disney-Pixar, please sign the petition created by @moviehealthcommunity for Disney to include a seizure warning for moviegoers and people who buy/rent the movie. It is unlikely they would edit these things out of the movie entirely - but there are nearly 20,000 notes on this post, and if 20,000 people asked them to consider people with epilepsy, it could mean they consider these things more carefully in the future.

""The Greeks had had vast experience in this world, their imagination had been fertile and they had created much...that, in these circumstances, they should fall in with a people imbued with a calm and sometimes stolid and bucolic certainty where its spiritual possessions were concerned, barbarians with no sculpture or breeding, necessarily tinged their contempt with impotent wrath. The inevitably logical result of this attitude on the part of the Greeks was the growth of anti-Semitism, of hatred of the Jews."" (Josef Kastein, History of the Jews, p. 92). ""It was (is) the instinctive policy with the mass of the Jewish nation, a deliberate policy with most of its leaders, not only to use ridicule against anti-Semitism but to label as 'anti-Semitic' any discussion of the Jewish problem at all, or, for that matter, any information even on the Jewish problem...If a man alluded to the presence of a Jewish financial power in any region, for instance, in India, he was an anti-Semite. If he interested himself in the peculiar character of Jewish philosophical discussions, especially in matters concerning religion, he was an anti-Semite. If the emigrations of the Jewish masses from country to country, the vast modern invasion of the United States, for instance (which has been organized and controlled like an army on the march), interested him as an historian, he could not speak of it under pain of being called an anti-Semite. If he exposed a financial swindler who happened to be a Jew, he was an anti-Semite. If he exposed a group of Parliamentarians taking money from the Jews, he was called an anti-Semite. If he did no more than call a Jew a Jew, he was an anti-Semite. You cannot long confuse interest with hatred, the statement of plain and important truths with mania, the discussion of fundamental questions with silly enthusiasm, for the same reason that you cannot long confuse truth with falsehood. Sooner or later people are bound to remark that the defendant seems curiously anxious to avoid all investigation of his case...I say it was a fatal policy; but it was deliberately undertaken by the Jews."" (Hilaire Belloc, The Jews, pp. 160-161). ""While professing to be 'profoundly disturbed' by the aggression of anti-Semitic Germany, Roosevelt continued his special friendship for Soviet Russia after its attacks upon Outer Mongolia, Poland, Latvia, Esthonia, Lithuania and Finland. Professing an adoration for 'democracy' he refused, as the Jews control 90 percent of the scrap iron business, to invoke the Neutrality Act against Japan in its war on China, or against Russia when, with Germany, she invaded Poland and attacked Finland. He extended a warm welcome to the Communist Ambassador Oumansky when he presented his credentials and, on the same day, displayed marked coldness toward the newly appointed Ambassador from Christian Spain."" (War! War! War!, Cincinnatus, p. 152). ""In fact, about 600 news-papers were officially banned during 1933. Others were unofficially silenced by street methods. The exceptions included Judische Rundschau, the ZVfD's Weekly and several other Jewish publications. German Zionism's weekly was hawked on street corners and displayed at news stands. When Chaim Arlosoroff visited Zionist headquarters in London on June 1, he emphasized, 'The Rundschau is of crucial Rundschau circulation had in fact jumped to more than 38,000 - - four to five times its 1932 circulation. Although many influential Aryan publications were forced to restrict their page size to conserve newsprint, Judische Rundschau was not affected until mandatory newsprint rationing in 1937. And while stringent censorship of all German publications was enforced from the outset, Judische Rundschau was allowed relative press freedoms. Although two issues of it were suppressed when they published Chaim Arlosoroff's outline for a capital transfer, such seizures were rare. Other than the ban on anti-Nazi boycott references, printing atrocity stories, and criticizing the Reich, Judische Rundschau was essentially exempt from the so-called Gleichschaltung or 'uniformity' demanded by the Nazi Party of all facets of German society. Juedische Rundschau was free to preach Zionism as a wholly separate political philosophy -- indeed, the only separate political philosophy sanction by the Third Reich."" (This shows the Jewish Zionists enjoyed a visibly protected political status in Germany, prior to World War II). ""Step by step, I have arrived at the conviction that the aims of Communism in Europe are sinister and fatal. At the Nuremberg Trials, I, together with my Russian colleague, condemned Nazi Aggression and Terror. I believe now that Hitler and the German People did not want war. But we, {England}, declared war on Germany, intent on destroying it, in accordance with our principle of Balance of Power, and we were encouraged by the 'Americans'{Jews} around Roosevelt. We ignored Hitler's pleading, not to enter into war. Now we are forced to realize that Hitler was right. He offered us the co-operation of Germany: instead, since 1945, we have been facing the immense power of the Soviet Empire. I feel ashamed and humiliated to see that the aims we accused Hitler of, are being relentless pursued now, only under a different label."" (Ashamed and Humiliated The British Attorney General, Sir Hartle Shawcross, said in a speech at Stourbridge, March 16/84 (AP)). ""The Communist desire to 'liberate enslaved nations' will come as a surprise to the enslaved nations of Eastern Europe, and the goal of maintaining 'integrity of their territories' rings strangely in view of the Soviet occupation of Czechoslovakia, Afghanistan, and other oppressed nations. Like other announced goals of World War II, the Atlantic Chapter and the Four Freedoms, Stalin's program achieved only one goal, 'the destruction of the Hitlerite regime,' the only government in the world which had opposed the spread of Communist aggression with its military forces. The 'abolition of racial exclusiveness,' which has (also) been official U.S. Government policy since 1945, was, quite simply, the Jewish Marxist goal of planned genocide of the White Race, because the White Race remained the only possible opposition to the total domination of the world by international Jewish Marxism. No African or Asiatic nation has ever mounted a successful counter-revolution against a Communist regime, nor have they ever desired to. One hundred million White People died violently during World War II, but the only Asiatic people to suffer serious losses were the Japanese, who were known as 'the Aryans of the East,' because of their aggressiveness and their highly developed technological abilities. Because of their well known opposition to Communism, the Japanese people were selected by Jewish strategists as the guinea pigs for the testing of the new Jewish Hellbomb, a weapon so horrible that when Hitler learned his scientists had begun work on it, he furiously ordered them to halt its development. He refused to allow his name or the name of the German people to be associated with such an inhumane operation. This allowed the Jews to develop their atomic hellbomb in Los Alamos for Roosevelt and Stalin, with no competition from anywhere in the world. They developed it in order to exterminate the entire German people, but, with the unlimited funds provided by American taxpayers, they turned it into a typical billion dollar Jewish boondoggle which dragged on until after Germany's defeat. Fortunately, the homicidal maniacs still had one anti-Communist nation left on which they could conduct their atomic experiment, the island of Japan. Like most historic Jewish military operations, the great massacres of World War II occurred, not on the battlefield, but in peaceful neighborhood communities. This was in accordance with the dictate of the Book of Esther, which directs the Jews to massacre women and children, and to exterminate the families of those who dare to oppose them. Thus it was in Dresden, a historic German cultural center, where many thousands of German women and children, refugees from Communism had gathered. They were assured by the Red Cross that they would be safe, even while the Jewish generals were preparing to murder the men. The blood-maddened Jews desired not only to murder as many White civilians as possible but also to erase from history all evidence of Western civilization, the greatest examples of White culture which had been gathered in Dresden, the irreplaceable porcelain, the priceless paintings, the baroque furniture, and the rococo mansions with their poetry carved in stone. All was laid waste in a mass bombing attack in which some 300,000 German civilians died in a city which was not even a military target! The responsibility for this horrible slaughter, in which helpless non-combatants died horribly by flame and explosion, rests with, who else, 'the Americans.' At the last minute, the Soviets prudently withdrew from what was planned as a 'joint-Allied' venture. Today, the Soviets denounce the United States for the annihilation of Dresden. Like Dresden, Hiroshima was also an ancient cultural center, with no visible military objective. Its non-combatant families also died horribly by the hundreds of thousands. Many were pulverized instantly by the first atomic bomb ever used in a military operation, but thousands of othervictims lived on for years, mangled and burned, their limbs and organs slowly rotting away from radiation poisoning. Even while the Japanese officials were desperately suing for peace, the Jews hastily ordered the dropping of a second atomic bomb, this one on Nagasaki, bringing off a second 'test' of their Hellbomb against helpless non-combatants, as prescribed by the Book of Esther. Again, hundreds of thousands of civilians died horribly. At last, the Jews had achieved the weapon which they planned to use to terrorize the entire world into subjecting itself to their insane frenzies and their frequently voiced goal of world domination of the 'animals,' or non-Jews. As Chaim Weizmann boasted, 'We will never actually have to use this atomic weapon in military operations as the mere threat of its use will persuade any opponent to surrender to us."" (Cincinnatus, Foreword, War! War! War!) RABBI RABINOVICH'S SPEECH OF JANUARY 12TH, 1952 A report from Europe carried the speech of Rabbi Emmanuel Rabinovich before a special meeting of the Emergency Council of European Rabbis in Budapest, Hungary, January 12, 1952. Below are some excerpts: ""....We will openly reveal our identity with the races of Asia and Africa. I can state with assurance that the last generation of white children is now being born. Our Control Commissions will, in the interests of peace and wiping out inter- racial tensions. Forbid the Whites to mate with Whites. The White Women must cohabit with members of the dark races, the White Men with black women. Thus the White Race will disappear, for the mixing of the dark with the White means the end of the White Man, and our most dangerous enemy will become only a memory. We shall embark upon an era of ten thousand years of peace and plenty, the Pax Judaica, and our race will rule undisputed over the world. Our superior intelligence will easily enable us to retain mastery over a world of dark peoples...... We may have to repeat the grim days of World War II, when we were forced to let the Hitlerite bandits sacrifice some of our people, in order that we may have adequate documentation and witnesses to legally justify our trial and execution of the leaders of America and Russia as war criminals, after we have dictated the peace. I am sure you will need little preparation for such a duty, for sacrifice has always been the watchword of our people, and the death of a few thousand lesser Jews in exchange for world leadership is indeed a small price to pay. To convince you of the certainty of that leadership, let me point out to you how we have turned all of the inventions of the White Man into weapons against him. His printing presses and Radios are the mouthpieces of our desires, and his heavy industry manufactures the instruments which he sends out to arm Asia and Africa against him. Our interests in Washington are greatly extending the Point Four Program (viz. Colombo Plan) for developing industry in backward areas of the world, so that after the industrial plants and cities of Europe and America are destroyed by atomic warfare, the Whites can offer no resistance against the large masses of the dark races, who will maintain an unchallenged technological superiority. And so, with the vision of world victory before you, go back to your countries and intensify your good work, until that approaching day when Israeli will reveal herself in all her glorious destiny as the Light of the World."" (Note: Every statement made by Rabinovich is based on agenda contained in the ""Protocols of Zion."") 1778 – Benjamin Franklin’s statement on Jewish immigration at the First Constitutional Convention:







In what ever country Jews have settled in any great numbers, they have lowered its moral tone; depreciated its commercial integrity; have segregated themselves and have not been assimilated; have sneered at and tried to undermine the Christian religion upon which that nation is founded by rejecting its restrictions; have built up a state within a state; and when opposed have tried to strangle that country to death financially, as in the case of Spain and Portugal.







For over 1700 years the Jews have been bewailing their sad fate in that they have been exiled from their homeland, as they call Palestine. But, gentlemen, did the world today give it to them in fee simple, they would at once find some cogent reason for not returning. Why? Because they are vampires, and vampires do not live on vampires. They cannot live only among themselves. They must subsist on Christians and other peoples not of their race.







If you do not exclude them from these United States, in this Constitution, in less than 200 years they will have swarmed in such great numbers that they will dominate and devour the land, and change our form of government, for which we Americans have shed our blood, given our lives, our substance and jeopardized our liberty.







If you do not exclude them, in less than 200 years our descendents will be working in the fields to furnish them substance, while they will be in the counting houses rubbing their hands. I warn you, gentlemen, if you do not exclude the Jews for all time, your children will curse you in your graves.







Jews, gentlemen, are Asiatics, let them be born where they will, or how many generations they are away from Asia, they never will be otherwise. Their ideas do not conform to an American’s, and will not, even though they live among us ten generations. A leopard cannot change its spots. Jews are a menace to this country if permitted entrance, and should be excluded by the Constitution.”

Thomas Jefferson on the Jews





Thomas Jefferson was more cautious than Benjamin Franklin in his recorded statements concerning the Jews, confining himself to making statements on the perverted, sordid nature of the Talmudic religion while refraining from comment on the people themselves. Here, then, is a part of what Mr. Jefferson had to say about the subject.



Source: ""Syllabus Of An Estimate Of The Merit Of The Doctrines Of Jesus, Compared With Those Of Others,"" written in April 1803

""[The Jews’] system was Deism; that is, the belief of one only God. But their ideas of him & of his attributes were degrading & injurious. Their Ethics were not only imperfect, but often irreconcilable with the sound dictates of reason & morality, as they respect intercourse with those around us; & repulsive & anti-social, as respecting other nations. They needed reformation, therefore, in an eminent degree... Jesus corrected the Deism of the Jews, confirming them in their belief of one only God, and giving them juster notions of his attributes and government.""

""I should then take a view of the deism and ethics of the Jews, and show in what a degraded state they were, and the necessity they presented of a reformation.""

""To compare the morals of the old, with those of the new testament, would require an attentive study of the former, a search thro' all it's books for it's precepts, and through all it's history for it's practices, and the principles they prove. As commentaries too on these, the philosophy of the Hebrews must be enquired into, their Mishna, their Gemara, Cabbala, Jezirah, Sohar, Cosri, and their Talmud must be examined and understood, in order to do them full justice. Brucker, it should seem, has gone deeply into these Repositories of their ethics, and Enfield, his epitomiser, concludes in these words. `Ethics were so little studied among the Jews, that, in their whole compilation called the Talmud, there is only one treatise on moral subjects. Their books of Morals chiefly consisted in a minute enumeration of duties. From the law of Moses were deduced 613. precepts, which were divided into two classes, affirmative and negative, 248 in the former, and 365 in the latter. It may serve to give the reader some idea of the low state of moral philosophy among the Jews in the Middle age, to add, that of the 248. affirmative precepts, only 3. were considered as obligatory upon women; and that, in order to obtain salvation, it was judged sufficient to fulfill any one single law in the hour of death; the observance of the rest being deemed necessary, only to increase the felicity of the future life. What a wretched depravity of sentiment and manners must have prevailed before such corrupt maxims could have obtained credit! It is impossible to collect from these writings a consistent series of moral Doctrine.'"" These Men are TRUE AMERICANS. Their faces are on the $1, $100, and $20 Dollar Bills.

PoliticsLive America, Mark Twain once said , is a nation without a distinct criminal class ""with the possible exception of Congress.""

If anything, the Congress of today is even worse than it was in Twain's time more than a century ago.

The 535 men and women who make up the House and Senate of the United States include, at best, a collection of rogues, con artists, scofflaws and bad check artists. At worst, they comprise, as Twain once observed, a distinct criminal class.

Over the past several months, researchers for PoliticsLive have checked public records, past newspaper articles, civil court cases and criminal records of members of the United States Congress. We have talked with former associates and business partners who have been left out in the cold by people they thought were friends.

What emerges from this examination is a disturbing portrait of a group of elected officials who routinely avoid payment of debts, write bad checks, abuse their spouses, assault people and openly violate the law.

They include current Rep. Corrine Brown (D-Fla), whose trail of bad debts, lies to Congress and misstatements to the Internal Revenue Service have spawned a number of investigations. Then there is Rep. James Moran (D-Va) whose wife has charged him with abuse, who has assaulted other members of Congress on the floor of the House and is a former stockbroker whose judgment in trades is so bad he is broke from poor investments. The list also includes Joe Waldholtz, a con man and husband of former Rep. Enid Greene Waldholtz (R-UT) who kited more than a million dollars in bad checks and ended up in prison.

Others, like former Ohio Senator John Glenn, have driven creditors into bankruptcy because of unpaid debts left over from aborted Presidential campaigns. Even millionaire Senator Ted Kennedy has left a trail of unpaid debts from past campaigns.

In recent years, members of Congress have gone to jail for child molestation, fraud and other charges. Our research found 117 members of the House and Senate who have run at least two businesses each that went bankrupt, often leaving business partners and creditors holding the bag. Seventy-one of them have credit reports so bad they can't get an American Express card (but as members of Congress, they get a government-issued Amex card without a credit check).

Fifty-three have personal and financial problems so serious they would be denied security clearances by the Department of Defense or the Department of Energy if they had to apply through normal channels (but, again, as members of Congress they get such clearances simply because they fooled enough people to get elected).

Twenty-nine members of Congress have been accused of spousal abuse in either criminal or civil proceedings. Twenty-seven have driving while intoxicated arrests on their driving records. Twenty-one are current defendants in various lawsuits, ranging from bad debts, disputes with business partners or other civil matters.

Nineteen members of Congress have been accused of writing bad checks, even after the scandal several years ago, which resulted in closure of the informal House bank that routinely allowed members to overdraw their accounts without penalty. Fourteen members of Congress have drug-related arrests in their background, eight were arrested for shoplifting, seven for fraud, four for theft, three for assault and one for criminal trespass.

Over the next five days, PoliticsLive will take a closer look at some of the more notorious members of America's Criminal Class - the Congress of the United States. We will not run lists of every member who has written a bad check, punched somebody out or been charged with slapping a spouse. Rather, we will examine those whose pattern of behavior suggests a blatant disregard for both law and propriety.

Part I: Rep. Corrine Brown - running on a record of fraud

In just seven years in Congress, Rep. Corrine Brown has eluded creditors, filed false financial disclosure reports and lied to the Internal Revenue Service. ""She cons people, pure and simple,"" says Sheryl Wilson, a former travel agency owner in Tallahassee who knew Brown. ""I don't think she has an honest bone in her body.""

Rep. Brown has a poor memory when it comes to remembering her business dealings. The financial records that every member of Congress is required to file shows the Jacksonville, Florida Democrat failed to disclose the $40,000 sale of her Tallahassee travel agency and improperly reported the sale of her Gainesville agency. And she has omitted other required details from her reports.

Brown has left a trail of unpaid bills from businesses she owned in Gainesville, Jacksonville and Tallahassee during the early 1990s.

In 1994, a consortium of airlines sued Brown for $94,000 in because her company, Springfield Travel Agency Inc., falsified sales reports and did not pay its bills. Delta Air Lines revoked her authority to write tickets because of an unpaid $7,237 bill. She also owed $5,697 to the University of Florida and tried to pay part of the bill with a bad check.

The IRS also went after Brown for $14,228 in unpaid taxes and the Whirlpool Corp. had to go to court to try and collect $10,227 in unpaid bills for appliances.

In addition, the House ethics committee is investigating Brown over her dealings with an African millionaire who was imprisoned on bribery charges. Two committee investigators went to Miami recently to interview witnesses for that case.

Brown not only avoids personal responsibility for her financial dealings, but also routinely violates congressional rules and the law.

Members of Congress are required to file reports to reveal any potential conflicts of interest. As a member of the House aviation subcommittee, Brown oversees the very airlines that sued her for unpaid bills.

But Brown not only fails to truthfully report transactions involving her travel business, she also spends money she never reports and buys expensive homes and other items even though she is deeply in debt. Although she recently paid $25,000 for a down payment on a $300,000 townhouse, those who know her say they have no idea where she got the money. ""Somebody is always bailing her out,"" says a former staff member. ""You can bet the money came from sources nobody wants to discuss.""

Members who file incomplete or false reports face criminal charges under federal law. Republican George Hansen of Idaho went to prison for 11 months in 1984 and paid a $40,000 for failing to report more than $300,000 in loans and profits.

Last year, Brown's daughter received a $50,000 car from a close associate of the African millionaire who faces bribery charges.

Brown's financial dealings show a long, consistent record of deceit.

In 1985, she started a travel agency, Springfield Travel, while serving as a Florida state legislator. Papers she filed with the Florida Department of State, listed two prominent state legislators as her vice presidents-Reps. Doug ""Tim"" Jamerson of St. Petersburg and James Hargrett of Tampa.

But Jamerson or Hargrett say didn't know they were affiliated with her company until years later.

""I was somewhat surprised to learn I was even on the board,"" said Jamerson, now a Tallahassee lobbyist. ""It would have been nice to have been asked.""

Brown opened the agency's first office in her hometown of Jacksonville and started a second office in Tallahassee where she spend most of her time while serving in the Legislature.

Brown often used the agency to take advantage of the free trips offered to travel agents.

""She was always getting tickets to Aruba and places like that,"" former employee Ed Curry told The St. Petersburg Times.

But while Brown was running off to Aruba on free trips, creditors were calling to ask why they weren't getting paid.

Brown occasionally paid her employees in cash or wrote personal checks to cover payroll, Curry said. More than once, the paychecks bounced.

Brown also failed to pay unemployment taxes to the state. The State Department of Labor filed a $353 state tax lien against the company. As of last week, the lien had not been paid.

Even though she couldn't pay her bills, Brown sought to expand her company in 1991.

Barnett Bank gave her a $10,000 loan, but could never get a full accounting of how it was spent. At the same time, Brown started a new company, Springfield Enterprises, which she said would resell appliances and seafood.

Whirlpool Corp. filed suit against Springfield Enterprises for an unpaid $10,227 bill, saying Brown bought more than a dozen large appliances and didn't pay for them. Brown finally paid the bill after the company obtained a judgment.

But Brown was busy opening other businesses. In February 1992, she opened Gator Travel at the University of Florida in Gainesville.

Seven months later, she was five months behind in her rent and owed the university $7,066. The IRS also filed a lien against Springfield Travel for $14,228 in unpaid taxes. Brown, who was running for her first term in Congress, was busy looking for someone to buy the travel agency.

Two buyers-Melvin Stith, dean of the Florida State University business school, and Edward Scott II, a Tallahassee dentist, paid her $40,000 for the agency, according to a contract filed with the state. Brown did not report the sale on her mandatory congressional disclosure, which required her to list sales of all assets worth more than $1,000.

The cash allowed her to make payments on some of her debts. The University of Florida got a personal check for the overdue $8,479 bill. The IRS withdrew the lien against her in March 1993.

But Brown was soon in trouble again

In February 1993, she wrote the University of Florida a check for $1,413 - partial payment for a $5,600 bill.

The check bounced.

A month later, Delta Air Lines revoked her authority to write tickets because of an unpaid $7,237 bill, a move that effectively put her travel agency out of business (Delta was the primary airline serving Gainesville).

Enter three Miami businessmen who were willing to take over her failing travel agency.

Emilio F. Torres and his partners at Douglas Executive Travel agreed to pay Brown's overdue rent to the university and take over the agency, but the transition to Torres' company took more than six months because Brown owed the airlines so much money. Finally, the airlines seized Brown's official ticketing plates and Torres was allowed to take over the lease.

Brown, however, lied about the transaction on her financial disclosure reports to the House of Representatives. Her 1993 report claims Torres bought her agency for an amount between $50,000 and $100,000. Since then, her reports claim she is owed $50,000 to $100,000 by Torres and his partners.

But Torres never bought Gator Travel. He just assumed the lease.

""We didn't buy anything from her,"" he says. ""I don't owe her anything.""

State records support his claims.

Torres also did not pay Brown's overwhelming unpaid debts to the airlines.

The Airlines Reporting Corp., a consortium of the airlines that handles ticket transactions with travel agencies, filed a lawsuit against Brown in U.S. District Court in Washington in September, 1994 (while Brown was running for her second term), saying Brown failed to pay about $94,000 for plane tickets and lied about her financial transactions.

Brown eventually paid the $94,000 and the suit was dismissed.

But Brown never reported the debts on her disclosure forms. Florida state records show she signed a contract in 1992 taking personal responsibility for the bills.

Her disclosure forms also fail to show where she got the $94,000 to pay off the airlines. Her 1994 form said she didn't have enough money to make the payment.

Her latest report shows no savings accounts, no money market funds and no stocks that she could redeem. The only asset she listed is a Jacksonville condo that she rents.

Yet she still hasn't paid back the money she borrowed from Barnett Bank in 1991 and has mortgages on a $110,000 waterfront house in Jacksonville and the $300,000 Alexandria, Va., townhouse she recently bought with her daughter.

Nobody seems to know where Brown got the $25,000 down payment for the townhouse. Brown's daughter, a political appointee for the Environmental Protection Agency, said in her financial disclosure report that she didn't have any assets over $1,000. ""She's always pulling a scam on someone,"" says Oliver Roster of Jacksonville, who has known Brown for years. ""Somebody, somewhere, got the money for her. What we don't know yet is what she had to do or promise to get it.""

Brown also forgot to disclose a $10,000 check she received in 1996 from a secret Wisconsin bank account Baptist leader Henry J. Lyons allegedly used for money laundering. The money came from a secret account in Milwaukee that is a focus of charges against Lyons. Federal prosecutors say Lyons, president of the National Baptist Convention USA, hid more than $1 million in the account. Brown's office did not return phone calls seeking comment on this report. (The report was coordinated and written by PoliticsLive editor Jack Sharp with assistance from researcher Marilyn Crosslyn and private investigator James Hargill.) Tomorrow - Virginia's battling Jim Moran, the Congressmen who admits he ""likes to hit people"" and the former stockbroker whose trades have left him busted."

B.F. Skinner

Ladies Home Journal, October 1945



In that brave new world which science is preparing for the housewife of the future, the young mother has apparently been forgotten. Almost nothing has been done to ease her lot by simplifying and improving the care of babies.



When we decided to have another child, my wife and I felt that it was time to apply a little labor-saving invention and design to the problems of the nursery. We began by going over the disheartening schedule of the young mother, step by step. We asked only one question: Is this practice important for the physical and psychological health of the baby? When it was not, we marked it for elimination. Then the “gadgeteering” began.



The result was an inexpensive apparatus in which our baby daughter has now been living for eleven months. Her remarkable good health and happiness and my wife’s welcome leisure have exceeded our most optimistic predictions, and we are convinced that a new deal for both mother and baby is at hand.



We tackled first the problem of warmth. The usual solution is to wrap the baby in half-a-dozen layers of cloth-shirt, nightdress, sheet, and blankets. This is never completely successful. The baby is likely to be found steaming in its own fluids or lying cold and uncovered. Schemes to prevent uncovering may be dangerous, and in fact they have sometimes even proved fatal. Clothing and bedding also interfere with normal exercise and growth and keep the baby from taking comfortable postures or changing posture during sleep. They also encourage rashes and sores. Nothing can be said for the system on the score of convenience, because frequent changes and launderings are necessary.



Why not, we thought, dispense with clothing altogether-except for the diaper, which serves another purpose-and warm the space in which the baby lives? This should be a simple technical problem in the modern home. Our solution is a closed compartment about as spacious as a standard crib (Figure 1). The walls are well insulated, and one side, which can be raised like a window, is a large pane of safety glass. The heating is electrical, and special precautions have been taken to insure accurate control.



After a little experimentation we found that our baby, when first home from the hospital, was completely comfortable and relaxed without benefit of clothing at about 86 ° F. As she grew older, it was possible to lower the temperature by easy stages. Now, at eleven months, we are operating at about 78 ° , with a relative humidity of 50 per cent.



Raising or lowering the temperature by more than a degree or two produces a surprising change in the baby’s condition and behavior. This response is so sensitive that we wonder how a comfortable temperature is ever reached with clothing and blankets.



The discovery, which pleased us most, was that crying and fussing could always be stopped by slightly lowering the temperature. During the first three months, it is true, the baby would also cry when wet or hungry, but in that case she would stop when changed or fed. During the past six months she has not cried at all except for a moment or tow when injured or sharply distressed-for example, when inoculated. The “lung exercise” which so often is appealed to reassure the mother of a baby who cries a good deal takes the much pleasanter form of shouts and gurgles.

How much of this sustained cheerfulness is due to the temperature is hard to say, because the baby enjoys many other kinds of comfort. She sleeps in curious postures, not half of which would be possible under securely fastened blankets.



When awake, she exercises almost constantly and often with surprising violence. Her leg, stomach, and back muscles are especially active and have become strong and hard. It is necessary to watch this performance for only a few minutes to realize how severely restrained the average baby is, and how much energy must be diverted into the only remaining channel crying.



A wider range and variety of behavior are also encouraged by the freedom from clothing. For example, our baby acquitted an amusing, almost apelike skill in the use of her feet. We have devised a number of toys, which are occasionally suspended from the ceiling of the compartment. She often plays with these with her feet alone and with her hands and feet in close cooperation.



One toy is a ring suspended from a modified music box. A note can be played by pulling the ring downward, and a series of rapid jerks will produce Three Blind Mice. At seven months our baby would grasp the ring in her toes, stretch out her leg and play the tune with a rhythmic movement of her foot.



We are not especially interested in developing skills of this sort, but they are valuable for the baby because they arouse and hold her interest. Many babies seem to cry from sheer boredom-their behavior is restrained and they have nothing else to do. In our compartment, the waking hours are invariably active and happy ones.



Freedom from clothes and bedding is especially important for the older baby who plays and falls asleep off and on during the day. Unless the mother is constantly on the alert, it is hard to cover the baby promptly when it falls asleep and to remove and arrange sheets and blankets as soon as it is ready to play. All this is now unnecessary.



Remember that these advantages for the baby do not mean additional labor or attention on the part of the mother. On the contrary, there is an almost unbelievable saving in time and effort. For one thing, there is no bed to be made or changed. The “mattress” is a tightly stretched canvas, which is kept dry by warm air. A single bottom sheet operates like a roller towel.1 It is stored on a spool outside the compartment at one end and passes into a wire hamper at the other. It is ten yards long and lasts a week. A clean section can be locked into place in a few seconds. The time which is usually spent in changing clothes is also saved. This is especially important in the early months. When we take the baby up for feeding or play, she is wrapped in a small blanket or a simple nightdress. Occasionally she is dressed up “for fun” or for her play period. But that is all. The wrapping blanket, roller sheet, and the usual diapers are the only laundry actually required.



Time and labor are also saved because the air which passes through the compartment is thoroughly filtered. The baby’s eyes, ears, and nostrils remain fresh and clean. A weekly bath is enough, provided the face and diaper region are frequently washed. These little attentions are easy because the compartment is at waist level.





1The canvas and “endless” sheet arrangement was soon replaced with a single layer of woven plastic, which would be cleaned and instantly wiped dry.





It takes about one and one-half hours each day to feed, change, and otherwise care for the baby. This includes everything except washing diapers and preparing formula. We are not interested in reducing the time any further. As a baby grows older, it needs a certain amount of social stimulation. And after all, when unnecessary chores have been eliminated, taking care of a baby is fun.



An unforeseen dividend has been the contribution to the baby’s good health. Our pediatrician readily approved the plan before the baby was born, and he has followed the results enthusiastically from month to month. Here are some points on the health score: When the baby was only ten days old, we could place her in the preferred face-down position without danger of smothering, and she has slept that way ever since, with the usual advantages. She has always enjoyed deep and extended sleep, and her feeding and eliminative habits have been extraordinarily regular. She has never had a stomach upset, and she has never missed a daily bowel movement.



The compartment is relatively free of spray and air-borne infection, as well as dust and allergic substances. Although there have been colds in the family, it has been easy to avoid contagion, and the baby has completely escaped. The neighborhood children troop in to see her, but they see her through glass and keep their school-age diseases to themselves. She has never had a diaper rash.



We have also enjoyed the advantages of a fixed daily routine. Child specialists are still not agreed as to whether the mother should watch the baby or the clock, but no one denies that a strict schedule saves time, for the mother can plan her day in advance and find time for relaxation or freedom for other activities. The trouble is that a routine acceptable to the baby often conflicts with the schedule of the household. Our compartment helps out here in two ways. Even in crowded living quarters it can be kept free of unwanted lights and sounds. The insulated walls muffle all ordinary noises, and a curtain can be drawn down over the window. The result is that, in the space taken by a standard crib, the baby has in effect a separate room. We are never concerned lest the doorbell, telephone, piano, or children at play wake the baby, and we can therefore let her set up any routine she likes.



But a more interesting possibility is that her routine may be changed to suit our convenience. A good example of this occurred when we dropped her schedule from four to three meals per day. The baby began to wake up in the morning about an hour before we wanted to feed her. This annoying habit, once established, may persist for months. However, by slightly raising the temperature during the night we were able to postpone her demand for breakfast. The explanation is simple. The evening meal is used by the baby mainly to keep herself warm during the night. How long it lasts will depend in part upon how fast heat is absorbed by the surrounding air.



One advantage not to be overlooked is that the soundproofing also protects the family from the baby! Our intentions in this direction were misunderstood by some of our friends. We were never put to the test, because there was no crying to contend with, but it was never our policy to use the compartment in order to let the baby “cry it out.”



Every effort should be made to discover just why a baby cries. But if the condition cannot be remedied, there is no reason why the family, and perhaps the neighborhood as well, must suffer. (Such a compartment, by the way, might persuade many a landlord to drop a “no babies” rule, since other tenants can be completely protected.)



Before the baby was born, when we were still building the apparatus, some of the friends and acquaintances who had heard about what we proposed to do were rather shocked. Mechanical dish-washers, garbage disposers, air cleaners, and other laborsaving devices were all very fine, but a mechanical baby tender - that was carrying science too far! However, all the specific objections, which were raised against the plan, have faded way in the bright light of our results. A very brief acquaintance with the scheme in operation is enough to resolve all doubts. Some of the toughest skeptics have become our most enthusiastic supporters.



One of the commonest objections was that we were gong to raise a ""softie” who would be unprepared for the real world. But instead of becoming hypersensitive, our baby has acquired a surprisingly serene tolerance for annoyances. She is not bothered by the clothes she wears at playtime, she is not frightened by loud or sudden noises, she is not frustrated by toys out of reach, and she takes a lot of pummeling from her older sister like a good sport. It is possible that she will have to learn to sleep in a noisy room, but adjustments of that sort are always necessary. A tolerance for any annoyance can be built up by administering it in controlled dosages, rather than in the usual accidental way. Certainly there is no reason to annoy the child throughout the whole of its infancy, merely to prepare it for later childhood.



It is not, of course, the favorable conditions to which people object, but the fact that in our compartment they are “artificial.” All of them occur naturally in one favorable environment or another, where the same objection should apply but is never raised. It is quite in the spirit of the “world of the future” to make favorable conditions available everywhere through simple mechanical means.



A few critics have objected that they would not like to live in such a compartment themselves-they feel that it would stifle them or give them claustrophobia. The baby obviously does not share in this opinion. The compartment is well ventilated and much more spacious than a Pullman berth, considering the size of the occupant. The baby cannot get out, of course, but that is true of a crib as well. There is less actual restraint in the compartment because the baby is freer to move about. The plain fact is that she is perfectly happy. She has never tried to get out nor resisted being put back in, and that seems to be the final test.



Another early objection was that the baby would be socially starved and robbed of the affection and mother love, which she needs. This has simply not been true. The compartment does not ostracize the baby. The large window is no more of a social barrier than the bars of a crib. The baby follows what is going on in the room, smiles at passers-by, plays “peek-a-boo” games, and obviously delights in company. And she is handled, talked to, and played with whenever she is changed or fed, and each afternoon during a play period, which is becoming longer as she grows older.



The fact is that a baby will probably get more love and affection when it is easily cared for, because the mother is likely to feel overworked and resentful of the demands made upon her. She will express her love in a practical way and give the baby genuinely affectionate care.



It is common practice to advise the troubled mother to be patient and tender and to enjoy her baby. And, of course, that is what any baby needs. But is is the exceptional mother who can fill this prescription upon demand, especially if there are other children in the family and she has no help. We need to go one step further and teat the mother with affection also. Simplified childcare will give mother love a chance.







A similar complaint was that such an apparatus would encourage neglect. But easier care is sure to be better care. The mother will resist the temptation to put the baby back into a damp bed if she can conjure up a dry one in five seconds. She may very well spend less time with her baby, but babies do not suffer from being left alone but only from the discomforts, which arise from being, left alone in the ordinary crib.



How long do we intend to keep the baby in the compartment? The baby will answer that in time, but almost certainly until she is two years old, or perhaps three. After the first year of course, she will spend a fair part of each day in a playpen or out of doors. The compartment takes the place of a crib and will get about the same use. Eventually it will serve as sleeping quarters only.

This response is so sensitive that we wonder how a comfortable temperature is ever reached with clothing and blankets.
The discovery, which pleased us most, was that crying and fussing could always be stopped by slightly lowering the temperature.
Remember that these advantages for the baby do not mean additional labor or attention on the part of the mother.

They live like kings, and don’t spread that wealth to the masses of people who work for them. He will point to fast food workers, who put lettuce and pickles on burgers all day, and say that it’s not right that a person has to work forty hours per week still can’t make ends meet.

Take a look at how the Socialist elite is eating, but keep in mind a few things as you do.

Bernie Sanders has never built his own successful business, or come up with his own entrepreneurial idea.

Bernie Sanders has been living off of income provided by the hard work and taxes of others for decades.

Now let’s see what a public servant who riles against the wealthy is eating during his private jet flight to Rome to meet the Pope.

In the “ Settling In ” section, we have

Coriander crab salad with lemon poached prawns and lime creme.

In the “ Starters ” section, Bernie could have a nice bowl of:

Red lentil soup with lime and cilantro cream.

For his “ Main Course ,” Mr. Man of the People himself, could have:

Herb crusted lamb loin lemon risotto, braised endives and olives in a wild mushroom sauce.

You know, just your average lamb loin that mom used to make when you were growing up. Nothing elitist here.

For dessert, Sanders, who seems to have antipathy for the 1% of the country and the way they live, could top off his meal with:

A selection of fine cheeses. Montero, Royale Morbier, and Fourme D’ambert. Of course, these fine cheeses will be offered with fresh fruit, and ONION JAM.

Did you even know onion jam existed? Bernie Sanders apparently did.

All this is to say, that this proves the point that Socialism and Communism do not spread the wealth among the people. If you are a Sanders supporter, you aren’t going to get a check for any amount from the Sanders administration after he gets elected.

What happens in a Socialist and Communist regime, is that the people work for the government, rather then themselves. Their efforts, their work, their ideas go towards making sure the elites in the federal government will be able to live like kings, and continue to have a full bar available to them while they are spreading onion jam on whatever you spread onion jam on."

Miami turns out for a powerful, inspiring evening with Minister Louis Farrakhan

MIAMI - When the Honorable Minister Louis Farrakhan stepped before some 1,500 people packed into the historic Mt. Zion Baptist Church the crowd exploded with applause.

What most in the crowd did not know what the 82-year-old leader had been infused with boundless energy during this trip South to promote the “Justice Or Else!” gathering planned for this fall in the Nation’s Capital. Over several days he met with leaders, youth, activists, artists and preachers and professionals in private sessions and group sessions, never tiring, never wavering, never-not-smiling.

That same energy pervaded the church where extra chairs were added to a full upstairs sanctuary. Downstairs listeners endured a sweltering heat to hear sound piped in via speaker as event organizers were forced to find a place for people who had come out and refused to leave somewhere in the building.

Then outside others gathered around loud speakers placed outside, sitting on street curbs, on cars in a park across the streets and seemingly anywhere close enough to hear a clarion call for justice.

The message was well worth the heat, the lines wrapped around the corner and a bright sunny day that turned into a humid night.

“How can we charge others with the crime of killing us without due process and lying about it when we are killing each other? And we won’t march on ourselves, nor will we even rise up to condemn ourselves for what we are doing to ourselves. And in the gangs when we kill we don’t talk, so nobody is arrested and charged with murder and brought to what is called justice,” said Min. Farrakhan getting quickly into the subject of justice and his demand for justice planned for Oct. 10 in Washington, D.C., as part of the Justice Or Else gathering on the 20th anniversary of the Million Man March.

The gathering will be no frolic, no picnic, no folly, but a serious demand for justice placed before a government rife with injustice and a crisis in police killings of Blacks, Native Americans and others inside America. Such a demand called for an assessment of conditions and confronting White oppression on one side and Black fratricidal violence on the other.

“And the police when they kill us, they put the lie out first and then back the lie up with the institutions of government of White Supremacy. And so even though we march and even though we fight against this injustice it continues unabated. So we have decided on the 20th anniversary of the Million Man March we want to go to Washington.

“We want to go back to Washington to demand of our government what we rightly deserve and what we have paid for with our sweat and our blood,” the Minister declared. “But this time we are not asking for justice, we are demanding justice and as Frederick Douglass says, ‘power concedes nothing without a demand.’ And I added to that, power concedes nothing without a demand that is backed by power.”

“So what is the power that should back our righteous demand for justice? It is the unequaled power of our unity as a people. We have never ‘gone united.’ We stay as little tribes and factions, gathering only for the moment and then scattering after the moment. But when you and I can go as a people, not Muslim and Christian and Baptists, and Methodists, and Crips and Bloods, and native tribes, but go as the original inhabitants of our planet to demand justice and some of this earth we can call our own,” he said.

Between men and women there is a demand from nature that must be satisfied to bring unity and harmony, the Minister said. The man must give first as the maintainer, the protector, the provider for the woman in his life and the woman will respond to an unspoken demand out of the beauty of her nature, he said. But, the Minister noted, Satan has turned things upside down with women working, factories closed, and Blacks left in the lurch, unable to create jobs and unwilling to support Black entrepreneurs. And Blacks bereft of the knowledge of self beg others to do what Blacks must do for themselves, he continued. Those who provide goods and services take money out of an underdeveloped and disrespected community without substantial reinvestment.

Such social engineering leaves Uncle Sam ready to recruit fearless Black youth in the armed forces, and the U.S. government helped foment the crack cocaine epidemic by placing drugs and weapons in the ‘hood to promote fratricide and Black discord, he said. The wise of this nation, and leaders like J. Edgar Hoover, the longtime FBI director, know it is time for the rise of Black people and are determined to avert the destruction and fall of White supremacy, the Minister noted.

But like a serpent, Whites are deceptive, trying to keep control of the once-slaves who are destined to go free by monitoring their activities, their leaders, their actions and even their social media posts to cull information, he said.

It was standing room only for a Thursday night message from Min Farrakhan in Miami.

“They would like to charge us with radicalizing our people by telling the truth, but every time they kill a Black man or beat up a Black woman or unjustly stop us for traffic violation and then kill us, we are being radicalized. They are the ones who are radicalizing us. All we are doing is telling the truth of what they are doing,” Minister Farrakhan thundered as the crowd roared back and started to applaud loudly.

But, he said the slaughter of Blacks must cease because “we make it so difficult for us to go to Washington with the strength which is necessary to confront the evil of our government in depriving Blacks and Browns, native people and some of their own poor White people.”

Later in his message, the Minister called for 10,000 fearless men willing to make the ultimate sacrifice rather than live under tyranny. There comes a time in the life of every people who yearn for freedom where death is sweeter than to continue life under oppression, he said. Blacks must protect their lives if the federal government refuses to intervene when Black lives are unjustly and the principle of a life of a life is laid out in scripture, the Minister explained. “Death is sweeter than to continue to live and bury our children while White folks give the killers hamburgers. Death is sweeter than watching us slaughter each other to the joy of a 400-year-old enemy. Death is sweeter. The Qur’an teaches persecution is worse than slaughter then it says, retaliation is prescribed in matters of the slain. Retaliation is a prescription from God to calm the breasts of those whose children have been slain. If the federal government will not intercede in our affairs, then we must rise up and kill those who kill us, stalk them and let them feel the pain of death that we are feeling,” said Min. Farrakhan. The crowd rose to its feet and gave another standing ovation.

The Minister again called for a boycott of Xmas holiday spending as a response to oppression and the disrespect of Black life. He cited the last public speech of Dr. Martin Luther King, Jr., in 1968 in Memphis, where the civil rights leader spoke of inflicting economic pain on those who have oppressed Black people. Dr. King was more than a dreamer, he was a freedom fighter who awoke to the American nightmare, the Minister said. The way to inflict economic pain is by withdrawing money from the forces of oppression and using our combined economic might create a reality for ourselves, said Min. Farrakhan. He urged the audience to reject pagan celebrations in the name of Jesus and to spend time with loved ones, not exchanging gifts, but heartfelt discussions about the reality of the man Jesus and his life’s work, the Minister said.

Men, women and children of different backgrounds filled Mt. Zion. Although doors were supposed to open at 6 p.m., the church was already halfway full by then. The line extended down the sidewalk and around the building as men and women entered through separate entrances, but sat side by side in the historic house of worship.

By 6:30 p.m., the church sanctuary was full and people had to begin filling a steamy overflow room.

Though all came to hear Minister Farrakhan, everyone had different reasons or paths that ended July 30 for the Thursday evening message.

Since there was a social media campaign to promote Minister Farrakhan’s visit to Miami, many found out via Facebook and Twitter. “I saw a post from my friend on Facebook that Minister Farrakhan was going to be here, and I was like ‘Oh my God,’ ” said 37-year-old Kirsten Porter, who is from Minneapolis. “I’m hoping to get motivation, inspiration, and spiritual upliftment.”

Some had a direct connection to the Nation of Islam.

Donna Addy, who is originally from Detroit, but now lives in Boynton Beach, Fla., grew up in the Nation of Islam. However, she didn’t continue to attend mosque meetings throughout her life. Over the past few months, she’s been making the hour long drive from Boynton Beach to Miami to attend the Sunday meetings at Muhammad Mosque No. 29.

“I’m here to see the Minister and to hear the truth,” she said, her daughter Joy at her side. “If I had stuck with the Nation of Islam, imagine how much better I would be. So now, I’m exposing it to my daughter so she can get it early.”

Asha Starks, a 22-year-old attending Barry University in Miami, felt since she was part of the student movement, she should hear different viewpoints. Her grandfather aided Minister Louis Farrakhan during the Million Man March in 1995, which helped to shape her stance on social rights today.

“We need organization. There’s a lot of messed up stuff, and if we just stand by, nothing can change,” Ms. Starks said.

One of Minister Farrakhan’s main messages during his Justice Or Else tour across the country has been unity. Many say unity is needed in the community.

Patricia Atkinson, a 44-year-old woman born in New York with Jamaican roots, considers herself to be newly conscious. “Unity,” she said. “It’s time. So much is going on. When we have knowledge of self, we can unify. We need to support our own businesses so we can get respect from others.”

Minister Farrakhan has not only been pushing for unity among Blacks, but unity among Native Americans, Hispanics and others who have suffered injustice.

Wayne “Smoke” Snellgrove, a native of Saskatewan, Canada, was a guest of Minister Farrakhan during a leadership meeting for indigenous people and Latinos days before his speech at Mt. Zion Baptist Church. Mr. Snellgrove works for Indian Voices newspaper, which promotes education and public awareness about Native Americans and their issues. He loved what the Minister had to say and wanted more, so he found himself at the church.

“I want to hear more of the truth,” Mr. Snellgrove said. “Any chance I can get to be with and grow with my brothers and sisters, and share my spirituality.”

“I hope to gain motivation to keep fighting for the cause because it gets tiresome,” she said. “You just need to be in the company of other like minds,” said Vanessa Gonzalez, a 31-year-old Latina.

Both Mr. Snellgrove and Ms. Gonzalez say it is time to unite.

“I think 10.10.15 is a great way to be with my brothers and sisters,” Mr. Snellgrove said.

“It’s amazing that it’s been 20 years since the last march,” Ms. Gonzalez said. “I’m grateful I get to participate. It’s sad that we’re still fighting, but at least we have a voice. We need to unify. We can’t call for justice and only have it for one people, only have it for Blacks and Hispanics. I mean, Asians experience injustice, too. We need to unite to win together.”

Once Minister Farrakhan mounted the podium after a deafening round of applause, many got what they came for. Minister Farrakhan not only touched on unity in the community, but he also spoke about unity between the nature of man and the nature of woman.

“He (God) put in the nature of woman a demand,” Minister Farrakhan said. “First, the demand is on the man. The man is supposed to be the maintainer and the provider of the women in his life.”

For a portion of his lecture, Minister Farrakhan focused on the woman and how she should be treated.

“A woman is more than an object of pleasure,” he said. “She is the second self of God and she is a god herself.”

Minister Farrakhan provided all listeners with an empowering and motivating message, letting them know that they have the power within themselves to do great things.

“The Bible calls man not a glory of God, but the glory of God,” he said. “In your best state, you reflect him perfectly. When you look in the mirror, you don’t see that. But that’s not God’s fault. You are a caricature of what God intended you to be.”

The Minister also enlightened many on what being a believer in Jesus Christ really means and dealt with the need for justice.

“The more we are denied,” Minister Farrakhan said, “the longer we are denied, the stronger the answer to that cry.”

Minister Farrakhan urged the audience to study the last few years of Dr. Martin Luther King Jr.’s life before he was assassinated. “They didn’t assassinate him because he had a dream. He was assassinated because he woke up,” he said. “Justice is what Dr. King, Malcolm X, Marcus Garvey and Harriet Tubman wanted.”

In his last public speech, Dr. King talked on the need for land, the need to spread economic pain to those who practice injustice and supporting Black banks and institutions, the Minister observed.

Listeners shot to their feet many times to applaud the Minister’s unique message. After closing out in prayer, several guests left the church talking about what they had heard. Others crowded around the church on the sidewalk and across the street, buying DVDs and books of the Nation of Islam and asking when they could attend the mosque in Miami.

Minister Farrakhan gave listeners many things to think about when it came to improving their lives and the state of their communities. After hearing Minister Farrakhan’s lecture, Britney Stephens left with a better idea of who he is and what he’s about.

“What stuck out to me was that he was talking about how a lot of people say they’re with the Lord, but they’re not in Christ,” she said. “That’s something people have to think about.”

Twenty-seven-year-old Shameka Thomas felt the Minister’s lecture was powerful and intense.

“It’s what we need to wake up, especially about Black men and women and taking back our land,” she said. “His talk about Jesus and how he was a revolutionary and how we’re all one and in Christ and that there is no distinction stood out to me. Christ was about love but also about war.”

After hearing his message, many people was excited to be in Washington, D.C. on 10-10-15.

Arleen White, an activist originally from Jamaica who lost her 14-year-old son to gun violence, felt Justice Or Else is long overdue.

“We really need to unite,” she said. “It’s time. We’ve been victimized for too long and we need to fight for the hour and for our children. Now it’s time for us to really stand up because if we don’t stand for anything, we’ll die for anything.”

For Michael Lowe, it was just nice to see Minister Farrakhan in person.

“I got more of what I’m used to getting from him,” Mr. Lowe said. “Him bringing the truth like he does. I hope to follow him in his footsteps.”"	'We are not asking for justice, we are demanding justice'		[]	['minister', 'justice', 'unity', 'need', 'asking', 'man', 'black', 'blacks', 'farrakhan', 'demanding', 'church', 'demand']	"Farrakhan getting quickly into the subject of justice and his demand for justice planned for Oct. 10 in Washington, D.C., as part of the Justice Or Else gathering on the 20th anniversary of the Million Man March.

https://www.snopes.com/fact-check/melania-trump-ban-flu-shot/	first lady melania trump banned the white house staff from receiving flu shots.	false	['melania trump', 'news punch', 'your news wire']	2018/01/23	David Emery	['https://www.cdc.gov/flu/protect/keyfacts.htm', 'http://archive.is/F0vor', 'https://www.cdc.gov/flu/about/season/flu-season-2017-2018.htm']	http://archive.is/F0vor	http://archive.is/	"First Lady Melania Trump has banned White House staff from receiving the flu shot after learning of the adverse health effects associated with the controversial vaccine, according to reports.

While public debate rages about the safety of this season’s flu shot, Melania Trump says that as far as she is concerned, she won’t have people endangering her son with their “dangerous” flu shot diseases.

“I will not allow incubators of dangerous viruses to come anywhere near my son,” the First Lady said.

After researching the ingredients used in making the flu shot, and becoming concerned about potential negative health effects, including death, Melania Trump said she was “amazed that it [flu shot] is being pushed so hard by the media this year.“

The First Lady, who proudly describes herself as a “full-time mom”, then realized that this year’s flu shot is only 10% effective – and the flu strains contained in the vaccine may be responsible for spreading serious cases of influenza.

Many of the victims of this year’s deadly flu epidemic – including many of the dead – received a flu shot shortly before they came down with the virus.

In Santa Barbara eight people had died of the flu this month. Seven of them had the flu shot . This deadly pattern is replicating itself across the country, yet health officials are still telling people to get the flu shot, even though it does not work this season.

In the interests of her son Barron’s health – as well as her own – Melania decided to avoid the flu shot this year. She also decided to clean up the White House, encouraging staffers against taking the flu shot.

But as Melania explained, this wasn’t as easy as it sounds. Every year the pharmaceutical industry, medical experts and the mainstream media work hard to convince us to get vaccinated against the flu. 2018 is no different.

But, as usual, we’re not being told the whole story.

Pharmaceutical companies provide mainstream media outlets with a huge percentage of their advertising revenue. Big pharmaceutical companies actually spend far more on advertising than research. We are talking hundreds of billions of dollars

Big Pharma’s dollars effectively purchase the obedience of mainstream media. You can no longer believe anything they say about pharmaceuticals, especially vaccines.

It is clear Big Pharma is desperate to ensure mainstream media outlets never tell us about adverse reactions or the toxic chemicals being injected into us in the flu shot.

While the CDC attempts to convince us that the flu shot is safe, doctors working for the agency have warned us that the opposite is true

The sad fact is that we cannot rely on the CDC and mainstream media to protect us. We must do our own research and educate ourselves.

In the First Lady’s case, her self-education led to her total ban on the flu shot among White House staffers, encouraging the use of natural immunity-boosters, instead of the ineffective and dangerous vaccine.

Melania said that in order to justify the ban to the staffers, she had to provide “plenty of scientific evidence.“

“I have a friend who is a holistic doctor, she provides me with most of my dietary advice and nutritional supplements. She provided me with a wealth of information about the reality of vaccines in 2018,” the First Lady said.

“I spent a lot of time researching, reading, really studying the subject. I had to feel totally confident I was making the right decision for my son.”

“It took a few months but I finally felt totally confident with my decision.”

The influence that Big Pharma has over the U.S. population is profound, and deeply disturbing. Once you start looking, you realize that Big Pharma is everywhere. And, unfortunately, they are more interested in profits than public health.

But as Melania Trump says, once you educate yourself and make the effort to avoid their unnecessary products, you will find peace of mind, and the health of your family will improve.

The bill, known as the “Right to Try Act,” will prohibit the FDA from banning natural cures, and allow patients to try medications that have not been approved by the FDA, but are currently under clinical trial.

Right to Try was passed unanimously by the Senate last summer and by the House of Representatives on Tuesday in a vote of 250 to 169, after Trump personally lobbied for its passage. While the bill’s provisions are targeted at a wide range of medications, they also apply to medical marijuana thanks to a clinical trial being conducted by the Multidisciplinary Association of Psychedelic Sciences (MAPS).

Big legislation will be signed by me shortly. After many years, RIGHT TO TRY and big changes to DODD FRANK. — Donald J. Trump (@realDonaldTrump) May 23, 2018

Herb reports : The MAPS trial, currently in the second phase of the FDA approval process, is testing the effectiveness of smoked cannabis in veterans with PTSD and meets all of the criteria set out by the Right to Try.

The majority of states already have their own form of Right to Try legislation, with one notable exception being New York. In Utah, a recently passed law specifically addresses the right of terminally ill patients to try cannabis. However, because cannabis remains federally prohibited, even if a terminally ill patient has the “Right to Try” cannabis on the state level, they’re still in violation of federal law.

The Right to Try bill, recently passed by Congress, would change that. In addition to cannabis, MDMA and psilocybin could also potentially be used by ‘eligible patients’ since FDA trials of both substances meet the requirements set out in the federal bill.

What’s not clear is what illnesses qualify as life-threatening. Post-traumatic stress disorder, for example, could be argued to be life-threatening given the high rates of suicide among those who are diagnosed, but it’s up for debate. It’s likely that those details will be hammered out on a state by state basis in jurisdictions that have already passed their own version of Right to Try. The full title of the bill suggests as much stating, “in accordance with State law…”

However, in states that lack their own local provisions, the new bill appears to leave plenty of room for interpretation and a potential conflict with local drug laws.

Under the broad wording of the federal bill, no specific illnesses are mentioned. Instead, an ‘eligible patient’ is defined as, “Diseases or conditions where the likelihood of death is high unless the course of the disease is interrupted; and Diseases or conditions with potentially fatal outcomes, where the endpoint of clinical trial analysis is survival.”

Patients must also have exhausted all existing treatment options and must be unable to participate in the ongoing trials investigating the drug they want access to. Additionally, they must provide written consent from a qualified physician who does not stand to gain from the trial.

The bill passed on Tuesday after receiving some opposition from Democrats on Capitol Hill who believe that the law will undermine the FDA’s processes.

It’s likely that President Trump will sign the bill in the coming days since he has personally lobbied Congress for its passage. In January, Trump even mentioned the bill in his State of the Union Address saying, “People who are terminally ill should not have to go from country to country to seek a cure. I want to give them a chance right here at home. It is time for the Congress to give these wonderful, incredible Americans the right to try.”

Early Wednesday morning, Trump reiterated his support for the bill tweeting his intention to sign it into law.

Claire McCaskill in the U.S. Senate said he expects to come home to a home-cooked meal from his his fiancée at 6 p.m. every night, and plans for his future daughters to do the same.

Courtland Sykes on Tuesday took to Facebook to repost comments he wrote last year, to clear up his views on women's rights.

""In light of recent questions regarding my views on Women's Rights, attached is my full statement,"" he posted on his verified ""Courtland Sykes for Senate"" Facebook page. On whether he favors women's rights, Sykes said his fiancée, Chanel Rion, has given him orders to favor them, ""so I'd better.""

""But Chanel knows that my obedience comes with a small price that she loves to pay anyway: I want to come home to a home-cooked dinner at six every night, one that she fixes and one that I expect one day to have daughters learn to fix after they become traditional homemakers and family wives — think Norman Rockwell here and Gloria Steinem be damned,"" he said in the post.

The comments were apparently a part of an 11-page statement he sent to the St. Louis Dispatch last year. Sykes, who filed a statement of candidacy with the Federal Election Commission on Sept. 26, 2017, has crafted a Trump-style message on border security and building a strong military. According to the St. Louis-Dispatch, as of October, he had been a Missouri resident for less than a year.

Sykes, despite saying he was in the U.S. Navy, ""struggled to answer questions about when the United States should exercise military force,"" in an interview, according to the newspaper. Sykes then declined a second interview, instead sending the 11-page document outlining his positions, including his position on women's rights.

Sykes is far from the leading GOP candidate — he isn't even backed by President Trump, whose values Sykes claims to espouse. Mr. Trump has casually endorsed Missouri's GOP Attorney General Josh Hawley, the favored Republican in the race.

Sykes' reposted comments on women's rights continue, ""I don't buy into radical feminism's crazed definition of modern womanhood and I never did. They don't own that definition — and never did. They made it up to suit their own nasty, snake-filled heads. Modern women can BE anything they want, including traditional women — as millions are and millions are fast becoming. Millennial women voters despised Hillary (Clinton) and cost her the election (and they weren't Russians). I wonder why they despise her? One reason is they look at her life's personal wreckage and din't want to become like her.""

In a post on women's rights, GOP Senate hopeful Courtland Sykes describes how he believes women should behave Screenshot/Courtland Sykes for U.S. Senate Facebook page

In the Facebook post, Sykes also describes how he wants any future daughters of his own to grow up — to work at home, not to grow up into ""career-obsessed banshees.""

""I want daughters to have their own intelligence, their own dignity, their own workspace and their own degrees; I want them to build home-based enterprises and live in homes shared with good husbands and I don't want them to grew up into career-obsessed banshees who forgo home life and children and the happiness of family to become nail-biting, manophonic, hell-bent feminist she devils who shriek from the tops of a thousand tall buildings they are think they could have leaped over in a single bound — had men not 'suppressing them.' It's just nuts. It always was.""

Sykes' concludes by saying he supports women's' rights, but not the kind ""mean-spirited radical feminists"" support.

His opinions on Clinton and McCaskill — are quite clear. In another recent Facebook post, Sykes posted images of female Democrats — including Clinton, McCaskill and Sen. Elizabeth Warren, D-Mass., — alongside famous Disney villains.

A mother-of-three has spoken of her terror after she almost lost her legs to a deadly infection which she caught from shaving her bikini line.

Dana Sedgewick, 44, from Sheffield, trimmed her pubic area with a brand new razor but ended up cutting a spot on her groin.

Her body almost immediately went into shock, causing a red rash on her legs before they turned black from necrotising fasciitis - a flesh-eating infection.

Rushed to intensive care, doctors operated to remove as much of the rotting skin as they could - but she developed sepsis during the procedure.

She was placed in a coma as her family were told she had just a 30 per cent chance of survival as her kidneys failed and her heart stopped four times.

Having managed to survive the horrific ordeal, she underwent 21 operations to repair the damage to her skin - but doctors warned she would never walk again.

But with the support of her husband, Mathew, 47, she has now recovered and can walk using crutches and is back at home with her children - Megan, 18, Freya, 14, and Klara, nine.

Dana Sedgewick, 44, trimmed her pubic area with a brand new razor, but ended up in a coma after she developed the flesh-eating infection, necrotising fasciitis (pictured now, using a crutch to walk - despite being told she may never be able to use her legs again)

Mrs Sedgewick said: 'Like a lot of women, I tried to keep a tidy bikini line. So I had a quick trim with a new razor.

'But over the weekend, I felt unwell and noticed a little pimple on my groin which kept bleeding. I didn't think anything of it as I often got a rash from shaving.

'Little did I know that this tiny pimple would almost cost me my life.'

Mrs Sedgewick's ordeal began in May 2012. Two days after she'd shaved, she began experiencing dizziness and nausea.

She visited her GP, who took swabs of the area and prescribed her antibiotics to combat a suspected infection.

Later that day, her eldest daughter Megan discovered her lying in bed, with her legs covered in a bloody red rash.

Her body almost immediately went into shock, causing a red rash on her legs before they turned black from the rotting flesh (pictured in September 2012 after a couple of skin graft procedures to repair some of the damage on her legs)

Afterwards, her GP called to say that the swabs had revealed it was serious and that she needed to go in for another examination.

But when her husband dropped her off at the surgery, she collapsed.

“ Like a lot of women, I tried to keep a tidy bikini line. So I had a quick trim with a new razor ” Dana Sedgewick, 44

An ambulance was called and she was rushed to the trauma unit at the Northern General Hospital in Sheffield, where doctors diagnosed her with necrotising fasciitis.

The condition causes bacteria to release toxins that attack the surrounding soft tissue, and can be caused by a minor cut or scratch.

Mrs Sedgewick said: 'By the time I got to the hospital, my legs were covered in black, rotting flesh. It was touch-and-go as to whether I'd make it.'

Over the next ten hours, surgeons battled to save her legs. Cutting through seven inches of infected skin, they removed the diseased flesh and reapplied skin from her back.

Rushed to intensive care, doctors placed her in a coma as her family were told she had just a 30 per cent chance of survival as her kidneys failed and her heart stopped four times (pictured at the Northern General Hospital in Sheffield in May 2012)

Having managed to come round from the horrific ordeal, she underwent 21 operations to repair the damage to her skin - but doctors warned she would never walk again (pictured in hospital suffering from the infection)

Doctors told Mrs Sedgewick that she had been very lucky to survive her terrifying ordeal with necrotising fasciitis (pictured in hospital in June 2012)

During surgery, she developed sepsis and was given a slim chance of survival after going into septic shock.

The ‘silent killer’ strikes when an infection such as blood poisoning sparks a violent immune response in which the body attacks its own organs.

To increase her chances of survival, doctors decided to put her into an induced coma for nine days.

She said: 'When I woke up, my legs were covered in bandages and I had no idea what had happened. I thought I'd been in a car accident.

'But when the surgeon asked me if I remembered shaving, I suddenly recalled trimming my bikini line.

'He told me that the spot on my groin had become infected, and I'd been very lucky to survive.'

Mrs Sedgewick was transferred to the hospital's burns unit for specialist treatment, and was able to see her legs for the first time.

She said: 'It was horrific. All of my muscle had rotted away, and I had a crater of skin near my groin. I felt like I was going to throw up.

'But I knew that it could have been much, much worse. I could easily have lost my legs - or worse, died.'

WHAT IS NECROTISING FASCIITIS? Necrotising fasciitis is most commonly caused by an infection with group A Streptococcus. Those infections normally last just a few days - they are mild and typically clear themselves up. But in some unusual cases it can develop into necrotising fasciitis. They infect flat layers of a membrane known as the fascia, which are connective bands of tissue that surround muscles, nerves, fat, and blood vessels. The infection also damages the tissues next to the fascia. Sometimes toxins made by these bacteria destroy the tissue they infect, causing it to die. When this happens, the infection is very serious and can result in loss of limbs or death. .

Doctors warned that she'd never walk again but she defied them and managed to walk on crutches, after intense physiotherapy.

Six weeks later, she was discharged from hospital.

Over the next four years, she underwent 21 operations to improve the appearance of her skin.

Mrs Sedgewick, who has been left with extensive scarring, said: 'It didn't feel like my own body any more.

'But with Mat's support, I grew to see the scars as a reminder of how brave I'd been, and how lucky I was to survive.

'It's incredible to think a tiny shaving spot could have killed me. I had a very close shave indeed.'

Dr Ron Daniels BEM, chief executive of the UK Sepsis Trust, said: 'Stories like Dana's illustrate the serious damage sepsis can do. Every day in the UK, individuals and families have their lives torn apart by the condition.

'But through better awareness, thousands of lives could be saved each year.

'While necrotising fasciitis is a rare cause of sepsis, it's crucial that members of the public and healthcare professionals consider it when presented with an unwell patient.

'Anyone with flu-like symptoms and one or more of the key signs of sepsis must call an ambulance immediately. With every hour that passes before the correct antibiotics are administered, the risk of death increases.'

THE

ARGUMENT

OF THIS NARRATIVE

By way of

PREFACE

TO THE

READER.



The Reverend Author of this Compendious Summary was Bartholomaeus de las Casas alias Casaus, a Pious and Religeous person, (as appears by his zealous Transports in this Narrative for promotion of the Christian Faith) elevated from a Frier of the Dominican Order to sit in the Episcopal Chair, who was frequently importuned by Good and Learned Men, particularly Historians, to Publish this Summary, who so prevailed with him, that he Collected out of that copious History which might and ought to be written on this subject, the contents of this concise Treatise with intention to display unto the World the Enormities, &c. the Spaniards committed in America during their residence there, to their eternal ignominy; and for the author finding that no Admonitions or Reprehensions, how mild soever could operate upon or sink into the rocky-hearted Tyrants in those Occidental parts; he therefore took up a firm resolution, being then about 50 years of age (as he himself declares) to run the Hazards and Dangers by Sea, and the Risque of a long voyage into Spain there to acquaint and Certifie the most Illustrious Prince Phillip the Son and Heir of his Imperial Majesty Charles the Fifth of Blessed Memory, with the Horrid crimes, &c. perpetrated in those countries, part whereof he had seen, and part heard from such as boasted of their Wickedness. Whereupon his Caeserean Majesty moved with a tender and Christian compassion towards these Inhabitants of the Countries of America, languishing for want of redress, he called a Council at Valedolid, Anno Dom. 1542. consisting of Learned and Able Men, in order to the reformation of the West-Indian government, and took such a course, that from that time their Tyranny and cruelty against those Barbarians was somewhat repressed, and those Nations in some measure delivered from that intolerable and more then Aegyptian Bondage, or at least the Spaniards ill usage and treatment of the Americans was alleviated and abated. This Book mostly Historical, part Typographical, was Published first by the Author in Spanish at Sevil, after that Translated into Latin by himself; and in process of time into High Dutch, Low Dutch, French and now English; which is the Sixth Language it has been taught to speak, that anyone of what Nation soever might in this Narrative contemplate and see as in a mirror the dismal and pernitious fruits, that lacquey and attend unlimited and close fisted Avarice, and thereby Learn to abhor and detest it, Cane pejus & angue: it being the predominant and chiefest motive to the comission of such inexpressible Outrages, as here in part are faintly, not fully represented. Which sin the Pagan Indians themselves did exprobate in the Spaniards with all Detestation, Ignominy and Disgrace: for when they had taken some of them Prisoners (which was rarely) they bound them hand and foot, laid them on the ground, and then pouring melted Gold down their Throats, cried out and called to them aloud in derision, yield, throw up thy Gold O Christian! Vomit and spew out the Mettal which hath so inqinated and invenom'd both Body and Soul, that hath stain'd and infected they mind with desires and contrivances, and thy hands with Commission of such matchless Enormities. I will then shut up all this, being but an Extract of what is in the Prefatory part of the Original. I earnestly beg and desire all Men to be perswaded, that this summary was not published upon any private Design, sinister ends or affection in favor or prejudice of any particular Nation; but for the publick Emolument and Advantage of all true Christians and moral Men throughout the whole World.

THE CRUELTIES

OF THE

Spaniards

Committed in

AMERICA.



America was discovered and found out Ann. Dom. 1492, and the Year insuing inhabited by the Spaniards, and afterward a multitude of them travelled thither from Spain for the space of Nine and Forty Years. Their first attempt was on the Spanish Island, which indeed is a most fertile soil, and at present in great reputation for its Spaciousness and Length, containing in Circumference Six Hundred Miles: Nay it is on all sides surrounded with an almost innumerable number of Islands, which we found so well peopled with Natives and Forreigners, that there is scarce any Region in the Universe fortified with so many Inhabitants: But the main Land or Continent, distant from this Island Two Hundred and Fifty Miles and upwards, extends it self above Ten Thousand Miles in Length near the sea-shore, which Lands are some of them already discover'd, and more may be found out in process of time: And such a multitude of People inhabits these Countries, that it seems as if the Omnipotent God has Assembled and Convocated the major part of Mankind in this part of the World.

Now this infinite multitude of Men are by the Creation of God innocently simple, altogether void of and averse to all manner of Craft, Subtlety and Malice, and most Obedient and Loyal Subjects to their Native Sovereigns; and behave themselves very patiently, sumissively and quietly towards the Spaniards, to whom they are subservient and subject; so that finally they live without the least thirst after revenge, laying aside all litigiousness, Commotion and hatred.

This is a most tender and effeminate people, and so imbecile and unequal-balanced temper, that they are altogether incapable of hard labour, and in few years, by one Distemper or other soon expire, so that the very issue of Lords and Princes, who among us live with great affluence, and fard deliciously, are not more effminate and tender than the Children of their Husbandmen or Labourers: This Nation is very Necessitous and Indigent, Masters of very slender Possessions, and consequently, neither Haughty, nor Ambitious. They are parsimonious in their Diet, as the Holy Fathers were in their frugal life in the Desert, known by the name of Eremites. They go naked, having no other Covering but what conceals their Pudends from publick sight. An hairy Plad, or loose Coat, about an Ell, or a coarse woven Cloth at most Two Ells long serves them for the warmest Winter Garment. They lye on a coarse Rug or Matt, and those that have the most plentiful Estate or Fortunes, the better sort, use Net-work, knotted at the four corners in lieu of Beds, which the Inhabitants of the Island of Hispaniola, in their own proper Idiom, term Hammacks. The Men are pregnant and docible. The natives tractable, and capable of Morality or Goodness, very apt to receive the instill'd principles of Catholick Religion; nor are they averse to Civility and good Manners, being not so much discompos'd by variety of Obstructions, as the rest of Mankind; insomuch, that having suckt in (if I may so express my self) the the very first Rudiments of the Christian Faith, they are so transported with Zeal and Furvor in the exercise of Ecclesiastical Sacraments, and Divine Service, that the very Religioso's themselves, stand in need of the greatest and most signal patience to undergo such extream Transports. And to conclude, I my self have heard the Spaniards themselves (who dare not assume the Confidence to deny the good Nature praedominant in them) declare, that there was nothing wanting in them for the acquisition of Eternal Beatitude, but the sole Knowledge and Understanding of the Deity.

The Spaniards first assaulted the innocent Sheep, so qualified by the Almighty, as is premention'd, like most cruel Tygers, Wolves and Lions hunger-starv'd, studying nothing, for the space of Forty Years, after their first landing, but the Massacre of these Wretches, whom they have so inhumanely and barbarously butcher'd and harass'd with several kinds of Torments, never before known, or heard (of which you shall have some account in the following Discourse) that of Three Millions of Persons, which lived in Hispaniola itself, there is at present but the inconsiderable remnant of scarce Three Hundred. Nay the Isle of Cuba, which extends as far, as Valledolid in Spain is distant from Rome, lies now uncultivated, like a Desert, and intomb'd in its own Ruins. You may also find the Isles of St. John, and Jamaica, both large and fruitful places, unpeopled and desolate. The Lucayan Islands on the North Side, adjacent to Hispaniola and Cuba, which are Sixty in number, or thereabout, together with with those, vulgarly known by the name of the Gigantic Isles, and others, the most infertile whereof, exceeds the Royal Garden of Sevil in fruitfulness, a most Healthful and pleasant Climat, is now laid waste and uninhabited; and whereas, when the Spaniards first arriv'd here, about Five Hundred Thousand Men dwelt in it, they are now cut off, some by slaughter, and others ravished away by Force and Violence, to work in the Mines of Hispanioloa, which was destitute of Native Inhabitants: For a certain Vessel, sailing to this Isle, to the end, that the Harvest being over (some good Christian, moved with Piety and Pity, undertook this dangerous Voyage, to convert Souls to Christianity) the remaining gleanings might be gathered up, there were only found Eleven Persons, which I saw with my own Eyes. There are other Islands Thirty in number, and upward bordering upon the Isle of St. John, totally unpeopled; all which are above Two Thousand miles in Lenght, and yet remain without Inhabitants, Native, or People.

As to the firm land, we are certainly satisfied, and assur'd, that the Spaniards by their barbarous and execrable Actions have absolutely depopulated Ten Kingdoms, of greater extent than all Spain, together with the Kingdoms of Arragon and Portugal, that is to say, above One Thousand Miles, which now lye wast and desolate, and are absolutely ruined, when as formerly no other Country whatsoever was more populous. Nay we dare boldly affirm, that during the Forty Years space, wherein they exercised their sanguinary and detestable Tyranny in these Regions, above Twelve Millions (computing Men, Women, and Children) have undeservedly perished; nor do I conceive that I should deviate from the Truth by saying that above Fifty Millions in all paid their last Debt to Nature.

Those that arriv'd at these Islands from the remotest parts of Spain, and who pride themselves in the Name of Christians, steer'd Two courses principally, in order to the Extirpation, and Exterminating of this People from the face of the Earth. The first whereof was raising an unjust, sanguinolent, cruel War. The other, by putting them to death, who hitherto, thirsted after their Liberty, or design'd (which the most Potent, Strenuous and Magnanimous Spirits intended) to recover their pristin Freedom, and shake off the Shackles of so injurious a Captivity: For they being taken off in War, none but Women and Children were permitted to enjoy the benefit of that Country-Air, in whom they did in succeeding times lay such a heavy Yoak, that the very Brutes were more happy than they: To which Two Species of Tyranny as subalternate things to the Genus, the other innumerable Courses they took to extirpate and make this a desolate People, may be reduced and referr'd.

Now the ultimate end and scope that incited the Spaniards to endeavor the Extirptaion and Desolation of this People, was Gold only; that thereby growing opulent in a short time, they might arrive at once at such Degrees and Dignities, as were no wayes consistent with their Persons.

Finally, in one word, their Ambition and Avarice, than which the heart of Man never entertained greater, and the vast Wealth of those Regions; the Humility and Patience of the Inhabitants (which made their approach to these Lands more facil and easie) did much promote the business: Whom they so despicably contemned, that they treated them (I speak of things which I was an Eye Witness of, without the least fallacy) not as Beasts, which I cordially wished they would, but as the most abject dung and filth of the Earth; and so sollicitous they were of their Life and Soul, that the above-mentioned number of People died without understanding the true Faith or Sacraments. And this also is as really true as the praecendent Narration (which the very Tyrants and cruel Murderers cannot deny without the stigma of a lye) that the Spaniards never received any injury from the Indians, but that they rather reverenced them as Persons descended from Heaven, until that they were compelled to take up Arms, provoked thereunto by repeated Injuries, violent Torments, and injust Butcheries.

———————————————————————————————————

Of the Island HISPANIOLA.

In this Isle, which, as we have said, the Spaniards first attempted, the bloody slaughter and destruction of Men first began: for they violently forced away Women and Children to make them Slaves, and ill-treated them, consuming and wasting their Food, which they had purchased with great sweat, toil, and yet remained dissatisfied too, which every one according to his strength and ability, and that was very inconsiderable (for they provided no other Food than what was absolutely necessary to support Nature without superfluity, freely bestow'd on them, and one individual Spaniard consumed more Victuals in one day, than would serve to maintain Three Families a Month, every one consisting of Ten Persons. Now being oppressed by such evil usage, and afflicted with such greate Torments and violent Entertainment they began to understand that such Men as those had not their Mission from Heaven; and therefore some of them conceal'd their Provisions and others to their Wives and Children in lurking holes, but some, to avoid the obdurate and dreadful temper of such a Nation, sought their Refuge on the craggy tops of Mountains; for the Spaniards did not only entertain them with Cuffs, Blows, and wicked Cudgelling, but laid violent hands also on the Governours of Cities; and this arriv'd at length to that height of Temerity and Impudence, that a certain Captain was so audacious as abuse the Consort of the most puissant King of the whole Isle. From which time they began to consider by what wayes and means they might expel the Spaniards out of their Countrey, and immediately took up Arms. But, good God, what Arms, do you imagin? Namely such, both Offensive and Defensive, as resemble Reeds wherewith Boys sport with one another, more than Manly Arms and Weapons.

Which the Spaniards no sooner perceived, but they, mounted on generous Steeds, well weapon'd with Lances and Swords, begin to exercise their bloody Butcheries and Strategems, and overrunning their Cities and Towns, spar'd no Age, or Sex, nay not so much as Women with Child, but ripping up their Bellies, tore them alive in pieces. They laid Wagers among themselves, who should with a Sword at one blow cut, or divide a Man in two; or which of them should decollate or behead a Man, with the greatest dexterity; nay farther, which should sheath his Sword in the Bowels of a Man with the quickest dispatch and expedition.

They snatcht young Babes from the Mothers Breasts, and then dasht out the brains of those innocents against the Rocks; others they cast into Rivers scoffing and jeering them, and call'd upon their Bodies when falling with derision, the true testimony of their Cruelty, to come to them, and inhumanely exposing others to their Merciless Swords, together with the Mothers that gave them Life.

They erected certain Gibbets, large, but low made, so that their feet almost reacht the ground, every one of which was so order'd as to bear Thirteen Persons in Honour and Reverence (as they said blasphemously) of our Redeemer and his Twelve Apostles, under which they made a Fire to burn them to Ashes whilst hanging on them: But those they intended to preserve alive, they dismiss'd, their Hands half cut, and still hanging by the Skin, to carry their Letters missive to those that fly from us and ly sculking on the Mountains, as an exprobation of their flight.

The Lords and Persons of Noble Extract were usually expos'd to this kind of Death; they order'd Gridirons to be placed and supported with wooden Forks, and putting a small Fire under them, these miserable Wretches by degrees and with loud Shreiks and exquisite Torments, at last Expir'd.

I once saw Four or Five of their most Powerful Lords laid on these Gridirons, and thereon roasted, and not far off, Two or Three more over-spread with the same Commodity, Man's Flesh; but the shril Clamours which were heard there being offensive to the Captain, by hindring his Repose, he commanded them to be strangled with a Halter. The Executioner (whose Name and Parents at Sevil are not unknown to me) prohibited the doing of it; but stopt Gags into their Mouths to prevent the hearing of the noise (he himself making the Fire) till that they dyed, when they had been roasted as long as he thought convenient. I was an Eye-Witness of these and and innumerable Number of other Cruelties: And because all Men, who could lay hold of the opportunity, sought out lurking holes in the Mountains, to avoid as dangerous Rocks so Brutish and Barbarous a People, Strangers to all Goodness, and the Extirpaters and Adversaries of Men, they bred up such fierce hunting Dogs as would devour an Indian like a Hog, at first sight in less than a moment: Now such kind of Slaughters and Cruelties as these were committed by the Curs, and if at any time it hapned, (which was rarely) that the Indians irritated upon a just account destroy'd or took away the Life of any Spaniard, they promulgated and proclaim'd this Law among them, that One Hundred Indians should dye for every individual Spaniard that should be slain.

Of the Kingdoms contained in Hispaniola.

This Isle of Hispaniola was made up of Six of their greatest Kingdoms, and as many most Puissant Kings, to whose Empire almost all the other Lords, whose Number was infinite, did pay their Allegiance. One of these Kingdoms was called Magua, signifying a Campaign or open Country; which is very observable, if any place in the Universe deserves taking notice of, and memorable for the pleasantness of its Situation; for it is extended from South to North Eighty Miles, in breadth Five, Eight, and in some parts Ten Miles in length; and is on all sides inclosed with the highest Mountains; above Thirty Thousand Rivers, and Rivulets water her Coasts, Twelve of which prodigious Number do not yield in all in magnitude to those famous Rivers, the Eber, Duer, and Guadalquivir; and all those Rivers which have their Source or Spring from the Mountains lying Westerly, the number whereof is Twenty Thousand) are very rich in Mines of Gold; on which Mountain lies the Province of rich Mines, whence the exquisite Gold of Twenty Four Caracts weight, takes denomination. The King and Lord of this Kingdom was named Guarionex, who governed within the Compass of his Dominions so many Vassals and Potent Lords, that every one of them was able to bring into the Field Sixteen Thousand Soldiers for the service of Guarionex their Supream Lord and Soverain, when summoned thereunto. Some of which I was acquainted with. This was a most Obedient Prince, endued with great Courage and Morality, naturally of a Pacifick Temper, and most devoted to the service of the Castilian Kings. This King commanded and ordered his Subjects, that every one of those Lords under his Jurisdiction, should present him with a Bell full of Gold; but in succeeding times, being unable to perform it, they were commanded to cut it in two, and fill one part therewith, for the Inhabitants of this Isle were altogether inexperienced, and unskilful in Mine-works, and the digging Gold out of them. This Caiu proferred his Service to the King of Castile, on this Condition, that he would take care, that those Lands should be cultivated and manur'd, wherein, during the reign of Isabella, Queen of Castile, the Spaniards first set footing and fixed their Residence, extending in length even to Santo Domingo, the space of Fifty Miles. For he declar'd (nor was it a Fallacie, but an absolute Truth,) that his Subjects understood not the practical use of digging in Golden Mines. To which promises he had readily and voluntarily condescended, to my own certain knowledge, and so by this means, the King would have received the Annual Revenue of Three Millions of Spanish Crowns, and upward, there being at that very time in that Island Fifty Cities more ample and spacious than Sevil it self in Spain.

But what returns by way of Remuneration and Reward did they make this so Clement and Benign Monarch, can you imagine, no other but this? They put the greatest Indignity upon him imaginable in the person of his Consort who was violated by a Spanish Captain altogether unworthy of the Name of Christian. He might indeed probably expect to meet with a convenient time and opportunity of revenging this Ingominy so unjuriously thrown upon him by preparing Military Forces to attaque him, but he rather chose to abscond in the Province De los Ciquayos (wherein a Puissant Vassal and subject of his Ruled) devested of his Estate and Kingdom, and there live and dye an exile. But the Spaniards receiving certain information, that he had absented himself, connived no longer at his Concealment but raised War against him, who had received them with so great humanity and kindness, and having first laid waste and desolate the whole Region, at last found, and took him Prisoner, who being bound in Fetters was convey'd on board of a ship in order to his transfretation to Castile, as a Captive: but the Vessel perished in the Voyage, wherewith many Spaniards were also lost, as well as a great weight of Gold, among which there was a prodigious Ingot of Gold, resembling a large Loaf of Bread, weighing 3600 Crowns; Thus it pleased God to revenge their enormous impieties.

A Second Kingdom was named Marien, where there is to this day a Haven, upon the utmost Borders of the Plain or open Countrey toward the North, more fertil and large than the kingdom of Portugal; and really deserving constant and frequent Inahbitants: For it abounds with Mountains, and is rich in Mines of Gold and Orichalcum, a kind of Copper Mettal mixt with Gold; The Kings name of this place was Guacanagari, who had many powerful Lords (some whereof were not unknown to me) under his subjection. The first that landed in this Kingdom when he discovered America was an Admiral well stricken in years, who had so hospitable and kind a reception from the aforesaid Gracanagari, as well as all those Spaniards that accompanied him in that Voyage, giving them all imaginable help and assisstance (for the admiral's vessel was sunk on their Coasts) that I heard it from his own mouth, he could not possibly have been entertained with greater Caresses and Civilities from his own parents in his own Native Country. But this King being forced to fly to avoid the Spanish slaughter and Cruelty, deprived of all he was Master of, died in the Mountains; and all the rest of the Potentates and Nobles, his subjects, perished in that servitude and Vassalage; as you shall find in this following Treatise.

The Third Kingdom was distinguished by the Appellation of Maquana, another admirable, healthful and fruitful Region, where at present the most refined sugar of the Island is made. Caonabo then reigned there, who surmounted all the rest in Power, State, and the splendid Ceremonies of His Government. This King beyond all expectation was surpriz'd in his own Palace, by the great subtilty and industry of the Spaniards, and after carried on board in order to his transportation to Castile, but there being at that time six Ships Riding in the Haven, and ready to set Sail such an impetuous storm suddenly arose, that they as well as the Passengers and Ships Crew were all lost, together with King Canabao loaded with Irons; by which judgement the Almighty declared that this was as unjust and impious an Act as any of the former. This Kind had three or four Brothers then Living, Men of strength and Valour, who being highly incensed at the Captivity of their King and Brother, to which he was injuriously reduc'd, having also intelligence of the Devastations and Butcheries committed by the Spaniards in other Regions, and not long after hearing of their Brothers death, took up Arms to revenge themselves of the Enemy, whom the Spaniards met with, and certain party of Horse (which proved very offensive to the Indians) made such havoc and slaughter among them, that the half of this Kingdom was laid waste and depopulated.

Xaraqua is the Fourth Kingdom, and as it were the Centre and Middle of the whole Island, and is not to be equalled for fluency of Speech and politeness of Idiom or Dialect by any Inhabitants of the other Kingdoms, and in Policy and Morality transcends them all. Herein the Lords and Peers abounded, and the very Populace excelled in in stature and habit of Body: Their King was Behechio by name and who had a Sister called Anacaona, and both the Brother as well as Sister had loaded the Spaniards with Benefits and singular acts of Civility, and by delivering them from the evident and apparent danger of Death, did signal services to the Castilian Kings. Behechio dying the supreme power of the Kingdom fell to Anacaona: But it hapned one day, that the Governour of an Island, attended by 60 Horse, and 30 Foot (now the Cavalry was sufficiently able to unpeople not only the Isle, but also the whole Continent) he summoned about 300 Dynasta's, or Noblemen to appear before him, and commanded the most powerful of them, being first crouded into a Thatcht Barn or Hovel, to be exposed to the fury of the merciless Fire, and the rest to be pierced with Lances, and run through with the point of the Sword, by a multitude of Men: And Anacaona her self who (as we said before,) sway'd the Imperial Scepter, to her greater honor was hanged on a Gibbet. And if it fell out that any person instigated by Compassion or Covetousness, did entertain any Indian Boys and mount them on Horses, to prevent their Murder, another was appointed to follow them, who ran them through the back or in the hinder parts, and if they chanced to escape Death, and fall to the ground, they immediately cut off his Legs; and when any of those Indians, that survived these Barbarous Massacres, betook themselves to an Isle eight miles distant, to escape their Butcheries, they were then committed to servitude during Life.

The Fifth Kingdom was Hiquey, over whom Queen Hiquanama, a superannuated Princess, whome the Spaniards Crucified, did preside and Govern. The number of those I saw here burnt, and dismembered, and rackt with various Torments, as well as others, the poor Remnants of such matchless Villanies, who surviving were enslaved, is infinite. But because so much might be said concerning the Assassinations and Depopulating of these people, as cannot without great difficulty be published in Writing (nor do I conceive that one fragile part of 1000 that is here contained can be fully displayed) I will only add one remark more of the prementioned Wars, in lieu of a Corollary or Conclusion, and aver upon my Conscience, that notwithstanding all the above-named Injustice, profligate Enormities and other Crimes which I omit, (tho sufficiently known to me) the Indians did not, nor was it in their power to give any greater occasion for the Commission of them, than Pious Religioso's Living in a well regulated Monastic Life did afford for any Sacrilegeous Villains to deprive them of their Goods and Life at the same time, or why they who by flight avoided death should be detain'd in perpetual, not to be ransom'd Captivity and Slavery. I adde farther, that I really believe, and am satisfied by certain undeniable conjectures, that at the very juncture of time, when all these outrages were commited in this Isle, the Indians were not so much guilty of one single mortal sin of Commission against the Spaniards, that might deserve from any Man revenge or require satisfaction. And as for those sins, the punishment whereof God hath reserved to himself, as the immoderate desire of Revenge, Hatred, Envy or inward rancor of Spirit, to which they might be transported against such Capital Enemies as the Spaniards were, I judge that very few of them can justly be accused of them; for their impetuosity and vigor I speak experimentally, was inferior to that of Children of ten or twelve years of age: and this I can assure you, that the Indians had ever a just cause of raising War against the Spaniards, and the Spaniards on the contrary never raised a just was against them, but what was more injurious and groundless then any undertaken by the worst of Tyrants. All which I affirm of all their other Transactions and passages in America.

The Warlike Engagements being over, and the Inhabitants all swept away, they divided among themselves the Young Men, Women, and Children reserved promiscuously for that purpose, one obtained thirty, another forty, to this Man one hundred were disposed, to the other two hundred, and the more one was in favor with the domineering Tyrant (which they styled Governor) the more he became Master of, upon this pretence, and with this Proviso, that he should see them instructed in the Catholick Religion, when as they themselves to whom they were committed to be taught, and the care of their Souls instructed them were, for the major part Idiots, Cruel, Avaritious, infected and stained with all sorts of Vices. And this was the great care they had of them, they sent the Males to the Mines to dig and bring away the Gold, which is an intollerable labor; but the Women they made use of to Manure and Till the ground, which is a toil most irksome even to Men of the strongest and most robust constitutions, allowing them no other food but Herbage, and such kind of unsubstantial nutriment, so that the Nursing Womens Milk was exsiccated and so dryed up, that the young Infants lately brought forth, all perished, and females being separated from and debarred cohabitation with Men, there was no Prolification or raising up issue among them. The Men died in Mines, hunger starved and oppressed with labor, and the Women perished in the Fields, harrassed and broken with the like Evils and Calamities: Thus an infinite number of Inhabitants that formerly peopled this Island were exterminated and dwindled away to nothing by such Consumptions. They were compelled to carry burthens of eighty or one hundred pound weight, and that an hundred or two hundred miles compleat: and the Spaniards were born by them on the Shoulders in a pensil Vehicle or Carriage, or kind of Beds made of Net-work by the Indians; for in Truth they made use of them as Beasts to carry the burthens and cumbersom baggage of their journeys, insomuch that it frequently happened, that the Shoulders and Backs of the Indians were deeply marked with their scourges and stripes, just as they used to serve a tired Jade, accustomed to burthens. And as to those slashes with whips, blows with staves, cuffs and boxes, maledictions and curses, with a Thousand of such kind of Torments they suffered during the fatigue of their laborious journeys it would require a long tract of time, and many Reams of Paper to describe them, and when all were done would only create Horror and Consternation in the Reader.

But here is is observable, that the desolation of these Isles and Provinces took beginning since the decease of the most Serene Queen Isabella, about the year 1504, for before that time very few of the Provinces situated in that Island were oppressed or spoiled with unjust Wars, or violated with general devastation as after they were, and most if not all these things were concealed and masked from the Queens knowledge (whom I hope God hath crowned with Eternal Glory) for she was transported with fervent and wonderful zeal, nay, almost Divine desires for the Salvation and preservation of these people, which things so exemplary as these we having seen with our eyes, and felt with our hands, cannot easily be forgotten.

Take this also for a general Rule, that the Spaniards upon what American Coasts soever they arrived, exercised the same Cruelties, Slaughters, Tyrannies and detestable Oppressions on the most innocent Indian Nation, and diverting themselves with delights in new sorts of Torment, did in time improve in Barbarism and Cruelty; wherewith the Omnipotent being incensed suffered them to fail by a more desperate and dangerous lapse into a reprobate state.

Of the Isles of St. John and Jamaica.

In the Year 1509, the Spaniards sailed to the Islands of St. John and Jamaica (resembling Gardensa and Bee-hives) with the same purpose and design they proposed to themselves in the Isle of Hispaniola, perpetrating innumerable Robberies and Villanies as before; whereunto they added unheard of Cruelties by Murdering, Burning, Roasting, and Exposing Men to be torn to pieces by Dogs; and Finally by afflicting and harassing them with un-exampled Oppressions and torments in the Mines, they spoiled and unpeopled this Contrey of these Innocents. These two Isles containing six hundred thousand at least, though at this day there are scarce two hundred men to be found in either of them, the remainder perishing without the knowledge of Christian Faith or Sacrament.

———————————————————————————————————

_Of the Isle of _Cuba.

In the Year of our Lord 1511. They passed over to Cuba, which contains as much ground in length as there is distance between Valledolid and Rome, well furnished with large and stately Provinces and very populous, against whom they proceeded with no more humanity and Clemency, or indeed to speak truth with greater Savageness and Brutality. Several memorable Transactions worthy observation, passed in this Island. A certain Cacic a potent Peer, named Hathney, who not long before fled Hispaniola to Cuba for Refuge from Death, or Captivity during Life; and understanding by certain Indians that the Spaniards intended to steer their course thither, made this Oration to all his People Assembled together.

You are not ignorant that there is a rumor spread abroad among us of the Spaniards Arrival, and are sensible by woeful experience how such and such (naming them) and Hayti (so they term Hispaniola in their own language) with their Inhabitants have been treated by them, that they design to visit us with equal intentions of committing such acts as they have hitherto been guilty of. But do you not know the cause and reason of their coming? We are altogether ignorant of it, they replied, but sufficiently satisfied that they are cruelly and wickedly inclined: Then thus, he said, they adore a certain Covetous Deity, whose cravings are not to be satisfied by a few moderate offerings, but they may answer his Adoration and Worship, demand many unreasonable things of us, and use their utmost endeavors to subjugate and afterwards murder us. Then taking up a Cask or Cabinet near at hand, full of Gold and Gems, he proceeded in this manner: This is the Spaniards God, and in honour of him if you think well of it, let us celebrate our Arcytos (which are certain kinds of Dances and caprings used among them); and by this means his Deity being appeas'd, he will impose his Commands on the Spaniards that they shall not for the future molest us; who all unanimously with one consent in a loud tone made this reply. Well said, Well said, and thus they continued skipping and dancing before this Cabinet, without the least intermission, till they were quite tired and grown weary: Then the Noble Hathney re-assuming his discourse, said, if we Worship this Deity, till ye be ravished from us, we shall be destroyed, therefore I judge it convenient, upon mature deliberation, that we cast it into the River, which advice was approved of by all without opposition, and the Cabinet thrown in to the next River.

When the Spaniards first touched this Island, this Cacic, who was thoroughly acquainted with them, did avoid and shun them as much as in him lay, and defended himself by force of Arms, wherever he met with them, but at length being taken he was burnt alive, for flying from so unjust and cruel a Nation, and endeavuoring to secure his Life against them, who only thirsted after the blood of himself and his own People. Now being bound to the post, in order of his Execution a certain Holy Monk of the Franciscan Order, discours'd with him concerning God and the Articles of our Faith, which he never heard of before, and which might be satisfactory and advantagious to him, considering the small time allow'd him by the Executioner, promising him Eternal Glory and Repose, if he truly believ'd them, or other wise Everlasting Torments. After that Hathney had been silently pensive sometime, he askt the Monk whether the Spaniards also were admitted into Heaven, and he answering that the Gates of Heaven were open to all that were Good and Godly, the Cacic replied without further consideration, that he would rather go to Hell then Heaven, for fear he should cohabit in the same Mansion with so Sanguinary and Bloody a Nation. And thus God and the Holy Catholick Faith are Praised and Reverenced by the Practices of the Spaniards in America.

Once it so hapned, that the Citizens of a Famous City, distant Ten Miles from the place where we then resided, came to meet us with a splendid Retinue, to render their Visit more Honourable, bringing with them delicious Viands, and such kind of Dainties, with as great a quantity of Fish as they could possibly procure, and distributing them among us; but behold on a sudden, some wicked Devil possessing the minds of the Spaniards, agitated them with great fury, that I being present, and without the least Pretence or Occasion offered, they cut off in cold Blood above Three Thousand Men, Women and Children promiscuously, such Inhumanities and Barbarisms were committed in my sight, as no Age can parallel.

Some time after I dispatch Messengers to all the Rulers of the Province of Havana, that they would by no means be terrified, or seek their refuge by absence and flight, but to meet us, and that I would engage (for they understood my Authority) that they should not receive the least of Injuries; for the whole Country was extremely afflicted at the Evils and Mischiefs already perpetrated, and this I did with the advice of their Captain. As soon as we approached the Province, Two and Twenty of their Noblemen came forth to meet us, whom the Captain contrary to his Faith given, would have expos'd to the Flames, alledging that it was expedient they should be put to Death, who were, at any time, capacitated to use any Stratagem against us, but with great difficulty and much adoe, I snatcht them out of the fire.

These Islanders of Cuba, being reduc'd to the same Vasselage and Misery as the Inhabitants of Hispaniola, seeing themselves perish and dy without any redress, fled to the Mountains for shelter, but other Desperado's, put a period to their days with a Halter, and the Husband, together with his Wife and Children, hanging himself, put an end to those Calamities.

By the ferocity of one Spanish Tyrant (whom I knew) above Two Hundred Indians hang'd themselves of their own accord; and a multitude of People perished by this kind of Death.

A certain Person here in the same Isle constituted to exercise a kind of Royal Power, hapned to have Three Hundred Indians fall to his share, of which in Three Months, through excessive labour, One Hundred and Sixty were destroy'd, insomuch that in a short space there remained but a tenth part alive, namely Thirty, but when the number was doubled, they all perisht at the same rate, and all that were bestow'd upon him lost their lives, till at length he paid his last Debt to Nature and the Devil.

In Three or Four Months time I being there present, Six Thousand

Children and upward were murder'd, because they had lost their Parents

who labour'd in the Mines; nay I was a Witness of many other stupendous

Villanies.



But afterward they consulted how to persecute those that lay hid in the Mountains, who were miserably massacred, and consequently this Isle made desolate, which I saw not long after, and certainly it is a dreadful and depolorable sight to behold it thus unpeopled and laid waste, like a Desert.

Of the CONTINENT.

In the Year 1514, a certain unhappy Governour Landed on the firm Land or Continent, a most bloody Tyrant, destitute of all Mercy and Prudence, the Instrument of God's Wrath, with a Resolution to people these parts with Spaniards; and although some Tyrants had touched here before him, and Cruelty hurried them into the other World by several wayes of Slaughter, yet they came no farther than to the Sea Coast, where they comitted podigious Thefts and Robberies, but this Person exceeded all that ever dwelt in other Islands, though execrable and profligate Villains: for he did not only ravage and depopulate the Sea-Coast, but buried the largest Regions and most ample Kingdoms in their own Ruins, sending Thousdands to Hell by his Butcheries. He made Incursions for many Miles continuance, that is to say, in those Countries that are included in the Territories of Darien and the Provinces of Nicaraqua, where are near Five Hundred Miles of the most Fertil Land in the World, and the most opulent for Gold of all the Regions hitherto discover'd. And although Spain has bin sufficiently furnished with the purest Gold, yet it was dig'd out of the Bowels and Mines of the said Countries by the Indians, where (as we have said) they perished.

This Ruler, with his Complices found out new inventions to rack, torment, force and extort Gold from the Indians. One of his Captains in a certain Excursion undertaken by the Command of his Governeur to make Depraedations, destroy'd Forty Thousand Persons and better exposing them to the edge of the Sword, Fire, Dogs and variety of Torments; of all which a Religious Man of the Order of St. Francis, Franciscus de S. Romano, who was then present was an Eye-Witness.

Great and Injurious was the blindness of those praesided over the Indians; as to the Conversion and Salvation of this People: for they denyed in Effect what they in their flourishing Discourse pretended to, and declar'd with their Tongue what they contradicted in their Heart; for it came to this pass, that the Indians should be commanded on the penalty of a bloody War, Death, and perpetual Bondage, to embrace the Christian Faith, and submit to the Obedience of the Spanish King; as if the Son of God, who suffered Death for the Redemption of all Mankind, had enacted a Law, when he pronounced these words, Go and teach all Nations that Infidels, living peaceably and quietly in their Hereditary Native Country, should be impos'd upon pain of Confiscation of all their Chattels, Lands, Liberty, Wives, Children, and Death itself, without any precedent instruction to Confess and Acknowledge the true God, and subject themselves to a King, whom they never saw, or heard mention'd before; and whose Messengers behav'd themselves toward them with such Inhumanity and Cruelty as they had done hitherto. Which is certainly a most foppish and absurd way of Proceeding, and merits nothing but Scandal, Derision, nay Hell itself. Now suppose this Notorious and Profligate Governour had bin impower'd to see the Execution of these Edicts perform'd, for of themselves they were repugnant both to Law and Equity; yet he commanded (or they who were to see the Execution thereof, did it of their own Heads without Authority) that when they phansied or proposed to themselves any place, that was well stor'd with Gold, to rob and feloniously steal it away from the Indians living in their Cities and Houses, without the least suspicion of any ill Act. These wicked Spaniards, like Theives came to any place by stealth, half a Mile off of any City, Town or Village, and there in the Night published and proclaim'd the Edict among themselves after this manner:

You Cacics and Indians of this Continent, the Inhabitants of such a Place, which they named; We declare or be it known to you all, that there is but one God, one hope, and one King of Castile, who is Lord of these Countries; appear forth without delay, and take the oath of Allegiance to the Spanish King, as his Vassals.

So about the Fourth Watch of the Night, or Three in the Morning these poor Innocents overwhelm'd with heavy Sleep, ran violently on that place they named, set Fire to their Hovels, which were all thatcht, and so, without Notice, burnt Men, Women and Children; kill'd whom they pleas'd upon the Spot; but those they preserv'd as Captives, were compell'd throughTorments to confess where they had hid the Gold, when they found little or none at their Houses; but they who liv'd being first stigmatized, were made Slaves; yet after the Fire was extinguisht, they came hastily in quest of the Gold. Thus did this Wicked Man, devoted to all the Infernal Furies, behave himself with the Assistance of Profligate Christians, whom he had lifted in his Service from the 14th to the 21. or 22. Year, together with his Domestick Servants and Followers, from whom he received as many Portions, besides what he had from his Slaves in Gold, Pearls, and Jewels, as the Chief Governor would have taken, and all that were constituted to execute any kind of Kingly Office followed in the same Footsteps; every one sending as many of his Servants as he could spare, to share in the spoil. Nay he that came hither as Biship first of all did the same also, And at the vory time (as I conjecture) the Spaniards did depraedate or rob this Kingdom of above Ten Hundred Thousand Crowns of Gold: Yet all these their Thefts and Felonies, we scarce find upon Record that Three Hundred Thousand Castilian Crowns ever came into the Spanish King's Coffers; yet there were above Eight Hundred Thousand Men slain: The other Tyrants who governed this Kingdom afterward to the Three and Thirtieth year, depriv'd all of them of Life that remain'd among the Inhabitants.

Among all those flagitious Acts committed by this Governour while he rul'd this Kindom, or by his Consent and Permission this must by no means be omitted: A certain Casic, bestowing on him a Gift, voluntarily, or (which is more probably) induced thereunto by Fear, about the weight of Nine Thousand Crowns, but the Spaniards not satisfied with so fast a Sum of Money, sieze him, fix him to a Pole; extended his Feet, which being mov'd near the Fire, they demanded a larger Sum; the Casic overcome with Torments, sending home, procur'd Three Thousand more to be brought and presented to them: But the Spaniards, adding new Torments to new Rage and Fury, when they found he would confer no more upon them, which was because he could not, or otherwize because he would not, they expos'd him for so long to that Torture, till by degrees of heat the Marrow gusht out of the Soles of his Feet, and so he dyed; Thus they often murder'd the Lords and Nobles which such Torments to Extort the Gold from them.

One time it hapned that a Century or Party of One Hundred Spaniards making Excursions, came to a Mountain, where many People shunning so horrid and pernicious an Enemy conceal'd themselves, who immediately rushing on them, putting all to the Sword they could meet with, and then secur'd Seventy or Eighty Married Women as well as Virgins Captives; but a great Number of Indians with a fervent desire of recovering their Wives and Daughters appear'd in Arms against the Spaniards, and when they drew near the Enemy, they unwilling to lose the Prey, run the Wives and Maidens through with their Swords. The Indians through Grief and Trouble, smiting their Breasts, brake out into these Exclamations. O perverse Generation of Men! O Cruel Spaniards! What do you Murder las Iras? (In their Language they call Women by the Name of las Iras as if they had said: To slay Women is an Act of bloody minded Men, worse than Brutes and Wild Beasts.

There was the House of a Puissant Potentate scituated about Ten or Fifteen Miles from Panama, whose name was Paris, very Rich in Gold; and the Spaniards gave him a visit, who were entertained with Fraternal Kindness, and Courteously received, and of his own accord, presented the Captain with a Gift of Fifteen Thousand Crowns; who was of opinion, as well as the rest of the Spaniards, that he who bestow'd such a quantity of Money gratis, was the Master of vast Treasure; whereupon they counterfeit a pretended Departure, but returning about the Fourth Night-Watch, and entring the City privily upon a surprize, which they thought was sufficiently secur'd, consecrated it with many Citizens to the Flames, and robb'd them of Fifty or Sixty Thousand Crowns. The Dynast or Prince escaped with his Life, and gathering together as great a Number of Men as he could possibly at that instant of time, and Three or Four Days being elapsed, pursued the Spaniards, who had depriv'd him also by Violence and Rapine of a Hundred and Thirty or Forty Thousand Crowns, and pouring in upon them, recover'd all his Gold with the destruction of Fifty Spaniards, but the remainder of them having receiv'd many Wounds in that Rencounter betook them to their Heels and sav'd themselves by flight: but in few days after the Spaniards return, and fall upon the said Casic well-arm'd and overthrow him and all his Forces, and they who out-liv'd the Combat, to their great Misfortune, were expos'd to the usual and frequently mention'd Bondage.

Of the Province of NICARAQUA.

The said Tyrant An. Dom. 1522. proceeded farther very unfortunately to the Subjugation of Conquest of this Province. In truth no Person can satisfactorily or sufficiently express the Fertility, Temperateness of the Climate, or the Multitude of the Inhabitants of Nicaraqua, which was almost infinite and admirable; for this Region contain'd some Cities that were Four Miles long; and the abundance of Fruits of the Earth (which was the cause of such a Concourse of People) was highly commendable. The People of this place, because the Country was Level and Plain, destitute of Mountains, so very delightful and pleasant, that they could not leave it without great grief, and much dissatisfaction, they were therefore tormented with the greater Vexations and Persecutions, and forced to bear the Spanish Tyranny and Servitude, which as much Patience as they were Masters of: Add farther that they were peaceable and meek spirited. This Tyrant with these Complices of his Cruelty did afflict this Nation (whose advice he made use of in destroying the other Kingdoms) with such and so many great Dammages, Slaughters, Injustice, Slaver, and Barbarisme, that a Tongue, though of Iron, could not express them all fully. He sent into the Province (which is larger than the County of Ruscinia) Fifty Horse-Men, who put all the People to the Edge of the Sword, sparing neither Age nor Sex upon the most trivial and inconsiderable occasion: As for Example, if they did not come to them with all possible speed, when called; and bring the imposed burthen of Mahid (which signifies Corn in their Dialect) or if they did not bring the Number of Indians required to his own, and the Service or rather Servitude of his Associates. And the Country being all Campaign or Level, no Person was able to withstand the Hellish Fury of their Horses.

He commanded the Spaniards to make Excursions, that is, to rob other Provinces, permitting and granting these Theiving Rogues leave to take away by force as many of these peacable People as they could, who being iron'd (that they might not sink under the Burthen of Sixty or Eighty Pound weight) it frequently hapned, that of Four Thousand Indians, Six only returned home, and so they dyed by the way; but if any of them chanced to faint, being tired with over-weighty Burthens, or through great Hunger and Thirst should be siezed with a Distemper; or too much Debility and Weakness, that they might not spend time in taking off their Fetters, they beheaded them, so the Head fell one way, and the Body another: The Indians when they spied the Spaniards making preparations for such Journeys, knowing very well, that few, or none returned home alive, just upon their setting out with Sighs and Tears, burst out into these or the like Expressions.

Those were Journeys, which we travelled frequently in the service of

Christians, and in some tract of time we return'd to our Habitations,

Wives and Children: But now there being no hope of a return, we are for

ever depriv'd of their Sight and Conversation.



It hapned also, that the same President would dissipate or disperse the Indians de novo at his own pleasure, to the end (as it was reported) he might violently force the Indians away from such as did infest or molest him; and dispose of them to others; upon which it fell out, that for the space of a Year complete, there was no sowing or planting: And when they wanted Bread, the Spaniards did by force plunder the Indians of the whole stock of Corn that they had laid up for the support of their Families, and by these indirect Courses above Thirty Thousand perished with Hunger. Nay it fortun'd at one time, that a Woman opprest with insufferable Hunger, depriv'd her own Son of his Life to preserve her own.

In this Province also they brought many to an untimely End, loading their Shoulders with heavy planks and pieces of Timer, which they were compell'd to carry to a Haven Forty Miles distant, in order to their building of Ships; sending them likewise unto the Mountains to find out Hony and Wax, where they were devour'd by Tygers; nay they loaded Women impregnated with Carriage and Burthens fit for beasts.

But no greater pest was there that could unpeople this Province, than the License granted the Spaniards by this Governour, to demand Captives from the Casics and Potentates of this Region; for at the Expiration of Four or Five Months, or as often as they obtain'd leave of the Governour to demand them, they deliver'd them up Fifty Servants, and the Spaniards terrified them with Menaces, that if they did not obey them in answering their unreasonable Demands, they should be burnt alive, or baited to Death by Dogs. Now the Indians are but slenderly stor'd with Servants; for it is much if a Casic hath Three or Four in his Retinue, therefore they have recourse to the Subjects; and when they had, in the first place, seized the Orphans, they required earnestly and instantly one Son of the Parent, who had but Two, and Two of him that had but Three, and for the Lord of the place satisfied the desires of the Tyrant, not without the Effusion of Tears and Groans of the People, who (as it seems) were very careful of their Children. And this being frequently repeated in the space between the Year 1523, and 1533, the Kingdom lost all their Inhabitants, for in Six or Seven Years time there were constantly Five or Six Ships made ready to be fraighted with Indians that were sold in the Regions of Panama and Perusium, where they all dyed; for it is by dayly Experience prov'd and known, that the Indians when Transported out of their Native Country into any other, soon dye; because they are shortned in their allowance of Food, and the Task impos'd on them no ways dimished, they being only bought for Labour. And by this means, there have been taken out of this Province Five Hundred Thousand Inhabitants and upward, who before were Freemen, and made Slaves, and in the Wars made on them, and the horrid Bondage they were reduc'd unto Fifty or Sixty Thousand more have perished, and to this day very many still are destroy'd. Now all these Slaughters have been committed within the space of Fourteen years inclusively, possibly in this Province of Nicaraqua there remains Four or Five Thousand Men who are put to Death by ordinary and personal Opressions, whereas (according to what is said already) it did exceed other Countries of the World in multitude of People.

Of new SPAIN.

New Spain was discovered Anno Dom. 1517. and in the detection there was no first or second Attempt, but all were exposed to slaughter. The year ensuing those Spaniards (who style themselves Christians) came thither to rob, kill and slay, though they pretend they undertook this Voyage to people the Countrey. From this year to the present, viz. 1542. the Injustice, Violence and Tyranny of the Spaniards came to the highest degree of extremety: for they had shook hands with and bid adieu to all fear of God and the King, unmindful of themselves in this sad and deplorable condition, for the Destructions, Cruelties, Butcheries, Devastations, the Domolishing of Cities, Depradations, &c. which they perpetrated in so many and such ample Kingdoms, are such and so great, and strike the minds of Men with so great horror, that all we have related before are inconsiderable comparatively to those which have been acted from the year 1518 to 1542, and to this very month of September that we now live to see the most heavy, grievous and detestable things are committed, that the Rule we laid down before as a Maxim might be induputably verified, to wit, that from the beginning they ran headlong from bad to worse, and were overcome in their Diabolical acts and wickedness only by themselves.

Thus from the first entrance of the Spaniards into New Spain, which hapned on the 18th day of April in the said month of the year 1518, to 1530, the space of ten whole years, there was no end or period put to the Destruction and Slaughters committed by the merciless hands of the Sanguinary and Blood-thirsty Spaniard in the Continent, or space of 450 Miles round about Mexico, and the adjacent or neighboring parts, which might contain four or five spatious Kingdoms, that neither for magnitude or fertility would give Spain her self the pre-eminance. This intire Region was more populous then Toledo, Sevil, Valedolid, Saragoza, and Faventia; and there is not at this day in all of them so many people, nor when they flourisht in their greatest height and splendor was there such a number, as inhabited that Region, which embraceth in its Circumference, four hundred and eighty Miles. Within these twelve years the Spaniards have destroyed in the Said Countinent, by Spears, Fire and Sword, computing Men, Women, Youth, and Children above Four Millions of people in these their Acquests or Conquests (for under that word they mask their Cruel Actions) or rather those of the Turk himself, which are reported of them, tending to the ruin of the Catholick Cause, together with their Invasions and Unjust Wars, contrarty to and condemned by Divine as well as Human Laws; nor are they reckoned in this number who perished by their more then Egyptian Bondage and usual Oppressions.

There is no Tongue, Art, or Human knowledge can recite the horrid Impieties, which these Capital Enemies to Government and all Mankind have been guilty of at several times and in several Nations; nor can the circumstantial Aggravations of some of their wicked Acts be unfolded or display'd by any manner of Industry, time or writing, but yet I will say somewhat of every individual particular thing, which this protestation and Oath, that I conceive I am not able to comprehend one of a Thousand.

———————————————————————————————————

Of New Spain in Particular.

Among other Slaughters this also they perpetrated in the most spacious City of Cholula, which consisted of Thirty Thousand Families; all the Chief Rulers of that Region and Neighboring places, but first the Priests with their High Priest going to meet the Spaniards in Pomp and State, and to the end they might give them a more reverential and honourable reception appointed them to be in the middle of the Solemnity, that so being entertained in the Appartments of the most powerful and principal Noblemen, they might be lodged in the City. The Spaniards presently consult about their slaughter or castigation (as they term it) that they might fill every corner of this Region by their Cruelties and wicked Deeds with terror and consternation; for in all the Countries that they came they took this course, that immediately at their first arrival they committed some notorious butcheries, which made those Innocent Sheep tremble for fear. To this purpose therefore they sent to the Governours and Nobles of the Cities, and all Places subject unto them, together with their supream Lord, that they should appear before them, and no soner did they attend in expectation of some Capitulation or discourse with the Spanish Commander, but they were presently seized upon and detained prisoners before any one could advertise or give them notice of their Captivity. They demanded of them six thousand Indians to drudge for them in the carriage of their bag and baggage; and as soon as they came the Spaniards clapt them into the Yards belonging to their Houses and there inclosed them all. It was a thing worthy of pity and compassion to behold this wretches people in what a condition they were when they prepared themselves to receive the burthens laid on them by the Spaniards. They came to them naked, their Privities only vail'd, their Shoulders loaden with food; only covered with a Net, they laid themselves quietly on the ground, and shrinking in their Bodies like poor Wretches, exposed themselves to their Swords: Thus being all gathered together in ther Yards, some of the Spaniards Armed held the doors to drive them away if attempting to approach, and others with Lances and Swords Butcher these Innocents so that not one of them escaped, but two or three days after some of them, who hid themselves among the dead bodies, being all over besprinkled with blood and gore, presented themselves to the Spaniards, imporing their mercy and the prolongation of their Lives with tears in their Eyes and all imaginable submission, yet they, not in the least moved with pity or compassion, tore them in pieces: but all the Chief Governours who were above one hundred in number, were kept bound, whom the Captain commanded to be affixed to posts and burnt; yet the King of the whole Countrey escaped, and betook himself with a Train of thirty or forty Gentlemen, to a Temple (called in their Tongue Quu) which he made use of as a Castle or Place of Defence, and there defended himself a great part of the day, but the Spaniards who suffer none to escape out of their clutches, especially Souldiers, setting fire to the Temple, burnt all those that were there inclosed, who brake out into these dying words and exclamations. O profligate Men, what injury have we done you to occasion our death! Go, go to Mexico, where our supream Lord Montencuma will revenge our cause upon your persons. And 'tis reported, while the Spaniards were engated in this Tragedy destroying six or seven thousand Men, that their Commander with great rejoycing sang this following Ayre;

Mira Nero de Tarpeia, Roma como se ardia, Gritos de Ninos y Vieyot, y el de nadase dolia.

From the Tarpeian still Nero espies

Rome all in Flames with unrelenting Eyes,

And hears of young and old the dreadful Cries.



They also committed a very great Butchery in the City Tepeara, which was larger and better stored with Houses than the former; and here they Massacred an incredible number with the point of the Sword.

Setting sail from Cholula, they steer'd their course to Mexico, whose King sent his Nobles and Peers with abundance of Presents to meet them by the way, testifying by divers sorts of Recreations how grateful their arrival was and acceptable to him: but when they came to a steep Hill, his brother went forward to meet them accompanied with many Noblemen who brought them many gifts in Gold, Silver, and Robes Emboidered with Gold and at their entrance into the City, the King himself carried in a golden Litter, together (with the whole Court) attended them to the Palace prepared for their reception; and that very day as I was informed by some persons then and there present by a grand piece of Treachery, they took the very great King Montencuma, never so much as dreaming of any such surprize, and put him into the custody of eighty Soldiers, and afterward loaded this Legs with irons; but all these things being passed over with a light pencil of which much might be said, one thing I will discover acted by them, that may merit your obervation. When the Captain arrived at the Haven, to fight with a Spanish Officer, who made War against him, and left another with an hundred Soldiers, more or less as a Guard to King Montencuma, it came into their heads, that to act somewhat worth remembrance, that the dread of their Cruelty might be more and more apprehended, and greatly increased.

In the interim all the Nobility and Commonality of the City thought of nothing else, but how to exhilarate the Spirit of their Captive King, and solace him during his Confinement with varity of diversions and Recreations; and among the rest this was one, viz., Revellings and Dances which they celebrated in all Streets and Highways, by night and they in their Idiom term Mirotes, as the Islanders do Arcytos; to these Masques and nocturnal Jigs they usually go with all their Riches, Costly Vestments and Robes, together with any thing that is pretious and glorious, being wholly addicted to this humor, nor is there any greater token among them then this of their extraordinary exultation and rejoycing. The Nobles in like manner, and Princes of the Blood Royal every one according to his degree exercise these Masques and Dances, in some place adjoyning to the House where their King and Lord is detained Prisoner. Now there were not far from the Palace about 2000 Young Noblemen who were the issue of the greatest Potentates of the Kingom, and indeed the flower of the whole Nobility of King Motencuma, and a Spanish Captain went to visit them with some Soldiers, and sent others to the rest of the places in the City where these Revellings were kept, under pretence only of being spectators of the solemnity. Now the Captain had commanded, that, at a certain hour appointed they should fall upon these Revellers, and he himself approaching the Indians very busie at their Dancing, said, San Jago (that is St. James it seems that was the Word) Let us rush in upon them, which was no sooner heard, but they all began with their naked Swords in hand to pierce their tender and naked Bodies, and spill their generous and Noble blood, till not one of them was left alive on the place, and the rest following his example in other parts, (to their inexpressible stupefaction and grief) seized on all these Provinces. Nor will the Inhabitants till the General conflagration ever discontinue the Celebration of these Festivals, and the Lamentation and Singing with certain kind of Rhythmes in their Arcytos, the doleful ditty of the Calamity and Ruin of this Seminary of the antient Nobility of the whole Kingdom, which was their frequent Pride and Glory.

The Indians seeing this not to be exampled cruelty and iniquity executed against such a number of guiltless persons, and also bearing with incredible patience the unjust Imprisonment of their King, from whom they had an absolute Command not to take up Arms against the Spaniard, the whole City was suddenly up in Arms fell on the Spaniards and wounded many of them, the rest hardly escaping; but they presenting the point of a Sword to the Kings Breast, threatned him with death unless he out of the Window commanded them to desist; but the Indians for the present disobeying the Kings Mandate, proceeded to the Election of a Generalissimo, or Commander in Chief over all their Forces; and because that the Captain, who went to the Port returned Victor, and brought away a far greater number of Spaniards then he took along with him, there was a Cessation of Arms for three or four days, till he re-entred the City, and then the Indians having gatherered together and made up a great Army, fought so long and so strenuously, that the Spaniards despairing of their safety, called a Council of War and therein resolv'd to retreat in the dead time of night and so draw off their Forces from the City: which coming to the knowledge of the Indians they destroyed a great number Retreating on the Bridges made over their Lakes in this just and Holy War, for the causes above-mentioned, deserving the approbation of every upright Judge. But afterward the Spaniards having recruited and got together in a Body, they resolved to take the City and carried it at last, wherein most detestable Butcheries were acted, a vast number of the people slain, and their Rulers perished in the Flames.

All these horrid Muders being commited in Mexico and other Cities ten, fifteen and twenty miles distant. This same Tyranny and Plague in the abstract proceeded to infest and lay desolate Panuco; a Region abounding with Inhabitants even to admiration, nor were the slaughters therein perpetrated less stupendous and wonderful. In the same manner they utterly laid wasate the Provinces of Futepeca, Ipilcingonium and Columa, every one of them being as large as the Kingdoms of Leon, and Castile. It would be very difficult or rather impossible to relate the Cruelties and Destruction there made and committed, and prove very nauseous and offensive to the Reader.

'Tis observable, that they entred upon these Dominions and laid waste the Indian Territories, so populous, that it would have rejoyced the hearts of all true Christians to see their number upon no other title or pretense, but only to enslave them; for at their first arrival they compel'd them to swear the Oath of Obedience and Fealty to the King of Spain, and if they did not condescend to it, they menace them with death and Vassalage, and they who did not forthwith appear to satisfie the unequitable Mandates, and submit to the will and pleasure of such unjust and Cruel Men were declared Rebels, and accu's of that Crime before our Lord the King; and blindess or ignorance of those who were set over the Indians as Rulers did so darken their understanding that they did not apprehend that known and incontrovertible Maxim in Law, That no Man can be called a Rebel, who is not first proved to be a subject. I omit the injuries and prejudice they do to the King himself, when they spoil and ravage his Kingdoms, and as much as in them lies, diminish and impair all his Right and Title to the Indians, nay in plain English invalidate and make it null and void. And these are the worthy Services which the Spaniards do for our Kings in those Countries, by the injust and colourable pretences aforesaid.

This Tyrant upon the same pretext sent two other Captains, who exceeded him in impiety and cruelty, if possible to the most flourishing and Feril (in Fruits and Men) Kingdoms of Guatemala, Situate toward the South, who had also received Orders to go to the Kingdoms of Naco, Hondera, and Guaymura, verging upon the North, and are Borderers on Mexico three hundred miles together. The one was sent by Land and the other by Sea, and both well furnished with Horse and Foot.

This I declare for a Truth, that the outrages committed by these two, particularly by him that went to Guatimala (for the other not long after his departure died a violent Death) would afford matter sufficient for an entire Volume, and when completed he so crouded with slaughters, injuries, butcheries and inhuman Desolations, so horrid and detestable as would Ague-shake the present as well as future ages with terror.

He that put out to Sea vexed all the Maritime Coasts with his cruel Incursions; now some inhabitants of the Kingdom of Jucatan which is seated in the way to the Kingdoms of Naco and Naymura, to which places he steered his course, came to meet him with burthens of Presents and Gifts: and as soon as he approacht them, sent his Captains with a party of Soldiers to depopulate their Land, who committed great spoils and made cruel slaughters among them; and in particular a Seditious and Rebellious Officer who with three hundres Soldiers entred a Neighboring Country to Guatimala, and there firing the Cities and Murdering all the Inhabitants, violently deprived them of all their goods, which he did designedly, for the space of an hundred and twenty miles; to the end that if his Companions should follow them, they might find the Country laid wast, and so be destroyed by the Indians in revenge for the dammage they had received by him and his Forces which hapned accordingly: for the Chief Commander whose order the abovesaid Captain had disobey'd and so became a Rebel to him, was there slain. But many other bloody Tyrants succeeded him, who from the year 1524 to 1535. did unpeople and make a Desert of the Provinces of Naco and Hondura (as well as other places) which were lookt upon as the Paradise of delights, and better peopled then other Regions; insomuch that within the Term of these eleven years there fell in those Countries above two Millions of Men, and now there are hardly remaining Two Thousand, who dayly dye by the severity of their Slavery.

But to return to that great Tyrant, who outdid the former in cruelty (as hinted above) and is equal to those that Tyrannize there at present, who travelled to Guatimala; he from the Provinces adjoyning to Mexico, which according to his prosecuted journey (as he himself Writes and testifies with his own hand in Letters to the Prince of Tyrants) are distant from Guatimala four hundred miles, did make it to his urgent and dayly business to procure Ruin and Destruction by slaughter, Fire and Depopulations, compelling all to submit to the Spanish King, whom they lookt upon to be more unjust and cruel then his inhumane and bloodthirsty Ministers.

Of the Kingdom and Province of GUATIMALA.

This Tyrant at his first entrance here acted and commanded prodigious Slaughters to be perpetrated: Notwithstanding which, the Chief Lord in his Chair or Sedan attended by many Nobles of the City of Ultlatana, the Emporium of the whole Kingdom, together with Trumpets, Drums and great Exultation, went out to meet him, and brought with them all sorts of Food in great abundance, with such things as he stood in most need of. That Night the Spaniards spent without the City, for they did not judge themselves secure in such a well-fortified place. The next day he commanded the said Lord with many of his Peers to come before him, from whom they imperiously challenged a certain quantity of Gold; to whom the Indians return'd this modest Answer, that they could not satisfie his Demands, and indeed this Region yeilded no Golden Mines; but they all, by his command, without any other Crime laid to their Charge, or any Legal Form of Proceeding were burnt alive. The rest of the Nobles belonging to other Provinces, when they found their Chief Lords, who had the Supreme Power were expos'd to the Merciless Element of Fire kindled by a more merciless Enemy; for this Reason only, becauase they bestow'd not what they could not upon them, viz. Gold, they fled to the Mountains, (their usual Refuge) for shelter, commanding their Subjects to obey the Spaniards, as Lords, but withal strictly and expressly prohibiting and forbidding them, to inform the Spaniards of their Flight, or the Places of their Concealment. And behold a great many of the Indians addrest themselves to them, earnestly requesting, they would admit them as Subjects, being very willing and ready to serve them: The Captain replyed that he would not entertain them in such a Capacity, but instead of so doing would put every individual Person to Death, if they would not discover the Receptacles of the Fugitive Governours. The Indians made answer that they were wholly ignorant of the matter, yet that they themselves, their Wives and Children should serve them; that they were at home, they might come to them and put them to Death, or deal with them as they pleas'd. But the Spaniards, O wonderful! went to the Towns and Villages, and destroy'd with their Lances these poor Men, their Wives and Children, intent upon their Labour, and as they thought themselves, secure and free from danger. Another large Village they made desolate in the space of two hours, sparing neither Age, nor Sex, putting all to the Sword, without Mercy.

The Indians perceiving that this Barbarous and Hard-hearted People would not be pacified with Humility, large Gifts, or unexampled Patience, but that they were butcher'd without any Cause, upon serious Consultation took up a Resolution of getting together in a Body, and fighting for their Lives and Liberty; for they conceiv'd it was far better, (since Death to them was a necessary Evil) with Sword in Hand to be kill'd by taking Revenge of the Enemy, then be destroy'd by them without satisfaction. But when they grew sensible of their wants of Arms, Nakedness and Debility, and that they were altogether incapable of the management of Horses, so as to prevail against such a furious Adversary, recollecting themselves, they contriv'd this Strategm, to dig Ditches and Holes in the High-way into which the Horses might fall in their passage, and fixing therein purposely sharp and burnt Posts, and covering them with loose Earth, so that they could not be discern'd by their Riders, they might be transfixed or gored by them. The Horses fell twice or thrice into those holes, but afterward the Spaniards took this Course to prevent them for the future; and made this a Law, that as many of the Indians of what Age or Sex soever as were taken, should be cast into these Ditches that they had made. Nay they threw into them Women with Child, and as many Aged Men as they laid hold of, till they were all fill'd up with Carkasses. It was a sight deserving Commiseration, to behold Women and Children gauncht or run through with these Posts, some were taken off by Spears and Swords, and the remainder expos'd to hungry Dogs, kept short of food for that purpose, to be devour'd by them and torn in pieces. They burnt a Potent Nobleman in a very great Fire, saying, That he was the more Honour'd by this kind of Death. All which Butcheries continued Seven Years, from 1524, to 1531. I leave the Reader to judge how many might be Massacred during that time.

Among the Innumerable Flagitious Acts done by this Tyrant and his Co-partners (for they were as Barbarous as their Principal) in this Kingdom, this also occurs worthy of an Afterism in the Margin. In the Province of Cuztatan in which S. Saviour's City is seated, which Country with the Neighbouing Sea-Coasts extends in Length Forty or Fifty Miles, as also in the very City of Cuzcatan, the Metropolis of the whole Province, he was entertain'd with great Applause: For about Twenty or Thirty Thousand Indians brought with them Hens and other necessary Provisions, expecting this coming. He, accepting their Gifts, commended every single Spaniard to make choice of as many of these People, as he had a mind to, that during their stay there, they might use them as Servants, and forced to undergo the most servile Offices they should impose on them. Every one cull'd out a Hundred, or Fifty, according as he thought convenient for his peculiar service, and these wretched Indians did serve the Spaniards with their utmost strength and endeavour; so that there could be nothing wanting in them but Adoration. In the mean time this Captain requir'd a great Sum of Gold from their Lords (for that was the Load-stone attracted them thither) who answered, they were content to deliver him up all the Gold they had in possession; and in order thereunto, the Indians gathered together a great Number of Spears gilded with Orichalcum, (which had the appearance of Gold, and in truth some Gold in them intermixt) and they were presented to him. The Captain ordered them to be toucht, and when he found them to be Orichalcum or mixt Metal, he spake to the Spaniards as followeth. Let that Nation that is without Gold be accursed to the Pit of Hell. Let every Man detain those Servants he Elected, let them be clapt in Irons, and stigmatiz'd with the Brand of Slavery, which was accordingly done, for they were all burnt, who did no excape with the King's Mark. I my self saw the Impression made on the Son of the Chiefest Person in the City. Those that escap'd, with other Indians, engaged the Spaniards by Force of Arms, but with such ill success, that abundance of them lost their Lives in the Attempt. After this they return'd to Gautimala, where they built a City, which God in his Judgement with Three Deluges, the First of Water, the Second of Earth, the Third of Stones, as big as half a score Oxen, all concurring at one and the same time, laid Level with its own Ashes. Now all being slain who were capable of bearing Arms against them, the rest were enslav'd, paying so much per Head for Men and Women as a Ransom; for they use no other servitude here, and then they were sent into Pecusium to be sold, by which means together with their slaughters committed upon the Inhabitants, they destroy'd and made a Desert of this Kingdom, which in Breadth as well as Length contains One Hundred Miles; and with his Associates and Brethren in Iniquity, Four Millions at least in Fifteen or Sixteen Years, that is, from 1524, to 1540 were murdered, and dayly continues destroying the small residue of that People with his Cruelties and Brutishness.

It was the usual Custom of this Tyrant, when he made War with any City or Province, to take along with himas many of those Indians he had subjugated as he could, that they might fight with their Country-men; and when he had in his Army Twenty, or sometimes Thirty Thousand of them, and could not afford them sustenance, he permitted them to feed on the Flesh of other Indians taken Prisoners in War; and so kept a Shambles of Man's Flesh in his Army, suffered Children to be kill'd and roasted before his Face. They butcher'd the Men for their Feet and Hands only; for these Members were accounted by them Dainties, most delicious Food.

He as the Death of many by the intolerable Labour of Carrying Ships by Land, causing them to Transport those Vessels with Anchors of a vast weight from the Septentrional to the Mediterranean Sea, which are One Hundred and Thirty Miles distant; as also abundance of great Guns of the largest fort, which they carried on their bare, naked shoulders, so that opprest with many great and ponderous Burthens, (I say no more than what I saw) they dyed by the way: He separated and divided Families, forcing Married Men from their Wives, and Maids from their Parents, which he bestow'd upon his Marriners and Soldiers, to gratifie their burning Lust. All his Ships he freighted with Indians, where Hunger and Thirst discharg'd them of their Servitude and his Cruelty by a welcome Death. He had two Companies of Soldiers who hackt and tore them in pieces, like Thunder from Heaven speedily. O how many Parents has he robb'd of their Children, how many Wives of their Husbands, and Children of their Parents? How many Adulteries, Rapes, and what Libidinous Acts hath he been guilty of? How many hath he enslav'd and opprest with insufferable Anguish and unspeakable Calamities? How many Tears, Sighs and Groans hath he occasion'd? To how many has he bin the Author of Desolation, during their Peregrination in this, and of Damnation in the World to come, not only to Indians, whose Number is numberless, but even to Spaniards themselves, by whose help and assistance he committed such detestable Butcheries and flagitious Crimes? I supplicate Almighty God, that he would please to have Mercy on his Soul, and require no other satisfaction than the violent Death, which turn'd him out of this World.

A farther Discourse of New Spain: And some Account of Panuco and Xalisco.

After the perpetration of all the Cruelties rehearsed in New Spain and other places, there came another Rabid and Cruel Tyrant to Panuco, who acted the part of a bloody Tragedian as well as the rest, and sent away many Ships loaden with these Barbarians to be sold for Slaves, made this Province almost a Wilderness, and which was deplorable, Eight Hundred Indians, that had Rational Souls were given in Exchange for a Burthen-bearing-Beast, a Mule, or Camel. Well, He was made Governour of the City of Mexico, and all New Spain, and with him many other Tyrants had the Office of Auditors confer'd upon them: Now they had already made such a progress toward the Desolation of this Region, that if the Franciscans had not vigorously opposed them, and that by (the King's Council, the best and greatest Encourager of Vertue) it had not speedily bin prevented, that which hapned to Hispaniola in Two Years, had bin the Fate of Hispania nova, namely to be unpeopled, deferred, and intomb'd in its own Rules. A Companion of this Governour employed Eight Thousand Indians in Erecting a wall to inclose his Garden, but they all dyed, having no Supplies, nor Wages from him, to support themselves, at whose Death he was not in the least concern'd.

After the first Captain before spoken of had absolutely profliaged and ruin'd the Panuconians, Fifteen Thousand whereof perished by carrying their Bag and Baggage: At length he arriv'd at the Province of Machuacan, which is Forty Miles Journey from Mexico, and as Fertile and Populous: The King to honour him in the Rencounter, with a Multiple of People, marcheth toward him, from whom he had received One Thousand Services and Civilities very considerable, who gratefully requited him with Captivity, because Fame had nois'd it abroad, that he was a most Opulent Prince in Gold and Silver; and to the end he might export from, and purge him of his Gold, he was cruciated with Torments after this manner; his Body was extended, Hands bound to a Post, and his Feet put into a pair of Stocks, they all the while applying burning Coals to his Feet at a tormenting distance, where a Boy attended, who by little and little sprinkled them with Oyl, that his Flesh might roast the better: Before him there stood a Wicked Fellow, presenting a Bow to his Breast charged with a Mortal Arrow, (if let fly) behind him, another with Dogs held in with Chains, which he threatned to let loose at him, which if done, he had bin torn to pieces in a moment; and with these kind of Torments they racked him to extort a Confession, where his Treasures lay; till a Franciscan Monk came and deliver'd him from his Torments, but not from Death, for he departed this miserable Life not long after: And this was the severe Fate of many Cacics and Indian Lords, who dyed with the same Torments which they were expos'd to by the Spaniards, in order to the engrossing of their Gold and Sliver to themselves.

At this very time, A certain Visiter of Purses rather than Souls hapned to be here present, who (finding some Indian Idols which were hid; for they were no better instructed in the Knowledge of the true God by reason of the Wicked Documents and Dealings of the Spaniards) detain'd Grandees as Slaves, till they had deliver'd him all their Idols, for he phancied they were made of Gold or Silver, but his Expectation being frustrated, he chastised them with no less Cruelty than Injustice; and that he might not depart bubbled out of all his hopes, constrain'd them to redeem their Idols with Money, that so they might, according to their Custom, Adore them. These are the Fruits of the Spanish Artifices and Juggling Tricks among the Indians, and thus they promoted the honour and worship of God.

This Tyrant from Mechuacam arrives at Xalisco, a Country abounding with People very fruitful, and the Glory of the Indians in this respect, that it had some Towns Seven Miles long; and among other Barbarisms equal to what you have read, which they acted here, this is not to be forgotten, that Women big with Child, were burthen'd with the Luggage of Wicked Christians, and being unable to go out their usual time, through extremity of Toil and Hunger, were necessitated to bring them forth in the High-wayes, which was the Death of many Infants.

At a certain time a profligate Christian attempted to devirginate a Maid, but the Mother being present, resisted him, and endeavouring to free her from his intended Rape, whereat the Spaniard enrag'd, cut off her Hand with a short Sword, and stab'd the Virgin in several places, till she Expir'd, because she obstinately opposed and disappointed his inordinate Appetite.

In this Kingdom of Xalisco (according to report) they burnt Eight Hundred Towns to Ashes, and for this Reason the Indians growing desperate, beholding the dayly destruction of the Remainders of their matchless Cruelty, made an Insurrection against the Spaniards, slew several of them justly and deservedly, and afterward fled to the insensible Rocks and Mountains (yet more tender and kind than the stony-hearted Enemy) for Sanctuary; where they were miserably Massacred by those Tyrants who succeeded, and there are now few, or none of the Inhabitants to be found. Thus the Spaniards being blinded with the Lustre of their Gold, deserted by God, and given over to a Reprobate Sense, not undrestanding (or at least not willing to do so) that the Cause of the Indians is most Just, as well by the Law of Nature, as the Divine and Humane, they by Force of Arms, destroying them, hacking them in pieces, and turning them out of their own Confines and Dominions, nor considering how unjust those Violences and Tyrannies are, wherewith they have afflicted these poor Creatures, they still contrive to raise new Wars against them: Nay they conceive, and by Word and Writing testifie, that those Victories they have obtain'd against those Innocents to their ruine, are granted them by God himself, as if their unjust Wars were promoted and managed by a just Right and Title to what they pretend; and with boasting Joy return Thanks to God for their Tyranny, in imitation of those Tyrants and Robbers, of whom the Prophet Zechariah part of the Forth and Fifth Verses. Feed the Sheep of the slaughter, whose Possessors slay them, and hold themselves not guilty, and they that sell them say, Blessed by the Lord, for ye are rich.

_Of the Kingdom of _JUCATAN.

An Impious Wretch by his Fabulous Stories and Relations to the King of Spain was made praefect of the Kingdom of Jucatan, in the Year of our Lord 1526; And the other Tyrants to this very day have taken the same indirect Measures to obtain Offices, and screw or wheedle themselves into publick Charges or Employments, for this praetext, and Authority, they had the greater opportunity to commit Theft and Rapine. This Kingdom was very well peopled, and both for Temperature of Air, and the Plenty of Food and Fruits, in which respect it is more Fertile than Mexico, but chiefly for Hony and Wax, it exceeds all the Indian Countries that hath hitherto bin discover'd. It is Three Hundred Miles in Compass. The Inhabitants of this place do much excel all other Indians, either in Politie or Prudence, or in leading a Regular Life and Morality, truly deserving to be instructed in the Knowledge of the true God. Here the Spaniards might have Erected many fair Cities, and liv'd as it were in a Garden of Delights, if they had not, through Covetousness, Stupidity, and the weight of Enormous Crimes rendred themselves unworthy of so great a Benefit. This Tyrant, with Three Hundred Men began to make War with these Innocent People, living peaceably at home, and doing injury to none, which was the ruine of a great Number of them: Now because this Region affords no Gold; and if it did the Inhabitants would soon have wrought away their lives by hard working in the Mines, that so he might accumulate Gold by their bodies and Souls, for which Christ was Crucified: For the generality he made slaves of those whose lives he spared, and sent away such Ships as were driven thither by the Wind of report, loaden with them, exchanging them for Wine, Oyl, Vinegar, Salt Pork, Garments, Pack Horses and other Commodities, which he thought most necessary and fit for his use. He proposed to them the choice of Fifty Virgins, and she that was the fairest or best complexioned he bartered for a small Cask of Wine, Oyl, Vinegar or some inconsiderable quantity of salt Pork, the same exchange he proferred of Two or Three Hundred well-disposed Young Boys, and one of them who had the Mind or presence of a Princes Son, was given up to them for a Cheese, and One Hundred more for a Horse. Thus he continued his flagitious courses from 1526 to 1533, inclusively, till there was news brought of the Wealth and Opulence of the Region of Perusia, whither the Spaniards marcht, and so for some time there was a Cessation of this Tyranny; but in a few days after they returned and acted enormous Crimes, robbed, and imprisoned them and committed higher offences against the God of Heaven; nor have they ye done, so that now these Three Hundred Miles of Land so populous (as I said before) lies now uncultivated and almost deserted.

No Solifidian can believe the particular Narrations of their Barbarism, and Cruelty in those Countreys. I will only relate two or three Stories which are fresh in my memory. The Spaniards used to trace the steps of the Indians, both Men and Women with curst Currs, furious Dogs; an Indian Woman that was sick hapned to be in the way in sight, who perceiving that she was not able to avoid being torn in pieces by the Dogs, takes a Cord that she had and hangs her self upon a Beam, tying her Child (which she unforunately had with her) to her foot; and no sooner had she done, yet the Dogs were at her, tearing the Child, but a Priest coming that way Baptiz'd it before quite dead.

When the Spaniards left this Kingdom, one of them invited the Son of some Indian Governour of a City or Province, to go along with him, who told him he would not leave or desert his Native Countrey, whereupon he threatned to cut off his ears, if he refus'd to follow him: But the Youth persisting resolutely, that he would continue in the place of his Nativity, he drawing his Sword cut off each Ear, notwithstanding which he persever'd in his first opinion, and then as if he had only pincht him, smilingly cut off his Nose and Lips.

This Rogue did lasciviously boast before a Priest, and as if he had merited the greatest applause, commended himself to the very Heavens, saying, ""He had made it his chief Trade or Business to impregnate Indian Women, that when they were sold afterward, he might gain the more Money by them.""

In this Kingdom or (I'm certain) in some Province of New Spain, A Spaniard Hunting and intent on his game, phancyed that his Beagles wanted food; and to supply their hunger snatcht a young little Babe from the Mothers breast, cutting off his Arms and Legs, cast a part of them to every Dog, which they having devour'd, he threw the remainder of the Body to them. Thus it is plainly manifest how they value these poor Creatures, created after the image of God, to cast them to their Canibal Curs. But that which follows is (if possible) a sin of a deeper dye.

I pretermit their unparallel'd Impieties, &c. and only close all with this one Story that follows. Those haughty obdurate and execrable Tyrants, who departed from this Countrey to Fish for Riches in Perusia, and four Monks of the Order of St. Francis, with Father James who Travelled thither also to keep the Countrey in Peace, and attract or mildly perswade by their Preaching the remnant of Inhabitants, that had outlived a septennial Tyranny, to embrace the knowledge of Christ. I conceive these are the persons who in the year 1534, Travelling by Mexico were sollicited by several Messengers from the Indians, to come into their Countrey, and inform them in the knowledge of one God, the true God, and Lord of the whole World: to this end they appointed Assemblies and Councils to examine and understand what Men they were, who called themselves Fathers and Friers, what they intended and what difference there was between them and the Spaniards, by whom they had been so molested and tormented: but they received them at length upon this condition that they should be admitted alone, without any Spaniards, which the Fathers promised; for they had permission, nay an express Mandate from the President of New Spain to make that promise, and that the Spaniards should not do them the least detriment or injury. Then they began, to Preach the Gospel of Christ, and to explicate and declare the pious intention of the King of Castile, of all which they had notice by the Spaniards for seven years together, that they had no King nor no other but him, who oppressed them with so much Tyranny. The Priests continued there but forty days, but behold they bring forth all their Idols to be committed to the flames; and then their Children which they tendred as the apple of the Eye, that they might be instructed. They also erected Temples and Houses for them and they were desired to come to other Provinces and Preach the Gospel, and introduce them into the knowledge of God, and the Great (as they stiled him) King of Castile: And the Priests perswasions wrought so effectually on them, that they condescended to that which was never done in India before (for whatsoever those Tyrants who wasted and consumed these large Kingdoms and Provinces, did misrepresent and falsifie, was only done to bring an odium and disgrace upon the Indians). For Twelve or Fifteen Princes of spatious and well-peopled Regions assembled, every one distinct and separate from the rest, with his own subjects, and by their unanimous consent upon"			[]	['great', 'men', 'thousand', 'miles', 'indians', 'inhabitants', 'gold', 'spaniards', 'death', 'king']

The City Press reported on Sunday (8 November) that an acquisition process by Armscor is aimed at providing president Jacob Zuma and the presidency with a new VIP jet which could cost up to R4 billion.

According to the report, the specifications for the jet include a “private bedroom suite, a bathroom, and a conference room for eight people”.

“The aircraft must be able to carry at least 30 passengers and have a range of 13,800km,” stated the report.

According to the City Press’ findings, there are only a handful of planes that match the tender’s requirements:

A basic Boeing 777 which costs about R3.9 billion

The Boeing 787 which costs about R3.1 billion

The Airbus which A330 costs about R3 billion

The Airbus A340 which costs about R3.1 billion

Specifically, only one of the listed planes can reach the needed distances: the Boeing 787.

Boeing offers a 787 as part of its Business Jets line (BBJ) in two models, the 787-8 (225square metres of space) and the 787-9 (260 square metres of space).

The BBJ classes offer 3.53m of interior width, with the 9 class the longer of the two planes at 48.4m vs the 8 class, which is 42.3m long.

While the plane developer states that interiors can be shaped and changed in line with a client’s requirements, it shows off what its planes could look like inside.

The landmark symbolizes a stack of records topped by a stylus and is representative of Programmatic architecture on an epic scale. This Hollywood historic icon is 150 feet high with a 90 foot spire and a beacon constantly blinking out HOLLYWOOD in Morse Code. The round shape is repeated in curved, angled awnings, and cylindrical light fixtures; glass walls, terrazzo floors, and stainless steel elevators are typical of the period. Below ground are echo chambers and recording studios, the first ever built for high fidelity recordings. Though the exterior is virtually unaltered, the interior offices and studios have undergone numerous remodellings. Inside the lobby is an astounding array of gold records, spanning the entire history of rock and roll. In December, the tower is lit to create Hollywood's tallest Christmas tree. Occasionally, the tower is decorated with various promotional ornaments. Past ""dress ups"" have included various flags on the rooftop, covering the circular Capitol Records sign with images of the Beatles, and recently a Beatles Yellow Submarine giant postage stamp was stuck to the side of the building. Since the tower is clearly visible from most of Hollywood and the busy 101 Freeway, the tower acts as the company's most recognizable billboard. At the base of the building's southern face (overlooking a parking lot) is a wall mural by artist Richard Wyatt, titled ""Hollywood Jazz"".

Tuesday night, voters elected at least five transgender candidates to government offices around the nation. It's not a large number, but it's a meaningful one.

""Last night was a victory for so many remarkable LGBTQ candidates, but it was also a victory for inclusion and acceptance,"" said Sarah Kate Ellis, President and CEO of GLAAD, on Wednesday. “This is a clear repudiation of President Trump’s hate-fueled politics of bullying and browbeating. Yesterday, Americans took to the polls and chose optimism, hope, and new leadership – and this is only the beginning of our resistance.”

The Gay & Lesbian Victory Fund, a national organization dedicated to electing openly LGBTQ people said in a statement that ""2017 will be remembered as the year of the trans candidate.”

Here's a look at those elected:

Danica Roem, Virginia's House of Delegates

Democrat Danica Roem, a former journalist, defeated incumbent Republican candidate Del. Bob Marshall Tuesday to become the first openly transgender elected official in Virginia. Roem, 33, is now also set to make history as the first openly transgender person to be elected and seated in a state legislature. She led by about 9%. Roem's campaign focused on jobs, schools and traffic problems rather than gender identity. She argued that Marshall had spent too much of his energy in office tackling social issues like the bathroom bill.

Danica is not the first transgender person elected to state office, but she is the first openly transgender person, GLAAD noted in an email to USA TODAY. Althea Garrison was elected in Massachusetts in 1992, but did not disclose that she was transgender —she was outed as being transgender after she won her race and then did not win re-election.

Andrea Jenkins, Minneapolis City Council

Andrea Jenkins, along with Cunningham, has made history as the first out transgender black person elected to public office of a major U.S. city. She ran against three other candidates and won more than 70% of the votes in her ward. She only needed to break 50% to win.

“My election is what resistance looks like,"" Jenkins said in a statement Tuesday night. ""It’s also about hope. As a City Council Member, I will be committed to advocating for equity for the most marginalized in our community.”

Jenkins has 12 years of experience as a campaign aide to other city council members. She said she wants to make Minneapolis a better place for African Americans to live in, create more affordable housing, police accountability and economic development.

Phillipe Cunningham, Minneapolis City Council

Phillipe Cunningham joined Jenkins as the only out trans black people to be elected to the city council of a major U.S. city after the transgender man's victory over the city’s longtime council president was announced Wednesday afternoon. The result had been delayed due to Minneapolis’ instant-runoff voting system.

With Cunningham and Jenkins' wins, the Minneapolis City Council is now ""15% qualified Black queer transgender leaders,"" Cunningham said in a statement.

""There will never be another generation born in this country where Black flamboyant boys, butch girls (with whom I will always share a kinship), and transmasculine boys won’t have an example that even the honor being elected as representatives of our communities is possible for them,"" Cunningham said.

Cunningham's campaign focused on ways his ward can build community wealth through small businesses, homeownership, environmental justice, safer neighborhoods and empowering a community voice.

Lisa Middleton, Palm Springs, Calif., City Council

Lisa Middleton became the first transgender person elected to a non-judicial office in California. She secured a spot on the Palm Springs City Council with nearly 31% of the votes. As a member of the Palm Spring Planning Commission, she focused on revitalizing downtown Palm Springs and promoted use of solar and renewable power.

""It's all because of all of you that we are here tonight, celebrating a victory, a historic victory for our city and for our state,"" Middle told supporters.

Tyler Titus, Erie School Board

Tyler Titus is the first openly trans person ever elected in Pennsylvania. He's a counselor, youth advocate and father. He publicly speaks to communities about trauma, suicide, and how communities can reach out to under-served populations, according to this Facebook page.

""Thank you to my volunteers, each supporter, and every voter,"" Titus said on Twitter. ""We made history tonight.""

Underground Nuclear Explosion At Crippled Japan Atomic Plant Shocks World

By: Sorcha Faal, and as reported to her Western Subscribers

An ominous edict issued from the Office of the President of Russia today to all Ministries of the Russian Government ordering that all “past, present and future” information relating to Japan’s Fukushima Daiichi nuclear disaster now be rated at the highest classification level “Of Special Importance” states that this condition is “immediately and urgently needed” due to a series of underground nuclear explosions occurring at this crippled atomic plant on 31 December as confirmed by the Ministry of Defense (MoD).

“Of Special Importance” is Russia ’s highest classification level and refers to information which, if released, would cause damage to the entire Russian Federation .

The Fukushima Daiichi nuclear disaster was a catastrophic failure at the Fukushima I Nuclear Power Plant on 11 March 2011. The failure occurred when the plant was hit by a tsunami triggered by the 9.0 magnitude Tōhoku earthquake.

The plant began releasing substantial amounts of radioactive materials beginning on 12 March 2011 becoming the largest nuclear incident since the 1986 Chernobyl disaster and the second (with Chernobyl ) to measure at the highest Level 7 on the International Nuclear Event Scale (INES).

According to this report, MoD “assests” associated with the Red Banner Pacific Fleet detected two “low-level” underground atomic explosions occurring in the Fukushima disaster zone on 31 December, the first measuring 5.1 magnitude in intensity, followed by a smaller 3.6 magnitude explosion moments later.

The MoD further reports that the 5.1 magnitude event corresponds to the energy equivalent in megatons of TNT of 0.0005, while the 3.6 magnitude event equals 0.0000005.

As a comparison, the MoD states that the atomic bomb dropped on Hiroshima in 1945 by the United States released the equivalent of 16 Kilotons = 0.016 megatons of TNT, about the energy equivalent of a magnitude 6 earthquake, and the largest hydrogen bomb ever detonated was the Tsar bomb, a device exploded by the Soviet Union on 30 October 1961, with an energy equivalent of about 50 megatons of TNT.

Important to note, this report continues, was that the architect of Fukushima Daiichi Reactor 3, Uehara Haruo, warned on 17 November 2011 warned that a “China Syndrome” (aka: Hydrovolcanic Explosion) was “inevitable” due to the melted atomic fuel that had escaped the container vessel and was now burning through the earth.

The MoD further reports that evidence that these underground nuclear explosions were about to occur began after mysterious steam plumes were first spotted on 19 December for a short period of time, then again on 24, 25, 27 December, and confirmed by a report Tokyo Electric Power Company (TEPCO) published on its website.

Most curious to note, this report continues, is that the United States appears to have had a more advanced notice of these underground nuclear explosions as evidenced by their purchase earlier this month (6 December) of 14 million doses of potassium iodide, the compound that protects the body from radioactive poisoning in the aftermath of severe nuclear accidents, to be delivered before the beginning of February 2014.

With experts now estimating that the wave of radiation from Fukushima will be 10-times bigger than all of the radiation from the entire world’s nuclear tests throughout history combined, and with new reports stating that dangerous radiation levels have been detected in snows found in Texas, Colorado and Missouri, this MoD report warns the US, indeed, is going to face the severest consequences of this historic, and seemingly unstoppable, nuclear disaster.

And not just to human beings either is this nuclear disaster unfolding either, this report grimly warns, but also to all biological systems as new reports coming from the United States western coastal areas are now detailing the mass deaths of seals, sea lions, polar bears, bald eagles, sea stars, turtles, king and sockeye salmon, herring, anchovies, and sardines due to Fukishima radiation.

As to the American people being allowed to know the full and horrific mass death event now unfolding around them, this report warns, is not be as the Obama regime has, in effect, ordered all of their mainstream news media organs not to report it, and as recently confirmed by former MSNBC host Cenk Uygur who was told not to warn the public about the danger posed by the meltdown at the Fukushima nuclear plant during his time as a host on the cable network.

And with Russian experts now warning that as Fukushima pollution spreads all over Earth (as large amounts of fish, seaweeds, and everything in ocean has been already been polluted, and these products are the main danger for mankind as they can end up being eaten by people on a massive scale) this report warns that Putin’s order to classify all information relating to this nuclear mass death event “Of Special Importance” is vital to protect the economic and social stability interests of the Russian Federation as this global catastrophe continues to worsen by the day.

Father Wendel O’Connor was rushed to the hospital after he called 911 to report that he had “fallen in the shower” and had a 10-inch long crucifix stuck in his anal cavity.

The radiographs of his abdomen revealed that he, indeed, had a large religious symbol stuck in his rectum.

Doctor James Shephard, who treated Father O’Connor, says he was shocked when he saw the x-ray pictures.

“Being a Catholic myself, I found it very disturbing to see such a sacred object in a cleric’s rectum. I found it very shocking that someone could love Jesus that way.”

After an extremely delicate 8 hour surgery, doctors were finally able to manually extract the crucifix.

“It took many hours and a lot of efforts to get it out of there. We had to make a few incisions to make his anus big enough to get it out. Honestly, I am still trying to figure out how he got it in.”

Dr Shephard says this particular Rectal Foreign Body Removal (RFBR) surgery was one of the most complex intervention he’s performed in his career.

According to Doctor Shephard, the crucifix’s shape made its extraction particularly complicated.

Father Wendel O’Connor refused to answer any questions, saying only that he had “an accident in the shower” and the “there was nothing sexual” in his situation.

The priest’s case comes with a particular context which has drawn a lot of media attention to it, but it’s actually common for people to get object stuck in their rear ends.

Every year, an average of 5 687 Americans show up at the hospital with various objects stuck in their anal cavities. Some of these cases have drawn a lot of media attention over recent years.

In October 2016, a mother of one from Wallasey in England, was rushed to the hospital to have a large vibrator taken out of her rectum.

In 2015, a 27-year-old unemployed American man went to the hospital with lower abdominal discomfort following an injection of a liquid adhesive in his anal cavity, five hours earlier.

Other objects reportedly found in people’s anal cavities include light bulbs, bottles, cell phones, various animals and even a Buzz Lightyear figurine.

In the Dec. 21 executive order , Trump has declared that severe human rights abuses and corruption “have reached such scope and gravity that they threaten the stability of international political and economic systems.”

“I hereby declare a national emergency to deal with that threat,” Trump said.

The executive order allows for the freezing of assets of U.S. nationals and foreigners who have committed severe human rights abuses, or corruption, inside or outside of the United States.

Theepochtimes.com reports: The executive order also targets foreigners and U.S. nationals who have assisted, sponsored, or provided financial or material aid to the foreign nationals who committed the crimes.

Offending individuals will be identified by the Treasury Department in consultation with the Secretary of State and Attorney General.

The executive order targets individuals, entities, and government officials.

In effect, the executive order allows for the United States to crack down on international criminal networks who engage in human rights abuses, such as child traffickers.

It also allows the United States to target individuals within regimes who have committed human rights abuses, such as in China or North Korea.

“Human rights abuse and corruption undermine the values that form an essential foundation of stable, secure, and functioning societies; have devastating impacts on individuals; weaken democratic institutions; degraded the rule of law; perpetuate violent conflicts; facilitate the activities of dangerous persons; and undermine economic markets,” Trump wrote in the executive order.

While it is unclear what the scope of the national emergency will be, 13 individuals have already been identified as serious human rights abusers and corrupt actors.

In addition, the Treasury Department said that it has identified 39 affiliated individuals and entities under the new order.

Among those initially targeted by the sanctions is Gao Yan, who was the director of the Beijing Public Security Bureau Chaoyang Branch. During Gao’s tenure, human rights activist Cao Shunli died in detention in March 2014.

“Cao fell into a coma and died from organ failure, her body showing signs of emaciation and neglect,” said the Treasury Department in a statement.

China has seen widespread human rights abuses over the years. Among them is the persecution of practitioners of the spiritual discipline, Falun Gong.

In June 2016, the House passed a resolution expressing concern about the “persistent and credible reports of systematic, state-sanctioned organ harvesting from non-consenting prisoners of conscience in the People’s Republic of China, including from large numbers of Falun Gong practitioners and members of other religious and ethnic minority groups.”

Officials involved in these abuses could now be targeted under the national emergency.

It also includes Mukhtar Hamid Shah, a Pakistani surgeon specializing in kidney transplants who Pakistani police believe to be involved in kidnapping, and the removal of and trafficking in human organs.

https://www.snopes.com/fact-check/kissinger-forced-vaccinations/	"henry kissinger spoke to a ""eugenics council"" on controlling populations through forcible vaccinations."	false	['']	2019/04/11	"David Mikkelson
David Emery"	['https://rense.com/general32/beast.htm', 'https://www.ncbi.nlm.nih.gov/pmc/articles/PMC1127045/']	https://rense.com/general32/beast.htm	https://rense.com/	"SANDPOINT , ID -- Recent decisions by President Bush to sequester vaccination injury files and appoint Henry Kissinger to lead a 9-11 inquiry may seem unrelated. In fact, they have much in common according to an award winning author who decrypted a centuries old alphanumeric code currently used by British and American intelligence agencies. Dr. Leonard Horowitz, a Harvard-trained researcher, discovered a foreboding fact while analyzing the code-the words ""Kissinger"" and ""Vaccination"" both decipher to ""666,"" the infamous ""mark of the beast."" President Bush and alleged war criminal Henry Kissinger



The name ""Kissinger"" codes for ""666."" (Rev. 13:18) In a prophetically titled book, released three months before 9-11, Death in the Air: Globalism, Terrorism and Toxic Warfare (Tetrahedron Publishing Group; 1-888-508-4787), Dr. Horowitz explained that several of the largest multi-national corporations, and Anglo-American intelligence agencies (i.e., MI6 and U.S. Special Services) often use letters such as ""S,"" as Hitler did with his ""SS,"" to signify the number ""6."" The researcher determined this designation reflects an alphanumeric code where multiples of six are assigned to each letter in the English alphabet from A to Z (e.g., A=6, B=12, C=18, . . . S=114, . . .Z=156). When these numbers are added, the words ""Kissinger"" and ""Vaccination"" both decipher to ""666""-the biblical ""mark of the beast.""



Many argue this association reflects mere chance, but Dr. Horowitz, who has been studying these codes and associations since 1998, and Kissinger's links to the vaccine industry since 1993, says serendipity cannot logically account for this shared infamous identity.



""The likelihood that these related numerological identities reflect a simple ""coincidence"" is close to impossible given Kissinger's political history and financial ties to vaccination industrialists,"" says Dr. Horowitz.



His evidence becomes more convincing while reflecting on Kissinger's political career. Many historians have likened Kissinger to a ""war criminal."" As Nelson Rockefeller's protg, Kissinger began his early service to the ""old money global elite"" by recruiting Nazi scientists and ""SS"" officials to America through a secret Counter-Intelligence Corps (CIC) project that evolved into the Central Intelligence Agency's (CIA) infamous ""Project Paperclip."" Throughout World War II, the Rockefellers partnered with German industrialists as arranged by their lawyers and business managers-John Foster and Allen Dulles. These men clearly directed American intelligence agencies to serve the financial interests of the Rockefeller's Standard Oil Company that partnered with Germany's leading industrial organization-I.G. Farben. At the close of WWII, the I.G. Farben building in Frankfort, protected from allied bombings from the highest levels of military command, became CIA headquarters. Rockefeller then dispatched another lawyer and banking official, John J. McCloy, to disperse their German assets to form the modern day petrochemical/pharmaceutical combine known as the Bayer corporation (maker of CIPRO for anthrax), the Hoechst company (owner of Aventis and the smallpox vaccine) and BASF, the global chemical giant. The Merck pharmaceutical company also received a major share of Hitler's ""flight capital,"" according to historians such as CBS News war correspondent Paul Manning.



In Martin Bormann: Nazi in Exile (Lyle Stuart, Inc, 1981), Manning also traced Hitler's money trail to German steel industrialist Fritz Thyssen. Thyssen, according to official U.S. war crimes investigator and attorney John Loftus, principally laundered his fortunes through American banks under the direction of Prescott Bush, the current president's grandfather. The Union Bank and Harriman/Brown Bank, the two principle money laundering institutions, were largely directed by the elder Bush.



""It should also be noted,"" Dr. Horowitz said, ""that beginning in the 1920s, Prescott Bush joined banking, energy, and medical industrialist John D. Rockefeller, and the British Royal Family, in financing the earliest racial hygiene experiments."" These genocidal efforts predated Hitler's. The early eugenicists sought to sterilize mostly Black populations deemed genetically inferior. At the same time, and for most of the twentieth century, they promoted sterilizing mentally retarded children for the same reason.



Allied banking industrialists are known to have funded Hitler's rise to power. As the war was ending, Manning wrote, these investments and the Nazi ""flight capital,"" were redirected to actualize what Hitler termed a rising ""Fourth Reich"" based on the previous ""vision of a thousand-year Third Reich . . . [and] world empire. This was outlined with clarity in a document called Neuordnung, or ""New Order,"" that was accompanied by a letter of transmittal to the Ministry of Economics. It declared that a new order for the [petro]chemical [pharmaceutical] industry of the world should supplement Hitler's New [World] Order""-a phrase also used by President George H.W. Bush during his 1991 State of the Union Address.



More recently, Kissinger's alleged war criminality has been the subject of numerous articles, some even appearing in mainstream periodicals such as Harper's. According to his biographers, besides helping many of Hitler's leading scientists and ""SS"" officials to escape Nuremberg trials, Kissinger has been implicated in several other genocides including ones in Cambodia and Chili. This is best reconciled, Dr. Horowitz says, ""because Kissinger's closest business associates are linked to the old money cryptocracy that has historically funded warring factions, terrorist organizations, and now directs the military 'defense' establishment running America's 'War on Terrorism.'""



Additional evidence is offered by the decrypted code. Using the alphanumerics of the multiples of six, wherein S=114, this number is reduced to a single digit as practiced in numerology and ancient Pythagorean mathematics to yield ""6."" (i.e., S=114=1+1+4=6.)



Thus, the Gestapo's ""SS,"" as well as ""Her Majesty's 'Secret Service,'"" Britain's ""MI6,"" and the American military's ""Special Services,"" all code for ""66"" as in ""Phillips 66"" and ""Route 66-America's highway."" Historic accounts link all of these to Rockefeller and/or Royal Family involvements.

Lending further credence to Dr. Horowitz's global conspiracy theory, historians reveal that Nelson Rockefeller appointed his protg, Kissinger, to become the nuclear weapons ""special studies"" director at the Council on Foreign Relations (CFR) in 1955, resulting in the deployment of ""tactical and strategic nuclear weapons"" around the world that heavily spirited the Cold War's rush to arms and today's continuing nuclear threats. The CFR has been largely influenced through Rockefeller involvements from its inception according to numerous authors and MI6 insiders. The council's higher direction has been reported to come from the British/German war-making oligarchy working through their ""Committee of 300"" on which George H.W. Bush, Henry Kissinger, and David Rockefeller are prominent members. David Rockefeller has chaired the CFR since the 1950s.



The rush to develop weapons of mass destruction, including biologicals and chemicals, was also instituted through Rockefeller and Kissinger directed federal policies according to the author of Kissinger (Simon & Schuster, 1992), Walter Isaacson. In 1955, while impacting NATO policy advances through the CFR, Kissinger advanced the defense theory that later became known as ""flexible response."" This called for the ""flexible"" use of a spectrum of weapons of mass destruction, primarily nuclear. Later, in 1969, as National Security Advisor under Richard Nixon, Kissinger, on behalf of his benefactors' business interests, demanded the U.S. Navy's Admiral Zumwalt reevaluate America's biological weapons capabilities. From this, Kissinger selected the option to develop ""synthetic biological agents"" for germ warfare. Their illegal development then proceeded under the guise of ""military defense,"" ""preventive vaccinations,"" and ""cancer research,"" according to Dr. Horowitz., who drew his evidence from the Congressional Record.



In his national bestseller Emerging Viruses: AIDS & Ebola-Nature, Accident or Intentional? (Tetrahedron Press, 1998), Dr. Horowitz documented Kissinger's oversight of the CIA's top secret biological weapons program called ""MK:NAOMI."" While professing a moratorium on the development of such weapons, urging President Nixon to sign the Geneva Accord outlawing such practices, Kissinger, through his chain of command,Ê directed members of the National Academy of Sciences-National Research Council to advise U.S. Army officials to develop immune suppressive ""synthetic biological agents"" descriptively and functionally identical to HIV/AIDS and the Ebola virus.



How did HIV and Ebola viruses break out of their military-medical labs? Dr. Horowitz posits the following controversial, yet well-documented theory. Through the Merck pharmaceutical company, a major U.S. biological weapons contractor whose president, George W. Merck, directed America's entire biological weapons industry, contaminated chimpanzees were used during the early 1970s to develop the earliest experimental hepatitis B vaccines given to gay men in New York City and Blacks in central Africa. This, according to Dr. Horowitz's published scientific papers, was the precise vaccination that triggered the AIDS pandemic.



No doubt Merck's chief advisor, Dr. Kissinger, would have approved of this AIDS outcome given his enthusiasm for his National Special Security Memorandum 200, ordered just before these vaccinations began, that called for massive Third World depopulation especially targeting Black Africans.



Given this knowledge, and the rapidly advancing science in this field that proves the accuracy of Dr. Horowitz's theory of HIV/AIDS origination, the vaccination liability indemnity clause in President Bush's recently passed Homeland Security Bill, and subsequent Bush administration efforts to close mercury-toxicity vaccine-injury case files leaving autistic victims and their families in the lurch, provides multiple benefits to the Rockefeller/Kissinger-linked drug companies, especially to Merck. Dr. Horowitz sees these moves as a precaution against accumulating scientific evidence linking modern cancer and autoimmune epidemics, as well as AIDS, to contaminations in Merck's vaccines, including their cancer virus tainted polio and hepatitis B vaccines.



Moreover, Dr. Horowitz has documented similar manipulations in the fields of genetics and cancer research, both heavily controlled by these same political powers and global energy industrialists. Government contracts reprinted in Emerging Viruses: AIDS & Ebola, prove the Atomic Energy Commission became heavily involved in the National Cancer Institute's Special Virus Cancer Program (SVCP) which Dr. Horowitz claims is largely responsible for the emergence of HIV and AIDS. His official testimony, which heavily implicates Merck, was ""whitewashed"" recently during a U.S. General Accounting Office investigation into this matter ordered by Congressman James Traficant. The Ohio democrat was subsequently imprisoned on racketeering charges. His indictment, he insists, stemmed from conspirators at the highest levels of government and industry. (See: U.S. GAO Commits Scientific Fraud In AIDS Inquiry at: http://www.healingcelebrations.com/gao.htm) It is clear from the contracts that the U.S. Navy's Biological Research Laboratory also played an important role in the SVCP developing new types of airborne cancer viruses and other infectious agents.



In his latest book, Death in the Air: Globalism, Terrorism and Toxic Warfare, Dr. Horowitz draws additional attention to the ""666 logo"" used by the U.S. Department of Energy managed Nuclear Engineering and Environmental Laboratory in his home state of Idaho. This is where Navy and nuclear submarine personnel go to train. The three backwards upside-down Ss, supposedly energy symbols, match those of a weathervane adorning Dr. Horowitz's neighbor's lakefront estate situated at the center of the U.S. Navy's ""Cutthroat"" unmanned nuclear submarine testing area on lake Pend Orielle near Sandpoint.

The neighbor, Klaus Groenke, a wealthy German industrialist on the Board of Trustees of the German-American Academy in Berlin, which was co-founded and chaired by Henry Kissinger, watches his three inverted lightning bolts, or backwards upside-down Ss, pivot in the wind to overlap forming two Nazi swastikas.



According to the earliest Pythagorean mystery school alphanumeric code upon which more modern intelligence agency codes are based, according to Dr. Horowitz, the Nazi swastika, like the letter ""X,"" also codes for the number ""6"" (or sometimes ""9"" upside down). Thus, the adjacent swastikas on Mr. Groenke's estate code for ""66,"" much like the double ""XX"" in the Rockefeller-directed EXXON corporation, and the ""66"" code depicted by the twelve stars in the ""Global Integration Services"" logo of the Battelle Memorial Institute-the CIA contractor whose scientists manufactured the silica-cut hyperweaponized Ames strain of electromagnetized anthrax that was mailed in October, 2001, to create the public fright and impetus for the U.S. Government to stockpile nearly a billion dollars in ""preventive vaccines"" for anthrax and smallpox as well as other costly prescription drugs like Bayer's CIPRO. (For Dr. Horowitz's complete anthrax mailings special report link to: http://www.tetrahedron.org/articles/anthrax/anthrax_espionage.html)



Given all of the incriminating evidence linking President Bush's ""War on Terrorism"" to global industrialists like the Rockefellers, Henry Kissinger, the Mercks of Europe, and the British oligarchy, Dr. Horowitz concludes it is not likely an accident that the names ""Merck"" and ""Bush"" both decipher to ""300"" using the same code. This is consistent with the ""Committee of 300"" and its powerful influence over global politics and governmental policies. It is, likewise, no ""coincidence"" that Kissinger, the only modern day political leader whose name deciphers to ""666,"" with his ""special services"" record at the CFR, became a top advisor to the Merck pharmaceutical company-the world's leading vaccine maker-with the word 'vaccination' also resolving to ""666.""



""Now that we have some of their secret codes,"" Dr. Horowitz concludes, ""it is possible to perform statistical analyses, the scientific method of determining correlation (coefficients) for testing associations-in this case co-conspirators in a global conspiracy. When this is done, the outcome proves a genocidal theory beyond our worst nightmares.""

Ted Cruz recently issued a summons to potential supporters.

It’s not really a summons. It’s a fundraising letter — as in, Cruz is summoning support. But the problem is the Cruz campaign has made the envelope look much like a legal summons, which can be pretty serious. A summons occurs when a person is sued or ordered to appear in court. Most people are probably not thrilled about getting such a summons.

A reader brought this mailer to our attention because she viewed it as misleading and intimidating. We reached out to the Cruz campaign and explained the concern. The Cruz campaign later provided the following statement:

“Out of more than 50,000 mailers to the San Antonio area targeting likely supporters there was one complaint that came not to us but to the local media. Our mail efforts have been both effective and critical to identifying and engaging our supporters, and getting them involved in our campaign efforts to keep Texas strong.”

No doubt, the fundraising letter, itself, is effective. But we think the Cruz campaign could do without the legal summons language on the envelope. It’s just too official looking. The envelope has two clear windows. Above those windows it says, “Summons Enclosed — Open Immediately” in bold letters.

In the top left corner, it says in small black print:

“Official Kerr County Summons

Ted Cruz for Senate 2018”

Many people might notice that “Ted Cruz for Senate 2018” and, rightfully, assume this is just campaign mail. But many others might not get past the “Official Kerr County Summons” bit.

Cruz appears to be in a competitive race with U.S. Rep. Beto O’Rourke, D-El Paso. It’s understandable he would want to summon conservative support. But certainly his campaign can do that without making it look like a legal threat, right?

Reed Introduces Legislation to Register Handguns

Thursday, February 24, 2000

Groups Supporting Handgun Registration



Summary



How would it work?

Sign an on-line petition supporting handgun registration



WASHINGTON, DC -- Stating that ""the police should not be limited in their ability to track down criminals,"" Senator Jack Reed (D- RI) today introduced legislation to require the registration of all handguns. The Handgun Safety and Registration Act is meant to reduce illegal gun trafficking by providing for more efficient tracing of handguns used in crimes and tougher penalties for those who sell guns to illegal purchasers. The law will create an on-line database of all registered handguns which can be easily accessed by federal, state and local law enforcement agencies.



Reed's goal is to reduce the number of handguns that end up in the possession of criminals. The bill would require registration of all handguns, including those currently in private possession, and would make it a felony for any person to transfer a handgun to another individual without prior law enforcement approval. Background checks would be performed on all primary and secondary transfers of handguns, including retail sales, gun shows, Internet sales and all private sales.



Reed stated, ""This bill will limit criminals' access to guns. Background checks will finally be performed on all handgun sales. Before a handgun owner sells a gun without registering it, they will be forced to think hard about the crime they are about to commit and the ten years they may spend in prison.""



Reed's legislation has been endorsed by Handgun Control, Inc., the Violence Policy Center, the NAACP, the Coalition to Stop Gun Violence and Physicians for Social Responsibility.



The legislation was introduced in response to law enforcement officials' complaints that the methods available for tracing handguns used in crimes are extremely inefficient and provide criminals an advantage over the police.



Currently when a gun is recovered after a crime, a state or local law enforcement agency must contact the Bureau of Alcohol Tobacco and Firearms (ATF) with the name of the manufacturer and the serial number of the handgun. The ATF in turn contacts the manufacturer, which provides the name of the wholesale or retail dealer to whom the handgun was sold. ATF then contacts the dealer to obtain the name of the individual or another retail dealer who purchased the handgun. This often leads to a dead end. If the individual handgun owner has sold the gun to another person in a private sale, there is no way for law enforcement to follow the path of the handgun.



Reed's legislation would make the process more efficient for local law enforcement officials by providing access to a national on-line database of registered weapons.



Reed stated, ""Without restricting in any way the possession or sale of hunting rifles or shotguns used by law-abiding sportsmen, this legislation will give law enforcement officials the tools to conduct faster and more reliable tracing of handguns used in crime, and prevent handguns from falling into criminal hands in the first place.""



The legislation will add handguns to the successful federal weapons registration system already in place under the 1934 National Firearms Act (NFA). The NFA requires registration of all machine guns, short-barrel shotguns and short-barrel rifles, silencers, bombs, grenades, and other specialized weapons. The NFA is administered by the Department of the Treasury's Bureau of Alcohol, Tobacco and Firearms (ATF).



The legislation will face significant opposition from gun control opponents.



""I am under no illusion,"" Reed stated, ""that this legislation will be approved by this Congress or next Congress. Movement on gun control always has been a long and labored process. It was not until 1968, five years after the assassination of John F. Kennedy with a mail-order rifle, that Congress limited that type of gun sale and set up a dealer licensing system. By then, Robert F. Kennedy and Martin Luther King Jr. had been assassinated by gunmen. The 1968 Gun Control Act was the first major gun control legislation in 30 years. But we must begin the process to create a law that Americans overwhelmingly believe is necessary.""



A Time/CNN poll in July of 1999 found that 76 percent of Americans support having the federal government require that each handgun be registered.



A summary of the legislation is attached.

Handgun Safety and Registration Act

[Back to the Top]

Mary Leigh Bleck, President, Million Mom March

""This will help stem the flood of handguns into the illegal market, where kids and criminals have easy access to them. We thank you for your courage and leadership in helping to reform America's guns laws, and we look forward tow orking with you on this historic effort.""

Mrs. Sarah Brady, Chair, Handgun Control, Inc.



""It's about time Congress considers legislation like the Handgun Safety and Registration Act of 2000 to require the registration of handguns in this country. For far too long in America, too many gun crimes have gone unsolved and murderers are getting away with murder because law enforcement doesn't have a clear paper trail to follow. Requiring handguns to be registered - like we register cars - would help law enforcement officers do their jobs, solving crimes.""



""I commend Senator Reed for sponsoring the Handgun Safety and Registration Act and hope that Congress will listen to what the majority of law enforcement groups and Americans are saying and quickly pass this important legislation.""



Mark Pertschuk, Legislative Director of the Coalition to Stop Gun Violence



""Firearms registration and licensing is the single most important thing Congress can do to protect children from gun violence. Senator Reed should be congratulated for his courage and his vision on this critical issue.""



Kristen Rand, Director of Federal Policy at the Violence Policy Center



""Senator Reed's legislation brings a complicated and cumbersome handgun tracing system out of the dark ages and into the 21st Century with instant on-line access. By utilizing an existing registration system, this proposal would prove to be the most cost effective and efficient system to register America's arsenal of 60 million handguns. We must match the level of sophistication of crimes in this country with a modernized tracking system.""



Arinn Dixon, Associate Director, Physicians for Social Responsibility



""Physicians for Social Responsibility applauds Senator Reed's critical efforts toward preventing gun violence in this country and emphatically endorses the provisions outlined in the ""Handgun Safety and Registration Act."" His actions show the American public that lawmakers are concerned enough about our nation's epidemic of gun violence to take significant, preventative action.""

Summary of the Handgun Safety and Registration Act of 2000

[Back to the Top]



Adds handguns to the list of weapons registered by the Secretary of the Treasury, Bureau of Alcohol, Tobacco, and Firearms (ATF), under the National Firearms Act (NFA), which currently covers machine guns, short-barrel shotguns, short-barrel rifles, silencers, bombs, grenades, and other specialized weapons. [Subsection 2(a)]



Requires all handguns, including those currently in private possession, to be registered with ATF within one year of enactment. If a handgun is transferred to another individual during the one-year transition period, the bill requires the handgun to be registered prior to the transfer. [Subsection 2(f)]



Imposes federal law enforcement background checks on all handgun transfers, including both primary and secondary transfers. For all NFA weapons, ATF conducts background checks through the National Crime Information Center (NCIC), the Treasury Enforcement Communications System (TECS), and the National Law Enforcement Tracking System (NLETS).



To ensure compliance with the Handgun Safety and Registration Act, the bill requires the Secretary to take measures to inform the public of the requirements of the Act, such as public service announcements. [Subsection 2(h)]



Requires ATF to share handgun registration data with local, state, and federal law enforcement officials to enhance tracing capabilities (exempts handgun registration information from the disclosure restrictions of the Internal Revenue Code of 1986, of which the NFA is a part). [Subsection 2(e)]



Imposes a tax of $5 on handgun registration and transfers, rather than the $200 tax imposed on most NFA weapons. [Subsections 2(b) and 2(f)(1)]



Imposes a $50 tax on the making of a handgun, rather than the $200 tax imposed on the making of most NFA weapons. [Subsection 2(c)]



Permits the continued importation of handguns by excluding handguns from the general prohibition on importation of NFA firearms under section 5844 of the NFA.

[Subsection 2(d)]



Only required participation by state and local law enforcement is the Chief Law Enforcement Officer's completion of the ""Law Enforcement Certification"" portion of ATF registration or transfer form (as currently required for all NFA weapons). State and local law enforcement agencies are not required to administer the registration program or send forms to ATF. On a voluntary basis, they may choose to provide ATF registration documents to the public.



To further ensure that registration and transfer forms are readily available to the public, the bill requires ATF to post forms on the Internet in a downloadable format, and to make forms available to state and local law enforcement agencies, the U.S. Postal Service, and regional offices of ATF and other Treasury Department bureaus. [Subsection 2(g)]



Authorizes such appropriations as may be necessary to enable ATF to administer the new handgun registration and background check provisions in the bill. [Subsection 2(i)] [Back to the Top]

How would it work?

[Back to the Top]



The handgun owner (the registrant) obtains an ATF registration form and FBI fingerprint form FD-258, either from his or her local Chief Law Enforcement Officer, by mail from ATF, at a U.S. Post Office, or from a regional ATF/Treasury Department facility.



The registrant fills out the registration form and affixes a 2x2 inch photograph of himself taken within the past year.



The registrant takes the form to his or her Chief Law Enforcement Officer, who completes the ""Law Enforcement Certification"" portion of the form.



The registrant completes FBI fingerprint card Form FD-258. Fingerprints must be taken by a person qualified to do so and must be clear, unsmudged and classifiable.



A check or money order for $5 is made payable to ATF by the registrant.



The registrant sends all completed forms, accompanying materials, and tax payment to:

Bureau of Alcohol, Tobacco and Firearms

P.O. Box 73201

Chicago, IL 60673



If application is approved, the original of the form with the canceled stamp affixed, showing approval, will be returned to the applicant. Otherwise, the tax will be refunded and ATF will contact the registrant regarding abandonment of the handgun.



Transferring a handgun



Transfer procedures are similar to the registration process described above, except that the transferee completes the reverse of the transfer form, has the Chief Law Enforcement Officer complete the ""Law Enforcement Certification,"" and attaches photos and fingerprint data."

The 2016 Clown Sightings were reports of people disguised as evil clowns in incongruous settings, such as near forests and schools. The incidents were reported in the United States, Canada, and subsequently in other countries and territories from August 2016.[1][2][3][4][5] The sightings were first reported in Green Bay, Wisconsin in what turned out to be a marketing stunt for a horror film. The phenomenon later spread to many other cities in the US, most notably South Carolina where a 9-year-old boy told his mother that two suspicious males dressed as clowns tried to lure him into the nearby woods.[6] By mid-October 2016, clown sightings and attacks had been reported in nearly all U.S. states, 9 out of 13 provinces and territories of Canada, and 18 other countries.

Prior to the spate of incidents in 2016, numerous sightings of people dressed as clowns in odd or incongruous settings have occurred throughout the world since 2013. The proliferation of videos and images of these precursor sightings spread through social media posts and viral sharing of the content, most notably from DM Pranks, an Italian YouTube channel.

Scope, timeline and effects of sightings [ edit ]

Precursor sightings [ edit ]

One possible precursor event was the 2013 sightings of a ""creepy clown"" in Northampton, England. The Northampton clown sightings, which were in the town during September and October 2013, were the work of three local filmmakers Alex Powell, Elliot Simpson, and Luke Ubanski.[7] The clown shared similar looks to Pennywise the Dancing Clown from Stephen King's book It. The trio started a Facebook page for the so-called ""Northampton clown"" and were using the appearances to drive traffic to the page.[7]

In March 2014, Matteo Moroni from Perugia, Italy, owner of the YouTube channel DM Pranks, began dressing up as an evil clown and terrifying unsuspecting passersby, with his videos racking up hundreds of millions of views.[8] A rash of sightings appeared in California in October 2014, which centered around the ""Wasco clown"", and primarily occurred in the Wasco, California, area with photos appearing on social media.[9]

A person in clown attire was spotted in a cemetery in Chicago, Illinois, in July 2015. This occurrence involved two residents who spotted the ""creepy clown"" scaling the gate at the Rosehill Cemetery late at night. After the clown entered the cemetery, they turned to face the residents and began waving slowly as they made a video recording. After waving for a few seconds, the clown ran into a dark wooded area and was not seen again. Police investigation of the sighting did not lead to any arrests.[10]

2016 sightings and effects [ edit ]

The 2016 clown phenomenon began in Green Bay, Wisconsin in early August. Five pictures of a creepy clown roaming a vacant parking lot under a bridge in downtown Green Bay at night started going viral on August 1, 2016.[11] A Facebook page was created shortly after claiming the clown was named ""Gags.""

The Verge dismissed the sightings as a case of mass hysteria, stating that a fear of clowns (which is common in children and adults) may be an underlying cause.[281] Vox likewise claimed that ""The Great Clown Panic of 2016 has been perpetuated by pretty much everyone except actual clowns.""[282]

As Levi’s signature jeans gained popularity amongst a wider set in the middle of the last century, the pants came to symbolize American freedom. As Stanford Historian Niall Ferguson points out in his book, Civilization: The West and the Rest, during the Cold War, the American pants were so desirable behind the Iron Curtain that citizens would break any number of laws to obtain them. At one point the company even celebrated America’s armed heritage in a circa 1950 advertising brochure, “Levi’s Gallery of Western Guns & Gunfighters.” It’s with some irony then that Levi’s has abandoned this rugged image to team up with a billionaire oligarch in an effort to empower the government to trample upon the fundamental rights of the American people.

On September 4th, Levi’s CEO Chip Bergh announced that the San Francisco-based clothing manufacturer (which also owns Dockers) would openly advocate for gun control. As part of this campaign, the company will donate more than $1 million to radical anti-gun groups, including Michael Bloomberg front-group Everytown for Gun Safety and Giffords, formerly Americans for Responsible Solutions and the Legal Community Against Violence. The company will also match employee donations to these groups and is encouraging its staff to devote their time to anti-gun activism.

Further, Bergh stated that the company has joined the Everytown Business Leaders for Gun Safety. The business wing of Bloomberg’s outfit is dedicated to leveraging member companies’ “market footprint… employee networks, [and] public communications platforms” to diminish Americans’ Second Amendment rights.

In a repulsive insult to the nation’s 100 million gun owners, Bergh likened Levi’s campaign to restrict the rights of law-abiding Americans to previous company efforts aimed at combatting pre-Civil Rights Era racial bigotry.

Among gun owners, Levi’s intemperate foray into the world of gun control politics has been met with the disgust it deserves. However, it shouldn’t be met with surprise.

Since the late 1990s, Levi’s has used its name and resources to attack gun rights. In 1999, the company gave $100,000 to gun control group PAX, followed by a $250,000 donation in 2000 and another $100,000 in 2001.

PAX was founded in 1998 by Dan Gross, who went on to become president of the Brady Campaign to Prevent Gun Violence. PAX would go on to change its name to the Center to Prevent Youth Violence and later merge with the Brady Campaign.

Much like Bloomberg’s Everytown, PAX placed an emphasis on attracting corporate partners to their gun control efforts. As part of Levi’s relationship with PAX, in 1999 the apparel company teamed up with the band Goo Goo Dolls to attract support for the anti-gun group during the Levi’s Fuse ’99 summer concert tour. Concert goers, and visitors to Levi’s website, were encouraged to sign the PAX Youth Petition. Moreover, the denim company donated a percentage of all Levi’s Fuse ’99 t-shirt proceeds to the gun control group.

The PAX Youth Petition endorsed a variety of severe gun control measures that have repeatedly been rejected by the American public through their elected representatives. The document called for the “licensing and registration of guns, like automobiles.” The petition also demanded the “elimination of assault weapons and other weapons of war.” As the 1994 Clinton “Assault Weapons” ban was in place at the time of the petition, this imprecise demand appeared to call for prohibiting the sale of the remaining lawful semi-automatic firearms, confiscation of the firearms grandfathered under the ban, or both.

Given the majority of Levi’s 165-year history, Bergh’s decision to use a formerly-quintessential American company to attack a quintessential American right is a particularly sad episode in the current surge in corporate virtue-signaling. We can only assume that Levi’s accountants have determined that resulting skinny jeans sales will be enough to offset the permanent damage to their once-cherished brand."

https://www.snopes.com/fact-check/dc-comics-jesus-christ/	dc comics is publishing a series depicting jesus christ living with a superhero.	true	['']	2019/01/11	Arturo Garcia	['https://www.theverge.com/2017/6/24/15865528/preacher-garth-ennis-amc-vertigo-comics-dominic-cooper-ruth-negga', 'https://www.bleedingcool.com/2019/01/09/fox-news-jesus-august/', 'https://www.bleedingcool.com/2018/08/25/jesus-superhero-mark-russell/', 'https://www.cbr.com/dc-jesus-perfect-second-coming/']	https://www.bleedingcool.com/2019/01/09/fox-news-jesus-august/	https://www.bleedingcool.com/	"Back in August last year, Bleeding Cool contributor Mike Sangregorio interviewed Mark Russell about his upcoming DC Comics comic book Second Coming with Richard Pace. Which features Jesus Christ returning to Earth and rooming with Superman analogue Sun-Man. It's clearly a satire.

Today, Fox News seems to have come across the interview and made it a news story. The comic book was announced last year. DC Comics hasn't done any PR blasts about it. So how does this kind of thing happen?

It seems to have begun at my old stomping ground Comic Book Resources. With a title 'Of Course DC Is Bringing Jesus to Comics', writer Anthony Couto summed up a recent history of DC Comics tackling religious themes – though they miss the big one that would have been relevant to this story. Namely Swamp Thing by Rick Veitch featuring Jesus Christ in a comic that was greenlit by editor Karen Berger and partially drawn before it was spiked by her boss, Paul Levitz. This led Veitch to leave DC, stopped Neil Gaiman taking over the book and for the critically acclaimed series to enter the critical doldrums for quite some time.

Anyway, this article was then picked up by Christian Headlines, in an article by Michael Foust, which linked to the earlier Bleeding Cool interview to garner quotes that Russell gave that might seen as satirical against Christianity. Such as,

He goes by a megachurch and they have a billboard of this Tom Brady-looking Jesus Christ throwing a football and he doesn't even recognize himself which is a metaphor for him not recognizing what's been done with the religion that bears his name.

But not,

Sun-Man has to deal with things like his grandmother succumbing to dementia or that he can't adopt, because he's technically not a human being, and his wife wants a baby. These are the sorts of problems that superpowers are utterly helpless against. Jesus brings this very different view on how power can be used.

And said that the comic contradicted scripture. That was on Monday.

On Tuesday, CBN News offering 'A Christian Perspective', had Emily Jones churn the story but did not mention or link to Christian Headlines or CBR, though clearly used the former's take on the story. They did however mention and linkto Bleeding Cool's interview. They called it 'closer to blasphemous than biblical.'

On the same day the Preston Business Review, writer unknown. swiped the story from CBN, without crediting or linking, repeating their line about blasphemy line, mentioning – but not linking – to Bleeding Cool. The same with WND.

Today the right-wing site Newsbusters's Matt Philbin picked up on the story, using all the same quotes but crediting no one but Bleeding Cool's interview. From last August. And adding lots more invective.

From there it was a hop and a skip to Fox News for an article by Caleb Parke. Who credited and linked to no one but Bleeding Cool, with the headline 'DC to release controversial Second Comic Of Jesus'. The invective was stripped back, but you could see the journey.

Controversial to whom? After all, no one in the media seemed to notice Bleeding Cool's interview with Mark Russell about the comic until three days ago, and that was only because of another comic book website, trying to fill a slow news day…

I wonder where this story will go now?

UPDATE: I should have guessed. Breitbart.

Second Coming will be published in March.

John McCain was stationed on the Forrestal at the time and was quite likely responsible for the fire that killed 134 sailors and injured 62 others.

Hot dog pilots were well known for their ""wet-starts,"" a process which allows fuel to build up in the engine before hitting the plane's start switch. The result of the wet-start is a long flame erupting from the tail of the plane. It was done simply for effect, a showy procedure meant to draw attention to the pilot.

On June 29, 1967, John McCain is alleged to have used a wet-start to ""shake up"" a pilot in the plane behind him. The result was a fired rocket, dropped bombs and a fire that raged for nearly two days. 134 sailors lost their lives and another 62 were badly injured.

McCain never had to answer for the incident. His father and grandfather were Navy admirals with a great deal of sway.

Three months after the Forrestal disaster McCain was shot down over North Vietnam. You know the rest of the story.

What was that vaccine? Well according to Henry Rothschild, (no relation to the Rothschild family allegedly) the vaccine is known as Terminar.



Terminar which is Spanish for terminate, according to Mr. Rothschild Terminar was design to break down African American/Black women ovaries exposing them to different germs and multiple diseases which will likely produce a child with serious birth defects and serious illnesses.



The government ran a secret operation releasing the anesthetic to predominately black areas. They figure it was best to distribute it through an Epidural so it will go unnoticed. Mr. Rothschild child is asking both black and white women to find out what illnesses may run in your family. If you received an Epidural between 2010-2014 and later gave birth anywhere from 2011 until present, if your child was born with any illness that's not normal this may be the reason why.

MiMi 10/31/2016 06:48:54 pm Just a bit of information sickle cell trait is not acquired from any form of vaccine. Either you or your partner also carry the trait and it is genetically passed to our children like eye color, hair color etc. When we found out my daughter carries the trait her father and I got tested and we found out he is a carrier. Which means that if she later has children with a carrier they will have a 50% chance of having a child with full blown sickle cell.

Reply Megan 10/28/2016 10:11:32 pm Yes, unfortunately back pain does happen after you have an epidural. I have had 3 2008, 2011, 2013, after my epidural I couldn't feel my legs for hours and I didn't even know I needed to pee due to my bladder being numb. But the nurses said that I had received 2 IV bags so I either had to go to the bathroom or use a bed pan. I had to have 2 nurses help me from the bed to the wheelchair and then on to the toilet and back again. Sadly from what you are saying the lack of oxygen was a result horrible but regular occurrences. I'm glad your babies were not seriously harmed during birth. Lauren 10/28/2016 10:24:04 pm My second daughter was born December of 2011 and she was born not breathing and also has been diagnosed with spd, she is delayed, and she is taking speech therapy!!! I have had her in therapy since she was one... She was taking occupational therapy, play therapy, and speech every week but she is now just taking OT and speech. I recently got her on a iep plan at school so she could get more help... But if this is true I want to know more about what state this was used in and who I need to talk to!!!! I am calling my doctor first thing Monday to look at my records!!! michelle 10/29/2016 08:50:14 am you all sound so uneducated. epidurals are SUPPOSED to numb you from the waist down - that's the whole point - so you don't feel any pain. It's common for women to have to get a catheter or wear a diaper for a few hours up to a day after having an epidural because they are still numb and can't tell when they have to pee. This is NORMAL. And yes, you will have some back pain, have you SEEN how big those shots are?! Do you think a huge needle going into your spine is supposed to make your back feel good? Educate yourselves. All of these things you're complaining about are normal. Anyone who works around women delivering babies or just has a common knowledge of how it works, would know that there is nothing abnormal about anything you've described. You just look stupid. anonymous 10/30/2016 11:10:38 am i have back problems from when i git an epidural in 2010 and in 2013. but my epidural in 2013 went wrong i ended up getting a blood patch a few weeks later Laci 10/31/2016 03:53:54 am Your daughter has a learning disability because her oxygen was deprived due to the cord being wrapped around her neck. How could an epidural cause that? It couldn't. It just happens. Christins 10/31/2016 06:00:10 pm To Michelle





Your the one wwho looks stupid and like an idiot these things are not normal children being born with extra thumbs and persistent ongoing back pain they're not talking about just that day dumbass they're talking about STILL you need a edumacation ( education in case you think I can't spell) to learn how to differentiate sentences!!! Heather 11/1/2016 09:22:41 am Epidurals usually will slow down labor since once it's administered you can't get out of bed and are just laying there. Moving around and working through contractions is ideal since it doesn't stop labor. Her cord was probably wrapped around her for a while since the closer you are to your due date the less room a baby has to move around. I also have back pain from my first epidural in 2014 and can't sit straight up from bed or get up fast from sitting in the floor. Gwendolyn A. Jones 10/28/2016 10:23:12 pm I received several epidurals 2014 to present Reply Janay Williams 10/29/2016 10:39:27 am Well I had my child in 2012 with an epidural and he is 100% percent healthy and normal functioning and is now 4 and the top reader of his kindergarten class and has been reading since he was 3 I however will not be getting a epidural with my next child after being educated on all the things they put in this stuff they give but to each its own most of these problems I'm reading sounds like it's from the parents or just natural causes not an epidural Gwendolyn Wright 10/31/2016 08:38:27 am I had an epidural with all five of my children from 1992- 2012.

Amanda 10/31/2016 04:37:54 pm To Michelle maybe u should educate yourself before u make comments I had an epidural in 1998 with first son and yes couldn't feel anything for 24 hrs but my last epidural in 2005 I was numb but still could walk around shower do everything except feel the worst of the pain and you will find most of these women are talking about ongoing back issues because of epidural Barbara 10/31/2016 06:45:37 pm While a baby is in utero a lot of things are going on, so many things in fact, I am relived when I deliver a full term, healthy baby. It truly is a miracle. Unfortunately when babies are born with extra digits, cord around the neck,sickle cell or other unusual things, they have NOTHING to do with an epidural. They are congenital, traits or genes that parents have passed on, or things that happen while growing inside. The numbness is normal and back pain can last for years, unfortunately. Also having a to get a blood patch is uncommon, but does happen. L Patterson 10/28/2016 10:25:27 pm WTH Reply Tori 10/29/2016 11:54:40 am What the I had a baby in 2013

You'd be dead! Educated yourself. Lauren 10/30/2016 03:03:41 pm I am 30 and I was born with total deafness in my right ear. Mine was from a part of the inner ear not fully developing which may be the case in your situation, but you will not know until you go to a specialist. Mine was not noticed until I failed the hearing test in kindergarten, and then that's when I went. There is still no treatment though. Good luck with your child.

Educated is past tense Sbwilson 10/29/2016 01:31:32 am None of your points are really valid. Autism is a rare condition not a illness or disease it cannot be spread. And neither is lower back pain, neither is a cord being wrapped around the neck, not an illness, that is simply something that can happen during childbirth. Reply Lindsey Scott link 10/29/2016 04:44:15 am not sure if this may have anything at all to do with this, but my child was born in 2013, and to this day i have to hold my peepee forabout 3 hrs, then once i go to the bathroom i only pee a small amout.. never had this problem before or during my pregnancy... can it affect the mother as well, or is it only expected to affect the child?????

so many stupid people know here. Dead set.



Back pain will be experienced.



You got a giant friggen needle into your spinal chord ffs.



And twins dying, the smallest one sometimes dies. That's just what happens. The epidural hasn't caused any of this shit with your children.



I had one and my daughter is advanced by about a year and healthy as anything!

Yeh I get bad back pain but what can I expect... I had someone inject foreign fluid into my spinal chord through a thick needle.



Of course you're gunna get back pain.



Specially around the time each year that you had it.



Mine plays up bad every September til early December.



Stop believing this bullshit. Your children have not been injected with health problems. If anything, you'd be the sick one. Not them. Pmangum 10/31/2016 05:36:57 pm SBWILSON will the drug that was ""put"" in the epidural cause Burkitt lymphoma, acute lymphoblastic leukemia, sickle cell traits, seizures or miscarriages?

Stupid. Jen 10/28/2016 06:10:47 pm Are you actually joking? You are what's wrong with the world. News flash conspiracy theorists IT COSTS MONEY TO HAVE SICK PEOPLE. Our governments don't make money from infecting us with diseases secretly. The level of stupidity is astounding. #AutismMom. Erica 10/28/2016 06:53:43 pm You are correct! Autism was a listed side effect of some childhood vaccines and it's also part of the reimbursement program in the vaccine injury court.

So many people are unaware of vaccine injuries and just how the natural immune system.

Autism is not a genetic disorder. It does not run in the family. It can not be tested for.. Autism is a group of specific symptoms. Those symptoms are side effects of carcinogens.

I do believe that it exasperates the already existing disorder whether it's visable at the time or not. My son is severely Autistic. His labor was induced via pitocin bc he was 2 weeks late, & I did have an epidural.. Any # of factors could have come in to play in the severity of his diagnosis which was BEFORE the age of ""2""..Over the years we've been able to weed out some environmental factors that make him act out more (gluten foods, artificial flavors & sugars, dairy, perfumes, dyes, etc) Autism in my opinion is genetic and environmental. One doesn't exist w/o the other. He is now 12. We still give him vaccines, but ONLY the necessary ones..

Also, if YOU have vaccinated your children and you yourself are vaccinated, then you shouldn't be concerned about sicknesses that can come from nonvaccinated people. Isn't that the purpose of them?



You may also want to pay attention to the Studies done on the Amish, who don't vaccinate and have very few cases of autism, 3 I believe, and 2 of those children were known to have been vaccinated. Try NOT to believe everything the government and Big Pharma tell you ;-) Lana 10/29/2016 09:34:45 am Gena- you clearly don't know how vaccinations work if you think that people who get vaccines can never get that illness. That's not how it works.



It's not so simple as ""if you don't get a vaccine, you're going to get that disease"" or ""if you do get a vaccine, you won't get that disease.""



It's a population thing. If everyone is vaccinated, then we WIPE OUT deathly diseases that used to kill people by the thousands, even millions.



Why would you want your child to get Polio? Why would you want to make your child suffer and possibly even DIE from something that was virtually wiped out of the country until a few uneducated parents decided that ""vaccines were bad""?



I'm not name calling, but you are definitely the one that needs to be doing the research. Go get your degree as a doctor so you'll actually know how things work instead of believing some stupid conspiracy theories that the government and everyone is out to get you. Jen 10/29/2016 12:32:08 pm No, my son was not actually vaccinated for other reasons until he was 9 years old. So he did not get autism from vaccines. No epidural either sadly. Who is left to blame?

It's helped keep them from getting sick unlike other children. I don't believe that vaccinations cause children to get diagnosed with autism. Id rather protect them then hurt them. Not vaccinating them can cause serous illness and lead to death. I don't want to lose my children because of children that are vaccinated. This real business. Which means your child won't be able to attend school because they aren't vaccinated which can lead to social issues. Do your research love!

Autism doesn't run in families... that's not how it works. Anyone can be born autistic- whether you have family history of it or not.

Was it peer reviewed probably not. It was probably just something you seen on Facebook that used big words and said the words vaccine and autism. Malina 10/28/2016 05:21:49 pm One cannot conduct an experiment where they're injuring or effecting ones life, like ""giving"" someone autism. It's only correlations. It's unethical to conduct true research on a person in this case. It can't ever be truely proven. Lisa lynn 10/28/2016 06:18:08 pm You are special. I'm a specialist with developmental disabilities and autism. The ""research"" on autism and vaccinations has been disqualified. It's being over diagnosed. Kids who are just add and ADHD are getting diagnosed as autistic and later having to get removed from the spectrum. It's a go to for 85% of doctors now so they don't have to figure out the real problems Juanisha 10/28/2016 08:50:27 pm Listen I have twins born in 2010 and one was diagnosed with autism it is something you are born with. You can not just all of a sudden develop autism. And vaccines don't do anything to you but protect you. This really upsets me because yall are just trying to get some money and its crazy Lana 10/29/2016 09:25:06 am Yes, Amber, fake studies with no real credibility and probably never happened. You don't develop autism. You are born with it. Christine 10/30/2016 02:34:49 am Hmmmm.... no peer reviewed studies linking vaccines to autism? No proof that vaccines cause ""harm""? No proof that vaccines don't actually provide true immunity to the disease you vaccinate against???? I guess maybe you forgot to read these then.

Please explain why so many parents opt out of vaccinations and still have children on the spectrum. You have babies born in other countries and for religious reasons, that are never vaccinated and still fall in the spectrum. Please research this farther. There is no actual way to pinpoint what causes this disorder. I work with individuals with ASD and hey come from all walks of life. It is baffling that's what intrigues me about it. corderro donegan 10/28/2016 10:08:55 pm thank you that's all they are trying to do. maybe you should read toffee paperwork on the epidural that they give you before they sign and they won't have any problems Ashley 10/28/2016 12:02:34 pm I feel like anyone who reads this and believes it, is seriously lacking common sense.

I had another epidural in 2012 my daughter seemed fine but my husband and I noticed when she was 3 she couldn't recall what you we're teaching her and she is 4 now and it's still going on it just seem like she has a hard time remembering and recalling.

It seems as if everyone is look for someone to blame. But if this was real, there would be a CRAZY lawsuit.

Don't believe everything you read on Facebook ! Reply Sha 10/28/2016 05:11:59 pm I agree. I have never heard of this site and I had an epidural and my daughter will be turning 3. She has had no problems. My husband and I tried repeatedly to get pregnant and nothing. I have had 2 prior miscarriages so once my pregnancy was confirmed I was going on 3 months and was scared crazy. Not knowing I'm pregnant, plus miscarriages and I had never made it pass 1-2 months with the first 2. My water broke and my cervix was not open and I received an epidural followed by an emergency c section & Rylei was fine. I had no problems afterwards. So I think this article is a bunch of bologna. Like you mentioned no lawsuit, can't even recollect it being on the news.

Both times the doctors thought it was weird that I could move my legs. You could pinch them and I felt nothing. But it was a pretty cool experience. My feet were so far to my head I could watch both my kids come out. Also I could feel their bodies, it didn't hurt. But I guess seeing it helped me feel it. It was weird but pretty cool at the same time. I am a very blessed mother.

I had my first epidural on my 5th child ... She was born 8-1-13 and she has dysphagia... It's a swallowing disorder, where she aspirates think liquids even her Sylvia... She is more acceptable to pneumonia and has been on thickened liquids since birth for no reason... Riley of Indianapolis calls her a medical mystery because nothing has caused this n she hasn't grown our of it.... I see a lot of swallowing problems on here.. hmmmmmmm Reply tiffany 10/29/2016 09:00:03 am Well, it's not. This website has 0 credibility.

Epidurals are only given after labor cannot be stopped in pre-term labors. Reply Shuterra 10/29/2016 04:17:24 am I had an epidural in aug 2014 with my 2 yr old she's fine. Then turnt around and got pregnant with twins and gave birth to them jun 2015 my daughter died at 3 months cause was unknown and my son was diagnosed with hydrocephalus and has a permanent tube in his body and also developmental delays. They say the reason for the hydrocephalus was cause he had a kink in his spine which sounds like a birth defect to me.

The scientific data? MMR does not cause Autism, and the study that supposedly proofed this was found to be biased, and the researcher was trying to make his case, and poison epidural do not cause birth issues, do research before you believe everything you read, becomming educated and understand before making claims, it is sad children are born ir die, but sometimes sadly enough, it is just genetics, or just bad luck. Reply Tiara Chambers 10/29/2016 08:28:50 am I have 3 children. Had them in 2008, 2011, and 2013. My son born in 2011 has major behavior problems, but I don't think it's connected to this. My daughter born in 2013 was born sick and had to stay in hospital for 7 days. I was hemorrhaging right after I had her and almost needed a blood transfusion and she has hypothyroidism. Also, my back is terrible now and I had an epidural with all 3 of mine. I live in Pennsylvania so I wonder if they were doing that here....or if this post is even true.

People are really complaining that when they got an epidural, they were numbed from the waist down? NO SHIT THAT'S THE POINT OF GETTING ONE. Stop looking for something to blame you or your child's problems on. No, autism doesn't ""run in families."" You people need to do some research because you all sound so uneducated and just plain ignorant. By the way, this is just another fake article to get circled around Facebook to try to get a rise out of idiots. No credibility to this website. No factual information in this article. Nothing proven or even close. So, congratulations on being the idiots they got a rise out of. Do better in the future.

My opinion, most of these do not even seem to have anything to do with an epidural. My son was born in 2012, I had an epidural, but my son is absolutely healthy with no complications during delivery. Things happen for a reason. I wouldn't personally blame it on the epidural as soon as you see something on the internet. Before assuming that the epidural has caused issues with your child, read up on it. Do more information.

With my last 2 I had them natural Reply Charlotte Woolsey 10/29/2016 05:23:40 pm Well all I want to say is I don't believe everything I read on the internet before one of you come back and say something. I don't know if this article is true or not. But if it's not true like you girls are saying why would ( I think it was Tabitha not for sure but I will scroll up and see) you say that the epidural affects the second child not the one you are delivering. If this story is false an epidural should not affect any deliveries. So the story maybe something to it or you are contradicting yourself. But epidural and spinal do cause back pain and headaches. That is the side affects from them, but you choose to have one so that is no ones fault. Like I said don't know if this is true or not but I wouldn't put anything passed the government to do something to the epidural's. They are evil and crooked.

Reply Nicky 10/31/2016 03:50:16 am Just been reading through these comments and what I dont understand is how you all think that the epidural made your babies sick. They are fully developed when you get the needle so how do you think it caused heart defects or such when the organs and brain are mostly formed in the first trimester. It all sounds ridiculous to be honest. The epidural does cause numbness in the legs its supposed to thats the whole point and as for backache well its the strain of the pregnancy that weakens our backs more than the injection. The source of this article is not even verified. I dont believe a word of it. Pregnancy and labour is always risky & unfortunately sometimes things do go wrong but I wouldn't be blaming the epidural.

Situation

More than 100 whales - orcas and belugas - are being held in tiny enclosures on Russia's Pacific Coast in the city of Nakhodka.

This is the largest number of sea creatures to ever be held in small temporary enclosures. Some of them have been there since July.

Marine mammal experts claim that those animals were being sold to Chinese aquariums, despite the fact that legally they are only supposed to be used for scientific and educational work. In China there are thousands of millions of dollars to be made on these whales.

There are currently 11 orcas, 5 baby walrus and 90 baby belugas held in these enclosures.15 of the belugas are yearlings that are completely dependent on the mothers for survival. Yearlings need to be in constant tactile contact with a parent - in case of danger their mother will fight to the death to keep them alive. Capturing whales this young is banned in Russia.

The export of these marine mammals has finally been stopped but the problem now is that these animals are stuck in ""whale prison"" whilst the authorities try to find the perpetrators and work out the right procedural decision to take. Independent experts are seriously worried that the animals will die if they are kept in these conditions much longer. Whale babies who have not received enough mother's milk will not survive the winter.

Solution

These Orca's need to be released into their natural habitat. The belugas need to be transferred to responsible people that will feed them, rehabilitate them and release them into their natural habitat when they are ready."

MOSCOW (AP) — Russian officials have invited a French ocean explorer to offer advice on how to safely release nearly 100 illegally captured whales, voicing hope that the animals could be let into the wild during summer.

Jean-Michel Cousteau of the Ocean Futures Society arrived Friday in Russia’s Far East on a mission to inspect the mammals and help create conditions for them to be released. Cousteau, son of famous oceanographer Jacques Cousteau, has voiced concern about the animals’ condition and offered his help to the Russian government.

The whales’ condition has drawn international concern, and President Vladimir Putin has ordered authorities to investigate the case and release the animals. Russian prosecutors have brought criminal charges against four companies keeping the whales.

Whales are worth a fortune on the black market, and local environmental activists suspected that they were captured for sale to amusements parks in China. Russian law only allows for the capture of whales for “scientific” purposes.

Regional Gov. Oleg Kozhemyako met with Cousteau in Vladivostok, voicing hope that his experience will help “get a full picture on how to allow the animals to readapt to living in the wild.”

Before flying to the Far East, Cousteau met with Russian Natural Resources Minister Dmitry Kobylkin in Moscow on Thursday. Kobylkin said summer offers the most favorable conditions for releasing 97 belugas and orcas.

“We couldn’t release the animals in the winter, it would have simply killed them,” Kobylkin said. “We can and must do this work in the coming summer.”

He emphasized that Russia would like to rely on international expertise to ensure the safe release of the mammals.

“We want to do it as openly as possible,” Kobylkin added.

Russian scientists estimate that the rehabilitation effort will cost about 300 million rubles (about $4.6 million).

Activists first raised the alarm late last fall when 101 belugas and orcas were captured and placed in a marine containment facility that environmentalists have dubbed a “whale prison” near the far eastern port of Nakhodka.

Local prosecutors have said that several of the mammals have escaped, but environmentalists said four animals likely died because of cramped conditions and low temperatures."

The BBC's Helier Cheung and Tessa Wong were at the scene as a dramatic rescue bid gripped the world.

What happened over those two weeks is a remarkable story of friendship, human endurance - and the lengths some people will go to save someone else's child.

Here our reporters tell the full story of the Wild Boars.

The birthday party that went wrong

It all began with a birthday.

On Saturday 23 June, Peerapat ""Night"" Sompiangjai turned 17 - a milestone most young people around the world would want to celebrate in style.

His family had prepared a bright yellow SpongeBob SquarePants birthday cake and several colourfully wrapped presents at their home in a rural village in Mae Sai district.

But Night wasn't rushing home that day. He was out with his friends, the other members of local youth football team the Wild Boars, and their assistant coach, Ekkapol ""Ake"" Chantawong.

When their football practice ended, they raced through the rice paddies on their bicycles and up into the forested hills that lately had been blanketed in rain.

Their destination: the Tham Luang cave, a favourite haunt for the boys, who loved exploring the nooks and crannies of the mountain range towering over Mae Sai.

Image copyright Facebook/Nopparat Kanthawong Image caption A photo the boys posted to Facebook shortly before they went in the cave

Once at the mouth of Tham Luang, they stashed their bikes and bags by the cave entrance.

The team and their young coach had often ventured deep into Tham Luang, sometimes as far as 8km, for initiation rites where they would write the names of new team members on a cave wall.

In high spirits, they clambered into the cave with just their torches. They didn't need much else - after all, they were only planning to be there for an hour.

They would not emerge until two weeks later.

Back at Night's home, his family began to worry. His birthday cake sat untouched.

Where were the Wild Boars?

Snaking for 10km beneath the cloud-swathed mountain range that separates Thailand and Myanmar is Tham Luang, the fourth biggest Thai cave system.

Named after a mountain shaped like a reclining woman, its full name is Tham Luang Khun Nam Nang Non - ""the great cave and water source of the sleeping lady mountain"". Rich in folklore, it is a popular destination for day-trippers - and adventurous children.

It has its dangers - people have gone missing in Tham Luang before. And once monsoon season starts in July, the cave goes from innocuous to extremely dangerous.

The cave can flood up to 5m (16ft) during the rainy season, and should only be entered between November and April.

""The water is moving, it's muddy and there is almost no visibility,"" local guide Joshua Morris told the BBC.

And once the cave floods - it's risky even for experienced divers.

Almost everyone in Mae Sai knows this. So when the parents of the Wild Boars began to worry about their missing boys, they headed straight to the cave. The boys' plans to visit Tham Luang had been discussed in a group chat on a messaging app with other friends.

They found the bikes, the bags, and some football shoes outside. They raised the alarm.

Deep in the cave, the Wild Boars found themselves in trouble. It had been raining for the last few days, and all that water falling on the mountain had to go somewhere.

That somewhere was the Tham Luang cave system, which was fast filling up.

One initial account from the boys suggests they were caught off-guard by a flash flood. They needed to get out, but instead had no choice but to scramble even deeper into the cave.

The Wild Boars eventually found themselves marooned on a small rocky shelf about 4km from the cave entrance, past a normally dry point known as Pattaya Beach which by now was flooded.

Swallowed up by an unforgiving mountain and surrounded by darkness, the boys and the coach lost all sense of time. Fear, perhaps even terror, would no doubt have crept in.

But they were nothing but determined to survive. The group used rocks to dig 5m deeper into the shelf, to create a cavern where they could huddle together and keep warm.

Coach Ake, a former monk, taught the boys meditation techniques - to help them stay calm and use as little air as possible - and told them to lie still to conserve their strength.

But an extraordinary set of circumstances also worked in their favour.

They apparently had no food - but they did have a supply of drinkable water in the form of moisture dripping from the cave walls.

It was dark, but they had their torches. There was also enough air for a while - because the porous limestone and cracks in the rocks meant air could come through.

They had the right conditions to survive - at least for a little while. And most importantly, the Wild Boars had one another.

Now came the hardest bit - hoping for rescue.

Outside the cave, a full-blown rescue operation was quickly unfolding.

Authorities called in the elite Thai Navy Seals, the national police, and other rescue teams. Local volunteers also pitched in.

Initial investigations found footprints at one of the chambers in the cave - but no other sign the boys were still alive.

The Wild Boars were somewhere in the twisted depths of Tham Luang - but where exactly? And more importantly - how could rescuers get to them?

Exploring the cave was a challenge - most of the Navy divers had little cave diving experience. And the weather was merciless - heavy rainfall meant the water level was still rising, flooding chambers and cutting off rescuers from parts of the cave.

Engineers desperately tried to pump water out of the cave - but struggled, at least at first.

At the start, ""no one really had any idea what to do"", one volunteer said. Officials brought whatever equipment they could think of - small water pumps, long pipes, knives and shovels - but much of it was apparently unsuitable.

They even tried drilling into the mountainside, desperate to find cracks into the cave system which they could squeeze into, and used drones with thermal sensors to try to locate the boys.

Rescuers also turned to the villagers for local knowledge. The Thai Navy Seals found a boy, a Wild Boar member who happened to have skipped the cave expedition. He recalled a place in the complex they'd visited before - called Pattaya Beach.

Could the missing 13 be there?

Amid the flurry of rescue operations, a small group kept vigil at the mouth of the cave.

Image copyright AFP

These were the boys' families, worriedly offering prayers for their lives. Among them was Tum Kantawong, the godmother of Coach Ake.

Every day she went up the mountain, carrying fruits, incense and candles. ""It was to show respect to the spirit that protects the cave. I asked her to protect the 13 kids,"" she said.

The group gradually expanded to include concerned teachers from the schools the Wild Boars attended.

""We wanted to be the first to welcome the boys when they came out,"" said school administrator Ampin Saenta, who is so close to one boy, Adul, that she calls herself his ""mama-teacher"".

Classmates of the Wild Boars held group prayers, sang songs of encouragement into the cave, folded paper cranes, and posted messages of hope on school noticeboards.

Villagers rallied together, donating money and hundreds of packages of food to the relatives of the boys and their coach.

That sense of community soon began to spread, as the story gained the nation's attention. Volunteers from other parts of Thailand flew in, while Thai social media lit up with expressions of love and support.

But it was about to get even bigger.

The first international rescuers arrived on Thursday 28 June.

These were US air force rescue specialists, and cave divers from the UK, Belgium, Australia, Scandinavia, and many other countries. Some had volunteered, and some were called in by Thai authorities.

Others were roped in when it became clear just how monumental the search effort would be.

Over the next few days, they and the Thai divers would fight a constant battle with the elements. They had to swim against a strong current, and were often forced back by rising floodwaters.

On Sunday 1 July - just over a week after the boys went missing - the rescuers made some progress. They reached a large cavern that would be later dubbed ""chamber three"" and serve as a key base for the divers.

It also happened to be the birthday of Note - one of the ""Thai cave boys"", as they were now dubbed by the media. All, however, were still lost to the world.

But not for long. The very next day, two British divers made an incredible discovery.

'Thirteen? Brilliant!'

John Volanthen and Rick Stanton had been braving Tham Luang's narrow, murky passageways for several days, laying out guide ropes and searching for signs of life.

On Monday, the two men finally reached Pattaya Beach. But there was nothing.

They continued onwards into the darkness. Then, a few hundred metres further, they found an air pocket.

""Wherever there is air space we surface, we shout, we smell,"" John told the BBC. It's a standard procedure for such rescue operations.

""We smelt the children before we saw or heard them.""

Soon, the light from John's torch illuminated an electrifying sight - the boys emerged from the darkness, coming down the ledge towards him.

Rick started counting the boys, while John asked: ""How many of you?""

""Thirteen!"" came the reply in English.

""Thirteen? Brilliant!""

Next to John, Rick couldn't quite believe what he was seeing. ""They're all alive!""

The lost Wild Boars had been found.

The two divers spent some time with the boys - trying to boost their morale. Then, they left lights with the boys, and promised to return later with food.

The extraordinary encounter was recorded on the divers' cameras - and swiftly posted online. The jubilation was instant, and worldwide.

Wracked with worry for much of the past week, the Wild Boars' parents were ecstatic to see their children had miraculously survived. They looked thin, but were otherwise in relatively good shape.

The boys and their coach were quickly joined by a military medic and Navy SEAL divers who would stay with them for the rest of the ordeal.

After nine days in the darkness, the Wild Boars once again saw light. They longed for proper food, and begged for pad krapao, a rice dish with meat stir fried with basil.

But doctor's orders were that they be put on a special diet of medicated liquid food, and mineral water with added vitamins.

A third boy, Dom, spent his birthday in the cave.

Rescuers set to work in figuring out how to extract 13 people - some of whom couldn't swim - from a winding, flooded 4km-long stretch of caves that even experienced divers would struggle with.

""Time is not on our side because they're expecting heavy rains within three days,"" diver Ben Reymenants told the BBC at the time.

""Now the real hard work comes.""

A volunteer army

The astonishing discovery of the children deep in a mountain cave catapulted tiny Mae Sai into the international spotlight.

Overnight, journalists from all around the world descended on the district, as even more rescue volunteers from around the world poured in.

A small makeshift town mushroomed at the rural country park by the cave entrance.

Food stalls were set up - some staffed by members of the Thai royal kitchen - serving free drinks, hot noodles, chicken rice, and even ice lollies.

No job was too small to do.

The country park toilets were dirty and stretched beyond capacity - so people began cleaning them. Workers needed to get up and down the mountain - so drivers offered free lifts. Rescuers were covered in mud - so a local laundromat cleaned their clothes every night.

Spirits were high, but then a fatal accident devastated the community.

A hero dies

Former Navy Seal diver Saman Gunan was one of many volunteers who had rushed to help in the rescue.

On 6 July, while on a routine run to deliver air tanks to the boys, he lost consciousness after running out of air for himself. His dive buddy pulled him out and tried to revive him.

But Saman could not be saved. He was only 38 years old.

His funeral took place later that day. Buddhist monks murmured prayers for Saman as incense burned.

His wife, Waleeporn Gunan, said: ""Saman once said we never know when we're going to die… so we need to cherish every day.""

The death hit home the danger of the rescue mission, and the risks facing the boys. Saman was a fit and healthy diver who had also represented Thailand in triathlons.

Ratdao Chantapoon, the mother of cave boy Note, was said to have told a friend: ""The Navy Seal had practised for so long, and was so strong, but also died. How about a boy who has never dived before?""

There was another thing to worry about too - despite efforts to replenish the air, oxygen levels in the chamber had fallen to 15%, lower than the usual 21%.

Time was running out.

Rescuers had identified three possible options:

Training the boys to dive through flooded areas of the cave - a process so ripe with potential for disaster it was widely considered a last resort

Pumping water from the cave and waiting for water levels to recede naturally - but this could take up to four months

Finding or drilling alternative passages into the cave

The divers started practising with some local boys at a swimming pool - figuring out how to transport a child safely underwater.

Other solutions, such as an offer of a kid-sized submarine designed by tech entrepreneur Elon Musk's engineers, would be rejected as unsuitable.

The rescue team faced conditions so difficult that even simple tasks - setting up air and phone lines in the cave - seemed impossible at first because of the labyrinthine layout of the cave.

Finally, late on 6 July, rescuers set up an oxygen supply. And in the end the boys communicated with their parents the old-fashioned way - by writing letters.

The letters, made public by the Thai Navy Seals, were deeply moving.

Scrawling hearts and smiley faces on note paper, the boys told their parents again and again that they loved them and not to worry.

They listed the food they wanted to eat - fried chicken and pork crackling. One even cracked a joke: ""Teacher, please don't give us too much homework!""

""I'm really sorry to the parents,"" said Coach Ake in his letter. But instead of a tongue-lashing, he received only love.

""Coach Ake, I really thank you for taking care of all the kids, and keeping them safe,"" one boy's relative wrote.

D-Day

Sunday 7 July. Two weeks had passed since the boys went missing.

Out of the blue, the Thai authorities announced they were pulling out the boys - now.

""There is no other day that we are more ready than today,"" Narongsak Osotthanakorn, the head of the rescue operations, said.

Journalists and volunteers were asked to leave the cave rescue site - and a brisk, steely mood overtook the camp.

Why the snap decision? The rain that had pelted Mae Sai incessantly had petered out in recent days, giving rescuers a rare break.

Locals had also told the Thai Navy Seals that by around 10 July every year, the Tham Luang cave system would be completely flooded.

It was time to launch what would later be described as a ""superhuman"" rescue effort, one that involved nearly 100 Thai and foreign divers.

The journey was split into two sections.

The first - from the boys' rocky ledge to chamber three - was more difficult. Rescuers made their way for hours through pitch dark waters that were bone-chilling cold, feeling their way with guide ropes. At times they had to navigate sections so ridiculously narrow that they could only just about fit a body through.

Each boy was given a full-face air mask to ensure they could breathe, and clipped to a diver. Another diver accompanied them.

A cylinder was strapped to the front of each child, while a handle was attached to their backs - and they were held face down to ensure water would run away from their faces.

John, the British rescue diver, likened the equipment to ""a shopping bag"" that allowed them to manoeuvre the boys around obstacles.

At the narrow sections, rescuers had to unstrap their air tanks in order to squeeze through, while also pulling along their precious cargo.

It would have been terrifying for experienced divers, let alone for children who were not strong swimmers. The Thai government says the boys and the coach were given anti-anxiety medication to relax - but several sources have told the BBC that they were in fact heavily sedated, and only semi-conscious during the journey - to ensure they would not panic.

Once they reached chamber three, it was time for the second phase. This took another few hours.

Each boy was secured in a stretcher, and carried by a team of at least five men. At one point they had to place the stretcher on a raft and pull it across a chin-high pool of water.

Rescuers had to winch the boys up a steep slope using a pulley system. In some rocky areas they formed a human chain, passing the boys hand to hand, while at others they slid them on top of pipes pumping out water.

For diver Ivan Karadzic, the experience was extremely stressful. Stationed at a halfway point in the cave, he was responsible for replacing air tanks and guiding rescue divers through.

He clearly remembers the nerves he felt when the first boy emerged from the darkness and was brought towards him. ""I didn't know if it was a casualty or a kid,"" he told the BBC.

""But when I saw that he was alive and breathing - it felt very good.""

Image copyright Getty Images Image caption Thai students prayed for the rescue mission to be a success

One by one, the Wild Boars were brought out of the darkness of Tham Luang. They were given oxygen before they were swiftly spirited away in ambulances to a hospital in Chiang Rai city.

Rescuers took them out in three batches over as many days, as they needed time in between to replenish air tanks.

But they were cutting it close. By the time the last batch of boys and the coach were out, water levels were starting to rise again, as rapidly as 30cm in one hour, according to senior Navy SEAL Supachai Tanasansakorn.

It was Tuesday 10 July - the day that locals said the cave would become completely flooded.

But while the boys were out, there were still people left on the rocky ledge deep inside Tham Luang - the Navy SEAL divers and medic who had looked after the Wild Boars, as well as Richard Harris, a famed Australian cave diving expert and doctor.

They emerged shortly after the last boy was taken out. It was not a moment too soon, as a pump suddenly stopped working - some said it failed while others said it was switched off.

Floodwaters rushed in, sending workers clearing up the site fleeing.

Hooyah!

It was an astonishing feat - after two agonising weeks the Thai cave boys and their coach were finally out at last, safe and sound.

On Facebook, the Thai Navy Seals posted: ""We are not sure if this is a miracle, science, or what.""

In Chiang Rai, jubilant crowds lined the streets leading to the hospital, cheering on the ambulances. Car horns blared incessantly in celebration.

Image copyright Reuters

Thai social media was inundated with posts hashtagged #ThankYou, #Heroes and #Hooyah, the signature Thai Navy Seal chant.

All around the world, millions of people who had anxiously followed the story celebrated the return of the Wild Boars.

But it was a bittersweet night for one person - Richard Harris. The selfless doctor who cut short his holiday in Thailand to save the boys' lives received the terrible news that his father had just died.

Reunited again

Dressed in gowns and wearing face masks, the Thai cave boys sat up in their hospital beds and waved to the world.

On Wednesday 11 July, the media got its first post-rescue glimpse of the Wild Boars in a Thai Navy Seals video. Some made victory signs at the camera.

Their parents, who had waited so very long to hold their sons again, were not by their side. They were behind a viewing window, some sobbing with joy at the sight of their boys.

The government said it was necessary to quarantine the boys to protect them and others from infection - though this did not stop Prime Minister Prayuth Chan-ocha from visiting in person. The parents did not publicly object to the strict rules.

At the hospital, the boys and coach were put through a series of health checks. Eye shades were a must at first - their eyes, accustomed to two weeks of darkness, could not bear the light.

Image copyright AFP Image caption The last four Navy SEALs to exit the cave

Hospital authorities said that some had minor lung and eye infections and needed antibiotics. Apart from that, they appeared to be on the mend.

Eventually, parents were finally allowed to briefly see the boys, although they had to maintain a 2m distance, and don hospital gowns and masks.

Some of the boys have even been able to start eating normal food again, after days of craving chocolate and their favourite snacks.

As for the rescuers, they are still digesting the unprecedented feat they pulled off.

""We didn't think the mission would be this successful,"" said Thai Navy Seals leader Rear Adm Arpakorn Yuukongkaew.

When rescue operations began, his team only had ""a little bit of hope that they might still be alive"".

""In the end that tiny bit of hope became reality.""

Many had expected the story of the lost Wild Boars to end in tragedy. Instead, it became a story of hope and survival, and of parents and sons reunited.

It's a story of ordinary people from all over the world coming together in a remote town in northern Thailand with one mission: to save 12 young boys and their coach.

""If you could do the same for someone else's child, you would,"" John told reporters upon his return to the UK.

What's next for Mae Sai? The district, and Tham Luang cave, have been put on the global map, probably permanently.

Image copyright AFP Image caption The story of the Wild Boars has dominated life in the local community

Already, local officials are planning to convert the cave complex into a museum and tourist attraction - and, inevitably, at least two production companies are eyeing the Hollywood potential of the story and angling to turn the rescue mission into a film.

As for the Wild Boars and Coach Ake, plans are afoot for them to shave their heads and spend a few days in a monastery. Their families believe this Thai Buddhist tradition will bless their lives, and cleanse them of an unfortunate experience.

""It's for their protection,"" said Night's grandfather, Seewad Sompiangjai. ""It's like they have died [after going into the cave] - and now have been reborn.""

For the boys, and Coach Ake - their first priority once they leave hospital must surely be to spend time with their families again.

After all, Night still has to celebrate that 17th birthday - and his parents have promised him a party.

A 19-year-old in Delaware, a 25-year-old in Columbus, Ohio, a 33-year-old in California, and a 64-year-old in Indiana.

They are among the 29 people fatally shot in the United States on March 6. Meaning that any one of them might have been the shooting death that pushed the year’s total past the number of deaths suffered by American forces during the invasion of Normandy on June 6, 1944.

On Thursday, Americans remembered those killed on D-Day, 75 years back. It was a day of enormous heroism that was critical in turning back Nazi Germany’s attempt to conquer Europe. Thousands of Americans, Canadians, Australians and soldiers from other countries were part of the largest amphibious invasion force in history.

Some 2,501 Americans gave their lives that day, according to historic estimates. Another 1,913 soldiers from other Allied countries also died, bringing the total death toll from the immediate invasion to 4,414.

It took until late April before the number of people killed by guns in the United States in 2019 topped that number, according to data collected by the Gun Violence Archive. (This data excludes suicides.)



(Philip Bump/The Washington Post)

As a percentage of the population, the death toll on D-Day was equivalent to about 5,930 deaths in the United States today — fewer than have been killed here in shooting incidents so far this year.

In an interview with President Trump earlier this week, British journalist Piers Morgan drew a comparison between American gun violence and World War II.

Morgan noted that there were 35 gun deaths a year in Britain, half the number killed on average each day in the United States. Trump responded by making an argument he’s made before: that if the concertgoers at a nightclub in Paris had been armed during a terrorist attack there in November 2015, fewer people might have died.

“Here’s my problem with that argument,” Morgan said. “More people were shot dead in America that week than have died from guns in Paris since the Second World War. The stats are so against that argument.”

Trump replied: “Well, what are you going to do? You’re going to take the guns away from hunters?” He also pointed out that many people have rifles for entertainment.

Morgan’s data point is incorrect. According to the Gun Violence Archive, 234 people were shot and killed in the United States the week of the Paris attacks. There are more gun suicides than homicides in the United States, but, even so, France has averaged more than 1,800 gun deaths per year in recent years.

It’s still the case, though, that other nations see far fewer gun deaths than does the United States. Looking at estimates since 1990, calculated by the Global Health Data Exchange at the University of Washington, there were more homicides by gun in the United States in 1990 alone than there were from 1990 through 2017 in the United Kingdom, Canada and Germany combined.



(Philip Bump/The Washington Post)

Most of those killed in the United States this year died in incidents in which they were the only victim. While we focus on mass shootings (defined by the Gun Violence Archive as incidents in which four or more people were killed or wounded), victims of these incidents make up only a tiny fraction of all those killed in 2019.



(Philip Bump/The Washington Post)

The number of those killed and wounded by guns in the United States has already topped 16,000 this year.



(Philip Bump/The Washington Post)

An after-action report compiled by the U.S. Army after D-Day found that between June 6, 1944, and July 1, the United States suffered 2,811 deaths and 13,564 wounded.

That’s 16,375 casualties combined — slightly less than the total from shooting incidents in the United States this year through June 6."

BY THE PRESIDENT OF THE UNITED STATES OF AMERICA

A PROCLAMATION

For generations, the story of American progress has been shaped by the inextinguishable beliefs that change is always possible and a brighter future lies ahead. With tremendous strength and abiding resolve, our ancestors -- some of whom were brought to this land in chains -- have woven their resilient dignity into the fabric of our Nation and taught us that we are not trapped by the mistakes of history. It was these truths that found expression as foot soldiers and Freedom Riders sat in and stood up, marched and agitated for justice and equality. This audacious movement gave birth to a new era of civil and voting rights, and slowly, we renewed our commitment to an ideal at the heart of our founding: no matter who you are, what you look like, how modest your beginnings, or the circumstances of your birth, you deserve every opportunity to achieve your God-given potential.

As we mark National African American History Month, we celebrate giants of the civil rights movement and countless other men and women whose names are etched in the hearts of their loved ones and the cornerstones of the country they helped to change. We pause to reflect on our progress and our history -- not only to remember, but also to acknowledge our unfinished work. We reject the false notion that our challenges lie only in the past, and we recommit to advancing what has been left undone.

Brave Americans did not struggle and sacrifice to secure fundamental rights for themselves and others only to see those rights denied to their children and grandchildren. Our Nation is still racked with division and poverty. Too many children live in crumbling neighborhoods, cycling through substandard schools and being affected by daily violence in their communities. And Americans of all races have seen their wages and incomes stagnate while inequality continues to hold back hardworking families and entire communities.

But the trajectory of our history gives us hope. Today, we stand on the shoulders of courageous individuals who endured the thumps of billy clubs, the blasts of fire hoses, and the pain of watching dreams be deferred and denied. We honor them by investing in those around us and doing all we can to ensure every American can reach their full potential. Our country is at its best when everyone is treated fairly and has the chance to build the future they seek for themselves and their family. This means providing the opportunity for every person in America

to access a world-class education, safe and affordable housing, and the job training that will prepare them for the careers of tomorrow.

Like the countless, quiet heroes who worked and bled far from the public eye, we know that with enough effort, empathy, and perseverance, people who love their country can change it. Together, we can help our Nation live up to its immense promise. This month, let us continue that unending journey toward a more just, more equal, and more perfect Union.

NOW, THEREFORE, I, BARACK OBAMA, President of the United States of America, by virtue of the authority vested in me by the Constitution and the laws of the United States, do hereby proclaim February 2015 as National African American History Month. I call upon public officials, educators, librarians, and all the people of the United States to observe this month with appropriate programs, ceremonies, and activities.

IN WITNESS WHEREOF, I have hereunto set my hand this thirtieth day of January, in the year of our Lord two thousand fifteen, and of the Independence of the United States of America the two hundred and thirty-ninth.

https://www.snopes.com/fact-check/super-blue-blood-moon/	a rare confluence of celestial events will bring what nasa terms a âsuper blue blood moonâ to the skies on 31 january 2018.	true	['blood moon', 'blue moon', 'earth', 'eclipse', 'full moon', 'lunar eclipse', 'moone', 'nasa', 'supermoon']	2018/01/29	Alex Kasprak	['https://moon.nasa.gov/news/29/teachable-moment-whats-a-supermoon-and-just-how-super-is-it/', 'https://science.nasa.gov/science-news/news-articles/a-supermoon-trilogy', 'https://www.timeanddate.com/eclipse/lunar/2018-january-31', 'https://www.timeanddate.com/astronomy/moon/distance.html?year=2015&n=137']	https://science.nasa.gov/science-news/news-articles/a-supermoon-trilogy	https://science.nasa.gov/	"Mark your calendars: a series of three supermoons will appear on the celestial stage on December 3, 2017, January 1, 2018, and January 31, 2018.

What is a Supermoon? A supermoon is a Moon that is full when it is also at or near its closest point in its orbit around Earth.

Since the Moon’s orbit is elliptical, one side (apogee) is about 30,000 miles (50,000 km) farther from Earth than the other (perigee). Nearby perigee full Moons appear about 14% bigger and 30% brighter than full Moons that occur near apogee in the Moon's orbit.

“The supermoons are a great opportunity for people to start looking at the Moon, not just that once but every chance they have!” says Noah Petro, a research scientist from NASA’s Goddard Space Flight Center.

It’s hard for our eyes to distinguish these small changes in size when the Moon is high amidst the vastness of the night sky. But any time you catch a full Moon as it rises or sets, while it’s suspended low on the horizon beaming through the silhouettes of trees or buildings, its apparent size might make you do a double-take. You almost feel as though you could reach out, grab the glowing orb, and drop it into your coffee cup. Even more so if it’s a supermoon.

If you can only catch one episode of the supermoon trilogy, catch the third one. It will be extra special.

First of all, the January 31st supermoon will feature a total lunar eclipse, with totality viewable from western North America across the pacific to Eastern Asia. The Moon’s orbit around our planet is tilted so it usually falls above or below the shadow of the Earth. About twice each year, a full Moon lines up perfectly with the Earth and Sun such that Earth’s shadow totally blocks the Sun’s light, which would normally reflect off the Moon.

“The lunar eclipse on January 31 will be visible during moonset. Folks in the Eastern United States, where the eclipse will be partial, will have to get up in the morning to see it,” notes Petro. “But it’s another great chance to watch the Moon.”

The Moon will lose its brightness and take on an eerie, fainter-than-normal glow from the scant sunlight that makes its way through Earth’s atmosphere. Often cast in a reddish hue because of the way the atmosphere bends the light, totally eclipsed Moons are sometimes called ‘blood Moons.’

“We’re seeing all of the Earth’s sunrises and sunsets at that moment reflected from the surface of the Moon,” says Sarah Noble, a Program Scientist at NASA headquarters.

The January 31st supermoon will also be the second full Moon of the month. Some people call the second full Moon in a month a Blue Moon, that makes it a super ‘blue Moon.’ Blue Moons happen every two and a half years, on average. With the total eclipse, it’ll be a royal spectacle indeed: a ‘super blue blood’ Moon.

Sometimes the celestial rhythms sync up just right to wow us. Heed your calendar reminders. On the three dates marked, step out into the moonset or moonrise and look up for a trilogy of sky watching treats!

2000 case of missing girl in North Carolina

Asha Jaquilla Degree (born August 5, 1990; first name pronounced AY-shuh[1]) went missing at the age of nine from Shelby, North Carolina, United States. In the early morning hours of February 14, 2000, for reasons unknown, she packed her bookbag, left her family home north of the city and began walking along nearby North Carolina Highway 18 despite heavy rain and wind. Several passing motorists saw her; when one turned around at a point 1.3 miles (2.1 km) from her home and began to approach her, she left the roadside and ran into a wooded area. In the morning, her parents discovered her absence. No one has seen her since.[2]

An intensive search that began that day led to the location of some of her personal effects near where she was last seen. A year and a half later, her bookbag, still packed, was unearthed from a construction site along Highway 18 north of Shelby in Morganton. At the point where she ran into the woods, a billboard now stands appealing for help finding her. Her family hosts an annual walk from their home to the billboard to draw attention to the case.

While the circumstances of Degree's disappearance at first seemed to suggest she was running away from home, investigators could not find a clear reason she might have done so, and she was younger than most children who do so. They have speculated that she might have been abducted instead. The case has drawn national media attention. In 2015, the Federal Bureau of Investigation (FBI) joined state and county authorities in a reopened investigation, offering a reward for information that could help solve the case.

Background [ edit ]

Harold and Iquilla Degree married on Valentine's Day in 1988. Their son, O'Bryant, was born a year later, and their daughter Asha was born in 1990.[3] The Degrees raised both children in their house on Oakcrest Drive in a residential subdivision amidst a generally rural area north of Shelby, North Carolina, on the western edge of the Charlotte metropolitan area.[4] Both worked regular jobs nearby. The children let themselves in after school,[5] where their parents expected that they would either be doing their homework or finished with it by the time they returned.[6]

They made sure their children were insulated from outside influences and had a life centered around their extended family, church, and school. The Degrees did not have a computer in the house. ""[E]very time you turned on the TV there was some pedophile who had lured somebody's child away, via the Internet,"" Iquilla recalled in a 2013 Jet interview.[7] Iquilla said Asha handled this well; she was cautious, shy and content mostly to stay within the limits her parents set. ""She was scared to death of dogs,"" she recalled years later. ""I never thought she would go out of the house.""[8]

Asha was in fourth grade at nearby Fallston Elementary School going into a three-day weekend on the second week of February 2000. The Cleveland County Schools were closed on Friday, February 11, while the Degrees still had to work; the children spent the day at their aunt's house in the same neighborhood, from which they went to their youth basketball practices at their school. The following day, Asha's basketball team, on which she was a star point guard, lost its first game of the season. Asha had fouled out. Her parents recalled that she was somewhat upset about this, crying along with her teammates afterwards, but seemed to have gotten over it and watched her brother's game afterwards.[6]

Disappearance [ edit ]

On February 13, a Sunday, the children went to church from a relative's house and then returned home. Around 8 p.m. that night, both children went to bed in the room they shared. Almost an hour later, the power went out in the neighborhood after a nearby car accident. The power came back on at 12:30 a.m., at which time Harold checked on his children and saw both Asha and O'Bryant asleep in their beds.[9] He checked again shortly before he went to bed at 2:30 a.m. on February 14, and again saw them both.[6]

Shortly afterwards, O'Bryant, then age 10, recalls hearing Asha's bed squeak. He did not further rouse himself as he assumed she was merely changing positions in her sleep. Apparently around this time, Asha got out of bed, taking a bookbag she had previously packed with several sets of clothes and personal items, and left the house. Between 3:45 and 4:15 a.m., a truck driver and a motorist saw her walking south along Highway 18, wearing a long-sleeved white T-shirt and white pants, just north of its junction with Highway 180.[10] They reported this to police after seeing a TV report about her disappearance.[6] The motorist said that he turned his car around because he thought it was ""strange such a small child would be out by herself at that hour"". He circled three times and saw Degree run into the woods by the roadside and disappear. It was a rainy night, and the witness said there was a ""storm raging"" when he saw her.[8][11] County sheriff Dan Crawford said, ""We're pretty sure it was her because the descriptions they gave are consistent with what we know she was wearing."" He added that they also saw her at the same place, heading the same direction.[12]

Iquilla awoke at 5:45 a.m. to get the children ready for school. On the morning of February 14, an important day since it was not only Valentine's Day but the Degrees' wedding anniversary,[13] this involved drawing a bath for them as they had not been able to take one the night before due to the power outage. When she opened the children's room to wake them up before their 6:30 alarm and call them to the bath, O'Bryant was in his bed but Asha was not, and Iquilla was unable to find her in the house, nor in the family cars.[7] She told Harold she could not find their daughter. He suggested Asha might have gone over to his mother's house across the street, but when Iquilla called there her sister-in-law said Asha was not there. ""That's when I went into panic mode. I heard a car next door ... I put shoes on and ran outside."" Iquilla called her mother, who told her to call the police.[7]

Search [ edit ]

By 6:40 a.m., the first police officers had arrived on the scene. Police dogs called to the scene could not pick up Asha's scent. Iquilla went through the neighborhood calling Asha's name, which she said had awakened everyone by 7 a.m.[7] Friends, family and neighbors canceled their plans for the day to assist police in searching the vicinity while the pastor of their church, along with other area clergymen, came to the Degrees' home to support them. By day's end all that had been found was a mitten, which Iquilla Degree said did not belong to her daughter as she had found that no winter clothing had been taken from the house.[14] Local news coverage resulted in the two drivers who had seen Asha walking along the road early that morning, including the one whose attempt to approach her apparently prompted Asha to flee into the woods, reporting the sightings to police.[6]

On February 15, candy wrappers were found in a shed at a nearby business along the highway, near where Asha had been seen running into the woods.[15] Along with them were a pencil, marker and Mickey Mouse-shaped hair bow that were identified as belonging to her.[8][16] It was the only trace of her found during the initial search. On February 16, Iquilla realized that Asha's bedroom was missing her favorite clothing, including a pair of blue jeans with a red stripe.[17][6][10] A week later, after 9,000 man hours had been invested in a search of the 2–3-mile-radius (3.2–4.8 km) of where she had last been seen, flyers posted all over the area and 300 leads ranging from possible sightings to tips about abandoned houses and wells where Asha might have ended up, the search was called off. ""We have never really had that first good, substantial lead,"" said county sheriff Dan Crawford at a news conference. He urged the media to keep the story alive.[18]

Later developments [ edit ]

At the news conference on February 22, Crawford said he was going ""long-range"" with the search for Asha. Both the FBI and North Carolina's State Bureau of Investigation (SBI) got involved and put her on their respective databases of missing children. While the agencies were done searching in the area of her home and route, ""we're following everything,"" he insisted.[18]

From Iquilla's account of what Asha had taken with her, investigators believed she had planned and prepared for this departure over the several days preceding her disappearance. ""She's not your typical runaway,"" observed SBI agent Bart Burpeau. Another expert, Ben Ermini of the National Center for Missing & Exploited Children, noted that most children who run away are at least 12.[11] An FBI agent also pointed to the lack of an issue she might have been running away from, such as a dysfunctional family or poor academic performance. Still, investigators believed that was the most likely explanation for her departure, but that for some reason she either got off track or was abducted.[18]

The media attention went national. A month after Asha's disappearance, the Degree family appeared on The Montel Williams Show to call attention to the case. America's Most Wanted and The Oprah Winfrey Show also devoted segments to it.[7]

On August 3, 2001, Asha's bookbag and other items were discovered during a construction project off Highway 18 in Burke County, near Morganton, about 26 miles (42 km) north of Shelby. It was wrapped in a plastic bag.[2][19][20][21] The worker who found it said the bookbag contained Asha's name and phone number.[16] The FBI took it to their headquarters for further forensic analysis; results from that testing have not been shared publicly.[22] To date it is the last evidence found in the case.[23] On the 20th anniversary of Asha's disappearance, the FBI confirmed that the bookbag contained a copy of Dr. Seuss's McElligot's Pool and a T-shirt depicting the band New Kids on the Block. Neither appeared to have been her property before they were found in her bag; the book was from the library at her elementary school.[1]

Later leads have turned out to be dead ends. In 2004, acting on a tip reportedly received from an inmate at the county jail, the sheriff's office began digging at an intersection in Lawndale. The bones that were found turned out to be from an animal.[20]

The Degrees took steps to keep Asha's memory, and the case, alive in the public's mind. In 2008, they established a scholarship in her name for a deserving local student.[24] They host an annual walk to raise awareness and money to fund their search.[25] The walk starts at their home and ends at a missing person's billboard for Asha along Highway 18, near where she was last seen.[2] It was originally held on February 14, but it was changed to February 7 in 2015 and February 6 in 2016, as Harold and Iquilla felt it was not fair to participants to make Valentine's Day a somber occasion.[5][4] Pictures of Asha, both real and those showing her as she might appear in later years created by investigators to help the search, still decorate the Degree house. ""I fully expect her to walk through the door,"" Iquilla says.[4]

Iquilla Degree lamented in a 2013 interview with Jet that her daughter's disappearance had not gotten as much media attention over the years as some subsequent cases of missing children. She believed it was because Asha was black. ""Missing white children get more attention. I don't understand why,"" she said. ""I know if you ask them they will say it's not racial. Oh, really? I'm not going to argue because I have common sense.""[7]

In February 2015, the FBI announced that FBI agents, Cleveland County Sheriff's Office investigators, and State Bureau of Investigation agents were re-examining the case and re-interviewing witnesses. They also announced a reward of up to $25,000 for ""information leading to the arrest and conviction of the person or persons responsible for her disappearance.""[26] A community group is offering an additional $20,000 reward.[27]

The FBI announced 15 months later, in May 2016, that their reinvestigation of the case had turned up a possible new lead. They disclosed that Asha may have been seen getting into a dark green early 1970s Lincoln Continental Mark IV, or possibly a Ford Thunderbird from the same era along Route 18 near where she was last seen later that night. It was described as having rust around its wheel wells.[28]

In September 2017, the FBI announced that its Child Abduction Rapid Deployment (CARD) team was in Cleveland County to assist in the investigation and ""provide on-the-ground investigative, technical, behavioral analysis, and analytical support to find out more about what happened to Asha"". The team worked alongside FBI Charlotte employees, Cleveland County Sheriff's Office investigators, and North Carolina State Bureau of Investigation agents for ten days.[29] The agencies also meet ""several times a month to go over the latest on the investigation."" Since September 2017, local agents and investigators have conducted approximately 300 interviews.[30]

In October 2018, the Cleveland County Sheriff's Office detectives appealed for information from the public about two items of interest that were found in Degree's bookbag: McElligot's Pool, a children's book by Dr. Seuss, which was borrowed from the Fallston Middle School library in early 2000, and a New Kids on the Block concert T-shirt.[1] An investigator said the items are ""critical to solving [the case]"".[31][32]

Luxury yachts offer pirate hunting cruises

Luxury ocean liners in Russia are offering pirate hunting cruises aboard armed private yachts off the Somali coast.

Wealthy punters pay £3,500 per day to patrol the most dangerous waters in the world hoping to be attacked by raiders.

When attacked, they retaliate with grenade launchers, machine guns and rocket launchers, reports Austrian business paper Wirtschaftsblatt.

Passengers, who can pay an extra £5 a day for an AK-47 machine gun and £7 for 100 rounds of ammo, are also protected by a squad of ex special forces troops.

The yachts travel from Djibouti in Somalia to Mombasa in Kenya.

The ships deliberately cruise close to the coast at a speed of just five nautical miles in an attempt to attract the interest of pirates.

""They are worse than the pirates,"" said Russian yachtsman Vladimir Mironov. ""At least the pirates have the decency to take hostages, these people are just paying to commit murder,"" he continued."

After waiting over two hours for law enforcement to show up, 5 sheriff cars arrived on scene and said they were given the wrong coordinates and had tried to return Lewis Arthur’s phone call but was not able to reach him. Arthur confirmed that his phone had died. The sheriff’s office was flooded with phone calls with each caller giving different coordinates.

A map posted to the Veterans’ page shows that the skull was found up the road on the side of the highway from what they claim is the site of the bunker that they previously found, which some reports say was demolished by black vans.

By any estimate, the skull was found well within the borders of what constitutes the suspected child-trafficking area in Tucson.

We will continue to provide updates as law enforcement and witnesses make more information available.

“Border Patrol doesn’t want to touch this body,” Arthur stated during a live feed while waiting for law enforcement to arrive. “Yes, we do have a child’s body found. There are other bones scattered out in this area,” “You can see where it’s decomposing. You can smell the death on it.”

Arthur told his crew to continue calling 911. “Get the sheriff’s department or someone that’s going to come take over the scene. We have a spot that we need to get to fast that we believe is tied to this, and we don’t trust them at all at this point. We do not trust them because of what they did at the last camp, because of how they left us hanging for 5 days.”

Veterans on Patrol handed the scene over to the sheriff’s department and jumped in the car to head to the next location. “We will just wait and see what the sheriff’s find there” Arthur said.

On the way to the next scene Arthur started a 3min live feed and posted it on the VOP Alpha Co.-Team Pulaski Facebook page.

“Border Patrol just driving by, not giving a sh*t, leaving these guys out here–well you’re just gonna have to call them (sheriff’s office)-Well, what if our guys had dead phones? They’d be out searching in the desert for hours? We had like three people who had dead phones because the heat drains their battery down.”

Arthur went on to describe the gruesome scene: “It’s going to be recent somewhat, sh*t in the desert decomposes real fast. If you can still smell and see the juices and stuff and look underground at the spinal cord was and you can kinda look inside and still see this child is decomposing, but it’s rapidly decomposing.”

Arthur continued:“They make more money off kids than they do drugs. That’s a fact, literally. They make more money off kids and human trafficking than they do the dope, cause the government gets about 60% of their dope take. Just saying.”

They then concluded the live feed by saying they were on their way to the next site and would check back in shortly.

The story continues to develop.

Last week, the Tuscon branch of Veterans on Patrol found a mysterious tunnel near 1-19 and Valencia while scouring the area for homeless veterans.

“Louis Arthur is from the Veterans on Patrol group,” local KOLD13 news reported. “They search washes and bridges looking for homeless vets they can help get off the streets.”

On June 1, the group stumbled upon the bunker.

“I didn’t expect to find something this heinous and inhumane this close,” said Craig Sawyer, a former Navy SEAL and member of the group.

The group found restraints on trees, hair dye, children’s items and pornographic magazines.

After alerting local and federal law enforcement about the situation and receiving no help, the group rallied local volunteers together to physically dig up the site. Veterans on Patrol has amassed a groundswell of support, and has vowed to keep the uncooperative law enforcement entities out of the site while they conduct a private investigation. They are hopeful to bring cadaver dogs on site to search the area.

The local news media has stopped reporting on the group’s activities.

The situation came to a head this afternoon when, according to the group, they dug up a bloody knife, female underwear, and the plane ticket of a potentially missing girl from Seattle. The group is trying to contact the girl’s family for verification. They filmed the finding live on Facebook, and shortly thereafter, the police showed up and arrested two members of the group for trespassing."

The investigation has also revealed that no midwife by that name ever existed and later on worked in maternity ward at the University Teaching Hospitals.

The General Nursing Council of Zambia has instituted investigations into social media reports alleging that close to 5,000 babies were swapped in the maternity ward at the UTH between 1983 and 1995.

Elizabeth Bwalya Mwewa, alleged to have been a midwife and currently in hospital is quoted in a report that has gone viral on Social media that she swapped over 5000 babies between 1983 and 1995.

GNC Manager Regulation and Compliance and Spokesperson Thom Yung’ana said the investigation into the matter will help to verify the authenticity of the report and has called for calm among stakeholders as investigations continue in the matter.

During this week reports emerged online that a dying nurse has begged God for forgiveness while confessing that she swapped thousands of babies while she was working as a nurse at UTH.

Elizabeth Mwewa, a nurse who worked at University Teaching Hospital, formerly called Lusaka Hospital, in Lusaka, Zambia, confessed on her sick bed that she exchanged the babies of thousands of new mothers while she worked at the maternity ward of UTH.

Elizabeth Bwalya Mwewa now suffers from cancer and, as she lay on her sickbed, she confessed to all her crimes.

She said on Monday: “May God Forgive me for my sins.”

She added: “I used to swap babies at UTH for fun.”

She continued: “I have terminal cancer and I know I will be dying soon. I wish to confess my sins before God and before all the affected people especially those who were giving birth at UTH during my service. I have found God. I’m now born again. I have nothing to hide, In the 12 years I worked in the maternity ward at UTH, I swapped close to 5000 babies.

“If you were born in UTH between the years 1983 to 1995 chances are your parents may not be your biological parents. I had developed a habit of swapping newly born babies just for fun. So take a good look at your siblings, if for example everyone is light and you are darkie… you are that child and I am really sorry for that.

“I know I sinned against God and may he forgive me for that. I am also asking Zambians to forgive me for the evil things I was doing to innocent children.

“I have caused some faithful couples to divorce after going for DNA Tests. It’s now that I have realised I was just being used by a demon to do that. I have caused many mothers to breastfeed children who are not theirs biologically.

“I don’t want to go to Hell for that, I’m really sorry I have sinned a lot.

Hayworth, he’s facing the prospect of the end of his career once again.

This time, it’s against a state senator who’s perfectly content with grifting votes at a Donald Trump rally. McCain’s seat has been targeted by conservative groups for years now to no avail, but this time, it’s a fair question to ask if McCain’s heart is in it anymore. And even if it is: Does anyone even care?

IT’S ABOUT TIME!

McCain went from being the leader of the party in 2008 to the poster boy for RINOism almost immediately after, and the right wing was emboldened by his loss to blame his — and later, Mitt Romney’s — perceived lack of conservatism for the party’s failure to keep Barack Obama out of the White House. Over the past couple of years he’s been at the forefront of a very public argument with ultraconservatives like Senators Ted Cruz, Mike Lee, and Rand Paul for control of the party, and McCain’s tendency to work with Democrats on a few different issues have made him the right wing’s biggest internal enemy. Even McCain’s military career has, however cynically, come into question of late. Back in July, Donald Trump insulted John McCain by saying he “liked people who weren’t captured,” a reference to McCain being a prisoner of war for five-and-a-half years in Vietnam. Bill Kristol swore that this would eventually kill Trump’s insurgent campaign, and the political press questioned whether or not Trump had finally gone too far. Five months later, he’s still here, and still dominating in the polls. Not driving the surveying for president, adventitiously, is Senator Lindsey Graham, whom McCain embraced to run basically a similar crusade he did in 2008. Graham, a remote approach peddle who has demonstrated an ability to bargain with Democrats on issues, for example, environmental change and migration, didn’t take part in a solitary one of the fundamental GOP faces off regarding, and surveyed with a fourth of the help that Mike Huckabee has before dropping out of the race in mid-December.

That’s right: according to the FDA, Frosted Flakes are healthier than avocados!

The system by which it classifies food as healthy or unhealthy is very basic and outdated. It suggests that foods that have low amounts of sodium, fat and cholesterol, along with some “beneficial nutrients,” are considered healthy, without bothering to distinguish between unsaturated and saturated fats.

This is extremely misguided to say the least, as the source of a fat is a big consideration when it comes to health. In addition, food that was formed naturally is a lot healthier than its chemically engineered counterparts.

According to the FDA’s definition, avocados are not considered healthy because 1 ounce contains 4.5 grams of fat. It doesn’t matter to them that it is the “good” type of fat. Likewise, almonds, with their 14 grams of fat per ounce, and salmon, with its 11 grams of fat per 3-ounce serving, are also considered unhealthy foods despite their well-documented health benefits.

Pop Tarts, Spaghetti-Os and Frosted Flakes are better than salmon and almonds?

On the other hand, some of the foods that make the cut according to their criteria are absolutely laughable. We’ve already discussed Frosted Flakes, which the agency deems healthy because it has 0 grams of fat per serving, is low in cholesterol and sodium, and has some “beneficial ingredients.” Somehow the fact that it has 10 grams of sugar per serving doesn’t matter.

Spaghetti-Os with calcium do not even remotely resemble anything found in nature, yet they are considered healthy because they only contain 1 gram of fat per serving. The highly artificial Low-fat Pop Tarts are also considered healthy because they are low in fat.

Is Big Food money ensuring labels are kept intentionally vague?

The FDA’s guidelines leave anyone with a half a brain wondering whether the agency is highly corrupt or just incompetent. It’s hard to rationalize their actions, but many people have speculated that Big Food money is influencing the FDA

The FDA’s delusion hit a fever pitch when it attacked the Kind food company for calling its bars, which are full of antioxidants, healthy. Their essential fatty acids, while not bad, push their fat content over the outdated limit. In the wake of this mess, the agency admitted its definitions were outdated, and said they would redefine the term for the first time in two decades. However, many believe their new definition will be written in such a way that a number of Big Food products will still be able to somehow qualify as healthy even if they are not. In addition, any changes could take years to be put in place because there will likely be hearings and proposals.

If you want to eat healthy food, you simply cannot rely on the FDA and Big Food companies to be honest about what is inside the products you buy in the store. Regardless of what the FDA says, naturally grown food is always the best choice. Nevertheless, it’s important to keep in mind that much of the produce you find in your grocery store has been sprayed with toxic pesticides. You can take matters into your own hands and know beyond a shadow of a doubt that what you are eating is completely natural by growing it yourself

Wednesday, Sept. 23, 2015: Police shoot man in wheelchair, say he was armed

At about 3 p.m., Wilmington police officers responded to reports of a man in a wheelchair with a self-inflicted gunshot wound.

A woman called 911 saying she heard two gunshots near the rear of an AutoZone at 1810 Lancaster Ave., according to an investigative report released Thursday by the state Department of Justice.

The woman who made the 911 call flagged responding officers down and pointed to Jeremy ""Bam” McDole saying, “He’s right there. He’s still got a gun.""

Two other officers soon arrived and encountered a civilian shouting about someone having a firearm, the report said. McDole, 28, was in a wheelchair, which he had used since being shot when he was 18.

Video taken on a bystander’s cell phone as McDole was confronted shows Wilmington police officers, guns drawn, telling him to raise his hands in the air and receiving no compliance. A single shot can be heard but it’s unclear from the footage if McDole was hit.

The officers — identified in the DOJ report as Senior Cpl. Danny Silva, Senior Cpl. Joseph Dellose, Cpl. Thomas Lynch and Cpl. James MacColl — continue to advance, all the while demanding a show of submission through raised hands. Instead, McDole moves his legs with his arms to adjust himself in his seat before he reaches into his pocket.

Officers order McDole to “drop the gun” and continue ordering him to raise his hands. McDole repositions himself in his wheelchair and moves his hands onto the armrests. Less than a minute passes between the shotgun blast and the other three officers firing their weapons and killing McDole.

An officer recovered an Armscor .38-caliber revolver with four spent and two unspent rounds, according to the DOJ report. The U.S. Bureau of Alcohol, Tobacco, Firearms and Explosives determined the weapon was legally purchased in South Carolina in 2009 but was stolen from a truck from the last known owner, the report said.

McDole’s body laid in the street for hours after the incident, draped in a white sheet and near the wheelchair he collapsed out of after being shot by four police officers. That’s how family and friends found the scene at the intersection of Tulip and Scott streets.

They shouted down police Chief Bobby Cummings, who attempted to explain the situation to them and quiet their visible distress. A handful of family members crossed the police tape perimeter to approach McDole before officers turned them back. Police had to ask a man laughing as the group mourned and protested to leave the scene after family charged at him.

WARNING: Graphic video

Thursday, Sept. 24, 2015: Family disputes police, says McDole had no gun

Police said they found a .38-caliber pistol at the scene, though family members said the weapon was planted to absolve the shooters.

McDole’s mother, Phyllis, said her son did not have a weapon and would never harm himself. Relatives gathered later at McDole’s mother’s home on North Rodney Street where they disputed the police account.

“He wasn’t bothering anybody. He didn’t have a weapon or anything,” said Phyllis McDole. “He stood up and pulled his pants up and sat back down and put his hands on his lap and they opened fire on him.”

She said her son was a happy man who loved spending time with family, especially his nephew.

“I raised my son to be a good kid,” she said. “He wasn’t a troublemaker. Every day he came here at 12 o’clock and took his nephew to the store to get water ice. What am I supposed to tell his nephew tomorrow when he doesn’t come to take him to get a water ice?”

New Castle County Councilman Jae Street called the situation “potentially explosive” and wrote a letter to U.S. Attorney General Loretta Lynch to investigate the McDole killing. He also criticized the way policing is done in Wilmington, and concerns like his still are being discussed from street corners to mayoral debates.

""Community policing, under my definition right now, doesn't exist,"" Street said in the wake of McDole’s death and the nearly-riotous reaction of residents. ""Community policing requires continuity of officers and interaction out of the car with the residents. We don't have that.""

Thursday, Sept. 27, 2015: Wilmington starts to rally

Community activists called on the state’s attorney general to file charges against the officers involved. Their races now known to the public, the killing quickly take on racial overtones consistent with more than two years of flare ups across the country in which black men are shot and killed by police.

A shooting in West Center City saw more than 300 people pour from their homes to confront officers on the scene. Police tried to push them back to establish a larger perimeter but instead were pelted with rocks and bottles. Three people were arrested.

Just a few hours after that when officers armed with shotguns came to search a home near Jeremy McDole's mother’s house, neighbors mocked them from their stoops chanting “Hands up, hands up!”

Monday, Sept. 28, 2015: Mother of man shot in wheelchair arrested

Phyllis McDole was arrested and charged with assault and threatening a woman she believed placed a 911 call saying a man had shot himself.

Police say McDole, accompanied by five unidentified people, three women and two men, went to the woman’s home on Lancaster Avenue Friday between 7:30 and 8 p.m., punching and threatening the woman after she answered the front door.

According to court documents, as McDole punched the resident, she said, “Bitch, you got my son killed. You are the one that called the cops. You got my son shot and you gonna die like my son died.”

Police said the victim assaulted was not the woman who made the 911 call on the day her son was shot. The woman suffered two black eyes, a small scratch, swelling on her hand and a cut lip.

Wednesday, Oct. 14, 2015: Family prepares for legal battle

The McDole family retained the Baltimore attorney that represented the family of Freddie Gray, a Baltimore man who died after suffering injuries in police custody on April 19, 2015. William H. “Billy” Murphy Jr. won a $6.9 million settlement last month for the Gray family. Murph says he hopes to bring justice to the family.

Friday, Oct. 30, 2015: Jeremy McDole's family leads march, rally in Wilmington

As friends and family of Jeremy McDole marched down the middle of the streets from Wilmington’s West Side and into Rodney Square, officers from the Wilmington Police Department guided the way, blocking traffic along the route.

“No Justice, no peace, no racist police,” the group of about 50 chanted as they snaked from Fourth and Adams streets to Orange Street and into Rodney Square, carrying balloons and donning spray-painted red and black apparel emblazoned with the phrase “Justice for Bam.”

Despite their message, police watched on. The two groups didn’t interact and the wish that the march and rally stay peaceful proved true.

The October march was the first of several. By December, the family was calling for Cummings’ resignation. It conducted a traffic-blocking sit-in on Market Street in January.

Thursday, March 3: McDole family sues Wilmington over fatal police shooting

The grandmother and mother of Jeremy McDole sue the city of Wilmington, alleging that the deadly police shooting in September was prompted by racial discrimination and would not have happened had McDole been white.

""Before using deadly force, Jeremy McDole should have been talked down by a properly trained professional before a cowboy mentality seeped into police work,"" said the lawsuit filed in Superior Court in Wilmington.

Both the city police and Attorney General Matt Denn’s office assured the public that they are investigating the shooting, but one of the attorneys representing the McDole family said it has been too long with no word.

“It has been five months,” said attorney Thomas C. Crumplar. “The family just cannot wait. We still don’t even know the names"" of the officers.

A spokesman for Denn's office said investigations of police use of force have taken on average 9½ months since January 2010.

""The Department of Justice believes a thorough investigation of the death of Jeremy McDole is important for the family and for the community,"" spokesman Carl Kanefsky said. ""That investigation remains active and underway and is expected to be completed in the near future.""

Later the same month, the city of Wilmington transferred the lawsuit from state court to federal court.

Friday, April 29: Court documents: McDole had gunshot residue on hand

Medical evidence revealed in a recent court filing says Jeremy McDole had gunshot residue on his hand and clothing when he was fatally shot by Wilmington police last fall – the first piece of information released since the incident to refute the family's claim that McDole was not armed.

A Division of Forensic Science analysis found residue on the right palm and right shirt sleeve, according to a court affidavit signed by Wilmington police Detective George Pigforrd. The residue is consistent with that left on a person after firing a weapon and matches the DNA profile of McDole, the court documents said.

The new court documents also identify for the first time the four officers involved in the incident. All four were on paid administrative leave.

On May 4, the Wilmington NAACP chapter called on state officials to shed more light on the death.

Wilmington police announced May 3 they'd completed the investigation, but did not elaborate on the findings.

Thursday, May 12: Police officers in McDole shooting not charged

The four Wilmington police officers were cleared in the shooting of Jeremy McDole, according to a report from the state Department of Justice.

But the report, which found ""serious deficiencies"" in how Wilmington police prepares its force for such incidents, said prosecutors considered filing a felony assault charge against one of the officers involved – Dellose, who in a cellphone video that surfaced after the Sept. 23 incident was seen firing a shotgun at Jeremy McDole . Prosecutors considered the charge based on how Dellose immediately confronted him rather than communicating with officers who were already on the scene and how he discharged his shotgun.

""Although [the Department of Justice] is not able to pursue criminal charges against Senior Cpl. Dellose, it is DOJ's position that Senior Cpl. Dellose's conduct in this case was extraordinarily poor police work that endangered both the public and his fellow officers,"" the 31-page report said. ""DOJ does not believe that Senior Cpl. Dellose should be employed by the Wilmington Police Department in any role where he would be carrying a firearm in public.""

Friday, May 13: AG's McDole report to help in federal civil suit

Wilmington Attorney Thomas S. Neuberger, who represents Jeremy McDole's family, said the report issued by the state Attorney General's Office would help in his federal civil case.

Calling the report ""historic"" and ""unprecedented"" because of the information it provided, Neuberger said it included portions of interviews with the shooting officers explaining what they saw on Sept. 23 that caused them to fire at McDole. Some of those interviews, Neuberger said, contradict what is seen in a cellphone video that was modified by the FBI and provided in the report issued by Attorney General Matt Denn's office.

""Instead of closing off the investigation, Denn ... goes on and helps us make the civil case for us,"" Neuberger said.

Friday, May 20: Confrontation marks McDole rally in Wilmington

A march to protest the shooting of 28-year-old Jeremy McDole by four Wilmington police officers, and the decision by the state Attorney General's Office to not prosecute the officers, threatened to explode when police blocked protesters from continuing to march on Market Street toward Rodney Square where children were participating in the annual Tennis in the Streets program.

Officers, some who had been escorting marchers along the rally, confronted the protesters at Ninth and Market streets, instructing them to head down Ninth Street. When protesters insisted they wanted to continue on Market Street, additional officers arrived and stood shoulder-to-shoulder preventing protesters access to the 900 block of Market Street. A group of officers on motorcycles lined behind them, and at least one officer farther down the block was holding a teargas gun.

Protesters continued to insult and yell at officers. Many pulled out cellphones and videoed the impasse.

About 20 minutes later, protesters turned east onto Ninth Street.

Tuesday, July 26: Phyllis McDole, mother of man shot by police, accepts plea deal

Jeremy McDole's mother, Phyllis, accepted plea deal in connection with the assault of a woman she believed placed the 911 call that eventually led to her son's death.

McDole, 49, pleaded guilty July 26 to third-degree burglary. The state dropped additional charges for conspiracy, terroristic threats and assault in exchange for her plea.

In October, she was sentenced to 45 days in prison, to be followed by 6 months of home confinement and a year of probation. She also was ordered to have no contact with the victim, to take her medications as prescribed and to comply with all recommended substance abuse and mental health treatment.

She recently violated her probation and was being detained at Baylor Women's Correctional Institution. She has a violation of probation hearing scheduled for 9 a.m. Thursday.

Monday, Sept. 19: Man who took McDole video claims he was never interviewed

Nate Wilson, the man who captured Jeremy McDole's fatal shooting on his cellphone camera, said in court documents for a civil suit that he was not interviewed by police investigating the incident. But a report issued earlier in the year, about the four Wilmington officers who shot McDole, indicate Wilson was interviewed by investigators with the state Department of Justice.

In an affidavit filed Sept. 19 with U.S. District Court in Wilmington, Wilson said he was at work detailing a car when he heard two shots and ducked into the vehicle he'd been working on ""to avoid being hit because I didn't know where the shots were coming from.""

Friday, Dec. 16: City pays $1.5 million to settle lawsuit with McDole family

The city of Wilmington has agreed to pay $1.5 million to settle a lawsuit brought by the family of Jeremy ""Bam"" McDole, a man in a wheelchair who was fatally shot by four police officers in September of 2015.

As part of the agreement, Wilmington police will consider a comprehensive use of force policy that will outline when force is appropriate and train officers in de-escalation procedures.

""If this isn't a piecrust promise but this is something that's going to come into being ... then Jeremy would not have died in vain,"" said Wilmington Attorney Thomas S. Neuberger, who represents McDole's family. ""And members of the minority community and poor people in Wilmington, as well as throughout the state, will enjoy enhanced protections when they encounter police.""

Friday, Jan. 6: No federal charges in cop shooting of McDole

Federal authorities concluded there is no evidence that four Wilmington officers ""willfully used excessive force"" in the 2015 fatal shooting of Jeremy ""Bam"" McDole.

Because of that, the U.S. Department of Justice said on Friday it would not pursue federal criminal civil rights charges against Wilmington police Senior Cpl. Danny Silva, Cpl. Thomas Lynch, Cpl. James MacColl or Senior Cpl. Joseph Dellose. The announcement came as a blow to the McDole family, which has been seeking a criminal indictment against the officers, said Thomas S. Neuberger, one of the attorneys representing McDole's family.

""The family strongly disagrees and are greatly disappointed with the conclusions and still feels a criminal prosecution would be warranted,"" Neuberger said."

Officials from the U.S. Attorney’s Office of the District of Delaware, the Justice Department’s Civil Rights Division and the FBI met today with representatives of the McDole family to inform them of this determination. The department makes this decision based on the determination that the evidence does not indicate that the corporals willfully used excessive force in shooting McDole.

Federal authorities devoted significant time and resources to reviewing the events surrounding McDole’s death. This involved reviewing detailed and lengthy analysis of voluminous materials, including police reports, law enforcement accounts, witness statements, dispatch logs, physical evidence reports, the autopsy report and an enhanced cell phone video of the incident.

The team of experienced federal prosecutors from the Civil Rights Division Criminal Section and the U.S. Attorney’s Office reviewed thousands of pages of documents and other evidence to determine whether the subject corporals violated federal law. Under the applicable federal criminal civil rights statute, prosecutors must establish, beyond a reasonable doubt, that a law enforcement officer willfully deprived an individual of a Constitutional right. To establish willfulness, federal authorities must show that the officer acted with the deliberate and specific intent to do something the law forbids. This is the highest standard of intent imposed by law. Mistake, misperception, negligence or poor judgment are not sufficient to establish a federal criminal civil rights violation.

The evidence developed during the investigation revealed that corporals Thomas Silva, James MacColl, Thomas Lynch and Joseph Dellose were dispatched pursuant to a 911 call reporting that a male suspect in a wheelchair, later identified as McDole, was armed with a handgun and may have sustained self-inflicted gunshot wounds. Silva arrived first at the scene, and the 911-caller pointed out McDole and said McDole was still in possession of a gun. Silva commanded McDole to show his hands and drop the gun, but McDole instead rolled his wheelchair into the street and reached into his waistband. MacColl arrived next and saw that McDole was not responding to Silva’s commands. Dellose arrived and immediately approached McDole from the opposite direction of Silva and MacColl. Dellose also ordered McDole to show his hands; however, McDole continued to reach into his waistband. Dellose stated that he observed the handle of a gun, so he fired a round at McDole from his shotgun. Lynch arrived immediately after Dellose fired.

After the shotgun blast, McDole continued moving his hands around his lap and waistband. McDole then reached into the right side of his waistband as if to grab something and began withdrawing his right hand, in which he held what the corporals believed to be a handgun. Silva, MacColl and Lynch each fired four shots at McDole from their service pistols. McDole fell to the ground and a responding officer approached him and removed from his waistband a handgun.

The incident was recorded in a cell phone video, which was enhanced at the FBI Laboratory. The video shows McDole continuously moving his hands around his waistband as WPD officers yell for him to show his hands and drop the gun. The camera pans away from McDole the instant before the shotgun blast. Toward the end of the video, McDole reaches into his waistband with his right hand, then begins pulling his right hand upward. A volley of shots is heard, but the camera pans away from McDole for a moment while the shots are being fired. Several law enforcement officers and civilians witnessed the shooting and the events leading up to it. These witnesses corroborated the claim of the corporals who fired at McDole that McDole failed to respond to law enforcement commands and continued moving his hands around his waistband when the shots were fired. The investigation also revealed that McDole’s DNA was located on the grip of the handgun recovered from his waistband and that there was gunshot residue was on McDole’s right palm and shirt sleeve.

There is insufficient evidence to disprove the corporals’ claims that they shot McDole in self-defense and in defense of nearby civilians and fellow officers. Other witnesses also corroborate Dellose’s claim that McDole was reaching into his side immediately before Dellose fired his shotgun, even though the video does not capture that precise moment. Accordingly, the government cannot disprove that Dellose saw a handgun or believed he saw a handgun. When Silva, MacColl and Lynch fired their weapons a few moments later, they had reason to believe that McDole had a gun that he had recently fired. They also knew that McDole had not responded to repeated commands to show his hands and drop the gun, was reaching into his waistband and was at that moment pulling his hand upward. The testimonial, video and physical evidence corroborates the corporals’ version of the events.

Accordingly, after extensive investigation into this incident, the federal review of this incident has been closed without prosecution. This decision is limited strictly to an application of the high legal standard required to prosecute the case under the federal civil rights statute; it does not reflect an assessment of any other aspect of the incident that led to McDole’s death.

The guidelines, listed under the California Department of Education’s proposed Health Education Framework, include educational resources that teach children to reject gender stereotypes and embrace a rainbow of possible gender options. One recommended book called “Who Are You?” teaches that there are at least 15 genders, and that it’s impossible to determine whether a baby is a boy, a girl or something else.

“Babies can’t talk, so grown-ups make a guess by looking at their bodies,” an excerpt reads.

One chapter in the proposed guidelines offers suggestions on how to explain sexuality with kindergartners.

“Discuss gender with kindergarteners by exploring gender stereotypes and asking open-ended questions, such as what are preferred colors, toys, and activities for boys/girls, and then challenging stereotypes if presented,” chapter three reads. “Throughout this discussion, show images of children around the same age who do not conform to typical gender stereotypes. Examples do not have to be exaggerated or overt. Simple differences, such as colors or toy preferences, can demonstrate acceptance of gender non-conformity.”

What about parents who would prefer that their children not be exposed to errant gender ideology? Unfortunately, there would be no opt-out option.

Brenda Lebsack, a writer for EdSource.org, first called attention to the proposed guidelines back in December. Lebsack, who has been a public educator for 20 years, is also a member of the Orange Unified School District board of education in Orange County.

“Since few people will read the nearly 1,000-page draft, which unfortunately is only available in English, I am sharing below some examples that parents and educators may be especially interested in,” she wrote. “Because the California Department of Education is inviting public comment on the draft, I urge all California residents to review the framework and provide input.”

Lebsack highlights several problematic chapters in the new guidelines. Chapter five, for example, includes this tip for discuss sexuality with seventh and eighth graders:

“Some students may be non-monogamous and the term ‘partner(s)’ may be used to be more inclusive,” it reads.

Polyamory, defined as “the practice of, desire to, or orientation toward having consensual non-monogamous relationships (i.e. relationships that may include multiple partners)” and “polyfidelity (which involves more than two people being in romantic and/or sexual relationships which is not open to additional partners), amongst many other set-ups” are discussed as just two of many acceptable options for young people.

Lebsack notes that many of the terms described in the middle and high school resources will be unfamiliar to parents, adding that “many of them are not in the English dictionary.” Despite this, parents won’t be able to choose whether or not their children receive these questionable teachings.

“While parents may assume they can opt out of this instruction, as they can with sexual health education and HIV prevention, this simply is not true,” she writes. “Instruction about gender or sexual orientations that is implemented through the adoption of the framework is exempted from parent notification and opt out requirements (California Education Code 51932b). According to The California Safe School Coalition, state law provides that ‘instruction or materials that discuss gender, sexual orientation, or family life and do not discuss human reproductive organs and their functions’ are not subject to parental notice and opt-out laws.”

Lebsack noted that if passed, the guidelines could be “disastrous” for school districts like Orange, which is already “facing declining enrollment and teacher layoffs.” She noted the real possibility that parents could remove their children from the public school system, “or even leave the state.”

The State Board of Education will vote on the 2019 guidelines in May."	15 Genders?

The Stamford Advocate reports:



A homeless woman from Bridgeport who enrolled her 6-year-old son at a Norwalk elementary school has become the first in the city to be charged with stealing more than $15,000 for the cost of her child's education.

Tanya McDowell, 33, whose last known address was 66 Priscilla St., Bridgeport, was charged Thursday with first-degree larceny and conspiracy to commit first-degree larceny for allegedly stealing $15,686 from Norwalk schools. She was released after posting a $25,000 bond.

McDowell's babysitter, Ana Rebecca Marques, was also evicted from her Roodner Court public housing apartment for providing documents to enroll the child at Brookside Elementary School.

According to the story, McDowell was primarily sleeping at a home in a different city, although she could not be there during the days, and also spent time at a local shelter. The boy went to the sitter's house daily after school.



An argument could be made that as they had no permanent home, there is no reason why the babysitter's house isn't a place of residence, as it was a place he went to daily and had more permanence than their other living situations appeared to. However, the school disagreed and decided after an investigation to press charges against the mother, claiming theft.



The Chair of the board of education admits the move is unusual -- normally a child found attending school out of district is just sent away. Others are speculating why this case became the case that the district appears to be interested in using to ""set an example"" in order to discourage other parents from attempting to send their children to school with false addresses, especially since the mother obviously has no ability to pay for the ""theft."" A lawyer involved in a similar case wonders why they wouldn't choose to go after someone where they may have a chance to get reimbursement back for the educational costs while making their point.



Could it be that the district is less concerned about sending a general example and more concerned about sending one geared to a specific audience? Like, for example, the low-income and homeless in the area?

Mayor Richard Moccia said of the case,

""This now sends a message to other parents that may have been living in other towns and registering their kids with phony addresses.""

In a letter to President Trump and Office of Management and Budget (OMB) Acting Director Mark Sandy, Senators Reed, Collins and 43 of their colleagues noted the bipartisan support behind both LIHEAP and WAP and described the critical role both programs play in providing vulnerable populations and low-income households with affordable home energy.

“LIHEAP helps low-income households, veterans, and seniors with their energy bills, providing an indispensable lifeline during both the cold winters and hot summer months,” the Senators wrote. “More than 90 percent of LIHEAP recipients have at least one household member who is a child, elderly, or disabled, and the percentage of households with at least one veteran has grown to 20 percent. The program helps to ensure that eligible recipients do not have to choose between paying their energy bills and affording other necessities like food and medicine.”

Preserving LIHEAP funding is a perennial bipartisan priority for Reed and Collins, who in recent years have worked together to prevent any funding cuts to the program. The current funding level for LIHEAP is able to serve less than 20 percent of the eligible population and that those who receive LIHEAP assistance have seen their average grant significantly reduced.

In FY 2016, Rhode Island households received over $26 million in LIHEAP funding, as part of $3.01 billion in total LIHEAP funds provided to states. Last October, Reed helped secure funding under the FY 2017 Continuing Resolution (CR), totaling over $3 billion nationally for LIHEAP and $22.49 million for Rhode Island.

The letter also emphasizes the importance of the Weatherization Assistance Program, which has helped reduce the burden of high energy prices for more than forty years by helping low-income families, seniors, and individuals with disabilities make necessary energy efficient improvements to their homes. Rhode Island households received nearly $1.1 million in WAP funds for FY 2016 as part of over $213 million allocated to states. Since 1990, Rhode Island has used WAP funds to successfully weatherize more than 13,250 low-income homes and rental units, according to the U.S. Department of Energy (DOE). The DOE also notes that WAP helps eligible Rhode Island families reduce annual energy bills by an average of $264.

“By supporting lasting and cost-effective home energy efficiency improvements for low-income families, seniors, and individuals with disabilities, WAP is increasing the energy efficiency of dwellings, reducing residential energy bills, improving the health and safety of our most vulnerable citizens, and helping to lower the need for short-term assistance,” the letter reads.

“LIHEAP and WAP are vital programs that help thousands of Rhode Islanders stay safe and help improve the energy efficiency of their homes through the coldest winters and the hottest summers,” said Senator Reed, the Ranking Member of the Transportation, Housing and Urban Development (THUD) Appropriations Subcommittee. “We need robust funding for both programs to ensure vulnerable populations don’t have to choose between paying high energy bills and paying for food, medicine, and other necessities.”

Other Senators who signed the letter include Tammy Baldwin (D-WI), Michael Bennet (D-CO), Richard Blumenthal (D-CT), Cory Booker (D-NJ), Maria Cantwell (D-WA), Sherrod Brown (D-OH), Ben Cardin (D-MD), Tom Carper (D-DE), Bob Casey (D-PA), Chris Coons (D-DE), Joe Donnelly (D-IN), Dick Durbin (D-IL), Dianne Feinstein (D-CA), Al Franken (D-MN), Kristin Gillibrand (D-NY), Martin Heinrich (D-NM), Heidi Heitkamp (D-ND), Mazie Hirono (D-HI), Tim Kaine (D-VA), Angus King (I-ME), Amy Klobuchar (D-MN), Patrick Leahy (D-VT), Joe Manchin (D-WV), Ed Markey (D-MA), Bob Menendez (D-NJ), Jeff Merkley (D-OR), Lisa Murkowski (R-AK), Chris Murphy (D-CT), Patty Murray (D-WA), Bill Nelson (D-FL), Gary Peters (D-MI), Brian Schatz (D-HI), Jeanne Shaheen (D-NH), Debbie Stabenow (D-MI), Jon Tester (D-MT), Tom Udall (D-NM), Mark Warner (D-VA), Elizabeth Warren (D-MA), Sheldon Whitehouse (D-RI), Ron Wyden (D-OR), Tammy Duckworth (D-IL), Maggie Hassan (D-NH), and Chris Van Hollen (D-MD).

The full text of the letter is below:

The President

The White House

1600 Pennsylvania Avenue, N.W.

Washington, D.C. 20500

Dear Mr. President:

We write in support of two successful federal programs, the Low Income Home Energy Assistance Program (LIHEAP) and the Weatherization Assistance Program (WAP), that are currently helping to meet the energy needs of eligible low-income households across the country. Access to affordable home energy is a matter of health and safety for many low-income households, children, veterans, and seniors. LIHEAP and WAP have enjoyed bipartisan support, and we hope that you will prioritize funding for both programs in your fiscal year 2018 budget proposal.

LIHEAP helps low-income households, veterans, and seniors with their energy bills, providing an indispensable lifeline during both the cold winters and hot summer months. More than 90 percent of LIHEAP recipients have at least one household member who is a child, elderly, or disabled, and the percentage of households with at least one veteran has grown to 20 percent. The program helps to ensure that eligible recipients do not have to choose between paying their energy bills and affording other necessities like food and medicine. This is especially important during the peak winter heating and summer cooling seasons, when energy bills can comprise roughly 30 percent of a low-income household’s monthly income. Sadly, though, the number of households eligible for LIHEAP assistance continues to exceed the program’s capacity.

The Weatherization Assistance Program is another key initiative, which for 40 years has helped to reduce more permanently the burden of high home energy prices for over 7.4 million low-income households. By supporting lasting and cost-effective home energy efficiency improvements for low-income families, seniors, and individuals with disabilities, WAP is increasing the energy efficiency of dwellings, reducing residential energy bills, improving the health and safety of our most vulnerable citizens, and helping to lower the need for short-term assistance. WAP has been repeatedly demonstrated as cost-effective and has supported thousands of high quality, skilled jobs. A study by Oak Ridge National Laboratory found that weatherization saves eligible single-family homes on average $283 in annual energy cost savings, which benefits not only the household but the local economy.

Thank you for your attention to and consideration of this important request. We recognize the ongoing challenges facing the discretionary budget and look forward to working with you to support these vital programs and ensure access to affordable home energy for the most vulnerable households in every state.

To The Point is excited to offer the ultimate adventure cruise along the pirate-infested coast of Somalia!



We board our luxury cruise ship in Djibouti on the Gulf of Aden near the entrance to the Red Sea, and disembark in Mombassa, Kenya seven adrenaline-charged days later.











Starting at $5,200 per-person (double occupancy, inside room) and $6,900 (veranda complete with bench rest), you'll relax like never before.







That's because you are welcome to bring your own arsenal with you. If you don't have your own weapons, you can rent them from our onboard Master Gunsmith. Enjoy reloading parties every afternoon with skeet and marksmanship competitions every night!



But the best fun of all, of course, is Pirate Target Practice.



For the object of the cruise is to sail up and down the Somali Coast waiting to get hijacked by pirates. The weapons rental costs are as follows.



Rent a full auto M-16 for only $25/day with ammo attractively priced at $16 per 100 rounds of 5.56 armor-piercing:







On a budget? Rent a full-auto scope-mounted AK-47 for only $9/day with 7.62 ball ammo at $12 per 100 rounds:







Hello! Nothing gets a pirate's attention like a Barrett M-107 .50-cal sniper rifle; only $59/day with 25 rounds of armor-piercing ammo affordably priced at only $29.95.







Need a spotter? Our professional crew members can double as spotters for only $30/hour (spotting scope included, but gratuities are not.)







Want to make a real impact? Rent an RPG for only $175/day with three fragmentation rounds included!







Also included: Free complimentary night vision equipment - and throughout the night, coffee, pastries and snacks are always available on the main deck from 7pm until 6am.



Our deluxe package comes complete with gourmet meals and all rooms offer a mini-bar.



But that's not all! Twin mounted miniguns are available for rental at only $450.00 per 30 seconds of sustained fire!







We guarantee that you will experience at least two hijacking attempts by pirates or you'll receive an instant $1,000 refund upon arrival in Mombassa.



How can we make that guarantee? We operate at 5 knots just beyond 12 nautical miles off the coast of Somalia, thus in international waters where pirates have no rights whatever. In fact, we make three passes through the area's most treacherous waters to ensure maximum visibility by Somali ""mother ships"".



We repeat this for five days, making three complete passes past the entire Somali Coast. At night, the boat is fully lit and bottle rockets are shot every five minutes with loud disco music directionally beamed shoreside to attract maximum attention.

President Donald Trump loves putting his name on everything from ties to steaks to water — and, of course, his buildings. But now the Trump Organization appears to be borrowing a brand even more powerful than the gilded Trump moniker: the presidential seal.

In recent weeks, the Trump Organization has ordered the manufacture of new tee markers for golf courses that are emblazoned with the seal of the president of the United States. Under federal law, the seal’s use is permitted only for official government business. Misuse can be a crime.

Past administrations have policed usage vigilantly. In 2005 the Bush administration ordered the satirical news website The Onion to remove a replica of the seal. Grant M. Dixton, associate White House counsel, wrote in a letter to The Onion that the seal “is not to be used in connection with commercial ventures or products in any way that suggests presidential support or endorsement.”

Listen to the Podcast

After listening to the new ProPublica/WNYC podcast “Trump, Inc.,” a listener brought the signs to our attention.

Eagle Sign and Design, a metalworking and sign company with offices in New Albany, Indiana, and Louisville, Kentucky, said it had received an order to manufacture dozens of round, 12-inch replicas of the presidential seal to be placed next to the tee boxes at Trump golf course holes. Two tee markers are placed on the ground at the start of a hole on golf courses to indicate where golfers should stand to take their first swing.

“We made the design, and the client confirmed the design,” said Joseph E. Bates, who owns Eagle Sign, declining to say who the client was.

An order form for the tee markers reviewed by ProPublica and WNYC says the customer was “Trump International.” The Facebook page for Eagle Sign and Design shows a photo of the markers in an album with the caption “Trump International Golf Course.”

It is unclear how many Trump International golf courses will feature the markers. The Trump Organization owns four courses with the “International” name in the U.S. and abroad, with a fifth course in Bali, Indonesia, in the works.

Eagle Sign makes a wide array of tee markers out of bronze and aluminum, and has made other signs for Trump’s courses, according to its website. At some of Trump’s golf courses, tee markers have sported the Trump family crest, which he took from the family that originally owned Mar-a-Lago without permission and then altered by adding his own name.

Ethics experts have long been on the lookout for signs that the Trump Organization would exploit the office of the presidency for commercial gain. Several said that using the presidential seal on the company’s golf courses would fall into this category.

A law governs the manufacture or use of the seal, its likeness, “or any facsimile thereof” for anything other than official U.S. government business. It can be a criminal offense punishable by up to six months in prison.

The “law is an expression of the idea that the government and government authority should not be used for private purpose,” said Kathleen Clark, a law professor at Washington University specializing in government and legal ethics said. “It would be a misuse of government authority.”

The Department of Justice declined to comment on whether it was aware the seal had been used by entities outside the government. The White House and the Trump Organization did not respond to request for comment.

The presidential seal was first sketched out by President Millard Fillmore in 1850 and the current design — which shows a bald eagle with an olive branch in its right talon, a bundle of 13 arrows in the left, and a scroll bearing the words “E pluribus unum” in its beak — was chosen by President Truman and made official in a 1945 executive order.

The seal that adorns the president’s speaking lecterns is handmade by the Institute of Heraldry, a department of the Army located at Fort Belvoir in Virginia that designs and provides guidance related to military and governmental symbols.

Versions of the seal have occasionally been put to personal use by past presidents. George W. Bush and Barack Obama had custom sets of golf balls made with the seal. Ronald and Nancy Reagan had a set of presidential china bearing the seal, and there have even been M&M’s and jelly beans that featured the seal.

In this case, the difference is that a private company is using the seal, said Richard Painter, vice chairman of Citizens for Responsibility and Ethics in Washington, a government accountability group. Painter also served as an associate White House counsel during the George W. Bush administration.

“If we had heard of a private company using it for commercial purposes, we would have sent them a nasty letter,” he said.

NEW YORK, United States — At American discount retailer Stein Mart, Ivanka Trump apparel is being sold under the guise of a different label. BoF has learned that the Jacksonville, Florida-based chain — which has 290 stores in 31 states, everywhere from Little Rock, Arkansas to Madison, Wisconsin — is selling Ivanka Trump garments relabeled as Adrienne Vittadini Studio.

G-III, the company that owns the right to manufacture and distribute Ivanka Trump apparel through a license agreement — and also owns brands including DKNY outright — acknowledges that it sold the relabelled merchandise to Stein Mart without the knowledge of the Ivanka Trump brand. It is not known whether this inventory was also sold to other retailers.

“G-III accepts responsibility for resolving this issue, which occurred without the knowledge or consent of the Ivanka Trump organisation,” a representative for G-III said in a statement to BoF. “G-III has already begun to take corrective actions, including facilitating the immediate removal of any mistakenly labelled merchandise from its customer. The Ivanka Trump brand continues to grow and remains very strong.”

BoF has obtained photos of identical garments being sold at Stein Mart, with the only difference being the name on the label. Some say “Ivanka Trump” while others say “Adrienne Vittadini.”

Why did this happen?

Since the election of her father Donald J. Trump to the office of US president, Ivanka Trump-branded merchandise has been dropped from several prominent American retailers, most notably Nordstrom — which cited weak sales — as well as Neiman Marcus and Shoebuy.com. According to a source within Stein Mart, the retailer has received negative feedback from customers regarding Ivanka Trump product, with one customer spitting on a blouse in front of a cashier before storming out of a store.

But the motivating factors may not be that simple. Swiping labels — or simply ripping the label out completely — before a garment is sold to a discount retailer has long been commonplace. One reason is brand protection: if a brand is hot, it’s not desirable to be associated with a discounter. However, this practice occurs less often now that many major full-price retailers — such as Nordstrom, Neiman Marcus and Saks Fifth Avenue — operate their own off-price outlets, marketing the same brands they sell at full-line stores.

“US textile product labelling laws allow substitution of labels, so long as the entity making the substitution is identified on the new label and keeps records for three years,” explained Susan Scafidi, professor of fashion law at Fordham Law School and founder of the Fashion Law Institute. “This is mostly for supply chain tracking reasons. All of the other required information on the label — fibre content, country of origin, etcetera — must be maintained.”

It could be argued that G-III was simply looking to protect the Ivanka Trump brand from being associated with a discount retailer. In its 2016 fiscal year — which ended at the end of January 2017 — G-III reported that net sales of Ivanka Trump merchandise increased by $17.9 million from 2015, although the company does not break out exactly how much revenue the merchandise generated altogether.

Sales performance of G-III's Ivanka Trump merchandise for the first quarter of 2017 — and since President Trump’s inauguration — has yet to be reported, although much of the success of the brand is thought to be due to sales in China, where she is often referred to as a “goddess” on social media. G-III does not break out Ivanka Trump sales by region.

In a call on Friday with BoF, Stein Mart chief executive D. Hunt Hawkins said that, despite certain customer complaints regarding the Ivanka Trump label being sold in stores, the retailer’s decision to carry the relabelled product was not motivated by politics. “We’ve had both labels for a while. We may see more Adrienne Vittadini in the short term,” he said. “I’ve had an equal number of [customers] say that they don’t want and do want [the Ivanka Trump merchandise] in the store. If we get it, we get.”

The retailer doesn’t have the luxury of being choosy. Unlike many of its off-price competitors — which have benefited from the rise of discount culture, expanding at a rapid rate — Stein Mart, which generated $1.4 billion in its 2016 fiscal year, has struggled. While year-over-year net sales were about flat in 2016, sales at stores open at least one year were down almost 4 percent.

While G-III and Stein Mart have both acknowledged their participation in the swap, it is unclear what role Adrienne Vittadini has played. Authentic Brands Group licenses Adrienne Vittadini, not G-III. However, G-III declined to explain how the Adrienne Vittadini labels ended up on the Ivanka Trump garments. A representative from Authentic Brands Group declined to comment for this story.

It certainly matters if Adrienne Vittadini did not know about the swap. “If the original label [is replaced] with that of a third party unaware of the substitution, the [responsible party] would be liable to the third party,” Scafidi says. “All of this derives historically from the law of fraud.”

And even if label swapping is technically legal, questions remain on whether or not the practice is ethical or in line with customer expectation. “Of course, the fact that a clothing retailer can legally relabel with certain restrictions doesn't mean that it should, especially if label-conscious consumers are likely to be outraged by the switch,” Scafidi says. “Fashion may be trending toward modesty, but when it comes to labels, customers are demanding more transparency than ever.”

The single sockeye salmon that tested positive was sampled from Osoyoos Lake in the summer of 2015, according to scientists from the Radiation Protection Bureau at Health Canada, in cooperation with Fisheries and Oceans Canada and local First Nations. The sample was one of a few (8 out of 156 total) individual fish that had trace levels of the longer lived cesium-137 (137Cs) (30 yr half-life) that we reported on last winter. To determine if this trace 137Cs was from Fukushima or remnant from atmospheric weapons testing, InFORM reexamined these individual fish samples to see if extremely low levels of 134Cs may be present. The results of this extended analysis show that trace (0.07 Bq kg-1) levels of 134Cs were detected in one sample from Okanagan/Columbia River population. No 134Cs was detectable in the other samples. The observed levels remain well below the action level (1000 Bq kg-1) set by Health Canada guidelines.

As we reported in the winter 2016 update, 8 individual fish (out of the 156 measured) from 2015 tested positive for low levels (<1 Bq kg-1) of cesium-137 (137Cs). With its ~30 year half-life, 137Cs is still present in the environment from 20th century atmospheric weapons testing and Chernobyl in addition to the Fukushima accident. In contrast, no individual fish from the 2014 monitoring effort were found to contain detectable levels of 137Cs. This difference led the team at the Radiation Protection Bureau to conduct a more detailed investigation of some of those few positive samples to determine if 134Cs, the Fukushima fingerprint isotope, was present. Results from 5 of those 8 are now available and discussed below. The remaining three samples have now been processed, and no elevated levels of 137Cs or 134Cs.

A more detailed investigation requires that the minimum detectable concentration (MDC) be lowered. When studying ionizing radiation, the MDC is a threshold that refers to the statistics of detecting individual nuclear disintegrations after a sample has been on a detector for a period of time. With each additional disintegration detected, the signal becomes more distinct from the noise. When detecting trace concentrations of isotopes, disintegrations are infrequent and thus more time on the gamma spectrometer detector is necessary to lower the MDC and determine with confidence (signal clearly, and statistically, above the noise) that an isotope is present. Lowering the MDC is analogous to increasing the exposure time for a camera to capture a good night scene as shown below.

For these salmon samples, each was freeze dried, to prevent the meat from going rancid, then placed on the detector for a full two weeks (336 hours). For comparison, InFORM salmon samples are normally counted for 6 hours. Similar to the photos above, after 6 hours on the detector, you can just make out the scene of a campfire on the beach, but it is difficult. In the case of those 8 samples, it was even possible to see that something was present, as with the logs on the shoreline in the photo (red square), but there is not enough signal to clearly resolve what that item might be. When placed on the detector for 2 weeks the decay signal is improved and the MDC threshold is lowered, similar to increasing the length of the camera’s shutter speed to capture more light.

With the lower MDC, the results are more statistically robust. In the graph above we see the 2 week results (darker teal and brown vertical bars) are now above the associated MDCs (horizontal lines) so we have greater confidence in the signal. In four of the five samples reporting, those early indications of of 137Cs in the sample turned out to be cases that weren’t statistically significant and the longer analysis revealed that levels of 137Cs decreased and the new results were in agreement with the average value for all the 2015 samples. This result is not totally surprising and is a good example of statistical regression to the mean.

However, one of the samples from Osoyoos Lake confirmed the level of 137Cs (0.53 Bq kg-1) and showed a very low (0.07 Bq kg-1), signal for 134Cs, the Fukushima fingerprint isotope.

We can validate that the observed signal comes from Fukushima by comparing the observed levels of 134Cs and 137Cs. The salmon sample was collected in 2015, almost exactly 2 half-lives of 134Cs (t 1/2 = 2.06 years), or 4 years, after the majority of this radioisotope was released into the environment. If we decay correct the 134Cs in the sample to the time of the Fukushima disaster in 2011, we get 0.35 Bq kg-1. We know from previous work by other scientists that 134Cs and 137Cs were released from the Fukushima accident in equal amounts. This should mean that the level of 137Cs in the sockeye sample is approximately equal, so what is the source of the additional 0.2 Bq kg-1? Examining the results of the 155 other salmon collected in 2015 we see from the sum of their spectra that the average concentration of 137Cs in all of these fish was ~0.2 Bq kg-1. Since no Fukushima radiation was detected in any of those samples we deduce that this is the level of contamination attributable to historic atmospheric weapons testing. Therefore, we conclude that just over half of the observed levels of radiocesium in this sample are from Fukushima contamination with the rest being from historical sources of human contamination in the 20th century.

The InFORM team stresses that even though the results presented confirm Fukushima radiation in this Pacific salmon, the levels of contamination do not approach levels that represent a significant health threat to the fish or to a human consumer. Based on this measurement, the total cesium (137Cs + 134Cs) radioactivity in this sample is 0.60 Bq kg-1, which is over 1000x lower than the level of concern according to Health Canada. For perspective, you would need to consume 1000-1500 kg of salmon with this level of contamination in a short period of time to increase your radiation dose by the same amount as a single 5 hour cross-country flight.

To view the full results from all 156 salmon from 2015 that were analyzed as part of our Fukushima biotic monitoring effort see our earlier summary or Open Data Canada. Initial results from the 2016 biotic monitoring program will be available shortly.

The new analysis ranked 48 continental states and the District of Columbia

© press The new analysis ranked 48 continental states and the District of Columbia

A new study published by the Social Science Research Network has revealed that 99.9% of all politicians in the USA are actual psychopaths.

The question is, are politicians already psychopaths, or does the line of work change them as such?

The new analysis ranked 48 continental states and the District of Columbia by measuring the psychopathic personality of their residents.

The leader of the study, Ryan Murphy, told Newsweek:

“These results are the first estimates we have, to the best of my knowledge, on the degree of psychopathy found in each state.""

Murphy claimed that each state’s ranking was computed on a previous study that ranked each state on the “Big Five” personality traits:

Agreeableness

Extraversion

Openness

Conscientiousness

neuroticism

© press

According to Miamiherald.com: This was done by analyzing the results of personality surveys given to thousands of residents in each state. People tended to have different levels of each of the “Big 5” traits depending on where they lived.

That previous study, which was published in 2013, aimed at separating the United States into broad regions of personality.

The states in the mid-Atlantic and northeast were classified as “temperamental and uninhibited.”

Those in middle America were “friendly and conventional,” while those in the west coast, Rocky Mountains, and Sunbelt region were “relaxed and creative.”

Psychopaths tend to be extroverted and charming yet “largely devoid of guilt, empathy, and love,” according to Scientific American.

They do things purely for their own interests , have shallow relationships and place blame on others when things go wrong, according to the magazine.

Murphy used the data on personality from the previous study and used it to calculate a new score based on personality traits that indicated psychopathy, according to Quartz.

After all the number crunching, what was the top psychopath hotspot? Washington D.C.

“The top five observations in psychopathy are the District of Columbia, Connecticut, California, New Jersey, and a tie of New York and Wyoming for fifth. The states that are least psychopathic are West Virginia, Vermont, Tennessee, North Carolina, and New Mexico,” Murphy wrote.

Murphy wrote that people should take the capitol’s top spot with a little bit of skepticism.

The D.C. area is small and entirely urban, so it is inherently different than comparing a state, which has a more diverse geography and population, he wrote.

Still, Murphy said in his study that the finding is consistent with a different study that found “psychopaths are likely to be effective in the political sphere” and could be tempted to work in the “literal seat of power.”

In general, Murphy writes that areas of the northeast are the most psychopathic, while rural areas are the least psychopathic, and that D.C. appears to be “far more” psychopathic on its own than any state in the country."	99.9% Of US Politicians Are Actual Psychopaths, New Study Reveals	2018-06-21 14:20:21+00:00	[]	['actual', 'murphy', 'state', 'district', 'reveals', 'psychopathic', 'ranked', 'politicians', 'psychopaths', 'states', 'psychopathy', 'personality', 'study', '999']	"99.9% Of US Politicians Are Actual Psychopaths, New Study RevealsThe new analysis ranked 48 continental states and the District of Columbia| @NeonNettle By: Daniel Newton on 20th June 2018 @ 2.30pm© press The new analysis ranked 48 continental states and the District of ColumbiaA new study published by the Social Science Research Network has revealed that 99.9% of all politicians in the USA are actual psychopaths.

Haspel supervised a U.S. “black site” in Thailand in 2002 where Abu Zubeidah and Abdul Rahim Nashiri were tortured by CIA personnel. In 2005, she helped destroy 92 videotapes showing their torture. She faced no consequences for those actions, and, assuming senators ask about them at her upcoming confirmation hearing, it’s likely that her answers will be given in a closed, secret session.

But Haspel’s actions may well have violated international law, specifically the U.N. Convention Against Torture. Could she face prosecution?

Legally speaking, yes. But politically, almost certainly not.

There are two legal avenues for a case against Haspel. The first is the International Criminal Court (ICC), and the second is a domestic court of a European nation.

The ICC is a better fit conceptually. Its entire purpose is to prosecute people for “genocide, war crimes, crimes against humanity, and aggression.” And despite legal counsel provided to the Bush administration at the time, the kinds of torture which Haspel supervised when she oversaw a CIA “black site” in Thailand are almost certainly violations of the U.N. Convention Against Torture.

Mary Ellen O’Connell, professor of international law at Notre Dame Law School, told The Daily Beast that Haspel “clearly broke the law… Every member of the CIA is aware that the U.S. is a party to the Convention Against Torture. Even members of the military would have had the duty to disobey a manifestly unlawful order from superiors to use torture.”

Not only did Haspel not disobey orders, some experts believe that she gave them herself, while supervising the interrogation of Zubaydah and Nashiri, and subsequently destroyed the tapes. The answers may be in the 6,000-page Senate intelligence committee report on torture during the Bush administration that remains classified (only the 524-page executive summary is authorized for release).

“ Every member of the CIA is aware that the U.S. is a party to the Convention against Torture. Even members of the military would have had the duty to disobey a manifestly unlawful order from superiors to use torture. ” — Mary Ellen O’Connell, professor of International Law at Notre Dame

Moreover, O’Connell noted, the ICC itself is “under pressure, with developing world countries leaving, for the court to look even-handed.” Nearly all ICC prosecutions have thus far been of Africans; a high-profile investigation of a sitting CIA director would help dispel concerns that the ICC is biased in favor of “first world” defendants.

The problem with the ICC is jurisdiction. Under the Rome Statute of the International Criminal Court, which established the body in 1998, the court can only hear of abuses that were either committed by an ICC member nation or took place within an ICC member nation. The United States is not a member: It signed the Rome Statute, but the Senate didn’t ratify it.

Thailand, where Haspel’s black site was located—at the international airport outside Bangkok—is in the same situation. It’s a signatory, but not a member.

The only way that Haspel could be prosecuted at the ICC, then, is if she had responsibility for war crimes that took place in another country that, unlike Thailand, is an ICC member nation.

The most likely candidate is Poland, where the CIA operated another black site, but it is not known whether Haspel had responsibility for that site, or exactly what took place there.

In other words, the ICC may not have jurisdiction at all, and absent additional leaks, it’s hard to see them gaining any information about what did or didn’t happen in Poland.

Even Haspel’s testimony to the Senate may be of little use. It is common practice for intelligence officers to request a closed hearing for matters related to national security, and until the Russia Investigation, it was unheard of for members of Congress to divulge the records of such hearings.

At Haspel’s public hearing, you can expect her to refuse to answer any question that has to do with torture, black sites, extraordinary rendition, on the grounds it could compromise national security—to say nothing of her own prosecution.

So much, then, for the ICC. What about the second option: domestic courts in other countries?

Andrew Novak, professor of international law at George Mason University, told The Daily Beast that “many countries have universal jurisdiction laws when the law of nations has been violated, as in cases of torture, slavery, or genocide. They would have jurisdiction if someone’s not being prosecuted elsewhere.”

Moreover, “after Rwanda and Yugoslavia, there are very broad laws to prosecute war crimes,” Novak said.

This has happened before. According to O’Connell, cases against Americans implicated in torture have proceeded in Spain, Italy, and Belgium. For example, O’Connell said, “Italy issued arrest warrants for CIA agents involved in the kidnapping and rendition of a Muslim cleric. One of the agents… was arrested on the warrant and held for a time in Panama. Another woman was arrested in Portugal a few months ago.”

A similar process is already underway in Haspel’s case. In Germany, the European Center for Constitutional and Human Rights (ECCHR), has filed a series of complaints with the country’s federal prosecutor, urging him to investigate.

Andreas Schüller, director of ECCHR’s International Crimes and Accountability Program, told The Daily Beast that this campaign has been going on for years. “In 2014, when the Senate report on the CIA came out, we filed a brief criminal complaint… They opened a preliminary examination—not yet an investigation, but a file that establishes the initial suspicion to open a case.”

In 2015 and 2016, ECCHR filed two more extended complaints, one regarding the Army’s alleged torture of inmates at Guantanamo Bay and Abu Ghraib, and a second on the CIA’s alleged torture at black sites.

“In 2016, Gina Haspel’s name was not known,” Schüller said, “but when she was nominated as vice-director of the CIA last year, we had a name to connect to other facts we had presented already.”

Now, the ECCHR says, “Gina Haspel must face arrest on traveling to Europe.”

But would the German federal prosecutor really go after the the CIA director, when such a move would gravely damage U.S.-German relations?

Schüller agreed it was unlikely.

“We don’t expect to see that move,” he said. “What we want to achieve is to say: look, there was torture, there is the UN Convention Against Torture, and you [the government] know who this person is. If you allow her to come here, you are making a clear political decision that you prioritize that over your obligations under the Convention Against Torture… They can’t say they didn’t know who was coming here.”

Moreover, Schüller added, “the legal accountability debate continues and makes life at least a little bit harder for the people making those decisions [to conduct torture]. It’s something they have to take into account.”

In sum, while the actions documented in the Senate’s report would be strong grounds for a war crimes prosecution of Gina Haspel, it’s very unlikely that anyone will make use of them. International law often takes a back seat to international relations, and realpolitik often dictates results. Even when the law, and its violation, are clear."

NEW YORK (AP) — Replicas of the official presidential seal displayed at one of Donald Trump’s golf courses were given to the club by members and have since been removed, the Trump Organization said Tuesday.

The statement to The Associated Press came a day after a report from two news organizations that said order forms for dozens of presidential seals listed “Trump International Golf Course” as the customer. Under federal law, the seal bearing the American eagle can only be used for official government business, with violations punishable by up to two years in jail.

“The plaques were presented to the club by a small group of members, who are incredible fans of the president, in honor of Presidents’ Day weekend,” said Trump Organization spokeswoman Amanda Miller. “They were temporary and have since been removed.”

The Trump Organization did not respond to a request for clarification on who ordered the plaques, the names of the members who “presented” them, how they were displayed and at what club.

ProPublica and WNYC reported Monday that the president’s company ordered the seal plaques to be used to mark where golfers should stand while teeing off on Trump courses. A photo accompanying the story, which was attributed to an unnamed source at the plaque manufacturing company, showed a table with at least 32 of the replica seals on it.

The president is mostly exempt from conflict-of-interest laws that prevent officials of the executive branch from profiting off their government positions. And lobbyists, special interest groups and diplomats have spent hundreds of thousands of dollars already at Trump properties.

But federal law regarding the presidential seal is another matter. It specifically bans the use of the seal for private purposes in a way that gives a “false impression of sponsorship or approval by the Government of the United States.”

Manufacturers are also prohibited from “knowingly” making the seal for anything other than “official use” by the U.S. government, punishable by fines and jail.

The company behind the presidential seals, Eagle Sign & Design in New Albany, Indiana, did not reply to phone calls and emails.

A Facebook page by the Eagle Sign & Design had a link to photos of its products that displays a blank page with the words “Presidential Seal” and “Trump International Golf Course,” but no photo. ProPublica/WNYC reported that there was a photo of the plaques there before it published its story."

People who refuse chemotherapy treatment live on average 12 and a half years longer than people who undergo chemotherapy, says Dr. Jones.

chemotherapy doesn’t work 97% of the time. According to recent statistics, approximately 1 in 2 men and 1 in 3 women will develop cancer in their lifetimes. This saddening reality is made worse when it is acknowledged that modern methods of ‘treating’ the disease are often ineffective and only make the symptoms of the disease worse. In fact, according to one Berkeley doctor,

In the eye-opening video above, Dr. Hardin B. Jones, a former professor of medical physics and physiology at the University of California, Berkeley, discusses how ‘leading edge’ cancer treatment is a sham.

He has personally studied the life expectancy of patients for more than 25 years and has come to the conclusion that chemotherapy does more harm than good. The bone-chilling realization prompted Dr. Jones to speak out against the billion-dollar cancer industry.

“People who refused chemotherapy treatment live on average 12 and a half years longer than people who are undergoing chemotherapy,” said Dr. Jones of his study , which was published in the New York Academy of Science.

“People who accepted chemotherapy die within three years of diagnosis, a large number dies immediately after a few weeks.”

According to the physician, the only reason doctors prescribe chemotherapy is because they make money from it. Such an accusation doesn’t seem unreasonable, as cancer treatment runs, on average, between $300,000 – $1,000,000 per treatment.

“Patients with breast cancer who reject conventional therapy live four times longer than those who follow the system. So this is something that you will not hear in the mass media, which will continue the myth…”

Despite the fact that the United States spends more on healthcare than any other high-income nation in the world, diseases of affluence continue to increase in prevalence, resulting in a shorter life expectancy.

Perhaps this is because mainstream media and the allopathic healthcare system don’t teach about the importance of preventative medicine . Eating a healthy diet, engaging in exercise, thinking positive thoughts, reducing stress, and enjoying the company of others – or habits that bring joy – are all proven to improve longevity and happiness.

As it is, there is no money in a healthy population, which is why fast food joints and pharmaceutical industries thrive in America. Hopefully, Dr. Jones’ efforts will inspire people to seek out alternative options if they or someone they know develops the debilitating disease.

Troll who mocked Katie Price's disabled son Harvey has been sacked »

But one self-styled astronomer claims they are wrong – and that not only will it hit Earth, it’s a part of the mysterious death planet Nibiru!

On February 16, a massive space rock will hit Earth – followed by the death planet itself, according to Mysterious Universe

We should note at this point that there’s no scientific evidence Nibiru even exists – and that internet maniacs predict that it will destroy Earth with mind-numbing regularity, and that it never, ever does.

Self-styled astronomer Dyomin Damir Zakharovich says, ‘NASA is lying through its teeth. It is not conceivable that they do not know the truth. We have seen the data!

‘The object they call WF9 left the Nibiru system in October when Nibiru began spinning counter clockwise around the sun. Since then, NASA has known it will hit Earth. But they are only telling people now.’

‘And this is just a precursor to the damage Nibiru will cause when it gets here. NASA probably knows the impact zone. I do not. We are all in peril.’

Dr Zakharovich believes that there’s a global conspiracy to conceal the existence of Nibiru – orchestrated by the leaders of Russia and the West.

‘The object is larger than NASA says. Our preliminary data suggested a 2.2km asteroid that will have no problem penetrating the atmosphere without burning up.

He claims it will destroy a city or cause huge tsunamis – and then Nibiru itself will arrive, and God knows what will happen.

What is Nibiru - and should we be scared?    Aaargh! (Picture Getty) For decades, conspiracy theorists have predicted that an unseen planet beyond Neptune – called Nibiru or Planet X – is going to destroy Earth. But in case you’re worried, you should note that Nibiru (or Planet X) was widely predicted to hit our planet in December 2015, and before that in September 2015. Prior to that, it was predicted to smash into our planet to coincide with the Mayan apocalypse in 2012 – and before that, Nancy Lieder, an American website writer who claimed to have an alien implant in her brain, predicted it would destroy the world in 2003. NASA has thoroughly debunked the Nibiru myth via its Beyond 2012 page, saying, ‘Nibiru and other stories about wayward planets are an Internet hoax. There is no factual basis for these claims. If Nibiru or Planet X were real and headed for an encounter with the Earth, astronomers would have been tracking it for at least the past decade, and it would be visible by now to the naked eye.’ Soviet-born American writer Zecharia Sitchin first wrote about Nibiru in his hit 1976 book ‘The 12th Planet’ where he claimed it was inhabited by a race of ‘ancient aliens’ – the Annunaki – who had created the human race. Sitchin’s work remains in print and has a devoted following around the world. Nigel Watson, author of the UFO Investigations Manual says, ‘Zecharia Sitchin claims that Nibiru collided with a planet called Tiamat that was situated between Mars and Jupiter. The result was the creation of the asteroid belt and planet Earth.’ ‘Nibiru is populated by the Anunnaki, an advanced humanoid race, who visited Earth thousands of years to mine gold in Africa. As an outcome of needing workers to carry out these mining operations they used genetics to create Homo Sapiens.’

The object called 2016 WF9 was detected by the NEOWISE project on Nov. 27, 2016.

Brady Press Briefing Room

1:25 P.M. EDT

SANDERS: Good afternoon. As you all know, President Trump is deeply committed to our veterans. These brave men and women have given so much to our country and deserve our absolute best, which is why this President is fighting for reform and accountability at the VA.

In keeping with his campaign pledge, the President donates his salary on a quarterly basis to further important projects. Today, the President is proud to donate his 2018 first-quarter salary to the Department of Veterans Affairs to support their caregiver programs.

Acting Secretary of Veterans Affairs Robert Wilkie is here to accept the check. I’d like to bring him up to say a few words about how these funds will be used.

And make sure that I give you —

ACTING SECRETARY WILKIE: Thank you very much, Sarah.

SANDERS: — the all-important actual check.

ACTING SECRETARY WILKIE: Thank you very much, Sarah. And good afternoon.

Before I address the President’s generosity, I want to say a couple of things about what happened in the House yesterday. I want to send my thanks and the thanks of Veterans Affairs to the Chairman of the House Veterans Affairs Committee, Dr. Roe, and thank him for the bipartisan coalition that he forged together. The vote yesterday was overwhelming, 347 to 70.

And this is long-awaited legislation that our veterans have been waiting in anticipation of. This takes seven community care programs that we have been using for the last 15 to 20 years and condenses them into one. It also makes it much easier for our veterans to obtain care that they need at the moment that they need it, in homes and in facilities closest to where they live.

This also opens up the Caregiver Program to long-waiting communities within our veterans’ world — those veterans from World War II, Korea, Vietnam, and the Gulf War who have not had access to a community caregiver program that was opened up for those who have served in the military since 9/11.

So with this strong bipartisan support, we urge the Senate to take up the House bill and give it to President Trump, hopefully before Memorial Day.

But I also want to single out the major veteran service organizations. Thirty-eight of them signed a letter in support of this legislation to the House and Senate leadership. Their people have been walking the halls of the Congress for the last week. They will be in the Senate next week, and we can’t thank them enough for their support for our nation’s 20 million veterans.

And Sarah, I want to thank you for the announcement. I want to thank you for President Trump’s generosity. The President’s gift underscores his promise to do all that he can for veterans, which includes supporting those who care for our veterans — not just those of us at VA, but the husbands, the wives, the families, and the community caregivers who are out there day in and day out making life easier for those who have borne the battle.

President Trump understands the critical role of caregivers in meeting the essential needs of America’s veterans.

So we have already earmarked this gift for caregiver support in the form of mental health and peer support programs, financial aid, education training, and research.

I am deeply grateful to President Trump for providing me the opportunity to serve America’s veterans and for his generosity in supporting them.

So thank you, Sarah, and thank you to President Trump. I know how much this means to American’s veterans. Thank you.

SANDERS: Thank you so much. Thank you. Thank you very much.

Lastly, this week is set aside each year to honor those across our country who wear the badge. In the spirit of Police Week, I want to read a quick letter from Samuel of San Antonio, Texas that he sent the President:

“Dear Mr. President Donald J. Trump,

Last year, I raised about $375 for our police. I went down to McDonald’s and bought 75 $5 gift cards so the police officers could get coffee or lunch. It would be really cool to meet you. I wish I could vote for you, but I’m only 11. But my mom voted for you. I’m starting a fundraiser called, “A Break for the Blue.” I listen to your talks, and I went to the inauguration and saw you. You’re awesome.

Sincerely, Samuel”

Thankfully, I had the honor of meeting Samuel earlier today. He was adopted by his family in Guatemala. He is incredibly grateful to be an American, and he’s very grateful to all of the law enforcement officers around the country.

The President is very proud of Samuel and believes our country needs more young people like him who give back to their communities. And he’s a really, really great kid and it was great to meet him.

And with that, I will take your questions. John.

Q Sarah, we haven’t had a chance to hear of any kind of an in-depth analysis here. Where are we with the summit with Kim Jong-un? And the statements that we’ve heard over the last few days out of North Korea, do you think that these throw in jeopardy the idea of a summit? Or is this just North Korea doing what it does in trying to get the best deal possible?

SANDERS: Look, the President is prepared and will be ready to meet, and we’re continuing to move forward with the preparations at this point. And if the North Koreans want to meet, we’ll be there. And at this point, there is not a lot of change beyond that, and certainly not in our process.

Q So what North Korea is saying now about the joint military exercises after Moon Jae-in said Kim knows that these take place and he understands that they have to take place. I mean, what game is North Korea playing?

SANDERS: You’d have to ask North Korea what game they’re playing. I can tell you what we’re doing, and we’re continuing to move forward in preparations. And the President, as we’ve said all along, will be prepared and ready to meet. And there’s really not a lot to add beyond that point.

Jon.

Q Thanks a lot, Sarah. What leverage does the U.S. have as it relates to having this meeting take place on June the 12th? And to that meeting actually taking place, when it takes place — if it takes place — what leverage does the U.S. have over accomplishing the American goal of denuclearizing the Korean Peninsula?

SANDERS: We’re continuing in the maximum pressure campaign. But again, nothing has changed on our end. This was an invitation that North Korea offered and that we’ve accepted, and we’re continuing to move forward in those preparations.

Q But on another issue on —

SANDERS: Sorry, I’m going to keep going because we’re really tight on time today.

Steve, go ahead.

Q If I could just follow up on that. What the North Koreans also announced was they were stopping the dialogue with South Korea. So is it possible that there could be a meeting between the United States and North Korea if that whole dialogue between the North and South is on ice?

SANDERS: The meeting that would take place on June 12th is between the United States and North Korea, should it take place. We’re going to meet with President Moon next week. And beyond that, again, there are no changes at this point to our schedule or anything else.

Blake.

Q Sarah, does President Trump believe that the FBI had a spy at one point inside his campaign?

SANDERS: I haven’t spoken with him directly about that, but certainly seen the reports. And if there is any truth to that, it should certainly be looked into.

Q And what is —

SANDERS: Sorry, I’m going to keep going just because we’re tight.

Emerald, go ahead.

Q Thank you. Following up on Blake’s question — if it is proven without a shadow of a doubt that there was a spy planted in the Trump campaign, does that change the President’s position on firing Robert Mueller?

SANDERS: I’m not going to speak about hypotheticals or get into what could happen if. We’ll move forward in the process and make a determination at that point.

John.

Q Thank you, Sarah. The Iraqi elections are over and it’s very clear that the two big winners — the two top vote-getters — were the party that was linked to Muqtada al-Sadr, a sworn enemy of the United States and someone aligned with the Iraqi Communist Party. And the second-place finisher was the party aligned with Mr. al-Amiri, a warlord who was once backed by Iran. What’s the U.S.’s attitude on a government in Baghdad having either of those individuals as the key player?

SANDERS: I’ll start with the fact I’m glad you said the names and not me — (laughter) — because I probably wouldn’t have gotten them right. But in terms of our policy, we don’t have any new policy announcements with a potential change there.

Q So you don’t care if either of them is —

SANDERS: Certainly we care, but I don’t have any specific changes in U.S. policy while that’s happened.

Jeff.

Q Sarah, what does the United States expect out of negotiations today with China on trade? And what are the President’s intentions on helping or changing the policy towards Chinese company ZTE?

SANDERS: In terms of the meeting, I’ll start there. Those conversations are ongoing. When we have something from that, I’ll be happy to share it with you. But right now, those are just discussions and there’s nothing to add to that at this point, since they’re just now taking place.

I can say that we expect that the President will meet with the head of the Chinese delegation later this afternoon.

Q And ZTE?

SANDERS: On ZTE — look, the United States and China relationship has a lot of issues that we have regular, ongoing conversations about: national security, trade, and ZTE is one of them. As we’ve said before, and as the President has stated, he’s asked Secretary Ross to look into the issue and do whatever is consistent with the law and regulations. But right now it’s just something that he’s asked them to look into.

Julie.

Q Thanks, Sarah. Also on trade, the President said yesterday that Mexico does nothing for us, especially for the border. We know there are talks today on NAFTA — today and tomorrow. And I wonder if the administration is going to condition any NAFTA deal on a safe third-country agreement with Mexico, or Mexico stepping up to do more to absorb asylum-seekers and other migrants who are seeking entry to the U.S.

SANDERS: I’m not going to get into the trade conversations at this point because they are ongoing and those are negotiations that we’re in the middle of. But I can tell you that the President does want to see Mexico step up and do more. There’s a lot that comes through their country, and he wants them to be tougher and more aggressive on that front.

Jeff.

Q Thank you, Sarah. This morning, the President marked the one-year anniversary of the Mueller investigation, saying it’s disgusting, illegal, unwarranted, and a witch hunt. But his own FBI director yesterday said it’s not a witch hunt. Does the President — why does the White House still believe it’s a witch hunt? And why did he cancel his news conference this afternoon, which was originally set for three o’clock with the NATO Secretary?

SANDERS: Different topics. But the President knows that there was no collusion in the campaign and he has been quite clear about this. It’s gone on for over a year. They found no evidence of collusion and still strongly believe that it’s a witch hunt. I’m not sure how we could be any more clear and certainly not sure how the President could be any more clear about his beliefs in his opinion.

In terms of a press engagement, the President will have press at his event here shortly, which is why we’re going to have to keep it quick and short today and likely take a few questions at that event.

Jordan.

Q Thanks, Sarah. On immigration, there seems to be — we’re moving closer to action in the House of Representatives and I’m wondering what bill the President would accept anything short of the four pillars that he laid out earlier this month. Something like border security and DACA, it seems to be a proposal that is gaining steam. Is that something that the President could support?

SANDERS: The President definitely supports border security, as he’s laid out multiple times and again talked about some yesterday. He would like to see the border security, he would like to see the loopholes closed. Our priorities have not changed in the immigration conversation at all.

Ayesha.

Q Thank you. Just going back to North Korea, you have said that the President would be willing to meet with North Korea if North Korea is. So does that put North Korea in the driver’s seat here? Is it North Korea that’s going to decide whether a meeting takes place? And also, the President said yesterday that the White House hadn’t heard anything from North Korea. Has that changed? Have you heard anything since these talks were called off with South Korea?

SANDERS: They’re certainly not in the driver’s seat. Nothing could be further from the truth. But they’re the ones that extended the invitation; we’ve accepted it. If they want to meet, we’re happy to do that. If they don’t, as the President has said, we’ll see what happens. But we’re going to continue the maximum pressure campaign in the meantime.

I don’t know how they would be in the driver’s seat in any capacity, form, or fashion.

Q Well, is the White House setting a standard for “We won’t meet with you unless you do X, Y, and Z”?

SANDERS: Look, the North Koreans have already made concessions. They’ve already — three Americans are home now that weren’t. The President has had some success in this process, and certainly we’ve given up nothing. And we are going to continue moving forward, and we’re moving into this with our eyes wide open. We’re not naïve in this process, but the President is fully prepared to have the meeting. But if not, that’s okay too. And we’ll see what happens beyond that.

Shannon.

Q I know we’ve asked this a few times, but —

SANDERS: That’s okay. That’s kind of what we do here, ask the same question over and over and over again.

Q Can you say yet when Michael Cohen stopped being the President’s personal lawyer?

SANDERS: I’m not going to get into anything on that matter. You’d have to reach out to the President’s outside counsel.

Q Yeah, but you still haven’t been able to answer that.

SANDERS: Jill, go ahead.

Q Thank you, Sarah. Why didn’t the President disclose the reimbursement to Michael Cohen in last year’s financial disclosure report? And just to follow up on other peoples’ questions on North Korea, has any consideration been given at this point to potentially canceling those joint military exercises with South Korea?

SANDERS: On the first question, that was addressed in the financial disclosure and that’s something that would be determined by White House Counsel — how things would be categorized in the filings.

And on the second part, those are ongoing exercises that are routine and they’re aware of, they’re annual. And at this point, we have no intention of changing it.

Steven.

Q I just want to ask you, because so many people around the country have been talking about it in the last 24 hours, what did the President mean when he said some immigrants are not people, they’re “animals”?

SANDERS: The President was very clearly referring to MS-13 gang members who enter the country illegally and whose deportations are hamstrung by our laws. This is one of the most vicious and deadly gangs that operates by the motto of rape, control, and kill. If the media and liberals want to defend MS-13, they’re more than welcome to.

Frankly, I don’t think the term that the President used was strong enough. MS-13 has done heinous acts. It took an animal to stab a man a hundred times and decapitate him and rip his heart out. It took an animal to beat a woman — they were sex trafficking — with a bat 28 times, indenting part of her body. And it took an animal to kidnap, drug, and rape a 14-year-old Houston girl. Frankly, I think that the term “animal” doesn’t go far enough. And I think that the President should continue to use his platform and everything he can do under the law to stop these types of horrible, horrible, disgusting people.

I’m going to take one more question. Peter.

Q Thank you, Sarah. Are the chances of a summit now less likely than they were a week ago before these statements came out from Kim Jong-un?

SANDERS: I’m not going to get into a percentage game. I can tell you that we’re ready and prepared. And if they happen, they happen; and if they don’t, we’ll see what happens.

Thanks so much, guys. We’ll see you here in a few minutes with the President.

There was rush-hour traffic on Constitution Avenue, and he’s had more important places to be. Graham has just finished a meeting at the White House with a group of 15 Republican senators and President Donald Trump. They’d been discussing tariffs in the wake of Trump’s increasingly bellicose trade moves and Tennessee Republican senator Bob Corker’s announcement the day before, June 5, that he’d introduce a bill to take back some of the authority Congress had given the executive branch to raise tariffs.

“He asked me to call the meeting,” Graham says of Trump. “We talked yesterday and I said, ‘Well, let me get a group together, and we’ll see what happens.’ ” Within days, it’s clear that the meeting has been a success for Trump. Bob Corker is on the Senate floor berating his fellow Republicans for blocking a vote on his amendment despite the fact, he says, that “95 percent of the people on this [Republican] side of the aisle support intellectually this amendment” but are afraid “we might poke the bear”—i.e., President Trump.

“There’s a lot of concern that this tariff thing is going to get out of hand,” Graham tells me in his office on June 6. “We have to realize this is one of the centerpieces of the campaign; it’s not traditional Republican policy, but we need to respect the fact that he won. . . . Maybe we need to change [Section] 232 [tariffs] one day, but now is not the time to do that, because it will undercut his negotiating position.”

Graham’s role in protecting Trump’s protectionist policies isn’t entirely out of character. The senator from South Carolina, a textile-manufacturing state, has a mixed record on free trade: He voted against the Central American Free Trade Agreement in 2005, for example, but backed the Trans-Pacific Partnership in recent years.

What is surprising is the very existence of Graham’s close relationship with Donald Trump.

Trump is “the world’s biggest jackass,” Graham said a month after Trump launched his presidential campaign, in response to Trump’s trashing his friend John McCain and other American prisoners of war (“I like people who weren’t captured”). Trump responded by calling Graham an “idiot” who is “probably . . . not as bright, honestly, as Rick Perry” and by reading off Graham’s cell phone number at one of his televised rallies. Graham had to get a new number.

While most Republicans fell in line before the 2016 election, Lindsey Graham—along with fellow senators Mike Lee, Ben Sasse, John McCain, and Rob Portman—was a high-profile NeverTrumper on Election Day. “My party has gone batshit crazy,” Graham said in a February 2016 speech about Trump. Graham told Fox News that Trump is “a kook. I think he’s crazy. I think he’s unfit to be president.”

But sometime after the election, Graham became a neo-Trumper. “You know what concerns me about the American press is this endless, endless attempt to label the president some kind of kook,” Graham said in November 2017. “I intend to support him in 2020 without equivocation,” Graham tells me now.

What changed since 2016? A neoconservative, in Irving Kristol’s famous formulation, was a liberal who’d been mugged by reality. Neo-Trumpers like Graham, then, are NeverTrumpers who were mugged by—what, exactly? Necessity? Expediency? Sean Hannity?

To hear Graham tell it, policy is what changed his mind. “He’s on track to do big things,” Graham says of the president. “He built up the military. I campaigned on it. He got out of the Iran deal. I campaigned on it. He’s destroying ISIL. I campaigned on it. He’s restructuring the tax code and the way we do business. I campaigned on it. He’s doing much of what I campaigned on, and I’m pleased.” Graham now speaks regularly with Trump and has become a close ally on matters ranging from North Korea to health care.

What about the issues of temperament that in 2016 made Trump, in Graham’s view, unfit to be president? Is there anything specific, I ask, that has convinced the senator that Trump isn’t the “kook” Graham called him back then? “One, I got to know him,” Graham says. “I’ve played golf with him. You know, play golf with somebody for three or four hours, you get to know them better. He’s funny as hell. He’s got a great sense of humor. There’s a method to the madness.”

“He’s nobody’s fool,” Graham adds. “Very smart. And he asks a lot of good questions.”

In 2016, Graham also suggested Trump’s character made him unfit. “Name one sports team, university, publicly held company, etc. that would accept a person like this as their standard bearer?” Graham tweeted in October 2016 after the release of the Access Hollywood video, in which Trump bragged about groping women by the genitals. If that behavior disqualified Trump in 2016, why doesn’t it disqualify him in 2020? “The American people listened to all that, and they said: ‘I want him to be president.’ Okay. I believe the elections have consequences,” Graham says. “I’ve always been of an opinion when the election’s over, you try to help the guy that won.”

In his efforts to help Trump, Graham hasn’t just been running interference on trade policy. He took the lead on a last-ditch attempt to partially repeal and replace Obama-care by block-granting money to the states, a bill that conservative health-care expert Yuval Levin called the “most coherent” plan considered by Republicans. Graham says Trump “loves the idea,” and it’s “almost a certainty” it would pass in the (unlikely) event Republicans pick up a seat or two in the Senate and hold the House.

Graham has also been the most enthusiastic congressional supporter of Trump’s North Korea diplomacy. Graham says that Trump’s credible threat of military force has brought North Korea to the negotiating table, and he believes Trump agrees with him that a war with North Korea is better than letting North Korea develop an arsenal of nuclear-tipped missiles that could strike the United States. The prospect of war with a regime that already has nuclear weapons might seem crazy to many, but Graham at least doesn’t downplay how apocalyptic a war would be. “If [President Trump] has to pick between millions of people dying in America and millions of people dying over there, he’s going to pick millions of people dying over there if he has to,” Graham says. There’s no hint in his rhetoric that military action against North Korea would stop at giving them a “bloody nose.”

Graham says that he still calls it like he sees it, supporting the president when he’s right and opposing him when he’s wrong. “I’m really worried about what he’s talking about in Syria. We pull out of Syria, ISIS will come back, and the Kurds will get eaten alive by Turkey,” Graham says. “That’d be the biggest mistake he could make. It will undo all of his achievements when it comes to ISIS. It’d be an Obama-on-steroids decision. I told him that.”

Graham has also warned Trump against firing special counsel Robert Mueller and refuses to call the investigation into Russian interference in the 2016 election a “witch hunt.” But he thinks it’s unlikely Mueller will uncover evidence Trump has committed any impeachable offenses: “You could fire [former FBI director James] Comey for any reason except a corrupt reason.” The May 2017 memo by deputy attorney general Rod Rosenstein, critical of Comey’s handling of the investigation of Hillary Clinton’s emails, “suggests there were valid reasons. Democrats wanted Comey fired. I think it’s going to be tough to prove that the president committed obstruction of justice in firing a guy that most people wanted to fire.”

Back in August 2017, after a neo-Nazi killed counter-protester Heather Heyer in a vehicular terrorist attack at a white nationalist rally in Charlottesville, Trump blamed “many sides” for the violence, failing to forcefully single out the side that committed murder, the side that claimed to have Trump’s support. The president made matters worse by saying some “very fine people” had participated in a torchlit white nationalist march where protesters chanted: “Jews will not replace us!” Graham issued a scathing statement:



Through his statements yesterday, President Trump took a step backward by again suggesting there is moral equivalency between the white supremacist neo-Nazis and KKK members who attended the Charlottesville rally and people like Ms. Heyer. I, along with many others, do not endorse this moral equivalency.



Many Republicans do not agree with and will fight back against the idea that the Party of Lincoln has a welcome mat out for the David Dukes of the world.



Trump responded with a pair of tweets: “Publicity seeking Lindsey -Graham falsely stated that I said there is moral equivalency between the KKK, neo-Nazis & white supremacists and people like Ms. Heyer. . . . Such a disgusting lie. He just can’t forget his election trouncing. The people of South Carolina will remember!”

It was only a few months after Trump warned Graham “the people of South Carolina will remember!” that Graham publicly did a 180 on whether Trump is a “kook.” Graham’s criticism of the president has been more tempered since Trump’s threatening August 2017 tweets, but he hasn’t gone completely in the tank for Trump.

In January 2018, Graham was at the Oval Office meeting where Trump said he opposed letting in more immigrants from certain “shithole” or “shithouse” countries. Georgia GOP senator David Perdue, who was also in the room, called the reported quotation a “total misrepresentation.” But Graham couldn’t bring himself to lie for Trump. “My memory hasn’t evolved,” Graham told reporters. “I know what was said, and I know what I said.”

“Following comments by the president, I said my piece directly to him yesterday,” Graham said. “The president and all those attending the meeting know what I said and how I feel. I’ve always believed that America is an idea, not defined by its people but by its ideals.”

But there has been perhaps no greater rhetorical desecration of American ideals by President Trump than his recent gratuitous praise that Kim Jong-un, the tyrant of the North Korean gulag state, “loves his people” and that the North Korean people love him with “great fervor.” In Graham’s media tour following the Trump-Kim summit, he left no illusions about the brutality of Kim, but he didn’t call on Trump to stop sanitizing the Stalinist dictator. Trump demands an unusual level of loyalty from his supporters, and there is some price to be paid for being his ally.

While President Trump was initially arguing last week that he was forced to impose a policy of separating children from parents who had illegally crossed the border because a law passed by Democrats tied his hands, Graham said on CNN that it simply wasn’t true: “President Trump could stop this policy with a phone call.” But Graham didn’t call on Trump to actually make that call. When Graham was asked on CNN on June 15 whether his newfound support for Trump was “two-faced,” he had a simple answer: “If you don’t like me working with President Trump to make the world a better place, I don’t give a shit.”

While Graham argues he’s been motivated by policy and principle, it would be naïve not to consider the possibility that political necessity played some role in his evolving view of Trump. Texas senator Ted Cruz, for example, withheld his support from Trump through the Republican convention, relenting coincidentally at a time when the presidential polls tightened and he faced mounting pressure from his donors to back Trump. Cruz was thus able to avoid a serious primary challenge in 2018.

Graham was always certain to face a primary challenger in 2020, and the fact that he hasn’t previously been defeated is somewhat surprising. Frequently derided on talk radio for his stance on immigration as Lindsey “Grahamnesty,” he won a seven-way 2014 primary in conservative South Carolina with 56 percent of the vote (his closest challenger lost by 41 points), just a year after participating as an author of the “Gang of 8” comprehensive immigration reform bill.

But while voters were willing to tolerate Graham’s heresy on immigration, there’s reason to think they wouldn’t be as ready to tolerate opposition to the incumbent president in 2020. On June 12, South Carolina Republican congressman and staunch Trump critic Mark Sanford was defeated in a primary. In the 2013 House primary, voters were willing to overlook Sanford’s extramarital affair. But harsh criticism of Trump was apparently a bridge too far. On June 5, Alabama congresswoman Martha Roby, who had said she couldn’t vote for Trump after the Access Hollywood tape came out, came in first in her primary (39 percent to 28 percent) but, having failed to win a majority, was forced to a July runoff. Even in suburban Northern Virginia, Rep. Barbara Comstock, a Republican who didn’t vote for Trump, lost 39 percent of the vote to a primary challenger.

It’s no coincidence that two of Trump’s most outspoken Republican critics in the Senate, Jeff Flake of Arizona and Bob Corker of Tennessee, are not seeking reelection in 2018. Mitt Romney will very likely win the Utah Senate nomination this month without having committed to backing Trump in 2020, but Utah Republicans were a national outlier in their opposition to Trump. Among the dozens of current and former prominent Republican officials who didn’t vote for Trump in 2016, Lindsey Graham may be the first neo-Trumper. But he likely won’t be the last.

https://www.snopes.com/fact-check/vagina-called-front-hole/	"the medical term ""vagina"" has been replaced with the phrase ""front hole."""	mostly false	['']	2018/08/27	Dan Evon	['https://www.healthline.com/health/lgbtqia-safe-sex-guide', 'http://archive.fo/0Jwsa', 'http://archive.fo/vkXMP', 'http://archive.fo/vGSfw#selection-417.0-422.0', 'https://www.healthline.com/health/lgbtqia-safe-sex-guide/response#1']	https://www.healthline.com/health/lgbtqia-safe-sex-guide	https://www.healthline.com/	"Overview Historically, when sex education was introduced to the general public, content was focused on puberty education for cisgender people, heterosexual sex, pregnancy prevention, and reduction of sexually transmitted infections (STIs). During that time, there was a great deal of stigma and discrimination associated with being lesbian, gay, bisexual, transgender, queer, intersex, and asexual (LGBTQIA). Gender-inclusive terms such as “nonbinary” and “trans” hadn’t yet entered mainstream language and culture. This historical context and rampant homophobia and transphobia created a foundation where most sex education curricula didn’t acknowledge the existence of LGBTQIA and nonbinary individuals. Sex education programs were, instead, developed based on the assumption that those receiving the information were solely heterosexual and cisgender. That’s why we worked with GLSEN and Advocates for Youth to ensure that this safe sex guide is aimed at understanding the nuanced, complex, and diverse gender identities, sexual orientation, attractions, and experiences that exist in our world, which vary across cultures and communities.

Why we need an LGBTQIA-inclusive safer sex guide Update: We have updated this section to clarify how we use terms referring to genitalia. You can read more about these changes here. Traditional safe sex guides are often structured in a way that presumes everyone’s gender (male/female/nonbinary/trans) is the same as the sex they were assigned at birth (male/female/intersex or differences in sexual development). Sex education resources often use videos, pictures, and diagrams as a way to convey important information, though these images and videos have historically failed to reflect or provide information about same-sex and queer relationships. In fact, the GLSEN 2015 National School Climate Survey shows that only about 5 percent of LGBTQ students saw LGBTQ representation in health class. These guides also often unnecessarily gender body parts as being “male parts” and “female parts” and refer to “sex with women” or “sex with men,” excluding those who identify as nonbinary. Many individuals don’t see body parts as having a gender — people have a gender. And as a result, the notion that a penis is exclusively a male body part and a vulva is exclusively a female body part is inaccurate. By using the word “parts” to talk about genitals and using medical terms for anatomy without attaching a gender to it, we become much more able to effectively discuss safe sex in a way that’s clear and inclusive. For the purposes of this guide, we’ve chosen to include alternative words for readers to use for their genitals. For example, some trans men choose to use the words “front hole” or “internal genital” instead of “vagina.” Alternatively, some trans women may say “strapless” or “girl dick” for penis. This usage is meant for one-on-one communication with trusted persons, such as your doctor or partner, not for broad discussion. In this guide, whenever we use the medical term “vagina,” we’ll also include “front hole” as clinically recommended by researchers in the BMC Pregnancy and Childbirth journal. The lack of representation and anti-LGBTQIA bias that LGBTQIA and nonbinary people often see in safe sex guides stigmatizes certain sexual behaviors and identities. It’s also directly related to the health disparities and higher rates of HIV and STIs reported within these communities. Discrimination in the sex ed world along with lack of access to healthcare tailored for LGBTQIA people and their needs plays a role in health disparities observed in LBGTQIA communities. For these reasons, it’s imperative for safe sex guides to become more inclusive of LGBTQIA and nonbinary people and their experiences. This will help address barriers to accessing care and effective educational tools, while simultaneously normalizing and acknowledging the true diversity that exists with regard to gender and sexuality.

Gender identity Gender identity is one component of gender and refers to the internal state of being a male, female, some combination of both, neither, or something else completely. Gender also includes gender expression and gender roles. Gender is different from sex, which is related to biological traits such as chromosomes, organs, and hormones. While a medical professional attending a birth assigns sex by looking at an infant’s genitals, gender is something each person comes to understand about themselves. It’s important to remember that gender has to do with who someone is, and sexual orientation has to do with who someone is attracted to. Here’s a list of more common gender identities and a quick description to better understand them: Cisgender is the word used to describe someone whose gender identity is the same as the sex that was assigned to them at birth.

is the word used to describe someone whose gender identity is the same as the sex that was assigned to them at birth. Trans is an umbrella term that often includes anyone who might identify as transgender (a gender identity describing someone who doesn’t exclusively identify with the sex they were assigned at birth), genderqueer, nonbinary, transfeminine, transmasculine, agender, and many more. Sometimes people wonder if trans people are always gay, while other times people assume trans people can’t be gay. Just like cisgender people, individuals who identify as trans can have any sexual orientation — straight, gay, bisexual, queer, lesbian, or asexual. Also, different people use gender identity labels differently, so it’s always good to ask someone what that term means to them in order to get a better understanding.

Nonbinary is a gender identity label that describes those who don’t identify exclusively as male or female. This means that a nonbinary person can identify as both male and female, partially male, partially female, or neither male nor female. Some nonbinary people identify as trans, while other don’t. If you’re confused which one of these terms to use for someone, as always, just ask!

Transfeminine is an umbrella term used to describe someone who was assigned male at birth and identifies with femininity. Someone who identifies as transfeminine may also identify as a trans woman or female.

Transmasculine is a gender identity describing someone who was assigned female at birth but identifies with masculinity. Someone who identifies as transmasculine may also identify as a trans man, trans woman, or male.

is a gender identity describing someone who was assigned female at birth but identifies with masculinity. Someone who identifies as transmasculine may also identify as a trans man, trans woman, or male. Agender is the word used to describe those who don’t identify with any gender or can’t relate to gender terms or labels at all. Sometimes people assume those who identify as agender also identify as asexual, but this isn’t true. Agender people can have any sexual orientation.

Sexual orientation Sexual orientation describes someone’s emotional, romantic, or sexual attraction to another person or group of people. Sexual orientation doesn’t tell us anything about the types of sex someone prefers or what body parts someone has. It simply gives us an idea of the range of people someone is attracted to. Here are some common sexual orientations: Heterosexual , also known as straight, is a sexual orientation to describe the physical, emotional, and sexual attraction to people who have a gender that’s different from their own.

, also known as straight, is a sexual orientation to describe the physical, emotional, and sexual attraction to people who have a gender that’s different from their own. Gay is a sexual orientation to describe a person who’s emotionally, romantically, or sexually attracted to people of their same gender and sometimes used by a person who identifies as man and who is emotionally, romantically, or sexually attracted to other men.

Pansexualis a sexual orientation used to describe a person who’s emotionally, romantically, or sexually attraction to people regardless of their gender or sex.

Consent Sexual consent is the act of agreeing to participate in any kind of touching or sexual activity. Sexual consent should take place in every sexual encounter and with all types of sexual activity and touching. Yes, even kissing! Often, consent involves a lot more than just a simple yes or no. It’s important to remember that the absence of a no doesn’t mean yes. There are often multiple behaviors to a sexual interaction, and consenting to one stage doesn’t necessarily mean someone is consenting to everything. Checking in with your sexual partner before and during sexual behaviors can help create a safe environment where sex can be a mutually pleasurable and positive experience grounded in respect and understanding. If you’re worried about ruining the mood or moment, take time before things get heavy to talk about consent and sex as well as barriers and protections. This strategy allows sexual partners to stay in the moment while also having clarity about what’s OK and what isn’t. Though consent is a serious thing, it doesn’t have to be a buzzkill. They are lots of ways to provide consent and finding the ones that work for you and your partner(s) can help create the trust and open communication that’s necessary to explore and have fun with sex. It’s important to remember that the absence of a no doesn’t mean yes. Consent can come in different forms, and it’s important to become educated on the various types in order to decide which form is the best fit for a particular person, group of people, or situation. Verbal or expressed consent is the act of using words to confirm agreement that you want something. The main thing to remember about this form of consent is that everything about the agreement is verbalized using words and there are no elements that are assumed or implied. If it wasn’t stated in the conversation or question, it wasn’t consented to.

The main thing to remember about this form of consent is that everything about the agreement is verbalized using words and there are no elements that are assumed or implied. If it wasn’t stated in the conversation or question, it wasn’t consented to. Implied consent is conscious and intentional agreement that someone wants something through their actions or body language. This type of consent can be tricky because the way body language and actions are interpreted varies from person to person. For example, one person may view flirtatious body language and touching as implied consent for more touching of other parts of the body, whereas someone else may view it as simply consenting to the flirtation and touching that’s currently happening. For this reason, it’s always best to get verbal consent too. Talk with your partner about how they feel about implied consent and the ways they use their body to communicate consent in a given sexual interaction.

Talk with your partner about how they feel about implied consent and the ways they use their body to communicate consent in a given sexual interaction. Enthusiastic consent involves both the verbal act of agreement and communicating the level of desire associated with that agreement. In simplest terms, it’s telling someone what you want and how badly you want it. The idea behind enthusiastic consent is that taking ownership and stating personal needs and desires is an important part of the consent process. Not only does this guide someone in knowing their partner’s wants and desires, both generally and in a given moment, but it also establishes a system of open communication for conveying preferences, turn-ons, and fantasies before and during sex.

Not only does this guide someone in knowing their partner’s wants and desires, both generally and in a given moment, but it also establishes a system of open communication for conveying preferences, turn-ons, and fantasies before and during sex. Contractual consent involves creating a written contract that outlines the sexual preferences of the partners involved and clearly states the sexual acts that can and can’t be performed, and in which situations. For some people, contractual consent means consent isn’t needed in the moment. For others, verbal, implied, or enthusiastic consent still need to happen. It’s important to remember that anyone can opt out of the contract or change the terms of the contract at any time. It’s helpful to revisit contractual consents regularly to ensure each person is still on the same page. Practicing contractual consent allows partners to engage in sexual encounters knowing what’s agreed upon, both in terms of consent and sexual activity. That’s why contractual consent is nice for many partners who prefer not to talk about consent in the midst of sex. This can help people feel more prepared and comfortable, while also eliminating the need to interrupt a passionate moment. Some ways to discuss consent with your partner “I was reading this article about different types of consent and realized we’ve never talked about it before.”

“I want to make sure we’re respecting each other during sex. Can we talk about consent?” “Hey, I’m wondering if we can check in about consent?”

“There are usually a few conversations I like to have before having sex. Do you mind if we talk about consent?”

“I know it can be awkward to talk about these things, but I’m hoping we can talk about consent. I know that’ll make me feel more comfortable and lead to a more positive experience for me.”

STIs An STI is an infection that’s passed from one person to another through sexual contact and activity. Although there’s often a lot of negative stigma — and sometimes shame — around contracting STIs, it’s actually quite common. According to the Centers for Disease Control and Prevention, there are approximately 20 million new STIs contracted every year in the United States, and 50 percent of these cases occur among people aged 15 to 24. Talking about STIs can be scary, but it’s super important to get tested regularly and talk with your healthcare provider about STIs if you’re sexually active. Ways STIs can be transmitted Skin-to-skin contact

vaginal/front hole sex

anal sex

oral sex

contact with bodily fluids, such as blood or semen

needles Testing is also important, because many people with an STI may not know they have one. There are a number of STIs that don’t come with significant or visible symptoms, which is why getting tested is the most effective way to stay STI-free. There are great websites, such as Get Tested, that’ll help you locate a local testing center. STD Test Express and SH:24 are great resources for those interested in at-home STI kits and testing. Most STIs can be treated with medication and many are cured with antibiotics. But when risk factors are ignored and STI symptoms go untreated, serious health issues can arise. Some of the most common STIs gonorrhea

chlamydia

human papillomavirus (HPV)

herpes

HIV

syphilis

hepatitis C Each of those infections falls into a class of either bacterial STIs (chlamydia, gonorrhea, and syphilis) or viral STIs (HPV, HIV, herpes, and hepatitis C). Treatment for a bacterial STI is typically a course of antibiotics. Unlike bacterial STIs, most viral STIs can’t be cured with antibiotics. The only one that can be entirely cured with treatment in most cases is hepatitis C. When someone becomes a carrier of a viral STI other than hepatitis C, that person remains a carrier of the virus. Medications are used to help decrease the chances of transmission and protect against the serious health issues that could surface if the STI is untreated. But the virus remains inside the body. Thanks to effective medications and safe sex precautions, most people with viral STIs are able to effectively manage symptoms and reduce their risk for transmitting the infection during sex. Ways to prevent STIs frequent STI testing

condoms and gloves used correctly with each sex act

dams

medications such as pre-exposure prophylaxis (PrEP) or post-exposure prophylaxis (PEP)

vaccinations Talking with a healthcare provider about these options and their effectiveness may help someone decide which combination of methods makes the most sense for them. Previously, there’s been a significant amount of research and data pointing to increased rates of STIs within the LGBTQIA community. More recent studies , however, suggest that flaws in the language, questions, and topics included in past research result in questionable conclusions related to STI disparities and contribute to stigma surrounding the LGBTQIA community. The language used in research should shift away from using gender and sexual identities to categorize certain sexual activities and experiences and instead focus on the sexual acts and behaviors that present the most risk for transmission and contraction of STIs.

Types of sex and ways to make sex safer We frequently hear about the importance of paying attention to our physical and mental health. For many people, it’s important to add sexual health to that list. Sexual health is an important part of your overall health. Sexual health includes: discovering sexual identity and attractions

finding ways to communicate them to others

preventing the transmission of STIs Having access to information about how to stay safe during sex gives people the comfort and confidence to explore and fulfill their sexual desires with less anxiety and worry. Understanding different types of sex and ways to make it safer is the first step in taking charge of your sexual health. Tips for safe oral and penetrative sex Talk with your partner about the last time they were tested for STIs.

Don’t participate in this type of sex if you notice cuts, sores, bumps, or high-risk bodily fluids — such as blood — on their genitals or in their mouth, as this can be signs of an infection and can increase the chances of transmitting an STI. Safe penetrative sex in a front hole, vagina, or anus Penetrative sex, also known as intercourse, is the act of inserting a body part or toy inside someone’s front hole, vagina, or anus. It’s important to be aware that the person being penetrated, also known as the receptive partner, or “bottom,” is typically at a higher risk for contracting STIs than the partner who’s penetrating, also known as the inserting partner or “top.” The risk for transmitting HIV to a bottom during unprotected anal sex is 15 in 1,000 compared with 3 in 10,000 for transmitting HIV from a bottom to a top. Ways to make penetrative sex safer Use a barrier such as a condom. Most condoms are made out of latex, but there are others made out of polyisoprene or polyurethane for those with a latex allergy.

Use a new barrier or condom with each new sexual partner and sexual activity.

Be sure to put the condom on correctly. Pinching the reservoir tip of a condom before rolling it over the penis will leave space to collect semen and reduce the chances the condom will break when the semen is released. The condom should be rolled down to the base of the penis so the barrier is covering the entire body part.

Secure the base ring of the condom when removing the condom-covered penis from the other person’s body. This helps prevent bodily fluids from sliding out of the condom and having contact with your partner.

Never put more than one condom on a penis at one time. Using two condoms on the same penis at this same time increases friction and the likelihood that one or both condoms will break.

Apply lube. Lube cuts down on the amount of friction on a condom, which helps prevent the chance that the condom will break.

When using a condom for penetrative sex, it can be helpful to place lube on the front hole, vagina, or anus before inserting. This will decrease pain and friction while increasing pleasure. Safe oral sex on a clitoris, front hole, vagina, penis, scrotum, or anus Oral sex is when someone uses their mouth to stimulate a partner’s genitals or anus. Ways to make oral sex safer Place a latex barrier between the mouth and body part oral sex is being performed on.

Apply lube to both sides of the barrier to enhance pleasure and decrease the chances of transmitting an infection. Safe sex with hands Fingers and hands can be used during sex to stimulate parts of the body such as the penis, front hole, vagina, mouth, nipples, or anus. Ways to make sex with hands safer Apply a generous amount of lube to help prevent cuts and pain.

Wash your hands and trim your fingernails before using them during sex.

important to note that sex with hands and fingers isn’t a common way of transmitting STIs, but we always want to be as safe as possible.

Use a hand or glove that’s different from the one you used to touch yourself, when touching your partner(s). Safe sex with toys One way to have sex with yourself and with partners is by using toys such as vibrators (can be used on the front hole and vagina), dildos (can be used on the front hole, vagina, and anus), plugs (can be used anally), and beads (can be used anally). These toys can help stimulate body parts both internally and externally. Ways to make sex with toys safer Use a barrier such as a latex condom on toys being used for penetration in the front hole, vagina, anus, or mouth.

If a toy’s been exposed to bodily fluids such as semen, vaginal fluids, saliva, or blood, try not to share it. This can reduce the risk of transmitting an STI.

If you do decide to share a sex toy that’s been used by or with a previous partner, be sure to clean and sanitize it thoroughly, following manufacturer’s instructions. Toys are made out of many different materials and therefore require different methods for sanitization. Some should be cleaned using soap and water while others should be boiled in hot water for a period of time. Follow the manufacturer’s instructions on how to sanitize each toy in the safest, most effective way.

Methods of protection Share on Pinterest Knowing how to properly protect yourself is key to both safe sex and staying in good sexual health. There are a number of different types of sexual protection barriers, including: outside condoms

inside condoms

dams

gloves

lube Water-based lubes are always best with latex condoms. This is because they reduce the chance that the lubricant will break down the barrier and reduce its effectiveness. These methods of protection can and should be used for all kinds of sex, which means everything from touching genitals to penetrative sex. Using barriers during sex helps reduce the risk of getting or giving STIs to sex partners, providing peace of mind that can make sex more fun and pleasurable for everyone. Barriers should also be used with sex toys, if sharing between two or more persons. In order to get the most out of sexual protection barriers, they need to be used correctly and for the appropriate sexual activity. Here’s a step-by-step guide for using some of the most common barriers: Outside condoms (commonly referred to as ‘male condoms’) An outside condom is a sexual protection barrier that can be used for penetrative and oral sex involving a penis. Outside condoms are designed to contain the bodily fluids (such as semen or ejaculate) that are released during sex. This prevents sexual partner(s) from being exposed to anyone’s fluids but their own. Outside condoms can be purchased at convenience stores, grocery stores, and drugstores. They can be purchased at any age and are often free at many health centers and STI testing clinics. For those with a latex allergy, use a non-latex condom made with polyisoprene or polyurethane. How to use an outside condom Make sure to use a new condom that’s not expired. Open the condom gently. Be careful to only tear the wrapper, not the condom. Take a look at the condom before putting in on, keeping your eyes out for any tears or unusual bumps. Place the rim of the condom over the penis, holding the tip in order to leave a small space to capture the bodily fluids that will be released. Roll the condom over the outside of the penis, until the rim of the condom meets the base. Apply lube to the outside of the condom, even if the condom came with existing lubricant. This will help reduce the amount of friction on the condom while also increasing pleasure. At the end of sex, make sure to secure the rim of the condom with your hand as it’s slowly pulled out from your partner’s body. Carefully tie a knot in the condom so bodily fluids can’t escape the barrier. Throw it in the trash. Inside condoms (commonly referred to as ‘female condoms’) An inside condom is a sexual protection barrier that can be used for penetrative sex involving a front hole/vagina or anus. Inside condoms are designed to line the wall of the front hole/vagina or anus in order to prevent bodily fluids from coming into contact with the toy or body part penetrating it. Inside condoms are often harder to find than outside condoms. Only one brand is available in the United States, but health clinics often have them. They’re also available by prescription. How to use an inside condom Just like with outside condoms, make sure to use a new condom that’s not expired.

Open the condom gently. Be careful to only tear the wrapper, not the condom.

Take a look at the condom before putting in on. Keep your eyes out of for any tears or unusual bumps.

Unlike an outside condom (which has one rim/ring), inside condoms have two rims/rings. One rim is closed, and the other is open. This creates a space between the two rims that protects the penetrating toy or body part from the bodily fluids secreted by the front hole/vagina or anus.

Apply a small amount of lube to the outside of the closed end of the condom. This is the part of the condom that will be inserted inside.

Different people have different preferences about the best way to insert an inside condom into the front hole/vagina or anus. A couple options include inserting it while sitting on the edge of a chair, standing, or lying down. Before inserting the condom inside, pinch the closed rim/ring with your fingers so the width is small enough to place inside the hole opening.

Push the closed, pinched rim as far back as possible, allowing the condom to line as much of the internal hole as possible. After it’s placed as far back as possible, remove your finger and allow the open rim of the condom to hang out of the hole opening. There should be around an inch of condom hanging.

When used for sex, a partner will insert a body part or toy into the open rim of the inside condom.

After sex, the penetrating partner should remove the toy or body part from the inside condom slowly.

Gently pinch the open rim of the condom together as you pull the remaining part of the condom from inside the body.

Throw the condom in the trash. Use a new one for another sexual act. Share on Pinterest Dams (also known as dental dams) A dam is a sexual protection barrier used during oral sex to help decrease the risk of contracting or transmitting an STI, such as gonorrhea, HPV, or herpes. Dams can be used with lots of different body parts, including a front hole/vagina, clitoris, and anus. Even though oral sex involving a penis has a higher risk of STI transmission, it’s important to know that oral sex involving other body parts still presents risks. Dams can be harder to find in stores than outside condoms. You can create your own dam by cutting open an outside condom and using it as a barrier between body parts. Check out this step-by-step guide to get you started. How to use a dam Open the dam packaging gently. Be careful to only tear the wrapper, not the dam.

Unfold the dam all the way, ensuring it’s large enough to cover the area of the body where oral sex will be performed.

Apply a small amount of lube to the genitals or anus of the partner receiving oral sex. This increases pleasure and serves as a form of protection.

Place the dam over the body part where oral sex will be performed, keeping it in place between the mouth and body part using one partner’s hands.

During oral sex, be sure to keep the side of the dam that’s against a body part facing the body. Don’t switch sides.

When finished, throw the dam away. Don’t reuse it on another body part or with another partner. Share on Pinterest Gloves Gloves are a great way to prevent the risk of infection when having sex with hands and fingers. They protect genitals from the germs found on hands and also keep hands safe from the bodily fluids that the genitals and anus release during sexual activity. Gloves can also provide a smooth texture that often increases pleasure during sex with hands. How to use gloves After washing and drying your hands, place the glove over the thumb, fingers, and palm.

Apply lube to increase pleasure and avoid friction that could cause the glove to rip or tear.

Use one glove for only one body part. If you switch body parts, put on a new glove.

When finished, pinch the base of the glove below your palm and pull it toward your fingers, causing the glove to turn inside out. This helps the bodily fluids that were on the outside of the glove stay inside.

Tie a knot at the bottom of the glove to keep bodily fluids from dripping out.

Throw the glove in the trash. Lube Lube by itself isn’t the most effective sexual protection method, but it can still act as a protective factor during sex. This is because it prevents excessive friction from occurring, which can break down condoms and cause small tears in the genital area. If using a latex barrier with lube, you’ll want to make sure to use lube that’s safe for latex. Non-water-based lubes can break down latex, causing the latex barrier to become less effective. Water-based lubes, however, are always a good choice. They can be used on latex, toys, and body parts. When the correct lube is used, it can both enhance pleasure and add an extra element of protection. Using lube is easy! Just apply it to a barrier or body part as needed to prevent friction, cuts, and tearing. If used for oral sex, make sure it is an edible lube. Protection for trans bodies Body parts and genitals vary in shape, size, color, and texture among all humans. Trans people use the same methods cisgender people use to engage in safer sex: outside condoms, inside condoms, gloves, and dams. Some trans and nonbinary-identified people choose to use gender-affirming interventions, such as hormones and surgery, to change their body to align with who they are. There are other trans-identified people who don’t feel the need to change their bodies to feel alignment and congruence around gender. There are also many who would like to but can't due to other factors, such as finances, medical reasons, and legal issues (depending on where in the world they live). For those who are able to and choose to pursue gender-affirming interventions (and for their partners), it’s important to have access to information about how those changes impact pleasure, sexual functioning, sexual health, and risk of STI transmission. As mentioned before, there’s no gender or sexual identity that automatically places someone at more of a risk for STI infections. It’s the sexual behaviors someone engages in — not how they identify — that make them more or less at risk. Each person is responsible for doing their part to understand their most appropriate forms of protection for their body. This only leads to safer and more fun sex for them and their partner(s)."

Here we calculate the tidal stress history, and specifically the amplitude of tidal stress, on a fault plane in the two weeks before large earthquakes globally, based on data from the global14, Japanese15, and Californian16 earthquake catalogues. We find that very large earthquakes, including the 2004 Sumatran, 2010 Maule earthquake in Chile and the 2011 Tohoku-Oki earthquake in Japan, tend to occur near the time of maximum tidal stress amplitude. This tendency is not obvious for small earthquakes. However, we also find that the fraction of large earthquakes increases (the b-value of the Gutenberg–Richter relation decreases) as the amplitude of tidal shear stress increases. The relationship is also reasonable, considering the well-known relationship between stress and the b-value17,18,19,20. This suggests that the probability of a tiny rock failure expanding to a gigantic rupture increases with increasing tidal stress levels. We conclude that large earthquakes are more probable during periods of high tidal stress.

Last year I went to one (I tried to refuse but the admin made me go) with my students and they were saying “pregnant people” instead of “women” and telling 15 year olds they could get hormones from PP. My only recourse is asking questions like “why are you calling women ‘pregnant people?'” and “how many genders are there?” Parents need to get involved with their children’s education and stop using it as free babysitting, teachers have no power, parents and students do.﻿

“I’m not trying to play down what Harvey Weinstein is accused of doing,” the production staffer said, “But his victims were adults. Kevin has spent decades using his power and influence to fraternize with young, often underage boys.

“Everyone in the industry knows about Kevin. Spacey’s crimes are some of the worst kept secrets in Hollywood. He preys on young usually ‘straight’ male child or teen stars early on in their career, and of course the ‘straight’ victims don’t say a word about it because they are ashamed.

“The problem of older male power players abusing far younger male and female wannabe or fledgling stars is endemic.”

Multiple sources claim Justin Bieber and Zac Efron were aggressively pursued by Kevin Spacey and Hollywood director Brian Singer when they first entered the entertainment industry as pre-teens.

It is widely accepted in the industry that Justin Bieber’s breakdown and drug and alcohol addiction from 2013 onwards was partly due to the trauma of being forced to take drugs and being sexually assaulted or raped by Singer and Spacey.

Describing Spacey as a man who “shits on those he thinks he is above”, the producer described Spacey “boasting about the tape as though it proved his superiority to the rest of us. He can do whatever he wants, including the worst crimes against the biggest names.”

“Everybody knew about Kevin”

Netflix announced the decision to cancel House of Cards on the same day that Star Trek actor Anthony Rapp accused Spacey of attempting to molest him when he was 14.

“He picked me up like a groom picks up the bride over the threshold,” Anthony Rapp told Buzzfeed. “But I don’t, like, squirm away initially, because I’m like, ‘What’s going on?’ And then he lays down on top of me…He was trying to seduce me…I don’t know if I would have used that language. But I was aware that he was trying to get with me sexually.”

The producer describes the House of Cards cancellation as “painful but necessary”, while alleging that Netflix executives have long been aware of Spacey’s lecherous and predatory behavior and have had contingency plans in place to protect themselves for years.

“They wouldn’t cancel a very profitable show because of one accusation. This is going to blow up much bigger than that and they don’t want to be part of it.”

“There has been hush money paid out on at least three occasions that I know about,” the producer said, also revealing that House of Cards junior production staff have been fired at Spacey’s request as punishment for refusing his sexual advances.

“He was always harassing the male PAs on set, pretending to blow the boom microphone, just basically assuming he was entitled to every young, decent-looking guy he had any power over on the set, straight or gay.”

The producer has also urged investigators to “look into the Kevin Spacey Foundation”, warning that it was set up to allow Spacey close access to young boys in the entertainment industry.

The Kevin Spacey Foundation is an organization of “mentors, advocates and educators” who work with hopeful emerging artists to “discover, fund and co-produce transatlantic musical, dance, theater and film projects,” according to its website, which features a photo of Spacey surrounded by ambitious children hoping to break into the entertainment industry.

In January 2015, at the same time Spacey was promoting his foundation and searching for eager children, a report was published revealing that Spacey’s name was alongside former President Bill Clinton on the logs of visitors who flew on the “Lolita Express.”

Bill Clinton and Kevin Spacey listed as passengers on Jeffrey Epstein’s notorious “Lolita Express”.

The private jet was owned by convicted pedophile and billionaire Jeffrey Epstein. He was found guilty of sex-trafficking girls as young as 12 years old to entertain his wealthy friends at pedophilia parties.

Kevin Spacey and Bill Clinton appear to be just two of those “wealthy friends” who received favors from Epstein.

Clinton’s name was listed on the passenger logs 26 times between 2001 and 2003, revealing that he flew on the plane at least once a month during the two-year period.

Epstein spent just 13 months in prison and home detention for the conviction of solicitation and procurement of minors for prostitution, while his close friends, including Kevin Spacey, faced no ramifications. In the case of Spacey, he continued to promote his foundation, and to encourage parents to let their children work with him.

The kids seemed to really enjoy the shows and especially liked ďThis Ainít No Rag, Itís A FlagĒ and ďIn AmericaĒ. We had a great time with them. We saw Camp X-Ray, where the Taliban detainees are being held only from a distance, but I picked up a lot of whatís going on there from talking with a lot of different people. The truth of the matter is that this operation is under a microscope. The Red Cross has an on site presence there and watches everything that goes on very closely. The media is not telling you the whole truth about whatís going on over there. The truth is that these scum bags are not only being treated humanely, but they are probably better off healthwise and medically than theyíve ever been in their lives They are fed well, able to take showers and receive state of the art medical care. And have their own Moslem chaplain. I saw several of them in a field hospital ward where they were being treated in a state of the art medical facility. Now letís talk about the way they treat our people. First of all, they have to be watched constantly. These people are committed and wanton murderers who are willing to die just to kill someone else. One of the doctors told me that when they had Taliban in the hospital the staff had to really be careful with needles, pens and anything else which could possibly be used as a weapon. They also throw their excrement and urine on the troops who are guarding them. And our guys and gals have shown great restrain in not retaliating. We are spending over a million dollars a day maintaining and guarding these nasty killers and anyone who wants to see them brought to the U.S.A. for trial is either out of their heads or a lawyer looking for money and notoriety. Or both. I wish that the media and the Red Cross and all the rest of the people who are so worried about these criminals would realize that this is not a troop of errant Boy Scouts. These are killers of the worst kind. They donít need protection from us, we need protection from them. If you donít get anything else out of this soapbox, please try to realize that when you see news coverage much of the time youíre not getting the whole story, but an account filtered through a liberal mindset with an agenda. We have two fights on our hands, the war against terror and the one against the loudmouthed lawyers and left wing media who would sap the strength from the American public by making us believe that weíre losing the war or doing something wrong in fighting it. Remember these are the same people who told us that Saddam Hussein's Republican guard was going to be an all but invincible enemy and that our smart bombs and other weapons were not really as good as the military said that they were. They also took up for Bill Clinton while he was cavorting around the Oval office with Monica Lewinsky while the terrorists were gaining strength and bombing our Embassies and dragging the bodies of dead American heroes around the dusty streets of Somalia. Itís a shame that we canít have an unbiased media who would just report the truth and let us make up our own minds. Here I must commend Fox News for presenting both sides much better than the other networks. They are leaving the other cable networks in the dust. People like being told the truth. Our military not only needs but deserves our support. Letís give it to them. The next time you read a media account about the bad treatment of the Taliban in Cuba, remember what I told you. Been there done that. Footnote: I got an e-mail from a rather irate first cousin of mine the other day who has a daughter whoís a lawyer and she seemed to think that I was painting all lawyers with the same brush. Please understand that Iím not doing that at all. That would be like saying that all musicians were drug addicts. There are a lot of good and honest attorneys out there. I happen to have one of them. But it seems that they never get any airtime. Itís always the radicals who get their opinions heard. Who fight the idea of the military tribunals and site The Constitution and the integrity of America as their source of justifying their opinions. Well, first of all The Constitution says Ē We the people of the United StatesĒ, it doesnít mention any other country. And secondly as far as integrity is concerned, I donít think some of these folks would know integrity if it bit them in the posterior. What do you think? God Bless America

The news that has been welcomed by scientists and leaders of the agriculture business alike as a move forward towards the industrial use of marijuana and hemp products could bring a major shift towards marijuana policies in the U.S.A. and ultimately, to the world.

Under present US federal law, it is illegal to possess, use, buy, sell, or cultivate marijuana, since the Controlled Substances Act of 1970 classifies marijuana as a Schedule I drug, although it has been decriminalized to some extent in certain states, Monsanto’s interest in the field has been interpreted by experts as the precursor to “a major shift in marijuana policy in the US” as it is believed the company would not have invested so much time and energy if it had not had “previous knowledge” of the Federal government’s “openness” towards the future legalization of marijuana.

Lawyer and marijuana law specialist, Edmund Groensch, of the Drug Policy Alliance, admits Monsanto’s involvement in marijuana projects could definitely help the pro-legalization activists.

“Currently, Federal law criminalizes marijuana and hemp derivatives because public opinion is still against it and legal commercial production in the U.S. is currently handled by a patchwork of small farmers whom are not trusted by investors. A major player as Monsanto could bring confidence within government and towards investors in the market if it were to own a large part of the exploitable lands and commercial products”.

“There is presently no way to control the production of marijuana and the quality of the strains. A GM strain produced by a company with the credentials and prestige of Monsanto would definitely lend a massive hand to pro-legalization activists within certain spheres of government and within the business world” he explains.

Although Monsanto’s testing on cannabis is only at an experimental stage, no plan has yet been released by the agriculture business firm as to what purposes the patented strain would be used for, although specialists believe answers should come this fall as rumors of a controversial new bill which could “loosen up laws around medical marijuana” is reportedly scheduled to pass before congress coming this fall.

Critics fear genetically modified cannabis will mix with other strains and could destroy the diversity of DNA, a reality dismissed by most studies claim experts."

Fans are filling stadiums from coast to coast to watch America’s pastime. They hope to see their favorite player in action, relive childhood memories, and – perhaps – catch a fly ball.

For well over a century, summer in America has been synonymous with baseball. The greats – Babe Ruth, Jackie Robinson, Willie Mays, and Joe DiMaggio (to name just a few) – have earned a place in history for their skill and for their dedication to the sport. But there is one – Morris “Moe” Berg – whose spot in American history comes not from baseball, but from espionage. He was a catcher who put his multitude of talents to work for his country as an intelligence officer.

The Brainiest Man in Baseball

Moe was born in New York City on March 2, 1902. He began playing baseball as a child, and while majoring in modern languages at Princeton University, he played shortstop on the school team. After graduating from college in 1923, Moe was signed by the Brooklyn Dodgers. He started his career as a first baseman and shortstop. But, Moe was a man of many skills (he spoke 12 languages), and baseball was by no means his only passion.

Off the field, Moe studied French at the Sorbonne in Paris and then decided to attend Columbia University Law School. In 1926, Moe joined the Chicago White Sox, and changed positions from shortstop to catcher. When asked how he did it, Moe replied that “they didn’t call me the brainiest man in baseball for nothing.”

He received his law degree and was admitted to the New York State bar in 1928. He joined the law firm of Satterlee and Canfield and kept playing ball for the White Sox. Moe injured his right knee in 1930, which eventually limited his playing time. In 1931, Moe was traded to the Cleveland Indians, and then to the Washington Senators. The move to Washington would change his life.

Joining a Different Kind of Team

Being a baseball player with vast intellectual gifts, Moe was frequently invited to embassy dinners and parties. He impressed many with his exceptional language ability and quick wit. He soon became very well known around town and caught the attention of the Roosevelt administration.

Moe played with the Senators until 1934; that year, he toured Japan with the American All-Star baseball team. While in Japan, the Japanese-speaking ball player filmed Tokyo Harbor, military installations, and other facilities for the US government.

When he returned from Tokyo, Moe began playing with the Boston Red Sox. While with Boston, Moe played in the inaugural Baseball Hall of Fame game in 1939. He played and coached for the Boston Red Sox until his retirement in 1942.



Shortly afterward, Moe toured Latin America with the Office of Inter-American Affairs, an agency set up to counter Axis propaganda in Latin America. During this trip, Moe used his linguistic talents to meet government officials, journalists, and businessmen.

In 1943, the Office of Strategic Services (OSS) – the forerunner of the CIA – recruited Moe into its ranks. Although he got off to a rocky start in the OSS, he was sent to Switzerland to collect intelligence on Germany’s efforts to build an atomic bomb. He met German physicist Werner Heisenberg, who – during a lecture – let slip his belief that Germany would lose the war and that the Nazis were not close to developing the bomb.

Moe provided the United States with incredibly helpful intelligence during World War II.

Life After World War II

Moe stayed with the OSS until it was dissolved in 1945. Afterward, he served on the staff of NATO’s Advisory Group for Aeronautical Research and Development.

Known as a man of mystery, Moe planned to write a book detailing his career as an intelligence officer. He never wrote the book, and many of his secrets will never be known.

Before his death in 1972, he said, “Maybe I’m not in the Cooperstown Baseball Hall of Fame like so many of my baseball buddies, but I’m happy I had the chance to play pro ball and am especially proud of my contributions to my country. Perhaps I couldn’t hit like Babe Ruth, but I spoke more languages than he did.”"	A Look Back … Moe Berg: Baseball Player, Linguist, Lawyer, Intel Officer — Central Intelligence Agency		[]	['lawyer', 'intelligence', 'shortstop', 'moe', 'playing', 'baseball', 'war', 'player', 'linguist', 'central', 'berg', 'played', 'man', 'intel', 'sox', 'look', 'officer']	"He began playing baseball as a child, and while majoring in modern languages at Princeton University, he played shortstop on the school team.

The U.S. Department of Health and Human Services (HHS) in Washington, D.C., which funds much of the nation’s biomedical research, has launched a “comprehensive review” of human fetal tissue research, to ensure that it’s complying with laws and regulations. The move comes on the heels of letters to the chiefs of HHS and the U.S. Food and Drug Administration (FDA) in Silver Spring, Maryland, from antiabortion groups and lawmakers decrying a recent FDA contract with a firm that supplies fetal tissue. Fetal tissue research is legal under a 1993 law.

“HHS has initiated a comprehensive review of all research involving fetal tissue to ensure consistency with statutes and regulations governing such research,” and to ensure adequate oversight “in light of the serious regulatory, moral, and ethical considerations involved,” the department said in a statement issued yesterday.

The action was accompanied by the abrupt cancellation of a contract under which a company, Advanced Bioscience Resources (ABR) of Alameda, California, was supplying fetal tissue to FDA to create so-called humanized mice for drug testing. HHS also said it would now audit all similar government contracts for tissue procurement.

HHS spokespeople declined to elaborate on the scope of the new research review, but it appears likely to encompass both projects within HHS agencies and work by outside researchers who are funded by HHS grants. The lion’s share of such research is funded by the National Institutes of Health (NIH), which is part of HHS.

In 2018, NIH spent $103 million of its $37 billion budget on projects that used human fetal tissue; it expects to spend $95 million in 2019. In 2017, the most recent year for which a breakout is available, NIH funded 197 projects involving the tissue, at a cost of $98 million. However, NIH does not currently contract with suppliers like ABR to acquire fetal tissue for intramural research, the agency said in a statement today. Human fetal tissue is used most often to study infectious diseases, developmental biology, developmental disorders, and eye disease, as Nature reported in this feature.

Such research has long been controversial. In 2016, Republican members of the House of Representatives, led by Representative Marsha Blackburn (TN), produced a report that urged the federal government to transition to obtaining fetal tissue from miscarriages and stillbirths. But opponents of fetal tissue research have failed repeatedly to pass legislation that would end funding for research using tissue from electively aborted fetuses—most recently earlier this month, when language prohibiting such funding was stripped from a 2019 HHS spending bill.

The battle now appears to be shifting to the executive branch. Yesterday, HHS said it was canceling a $15,900 contract to ABR to supply tissue to FDA because “it was not sufficiently assured” that the tissue will be obtained in a way that comports with the law that governs fetal tissue research. That 1993 law specifies that firms may not profit from transferring fetal tissue, but can collect “reasonable payments” such as for processing, storage, and transportation. FDA was implanting the tissue into mice to create humanized mice that have immune systems that behave like a human’s, and can be used to test drugs for safety and effectiveness.

FDA also wrote to the company that it’s not convinced that the contract, which was awarded this past July, should have been finalized without a competition. A few months ago, FDA had determined that ABR was the only firm in the country that could provide the tissue.

As recently as this past August, FDA had defended the ABR contract and its use of human fetal tissue, writing to a reporter with CNSnews.com that the agency “has in place systems to ensure” that any research by the agency, in house, or by contractors, complies with federal and state laws and regulations. FDA, the statement said, “is committed to ensuring that its [fetal tissue] research … meets the highest ethical standards.”

On 11 September, 45 antiabortion groups wrote to HHS Secretary Alex Azar that they were “shocked and dismayed” by the FDA contract. On 17 September, 85 members of Congress wrote a similar letter to FDA Commissioner Scott Gottlieb asking him to cancel the contract.

Reacting to HHS’s actions yesterday, Alta Charo, a professor of law and bioethics at the University of Wisconsin in Madison, said: “My instinct is that this is driven by politics, and is part of the overall effort to stigmatize and eventually criminalize abortion, as well as part of a larger campaign to roll back the clock on sexual and reproductive rights.”

Lawrence Goldstein, a neuroscientist at the University of California, San Diego, worried about the effect of HHS’s action on firms like ABR. “It could have a chilling effect on valuable research because companies who provide tissue may be scared out of use and provision,” he said.

Ross McKinney, chief scientific officer at the Association of American Medical Colleges in Washington, D.C., called fetal tissue “an important resource for biomedical research.” He added: “Fetal tissue research is already subject to a robust ethical and legal framework and research that continues to meet those standards should be continued.”

Abortion opponents, on the other hand, argued that HHS has not gone far enough. Marjorie Dannenfelser, president of the Susan B. Anthony List in Washington, D.C., which spearheaded the letter to Azar, called his action “completely inadequate. … Secretary Azar must put an immediate moratorium on funding for research using aborted baby organs and tissue purchased from the abortion industry,” she said in this statement."

John Joyce said that his trip to the U.S.-Mexico border in Arizona was a fact-finding mission that turned into an eye-opening experience.

Joyce, a Republican member of the House Homeland Security Committee, went on the trip led by Rep. Andy Biggs, a Republican from Arizona, from Tuesday to Thursday.

“My takeaway is after having seen firsthand what is going on, after sitting down and talking to border agents, the message is we need to build the wall,” he said on a conference call with reporters Thursday morning. “The wall frees up our agents to do their job.”

Joyce said the trip allowed him to see firsthand the crisis at the border and what is needed from Congress to allow border patrol agents to do their job better. He said he also wanted to see the damage Democrats have caused by claiming for months that there is no crisis at the border.

“Speaker (Nancy) Pelosi said it was manufactured and I had to laugh,” he said. “After what I have seen, this crisis is real.”

During his trip he visited an Arizona-based company that could build a mile of wall a day to secure the border. He also visited an area where it is believed people enter the country illegally through shallow portions of the Colorado River.

He also had dinner with border patrol agents. He said they related that they are often stretched thin.

He also did a ride-along.

He said the agents often work double shifts, occasionally using outdated technology.

He said he witnessed a group of 32 adults illegally crossing the border, each of them with a child. The Drug Enforcement Administration also confiscated a large amount of heroin and fentanyl that was being brought into the country.

“They made an interesting point that they have seen more of the manufactured drugs, more methamphetamine and more fentanyl because it cuts out the growers and it makes the cartels financially more productive,” he said.

He said that smugglers will sometimes use the distraction caused by a large group of migrants with children to cross the border into the United States.

“I was surprised (by) the number of undocumented aliens who sit down and give themselves up. They wanted to be brought into the system (and) then it became clear to me why,” he said. “The case was they were housed, they were fed and many of them were being released, many within two days.”

When he returns to Washington, Joyce said he will be co-sponsoring a bill introduced by New York Republican U.S. Rep. Doug Collins to close immigration loopholes. He said that often people use children to cross the border. The bill will ensure that children are released to a legal guardian or parent and are not put back into a system to help people cross the border.

“We, as Congress, need to get that fixed,” he said.

Joyce, a doctor by trade, said that he has always been concerned about health issues at the border. He said that there are 12 cases of multiple-drug-resistant strains of tuberculosis. He said that it is a bacterial lung inflection that often takes six to 12 months to treat. These cases require more than a year’s worth of treatment.

“My concern is what about the person who wasn’t coughing and wasn’t recognized as having tuberculosis, and they didn’t come here for treatment for their disease,” he said. “They could be released in a day and a half and be sitting at a restaurant (table) beside you.”"	Joyce: The border ‘crisis is real’	2019-04-19 01:00:00+00:00	['Michelle Ganassi']	['agents', 'crisis', 'real', 'trip', 'seen', 'released', 'wall', 'joyce', 'cross', 'rep', 'republican', 'border']	"U.S. Rep.
