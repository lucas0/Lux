TX AK HI FL Note: Montana authorized its counties to mail ballots to all voters but in counties that opt not to, voters will still need to apply for an absentee ballot.\n\nAt least three-quarters of all American voters will be eligible to receive a ballot in the mail for the 2020 election  the most in U.S. history, according to a New York Times analysis. If recent election trends hold and turnout increases, as experts predict, roughly 80 million mail ballots will flood election offices this fall, more than double the number that were returned in 2016.\n\nThe rapid and seismic shift in how Americans will vote is because of the coronavirus pandemic. Concerns about the potential for virus transmission at polling places have forced many states to make adjustments on the fly that  despite President Trumps protests  will make mail voting in America more accessible this fall than ever before.\n\nI have a hard time looking back at history and finding an election where there was this significant of a change to how elections are administered in this short a time period, said Alex Padilla, the California secretary of state who chairs the Democratic Association of Secretaries of State.\n\nMost of the changes are temporary and have been made administratively by state and local officials who have the power to make adjustments during emergencies like the pandemic.\n\nMail voting rules for the 2020 election Ballots mailed Absentee allowed for all Excuse required\n\n\n\n\n\n\n\n\n\nAll states allow at least some mail voting, but some will make it more accessible to voters than others. In nine states and Washington, D.C., every registered voter will be mailed a ballot ahead of the election. California, D.C. and Vermont will do this for the first time this fall. In 33 states, voters can cite the coronavirus as a reason to vote absentee or they can cast absentee ballots without specifying a reason. In nine states, every registered voter will automatically be mailed an application to request an absentee ballot. In 24 states, voters will need to procure an application for an absentee ballot themselves. In eight states, voters still need a reason beyond the virus to vote absentee. That means many voters in these states will need to vote in person at a polling place, barring any last-minute rule changes.\n\nSeveral of the states that made changes for the primaries are keeping them in place for the general election, while others are making separate adjustments for the fall. A handful of states have not made any modifications and appear unlikely to do so.\n\nOver all, 26 states and Washington, D.C., have in some way expanded voter access to mail ballots for the 2020 general election, with the broad goal of making it easier for people to vote amid a global health crisis. And in some states that maintained relatively strict rules, individual counties have undertaken similar efforts.\n\nChanges to voting in fall 2020 Ballots mailed Absentee allowed for all Excuse required States that made changes Sending ballots to all voters Sending absentee ballot applications to all voters Allowing no-excuse absentee voting IA MO CA NJ NV CT DE IL MD DE MA DC WI VT MA NM Allowing voters to cite Covid to vote absentee Other changes to ease absentee voting AL AR SC CT NH MI MN MT NC VA RI WV PA OK States that made no changes OR AZ FL GA KS CO HI AK ID KY LA MS IN UT WA NE ND NY TN ME OH SD WY TX States that made changes Sending ballots to all voters CA DC NJ NV VT Sending absentee ballot applications to all voters CT MD DE IL IA MA WI NM Allowing for no-excuse absentee voting MO DE MA Allowing voters to cite Covid to vote absentee AL AR CT NH WV Other changes to ease absentee voting NC MI MN MT OK PA SC RI VA No changes made OR UT WA CO HI AK AZ FL GA ID KS ME NE ND OH SD WY IN KY LA MS NY TN TX States that made changes Sending ballots to all voters Sending absentee ballot applications to all voters CA NJ NV CT MA DC DE IL IA WI VT MD NM Allowing for no-excuse absentee voting Allowing voters to cite Covid to vote absentee MO AL AR DE MA CT NH WV Other changes to ease absentee voting NC MN RI VA MI MT OK PA SC No changes made KS OR AZ FL GA CO HI AK ID UT WA ME NE ND OH SD WY IN KY LA MS NY TN TX Note: Connecticut, Delaware, and Massachusetts have authorized absentee voting for all voters and will also mail absentee ballot applications.\n\nSeveral new pieces of state legislation are also still pending, and experts say more changes could be forthcoming through executive action, litigation or other mechanisms in a few states, including New York.\n\nBut they also note that many Americans who choose to vote by mail this cycle because of the virus will simply be leveraging options that have long been available to them under existing laws.\n\nMore mail votes, higher turnout\n\nDuring the presidential primaries, many states that made it easier for people to vote by mail saw higher turnout than states that made fewer changes.\n\nOf the states that have held presidential primaries and caucuses this year, 31 saw an increase in turnout compared with 2016. Of those, 18 had sent either ballots or ballot applications to all voters ahead of the primaries.\n\nTurnout in presidential primaries and caucuses Change in primary turnout, 2016-2020 Lower turnout Higher turnout 25% Same +25% States that sent ballots or ballot applications NE KY MT OR NV OH IA NJ MD CO KS States that did not HI RI UT AK ID ND WA 75% More voted by mail WV SD CA TX MI IN WI DC NM AZ PA Percentage that voted absentee in 2020 primary 50% NY ME DE NC GA FL 25% Fewer voted by mail AL MS SC OK LA VT IL VA States that did not States that sent ballots or ballot applications Lower turnout Higher turnout Change in primary turnout, 2016-2020 25% Same +25% NE KY MT OR NV OH IA NJ MD CO KS HI RI UT AK ID ND WA More voted by mail 75% WV SD CA TX MI IN DC NM WI AZ PA 50% Percentage that voted absentee in 2020 primary NY ME DE NC GA FL Fewer voted by mail 25% AL MS SC OK LA VT IL VA States that sent ballots or ballot applications States that did not Change in primary turnout, 2016-2020 25% Same +25% NE KY MT OR NV OH IA NJ MD CO KS HI RI UT AK ID ND WA 75% WV SD CA TX MI IN DC NM WI PA AZ 50% ME NC DE GA FL Percentage that voted absentee in 2020 primary NY 25% OK LA AL MS SC VT IL VA Note: Seven states that have had primaries or caucuses are not shown in the chart because vote-by-mail data is not available. Of those, Minnesota and Wyoming had overall increases in turnout. Arkansas, Massachusetts, Missouri, New Hampshire and Tennessee had decreases in turnout.\n\nSix states continued to require voters to have a reason other than the virus in order to vote absentee in the primaries. In those states, voter turnout stayed roughly the same as 2016.\n\nMichael P. McDonald, a University of Florida professor who studies American elections, said that recent election trends, including many of this years primaries, have indicated that turnout will be up in the fall compared with 2016, and that the widespread use of mail voting will shatter previous records.\n\nIts sort of trite to say that youre going to have the highest turnout rate of your lifetime or this is the most important election of your lifetime, but it really feels like that, he said. Im still expecting this to have very high turnout in November. The outstanding question that we have is just: Will the election system be able to bear that?\n\nIndeed, the primaries also exposed the myriad problems that elections officials and voters could face this fall.\n\nIn Wisconsin, 11th-hour court rulings, long lines at the polls, a backlog of absentee ballot requests and complaints about missing or nullified mail ballots stretched the system to the brink of collapse. In Georgias most populous county, voters encountered an election meltdown rife with their own interminable lines and malfunctioning technology. And in New York, it took several weeks for overwhelmed officials to count thousands of mail ballots and deliver results.\n\nAll the while, Mr. Trump has fiercely criticized mail voting  while allowing that military members and older Americans should be allowed to vote absentee  saying that sending ballots to voters directly would compromise the elections integrity. More broadly, some Republicans have continued to insist without evidence that voting by mail favors Democrats.\n\nMail voting has expanded unevenly along somewhat partisan lines: Several of the states identified by The Cook Political Report as solid or likely Democratic in the 2020 general election have implemented some of the most expansive mail voting programs; many of the states identified as solid or likely Republican have continued to restrict access to mail voting.\n\nCook Political Report ratings for 2020 Electoral College Ballots mailed Absentee allowed for all Excuse required Solid + Likely Democratic Toss-ups and leans Solid + Likely Republican CA DC NJ AZ FL GA IA ME-2 UT AL AR CO HI AK ID MO MT KS OR VT WA CT MI MN NC NE-2 NH ND NE NV DE ME ME-1 PA WI IL MA OH TX NE-1 NE-3 OK SD WV MD NY KY LA MS NM RI VA WY IN SC TN Solid + Likely Democratic OR VT CA DC NJ NV CO HI ME ME-1 MD WA CT DE IL MA NY NM RI VA Toss-ups and leans AZ FL GA IA ME-2 MI MN NC PA WI NE-2 NH OH TX Solid + Likely Republican KS MO MT UT AL AR AK ID ND NE NE-1 NE-3 OK SD WV WY KY LA MS SC IN TN Solid + Likely Democratic Toss-ups and leans Solid + Likely Republican CA DC AZ FL GA IA UT AL AR CO HI AK MO OR KS MT NJ VT ME-2 MI MN NC ID NV CT DE IL PA ND NE NE-1 NE-3 WA NE-2 NH OH MA ME ME-1 MD WI OK SD WV TX WY KY LA MS NM RI NY IN VA SC TN Note: Maine and Nebraska select electors using the District method, in which each congressional district in the state selects its own elector, and the remaining two electoral college votes are determined by the popular vote winner.\n\nStudies have repeatedly shown that voting fraud of any kind is extremely rare in the United States. And states and counties that have transitioned to all-mail voting have seen little evidence of partisan advantage.\n\nPotential problems in November\n\nResearchers said that thinly stretched election offices might quickly become overwhelmed by the volume of mail ballots. To help lessen their load, elections officials in several key swing states have already asked that lawmakers give them more leeway to prepare absentee ballots for counting as they arrive rather than after the polls close.\n\nTheir problems could be compounded by a lack of funding for the Postal Service. If there are slowdowns in either election offices or post offices, experts said, ballots may not get sent out in a timely manner or returned by postmark deadlines.\n\nRichard L. Hasen, a professor of law and political science at the University of California, Irvine, said he remained very worried that scores of voters would be disenfranchised through no fault of their own. Because many voters will be unfamiliar with the mail voting process, he and other experts said, they were concerned that voters could make unintentional technical errors when marking, signing, sealing or sending a ballot, leading to their ballots eventually being rejected.\n\nAnd those voting in person may have to confront poll worker shortages that onlookers say are likely to be exacerbated by the pandemic.\n\nIts going to be bumpy, said Amber McReynolds, the chief executive of the National Vote at Home Institute and Coalition. Will it be a disaster in a particular state? Thats hard to tell at this moment.\n\nWell-prepared states that are accustomed to counting a high number of mail ballots  and where the presidential race is not close  could get called on election night. But experts say that in other states, the counting could delay race calls for at least a day or two. And in states where the presidential contest is tight and laws are inflexible, a clear picture of who has won could take weeks to develop.\n\nDespite the challenges, Phil Keisling, who was Oregons secretary of state when it began mailing ballots to voters more than two decades ago, was among more than a half-dozen experts who expressed faith that election administrators would get their jobs done.\n\nTens of millions of people are in election terra incognita, and so theres anxiety, and its understandable, Mr. Keisling said. But I am guardedly optimistic that we will run an election that will meet very high standards of professionalism, and that the vast majority of Americans, even if they dont like the results, are going to believe that the results are fair.'	b'A Record 76% of Americans Can Vote by Mail in 2020'	2020-08-11	[b'Juliette Love', b'Matt Stevens', b'Lazaro Gamio']	[b'record', b'voting', b'voters', b'americans', b'election', b'mail', b'turnout', b'vote', b'absentee', b'ballots', b'76', b'states', b'million', b'2020', b'dc']	b'Ballots mailed directly to all voters Absentee voting allowed for all Excuse required for absentee voting 21% 55% 24% 44 million voters in nine states + D.C. 115 million voters in 33 states 50 million voters in eight states Vt.

More broadly, some Republicans have continued to insist without evidence that voting by mail favors Democrats.\n\nMail voting has expanded unevenly along somewhat partisan lines: Several of the states identified by The Cook Political Report as solid or likely Democratic in the 2020 general election have implemented some of the most expansive mail voting programs; many of the states identified as solid or likely Republican have continued to restrict access to mail voting.\n\nCook Political Report ratings for 2020 Electoral College Ballots mailed Absentee allowed for all Excuse required Solid + Likely Democratic Toss-ups and leans Solid + Likely Republican CA DC NJ AZ FL GA IA ME-2 UT AL AR CO HI AK ID MO MT KS OR VT WA CT MI MN NC NE-2 NH ND NE NV DE ME ME-1 PA WI IL MA OH TX NE-1 NE-3 OK SD WV MD NY KY LA MS NM RI VA WY IN SC TN Solid + Likely Democratic OR VT CA DC NJ NV CO HI ME ME-1 MD WA CT DE IL MA NY NM RI VA Toss-ups and leans AZ FL GA IA ME-2 MI MN NC PA WI NE-2 NH OH TX Solid + Likely Republican KS MO MT UT AL AR AK ID ND NE NE-1 NE-3 OK SD WV WY KY LA MS SC IN TN Solid + Likely Democratic Toss-ups and leans Solid + Likely Republican CA DC AZ FL GA IA UT AL AR CO HI AK MO OR KS MT NJ VT ME-2 MI MN NC ID NV CT DE IL PA ND NE NE-1 NE-3 WA NE-2 NH OH MA ME ME-1 MD WI OK SD WV TX WY KY LA MS NM RI NY IN VA SC TN Note: Maine and Nebraska select electors using the District method, in which each congressional district in the state selects its own elector, and the remaining two electoral college votes are determined by the popular vote winner.\n\nStudies have repeatedly shown that voting fraud of any kind is extremely rare in the United States. And states and counties that have transitioned to all-mail voting have seen little evidence of partisan advantage.\n\nPotential problems in November\n\nResearchers said that thinly stretched election offices might quickly become overwhelmed by the volume of mail ballots. To help lessen their load, elections officials in several key swing states have already asked that lawmakers give them more leeway to prepare absentee ballots for counting as they arrive rather than after the polls close.\n\nTheir problems could be compounded by a lack of funding for the Postal Service. If there are slowdowns in either election offices or post offices, experts said, ballots may not get sent out in a timely manner or returned by postmark deadlines.\n\nRichard L. Hasen, a professor of law and political science at the University of California, Irvine, said he remained very worried that scores of voters would be disenfranchised through no fault of their own. Because many voters will be unfamiliar with the mail voting process, he and other experts said, they were concerned that voters could make unintentional technical errors when marking, signing, sealing or sending a ballot, leading to their ballots eventually being rejected.\n\nAnd those voting in person may have to confront poll worker shortages that onlookers say are likely to be exacerbated by the pandemic.\n\nIts going to be bumpy, said Amber McReynolds, the chief executive of the National Vote at Home Institute and Coalition. Will it be a disaster in a particular state? Thats hard to tell at this moment.\n\nWell-prepared states that are accustomed to counting a high number of mail ballots  and where the presidential race is not close  could get called on election night. But experts say that in other states, the counting could delay race calls for at least a day or two. And in states where the presidential contest is tight and laws are inflexible, a clear picture of who has won could take weeks to develop.\n\nDespite the challenges, Phil Keisling, who was Oregons secretary of state when it began mailing ballots to voters more than two decades ago, was among more than a half-dozen experts who expressed faith that election administrators would get their jobs done.\n\nTens of millions of people are in election terra incognita, and so theres anxiety, and its understandable, Mr. Keisling said. But I am guardedly optimistic that we will run an election that will meet very high standards of professionalism, and that the vast majority of Americans, even if they dont like the results, are going to believe that the results are fair.'

This is The Daily. Today: Newly unearthed documents tell the story of a rich, environmentally-minded heiress who helped sow the seeds of the modern anti-immigration movement. My colleague Nick Kulish tells Natalie Kitroeff about his investigation. Its Monday, August 19.\n\nnicholas kulish\n\nHer name is pronounced Cordelia Scaife May.\n\nnatalie kitroeff\n\nScaife.\n\nnicholas kulish\n\nScaife.\n\nnatalie kitroeff\n\nTell me about Cordelia Scaife Mays life as a young woman.\n\nnicholas kulish\n\nCordelia May was born in Pittsburgh in 1928. And when the first photos of her appeared on the front pages of newspapers around the country, they asked, could this be the richest baby in the world?\n\n[music]\n\nnicholas kulish\n\nShe was an heiress to the Mellon family fortune. They were barons of banking, titans of industry with oil, aluminum, all the sort of might of Pittsburgh distilled into cold, hard cash. She was raised outside Pittsburgh in a mansion that was known as Penguin Court because her mother was trying to breed and raise emperor penguins to waddle the ground. She was so excited about Admiral Byrds Antarctic expeditions.\n\narchived recording Expeditions have been sent or are expected to be sent by Britain, Australia, Norway, Chile, Russia and the Argentine. But Admiral Byrds will surely be the biggest.\n\nnicholas kulish\n\nCordelia herself as a young girl was super into animals. She had purebred dogs. The family had horses. She was very into nature, and birds in particular. You know, from the outside, it seemed like Cordelia had this fabulous life. But actually, she was quite unhappy. Her mother was an alcoholic, and she once described that there was no laughter in her household growing up.\n\nnatalie kitroeff\n\nSo whats the story that explains how she gets from that childhood to her interest in immigration policy?\n\nnicholas kulish\n\nYou know, its actually a long story, and a story that begins in her youth with her unlikely friendship or admiration for Margaret Sanger, the founder of Planned Parenthood.\n\narchived recording (margaret sanger) I guess I was what I would call a born humanitarian.\n\nnicholas kulish\n\nSanger was a close friend of her grandmothers, and someone she described as the only person who brought any joy into her house as a child. Initially she wasnt drawn to Sanger because of her politics and her pursuit of family planning and birth control for women. It was actually that shed been to jail, which appealed to Cordelias rebellious streak as a young woman.\n\nnatalie kitroeff\n\nSo she thinks Sanger is cool.\n\nnicholas kulish\n\nShe thinks Sanger is very cool. But over time, that friendship and her desire to emulate Margaret Sanger led her to engage deeply with Planned Parenthood and other birth control and population issues.\n\nnatalie kitroeff\n\nAnd at this point, what is Planned Parenthood and Sangers work all about?\n\nnicholas kulish\n\nAt that point, its really about access to contraceptives. Its about family planning. Its about taking women, first in the United States and then around the world, from just having as many kids as they end up getting pregnant with, and choosing, I want to have two kids. I want to have three kids. This is when I want to have them. Family planning in the most literal sense.\n\narchived recording (cordelia may) The people that come to our organization and want to have the same methods or whatever it is that one can have to prevent pregnancy. And those women will say to us, I  we ask their religion very often. And they say, I am a Catholic. I was raised in the Catholic church. This, my church is wrong on this. And that is said over and over and over again.\n\nnatalie kitroeff\n\nAnd what about that is attractive to May? Why is that interesting to this heiress?\n\nnicholas kulish\n\nShe was really passionate about the natural environment and preserving it. And that really dovetails with birth control for her, because she sees overpopulation as destroying the habitats of the animals that she loves so much. But in addition to that, she was  from what we read in her letters, she was a feminist. She cared about womens issues. Women should have a right to plan their smaller families, and the birds and the bees and the bunny rabbits should have as much room to roam as possible.\n\nnatalie kitroeff\n\nSo what does she do with that new focus?\n\nnicholas kulish\n\nWell, she becomes involved with a group known as the Population Council, which was founded by a member of another of Americas great families, John D. Rockefeller III.\n\narchived recording Gushing oil, Americas black gold, was the foundation of his empire. Today, the giants of the oil industry stand as monuments to Rockefeller, the architect of our business age.\n\nnicholas kulish\n\nThe Population Councils goal was to lower birthrates around the world, and she went to birth control clinics in Chicago. She visited family planning efforts in Korea and Japan and Taiwan. And perhaps most importantly, she and her family gave $11.4 million to the council during the 1960s, which was a lot of money in those days. As time goes on, you can see her already becoming more militant. In the 1970s, shes sort of pushing up against the Population Councils desire to stick with contraceptives and keep abortion at arms length. And she and her representatives are saying, we have to make abortion upon request something thats available to all women. The pace of controlling population is too slow. The growth of the global population is too much.\n\nnatalie kitroeff\n\nSo she starts to take more hard-line positions, even though, in this case, its about something we now think of as a progressive measure, which is universal access to abortion.\n\nnicholas kulish\n\nRight, exactly. Abortion appears to be less about family planning and more about controlling the population.\n\nnatalie kitroeff\n\nSo where does her story go from here?\n\nnicholas kulish\n\nWell, something very important and actually tragic takes place in her life. In August 1973, she secretly marries her childhood friend and longtime companion, Robert W. Duggan. And he is the district attorney for the county that includes Pittsburgh. And rather than a giant, lavish wedding in a cathedral somewhere, they get married in a rinky-dink little room with knotty pine walls on Lake Tahoe in Nevada. They pay a justice of the peace $5. And perhaps more importantly, they dont tell anyone. So if youre this heiress, why do you have this quickie wedding? Well, her longtime friend, her longtime companion, is under investigation for corruption. He has apparently been taking payoffs from illegal gambling rings, you know, to look the other way. And essentially, his defense is, Im getting the money from her. Unfortunately, this defense does not work. The investigation and the prosecution starts closing in on him. And eventually, he is indicted for tax evasion. And on the day that he is indicted, he is found dead from a shotgun wound outside his country house. It appears that he shot himself, that its a self-inflicted wound.\n\nnatalie kitroeff\n\nSo how does that tragedy affect her work?\n\nnicholas kulish\n\nIt appears  and theres a little speculation involved in this, obviously. But it appears to make her a little more radical. Theres a harder edge to her letters and to what shes writing to people at that time after the tragedy. And her attitude toward family planning starts to change. Her aide goes to the Population Council and tells them that she thinks family planning is a waste of money. The Rockefeller aide who takes the meeting says that he almost got the impression that she favored compulsory sterilization. And for the first time, something comes up that wed never seen before, which is the idea that, quote, the U.S. should seal its border with Mexico.\n\nnatalie kitroeff\n\nAnd how do you understand why she made this jump from being so focused on population control to immigration?\n\nnicholas kulish\n\nTheres a sort of confluence of events that helps bring this about, right?\n\narchived recording Dr. Ehrlich, when did the thought first come to you that perhaps our time as mankind on Earth was limited? archived recording (paul ehrlich) Oh, it came in 1949 when \n\nnicholas kulish\n\nPopulation control was a really big concern with the baby boom.\n\narchived recording (paul ehrlich) The thing thats important remember about population control is that if we want to avoid a tremendous rise in the death rate, we absolutely must have a tremendous decrease in the birthrate.\n\nnicholas kulish\n\nNow, theres a famous book called The Population Bomb by a Stanford professor named Paul Ehrlich.\n\narchived recording (paul ehrlich) So the first thing that should happen is that the president ought to say, from now, here on out, no intelligent, patriotic American family ought to have more than two children, preferably one if youre starting a family now  not any law, but just say this is what responsible people do.\n\nnicholas kulish\n\nBut in the late 1970s, the birthrate has fallen quite a bit. Were out of the baby boom at this point. And among the biggest contributors to population growth in the United States is immigration.\n\narchived recording America was founded by immigrants. We are the so-called melting pot of the world. And most of those immigrants entered this nation legally.\n\nnicholas kulish\n\nIn 1978, Border Patrol apprehended close to 900,000 unauthorized immigrants.\n\narchived recording Today, however, illegal aliens are a great and continuing problem.\n\nnicholas kulish\n\nAnd another 600,000 legal immigrants are also arriving, the greatest number since the 1920s. So if your concern is how many people are there in the United States, then your focus starts to shift toward immigrants.\n\nnatalie kitroeff\n\nDoes she seem to care who the immigrants are? Is there part of this thats about race?\n\nnicholas kulish\n\nShe says that its not about race. Very colorfully, she says, why cant we just imagine putting paper bags over the heads of the immigrants so were only counting their deleterious numbers rather than being accused of racism because most of these people happen to not be white? And yet in one of her most strident documents, she isnt saying, the Norwegians are pouring into Minnesota. Its Filipinos in Hawaii, as she puts it, quote, Orientals sneaking across the Canadian border, Latin Americans coming into Florida. And she says that the Cuban refugees, quote, breed like hamsters.\n\nnatalie kitroeff\n\nSo the language at least suggests that at least some of this is about racism.\n\nnicholas kulish\n\nShe says she isnt racist, but the people that shes worried about are not the white immigrants. Its the immigrants from non-white countries that shes preoccupied with.\n\n[music]\n\nnatalie kitroeff\n\nWell be right back. Nick, why does this matter for the modern immigration movement? What exactly does that have to do with the evolving views of this one rich woman?\n\nnicholas kulish\n\nIt matters because Cordelia Scaife May puts her money where her mouth is. And she has a lot of money. Equally important is in 1978, she meets a very unusual gentleman named Dr. John Tanton, an ophthalmologist who, in his spare time, likes to form political advocacy groups.\n\nnatalie kitroeff\n\nHes an ophthalmologist who  his side gig is forming public pressure groups?\n\nnicholas kulish\n\nExactly. Hes like a character out of a Frank Capra movie up in this small town in Michigan, this very charismatic, good-looking, square-jawed guy whos just great at getting people excited about an issue. Its weird, but hes really good at it. He actually was involved in a lot of the same issues. He was involved in environmental issues. He was involved in a group called Zero Population Growth, which was exactly what it sounds like. So through these circles from the population movement, Dr. Tanton got acquainted with Mrs. May. And he came to her seeking her help, which is to say her money, to get his group, the Federation for American Immigration Reform, off the ground.\n\nnatalie kitroeff\n\nAnd does she help out?\n\nnicholas kulish\n\nShe does. She provides him with $50,000 in seed money, with the one condition that she remains anonymous. She is in the background. She is not tied to this work.\n\n[music]\n\nnicholas kulish\n\nAnd he starts the group, and she gives him more money, and more money, and more money, to the point where theres an internal memorandum where he writes that Mrs. May has been our single biggest supporter. She just gave us another $400,000. That relationship is pretty well under control. And the more money that she gives him, the more ambitious he becomes. He spins off the research arm of FAIR into something called the Center for Immigration Studies.\n\narchived recording The Center for Immigration Studies, a nonprofit public interest institution, looking into immigrations effects on social and economic interests in the U.S.\n\nnicholas kulish\n\nHe moves the legal litigation group and turns it into the Immigration Reform Law Institute.\n\narchived recording Were a national public interest organization working for rational immigration policies. We seek to end illegal immigration and maintain legal immigration rates under an overall ceiling consistent with Americas domestic priorities.\n\nnicholas kulish\n\nPretty soon, hes starting to build almost an ecosystem of groups that reinforce each other. The Center for Immigration Studies has a report that is cited by FAIR or is used in a legal memorandum thats written by the Immigration Reform Law Institute. And it isnt clear to everyone that these groups are all coming from the same place.\n\nnatalie kitroeff\n\nNick, given that May comes from a very well-known and very wealthy family, I wonder if they have a reaction to the way that shes suddenly spending the family fortune.\n\nnicholas kulish\n\nThere are some family members who are also contributing to this cause. But in one instance that really upset her, she describes in a letter how a young cousin asked her whether the causes she were supporting werent discriminatory, racist. And what actually bothers her the most is not the accusation that it could be racist or discriminatory, but, as she puts it, the one that really puts my teeth on edge ... elitist. And so in response to this cousins question, she goes home and produces a five-page, typed response in which she tries to lay out her ideas. And this is, by the way, a document that was never before public and I think is the most complete record of her ideas on this subject. In her view, legal and illegal immigration lead to overpopulation. And that is responsible for a whole host of ills. She calls it the root cause of unemployment, inflation, urban sprawl, highway, skyway congestion, shortages of all sorts, not the least of which is energy, vanishing farmland, environmental deterioration and civil unrest. And she talks about how medical science has succeeded in reducing infant mortality rates, but its juxtaposed in the very same sentence with the idea of veterinarians prolonging the lives, quote, of useless cattle. She talks about how birthrates have dropped in a few areas, and millions die of starvation every year, but population growths continue to climb. And theres certain things  its uncomfortable when you read even wars no longer make much dent; during the 11 years of conflict, both North and South Vietnam showed a net increase in population.\n\nnatalie kitroeff\n\nYikes.\n\nnicholas kulish\n\nAnd this is also the place where she talks about this idea that the country is being invaded.\n\nnatalie kitroeff\n\nSo help us understand Mays actual impact on the development of this movement, which feels so connected to the ideas that shes articulating here.\n\nnicholas kulish\n\nWell, there are all these groups. The big three that people think about the most are NumbersUSA, the Center for Immigration Studies and the Federation for American Immigration Reform. And they put their might together and are able to pressure, at all levels, the government  at the local level, at the state level.\n\narchived recording Elizabeth Mayor Thomas Dunn has instructed his city employees to speak only English during working hours. The English-only rule, according to the mayor, applies to business and private conversations as well.\n\nnicholas kulish\n\nPushing English language laws.\n\narchived recording The Senate Judiciary Committee began considering a proposed constitutional amendment to make English the official language of the United States.\n\nnicholas kulish\n\nLaws that make it tougher for illegal immigrants to live in certain towns.\n\narchived recording Californias Republican Governor Pete Wilson wants to cut off social services to illegal immigrants and to deny citizenship to their U.S.-born children.\n\nnicholas kulish\n\nProposition 187 that was meant to restrict public benefits to undocumented people in California.\n\narchived recording After he announced his proposals in August, his poll ratings rose. Wilson finds support among members of such groups as the Federation for American Immigration Reform. Thats a national organization, which contends that immigrants are a drain on Americas resources.\n\nnicholas kulish\n\nThis goes all the way up to Congress.\n\narchived recording (george w. bush) The United States Senate is debating a very vital issue for our country, and that is immigration reform. I urge the senators to continue to work toward a comprehensive bill.\n\nnicholas kulish\n\nOne of the groups, NumbersUSA, they managed to get millions of calls and faxes and letters to congresspeople.\n\narchived recording Republicans have been bolting from the president on this issue. They believe that hes absolutely tone-deaf. And he continues to go down this road even though many members of his party, both in the House and the Senate, object.\n\nnicholas kulish\n\nAnd a lot of folks think that theyre the most important reason that immigration reform was derailed under George W. Bush.\n\narchived recording We have a number of grassroots groups now working to stop them from getting the 15 votes they needed for cloture last time and failed on it. The risk to the president  hes not on the ballot again, and he has believed in this from day one. And so he wants this, very much so. He views it as a legacy item. But the risk for the Republican Party is a lot of conservatives think if you pass this legislation, some of the base will stay home in the 2008 elections, and you will have even more damage after the heartache of 2006 for the Republican Party. That is the calculation. The president and his team disagree, but many conservatives think if even just a little bit of our base stays home, more trouble.\n\nnatalie kitroeff\n\nSo it seems like theres this broad base of support for all of these anti-immigration ideas. But in reality, they are all stemming from one source, which is Mrs. May.\n\nnicholas kulish\n\nRight. It feels like a groundswell. But then when you look back at their roots and when you look back at where their money is coming from, Mrs. May and Dr. Tanton are always behind it.\n\nnatalie kitroeff\n\nAnd these groups, the big three that you mentioned, these are groups that have enormous resonance in todays political atmosphere, right? I mean, they have a ton of influence.\n\nnicholas kulish\n\nRight. They have more influence, Id say, now than they ever have before. And thats in part because they cultivated allies like \n\narchived recording (jeff sessions) We have a goal.\n\nnicholas kulish\n\nJeff Sessions.\n\narchived recording (jeff sessions) And that goal is to end the lawlessness that now exists in our immigration system.\n\nnicholas kulish\n\nWho became attorney general.\n\narchived recording (jeff sessions) I have put in place a zero-tolerance policy for illegal entry on our southwest border. If you cross the southwest border unlawfully, then we will prosecute you. Its that simple.\n\nnicholas kulish\n\nAnd his aide, Stephen Miller, who is now the most important person, probably, in government when it comes to immigration issues.\n\narchived recording (stephen miller) Id like to thank everyone here today, and especially at the Center for Immigration Studies, for everything they do to illuminate a debate that far too often operates, like illegal immigrants, in the shadows. [LAUGHTER]\n\nnatalie kitroeff\n\nAnd so you see these groups created through Mays money cultivating allies in Congress. The key ones here are Jeff Sessions and Stephen Miller. And now we know these are folks who have brought their hard-line immigration policies and beliefs with them to the White House, to the administration.\n\nnicholas kulish\n\nIn many cases, it feels like they wrote the playbook. And now Miller is calling the plays. And it goes beyond that.\n\narchived recording (kellyanne conway) Its just that border security is national security, and we have a flood of drugs coming into this country and into our communities.\n\nnicholas kulish\n\nKellyanne Conway, the presidents adviser, was doing polling for these groups. I think a lot of people dont realize that.\n\narchived recording (kellyanne conway) We have, obviously, an increase in gang members coming over.\n\nnicholas kulish\n\nOther folks from FAIR, from CIS, have moved into important positions in the governments immigration apparatus.\n\narchived recording (kellyanne conway) Weve got 31 sanctuary cities, six sanctuary states. Youve got people wanting to make us an entire sanctuary country. We just need Democrats to come to the table and be honest with themselves and who theyve been in the recent past.\n\nnatalie kitroeff\n\nAnd how do you see all these officials with ties to this movement influencing the Trump administrations policies on immigration?\n\nnicholas kulish\n\nTheyre inside the government now, and they have the chance, more so probably than ever before, to enact an agenda that theyve been pursuing, everything from militarizing the border \n\narchived recording (donald trump) Until we can have a wall and proper security, were going to be guarding our border with the military.\n\nnicholas kulish\n\n to capping legal immigration, prioritizing skills over family ties in terms of who we let in.\n\narchived recording Another shift in President Trumps immigration policy as the administration announced it would deny green cards to immigrants who seek out food stamps, Medicaid and other forms of public assistance, while favoring wealthier immigrants. archived recording (kenneth cuccinelli) President Trump has once again delivered on his promise to the American people to enforce longstanding immigration law.\n\nnicholas kulish\n\nYou see most recently reducing access to public benefits for migrants, for legal migrants.\n\narchived recording (kenneth cuccinelli) A rule that encourages and ensures self-reliance and self-sufficiency for those seeking to come to or to stay in the United States.\n\nnicholas kulish\n\nLike this new rule that was issued on public charges.\n\narchived recording (kenneth cuccinelli) If people are not able to be self-sufficient, then this negative factor is going to bear very heavily against them in a decision about whether theyll be able to become a legal permanent resident.\n\nnicholas kulish\n\nThe overarching idea they started with is fewer people. And for that, you have to do legal as well as illegal immigration.\n\nnatalie kitroeff\n\nNick, do you think that without Cordelia Scaife May, these views dont become mainstream? Should her money be seen as the critical driver for the movement?\n\nnicholas kulish\n\nThats a really good question, because look, there are a lot of tectonic forces at play in the world, like offshoring and automation and migration driven by climate change, that really helped push this onto the agenda and would have anyway, even if there wasnt a Mrs. May. But what is undeniable is that four decades of well-funded groups able to push these ideas with her money now gaining political power and literally being part of making the policy. I think its very fair to think of her as a driver of this issue as well as this movement.\n\n[music]\n\nnatalie kitroeff\n\nThank you so much, Nick.\n\nnicholas kulish\n\nThanks for having me.\n\nnatalie kitroeff\n\nWell be right back.\n\nmichael barbaro'	b'Why an Heiress Spent Her Fortune Trying to Keep Immigrants Out'	2019-08-14	[b'Nicholas Kulish', b'Mike Mcintire']	[b'spent', b'family', b'immigrants', b'money', b'immigration', b'fortune', b'think', b'really', b'heiress', b'trying', b'legal', b'population', b'recording', b'groups']	b'michael barbaro\n\nFrom The New York Times, Im Michael Barbaro.

But over time, that friendship and her desire to emulate Margaret Sanger led her to engage deeply with Planned Parenthood and other birth control and population issues.\n\nnatalie kitroeff\n\nAnd at this point, what is Planned Parenthood and Sangers work all about?\n\nnicholas kulish\n\nAt that point, its really about access to contraceptives. Its about family planning. Its about taking women, first in the United States and then around the world, from just having as many kids as they end up getting pregnant with, and choosing, I want to have two kids. I want to have three kids. This is when I want to have them. Family planning in the most literal sense.\n\narchived recording (cordelia may) The people that come to our organization and want to have the same methods or whatever it is that one can have to prevent pregnancy. And those women will say to us, I  we ask their religion very often. And they say, I am a Catholic. I was raised in the Catholic church. This, my church is wrong on this. And that is said over and over and over again.\n\nnatalie kitroeff\n\nAnd what about that is attractive to May? Why is that interesting to this heiress?\n\nnicholas kulish\n\nShe was really passionate about the natural environment and preserving it. And that really dovetails with birth control for her, because she sees overpopulation as destroying the habitats of the animals that she loves so much. But in addition to that, she was  from what we read in her letters, she was a feminist. She cared about womens issues. Women should have a right to plan their smaller families, and the birds and the bees and the bunny rabbits should have as much room to roam as possible.\n\nnatalie kitroeff\n\nSo what does she do with that new focus?\n\nnicholas kulish\n\nWell, she becomes involved with a group known as the Population Council, which was founded by a member of another of Americas great families, John D. Rockefeller III.\n\narchived recording Gushing oil, Americas black gold, was the foundation of his empire. Today, the giants of the oil industry stand as monuments to Rockefeller, the architect of our business age.\n\nnicholas kulish\n\nThe Population Councils goal was to lower birthrates around the world, and she went to birth control clinics in Chicago. She visited family planning efforts in Korea and Japan and Taiwan. And perhaps most importantly, she and her family gave $11.4 million to the council during the 1960s, which was a lot of money in those days. As time goes on, you can see her already becoming more militant. In the 1970s, shes sort of pushing up against the Population Councils desire to stick with contraceptives and keep abortion at arms length. And she and her representatives are saying, we have to make abortion upon request something thats available to all women. The pace of controlling population is too slow. The growth of the global population is too much.\n\nnatalie kitroeff\n\nSo she starts to take more hard-line positions, even though, in this case, its about something we now think of as a progressive measure, which is universal access to abortion.\n\nnicholas kulish\n\nRight, exactly. Abortion appears to be less about family planning and more about controlling the population.\n\nnatalie kitroeff\n\nSo where does her story go from here?\n\nnicholas kulish\n\nWell, something very important and actually tragic takes place in her life. In August 1973, she secretly marries her childhood friend and longtime companion, Robert W. Duggan. And he is the district attorney for the county that includes Pittsburgh. And rather than a giant, lavish wedding in a cathedral somewhere, they get married in a rinky-dink little room with knotty pine walls on Lake Tahoe in Nevada. They pay a justice of the peace $5. And perhaps more importantly, they dont tell anyone. So if youre this heiress, why do you have this quickie wedding? Well, her longtime friend, her longtime companion, is under investigation for corruption. He has apparently been taking payoffs from illegal gambling rings, you know, to look the other way. And essentially, his defense is, Im getting the money from her. Unfortunately, this defense does not work. The investigation and the prosecution starts closing in on him. And eventually, he is indicted for tax evasion. And on the day that he is indicted, he is found dead from a shotgun wound outside his country house. It appears that he shot himself, that its a self-inflicted wound.\n\nnatalie kitroeff\n\nSo how does that tragedy affect her work?\n\nnicholas kulish\n\nIt appears  and theres a little speculation involved in this, obviously. But it appears to make her a little more radical. Theres a harder edge to her letters and to what shes writing to people at that time after the tragedy. And her attitude toward family planning starts to change. Her aide goes to the Population Council and tells them that she thinks family planning is a waste of money. The Rockefeller aide who takes the meeting says that he almost got the impression that she favored compulsory sterilization. And for the first time, something comes up that wed never seen before, which is the idea that, quote, the U.S. should seal its border with Mexico.\n\nnatalie kitroeff\n\nAnd how do you understand why she made this jump from being so focused on population control to immigration?\n\nnicholas kulish\n\nTheres a sort of confluence of events that helps bring this about, right?\n\narchived recording Dr. Ehrlich, when did the thought first come to you that perhaps our time as mankind on Earth was limited? archived recording (paul ehrlich) Oh, it came in 1949 when \n\nnicholas kulish\n\nPopulation control was a really big concern with the baby boom.\n\narchived recording (paul ehrlich) The thing thats important remember about population control is that if we want to avoid a tremendous rise in the death rate, we absolutely must have a tremendous decrease in the birthrate.\n\nnicholas kulish\n\nNow, theres a famous book called The Population Bomb by a Stanford professor named Paul Ehrlich.\n\narchived recording (paul ehrlich) So the first thing that should happen is that the president ought to say, from now, here on out, no intelligent, patriotic American family ought to have more than two children, preferably one if youre starting a family now  not any law, but just say this is what responsible people do.\n\nnicholas kulish\n\nBut in the late 1970s, the birthrate has fallen quite a bit. Were out of the baby boom at this point. And among the biggest contributors to population growth in the United States is immigration.\n\narchived recording America was founded by immigrants. We are the so-called melting pot of the world. And most of those immigrants entered this nation legally.\n\nnicholas kulish\n\nIn 1978, Border Patrol apprehended close to 900,000 unauthorized immigrants.\n\narchived recording Today, however, illegal aliens are a great and continuing problem.\n\nnicholas kulish\n\nAnd another 600,000 legal immigrants are also arriving, the greatest number since the 1920s. So if your concern is how many people are there in the United States, then your focus starts to shift toward immigrants.\n\nnatalie kitroeff\n\nDoes she seem to care who the immigrants are? Is there part of this thats about race?\n\nnicholas kulish\n\nShe says that its not about race. Very colorfully, she says, why cant we just imagine putting paper bags over the heads of the immigrants so were only counting their deleterious numbers rather than being accused of racism because most of these people happen to not be white? And yet in one of her most strident documents, she isnt saying, the Norwegians are pouring into Minnesota. Its Filipinos in Hawaii, as she puts it, quote, Orientals sneaking across the Canadian border, Latin Americans coming into Florida. And she says that the Cuban refugees, quote, breed like hamsters.\n\nnatalie kitroeff\n\nSo the language at least suggests that at least some of this is about racism.\n\nnicholas kulish\n\nShe says she isnt racist, but the people that shes worried about are not the white immigrants. Its the immigrants from non-white countries that shes preoccupied with.\n\n[music]\n\nnatalie kitroeff\n\nWell be right back. Nick, why does this matter for the modern immigration movement? What exactly does that have to do with the evolving views of this one rich woman?\n\nnicholas kulish\n\nIt matters because Cordelia Scaife May puts her money where her mouth is. And she has a lot of money. Equally important is in 1978, she meets a very unusual gentleman named Dr. John Tanton, an ophthalmologist who, in his spare time, likes to form political advocacy groups.\n\nnatalie kitroeff\n\nHes an ophthalmologist who  his side gig is forming public pressure groups?\n\nnicholas kulish\n\nExactly. Hes like a character out of a Frank Capra movie up in this small town in Michigan, this very charismatic, good-looking, square-jawed guy whos just great at getting people excited about an issue. Its weird, but hes really good at it. He actually was involved in a lot of the same issues. He was involved in environmental issues. He was involved in a group called Zero Population Growth, which was exactly what it sounds like. So through these circles from the population movement, Dr. Tanton got acquainted with Mrs. May. And he came to her seeking her help, which is to say her money, to get his group, the Federation for American Immigration Reform, off the ground.\n\nnatalie kitroeff\n\nAnd does she help out?\n\nnicholas kulish\n\nShe does. She provides him with $50,000 in seed money, with the one condition that she remains anonymous. She is in the background. She is not tied to this work.\n\n[music]\n\nnicholas kulish\n\nAnd he starts the group, and she gives him more money, and more money, and more money, to the point where theres an internal memorandum where he writes that Mrs. May has been our single biggest supporter. She just gave us another $400,000. That relationship is pretty well under control. And the more money that she gives him, the more ambitious he becomes. He spins off the research arm of FAIR into something called the Center for Immigration Studies.\n\narchived recording The Center for Immigration Studies, a nonprofit public interest institution, looking into immigrations effects on social and economic interests in the U.S.\n\nnicholas kulish\n\nHe moves the legal litigation group and turns it into the Immigration Reform Law Institute.\n\narchived recording Were a national public interest organization working for rational immigration policies. We seek to end illegal immigration and maintain legal immigration rates under an overall ceiling consistent with Americas domestic priorities.\n\nnicholas kulish\n\nPretty soon, hes starting to build almost an ecosystem of groups that reinforce each other. The Center for Immigration Studies has a report that is cited by FAIR or is used in a legal memorandum thats written by the Immigration Reform Law Institute. And it isnt clear to everyone that these groups are all coming from the same place.\n\nnatalie kitroeff\n\nNick, given that May comes from a very well-known and very wealthy family, I wonder if they have a reaction to the way that shes suddenly spending the family fortune.\n\nnicholas kulish\n\nThere are some family members who are also contributing to this cause. But in one instance that really upset her, she describes in a letter how a young cousin asked her whether the causes she were supporting werent discriminatory, racist. And what actually bothers her the most is not the accusation that it could be racist or discriminatory, but, as she puts it, the one that really puts my teeth on edge ... elitist. And so in response to this cousins question, she goes home and produces a five-page, typed response in which she tries to lay out her ideas. And this is, by the way, a document that was never before public and I think is the most complete record of her ideas on this subject. In her view, legal and illegal immigration lead to overpopulation. And that is responsible for a whole host of ills. She calls it the root cause of unemployment, inflation, urban sprawl, highway, skyway congestion, shortages of all sorts, not the least of which is energy, vanishing farmland, environmental deterioration and civil unrest. And she talks about how medical science has succeeded in reducing infant mortality rates, but its juxtaposed in the very same sentence with the idea of veterinarians prolonging the lives, quote, of useless cattle. She talks about how birthrates have dropped in a few areas, and millions die of starvation every year, but population growths continue to climb. And theres certain things  its uncomfortable when you read even wars no longer make much dent; during the 11 years of conflict, both North and South Vietnam showed a net increase in population.\n\nnatalie kitroeff\n\nYikes.\n\nnicholas kulish\n\nAnd this is also the place where she talks about this idea that the country is being invaded.\n\nnatalie kitroeff\n\nSo help us understand Mays actual impact on the development of this movement, which feels so connected to the ideas that shes articulating here.\n\nnicholas kulish\n\nWell, there are all these groups. The big three that people think about the most are NumbersUSA, the Center for Immigration Studies and the Federation for American Immigration Reform. And they put their might together and are able to pressure, at all levels, the government  at the local level, at the state level.\n\narchived recording Elizabeth Mayor Thomas Dunn has instructed his city employees to speak only English during working hours. The English-only rule, according to the mayor, applies to business and private conversations as well.\n\nnicholas kulish\n\nPushing English language laws.\n\narchived recording The Senate Judiciary Committee began considering a proposed constitutional amendment to make English the official language of the United States.\n\nnicholas kulish\n\nLaws that make it tougher for illegal immigrants to live in certain towns.\n\narchived recording Californias Republican Governor Pete Wilson wants to cut off social services to illegal immigrants and to deny citizenship to their U.S.-born children.\n\nnicholas kulish\n\nProposition 187 that was meant to restrict public benefits to undocumented people in California.\n\narchived recording After he announced his proposals in August, his poll ratings rose. Wilson finds support among members of such groups as the Federation for American Immigration Reform. Thats a national organization, which contends that immigrants are a drain on Americas resources.\n\nnicholas kulish\n\nThis goes all the way up to Congress.\n\narchived recording (george w. bush) The United States Senate is debating a very vital issue for our country, and that is immigration reform. I urge the senators to continue to work toward a comprehensive bill.\n\nnicholas kulish\n\nOne of the groups, NumbersUSA, they managed to get millions of calls and faxes and letters to congresspeople.\n\narchived recording Republicans have been bolting from the president on this issue. They believe that hes absolutely tone-deaf. And he continues to go down this road even though many members of his party, both in the House and the Senate, object.\n\nnicholas kulish\n\nAnd a lot of folks think that theyre the most important reason that immigration reform was derailed under George W. Bush.\n\narchived recording We have a number of grassroots groups now working to stop them from getting the 15 votes they needed for cloture last time and failed on it. The risk to the president  hes not on the ballot again, and he has believed in this from day one. And so he wants this, very much so. He views it as a legacy item. But the risk for the Republican Party is a lot of conservatives think if you pass this legislation, some of the base will stay home in the 2008 elections, and you will have even more damage after the heartache of 2006 for the Republican Party. That is the calculation. The president and his team disagree, but many conservatives think if even just a little bit of our base stays home, more trouble.\n\nnatalie kitroeff\n\nSo it seems like theres this broad base of support for all of these anti-immigration ideas. But in reality, they are all stemming from one source, which is Mrs. May.\n\nnicholas kulish\n\nRight. It feels like a groundswell. But then when you look back at their roots and when you look back at where their money is coming from, Mrs. May and Dr. Tanton are always behind it.\n\nnatalie kitroeff\n\nAnd these groups, the big three that you mentioned, these are groups that have enormous resonance in todays political atmosphere, right? I mean, they have a ton of influence.\n\nnicholas kulish\n\nRight. They have more influence, Id say, now than they ever have before. And thats in part because they cultivated allies like \n\narchived recording (jeff sessions) We have a goal.\n\nnicholas kulish\n\nJeff Sessions.\n\narchived recording (jeff sessions) And that goal is to end the lawlessness that now exists in our immigration system.\n\nnicholas kulish\n\nWho became attorney general.\n\narchived recording (jeff sessions) I have put in place a zero-tolerance policy for illegal entry on our southwest border. If you cross the southwest border unlawfully, then we will prosecute you. Its that simple.\n\nnicholas kulish\n\nAnd his aide, Stephen Miller, who is now the most important person, probably, in government when it comes to immigration issues.\n\narchived recording (stephen miller) Id like to thank everyone here today, and especially at the Center for Immigration Studies, for everything they do to illuminate a debate that far too often operates, like illegal immigrants, in the shadows. [LAUGHTER]\n\nnatalie kitroeff\n\nAnd so you see these groups created through Mays money cultivating allies in Congress. The key ones here are Jeff Sessions and Stephen Miller. And now we know these are folks who have brought their hard-line immigration policies and beliefs with them to the White House, to the administration.\n\nnicholas kulish\n\nIn many cases, it feels like they wrote the playbook. And now Miller is calling the plays. And it goes beyond that.\n\narchived recording (kellyanne conway) Its just that border security is national security, and we have a flood of drugs coming into this country and into our communities.\n\nnicholas kulish\n\nKellyanne Conway, the presidents adviser, was doing polling for these groups. I think a lot of people dont realize that.\n\narchived recording (kellyanne conway) We have, obviously, an increase in gang members coming over.\n\nnicholas kulish\n\nOther folks from FAIR, from CIS, have moved into important positions in the governments immigration apparatus.\n\narchived recording (kellyanne conway) Weve got 31 sanctuary cities, six sanctuary states. Youve got people wanting to make us an entire sanctuary country. We just need Democrats to come to the table and be honest with themselves and who theyve been in the recent past.\n\nnatalie kitroeff\n\nAnd how do you see all these officials with ties to this movement influencing the Trump administrations policies on immigration?\n\nnicholas kulish\n\nTheyre inside the government now, and they have the chance, more so probably than ever before, to enact an agenda that theyve been pursuing, everything from militarizing the border \n\narchived recording (donald trump) Until we can have a wall and proper security, were going to be guarding our border with the military.\n\nnicholas kulish\n\n to capping legal immigration, prioritizing skills over family ties in terms of who we let in.\n\narchived recording Another shift in President Trumps immigration policy as the administration announced it would deny green cards to immigrants who seek out food stamps, Medicaid and other forms of public assistance, while favoring wealthier immigrants. archived recording (kenneth cuccinelli) President Trump has once again delivered on his promise to the American people to enforce longstanding immigration law.\n\nnicholas kulish\n\nYou see most recently reducing access to public benefits for migrants, for legal migrants.\n\narchived recording (kenneth cuccinelli) A rule that encourages and ensures self-reliance and self-sufficiency for those seeking to come to or to stay in the United States.\n\nnicholas kulish\n\nLike this new rule that was issued on public charges.\n\narchived recording (kenneth cuccinelli) If people are not able to be self-sufficient, then this negative factor is going to bear very heavily against them in a decision about whether theyll be able to become a legal permanent resident.\n\nnicholas kulish\n\nThe overarching idea they started with is fewer people. And for that, you have to do legal as well as illegal immigration.\n\nnatalie kitroeff\n\nNick, do you think that without Cordelia Scaife May, these views dont become mainstream? Should her money be seen as the critical driver for the movement?\n\nnicholas kulish\n\nThats a really good question, because look, there are a lot of tectonic forces at play in the world, like offshoring and automation and migration driven by climate change, that really helped push this onto the agenda and would have anyway, even if there wasnt a Mrs. May. But what is undeniable is that four decades of well-funded groups able to push these ideas with her money now gaining political power and literally being part of making the policy. I think its very fair to think of her as a driver of this issue as well as this movement.\n\n[music]\n\nnatalie kitroeff\n\nThank you so much, Nick.\n\nnicholas kulish\n\nThanks for having me.\n\nnatalie kitroeff\n\nWell be right back.\n\nmichael barbaro'

Over the past week, there have been an average of 52,388 cases per day, a decrease of 16 percent from the average two weeks earlier.\n\nAs of Sunday afternoon, more than 5,389,700 people in the United States have been infected with the coronavirus and at least 169,600 have died, according to a New York Times database.\n\nHot spots Total cases Deaths Per capita Average daily cases per 100,000 people in the past week Few or no cases Share of population with a reported case No cases reported Double-click to zoom into the map.

About this data The hot spots map shows the share of population with a new reported case over the last week.

For total cases and deaths: The map shows the known locations of coronavirus cases by county.

For per capita: Parts of a county with a population density lower than 10 people per square mile are not shaded.\n\nCase numbers remain persistently high across most of the country, though reports of new cases have dropped since late July, when the country averaged well over 60,000 per day. Because the number of people hospitalized and the percentage of people testing positive also rose in many states, the summer case spike cannot be solely explained by increased testing.\n\nDeaths, though still well below their peak spring levels, reached an average of more than 1,000 per day by early August, more than double the average from early July. Some states reimposed limits on businesses and gatherings. Governors and even some mayors announced new restrictions on interstate travel.\n\nIn late February, there were just a few dozen known cases in the United States, most of them linked to travel. But by summer, the virus had torn through every state, infecting more people than the combined populations of Nebraska, Vermont and Montana.

And in a handful of remote counties, there has been not even one positive test.\n\nThe nations most populous places have all suffered tremendously. In Cook County, Ill., which includes Chicago, more than 4,900 people have died. In Los Angeles County, Calif., at least 208,000 people have had the virus.

Over the past week, there have been an average of 52,388 cases per day, a decrease of 16 percent from the average two weeks earlier.\n\nAs of Sunday afternoon, more than 5,389,700 people in the United States have been infected with the coronavirus and at least 169,600 have died, according to a New York Times database.\n\nHot spots Total cases Deaths Per capita Average daily cases per 100,000 people in the past week Few or no cases Share of population with a reported case No cases reported Double-click to zoom into the map. Use two fingers to pan and zoom. Tap for details. Sources: State and local health agencies and hospitals. About this data The hot spots map shows the share of population with a new reported case over the last week. Parts of a county with a population density lower than 10 people per square mile are not shaded. Data for Rhode Island is shown at the state level because county level data is infrequently reported. For total cases and deaths: The map shows the known locations of coronavirus cases by county. Circles are sized by the number of people there who have tested positive or have a probable case of the virus, which may differ from where they contracted the illness. For per capita: Parts of a county with a population density lower than 10 people per square mile are not shaded.\n\nCase numbers remain persistently high across most of the country, though reports of new cases have dropped since late July, when the country averaged well over 60,000 per day. Because the number of people hospitalized and the percentage of people testing positive also rose in many states, the summer case spike cannot be solely explained by increased testing.\n\nDeaths, though still well below their peak spring levels, reached an average of more than 1,000 per day by early August, more than double the average from early July. Some states reimposed limits on businesses and gatherings. Governors and even some mayors announced new restrictions on interstate travel.\n\nIn late February, there were just a few dozen known cases in the United States, most of them linked to travel. But by summer, the virus had torn through every state, infecting more people than the combined populations of Nebraska, Vermont and Montana. The national death toll exceeded 160,000, more than the population of Syracuse, N.Y. And after weeks of progress, reports of new cases reached record levels in July.\n\nCases and deaths by state and county This table is sorted by places with the most cases per 100,000 residents in the last seven days.

Thats a very low number for a statewide voting system rollout across 159 counties, she said.\n\nMany of the problems, she said, involved difficulties activating voter verification cards  which are inserted into the machines to start voting.\n\nThe potential for problems with the new system was somewhat well known from the states small-scale test in the 2019 elections, when a software glitch in the electronic poll books caused delays in most of the six counties where the test took place.\n\nA lot of people saw this coming, this meltdown, months in advance, said Andrew Appel, a computer scientist at Princeton who studies voting machines.\n\nCalling it way too complex, Marilyn Marks, the executive director of the Coalition for Good Governance, which had argued for a slower rollout of the equipment, described the technology as a Rube Goldberg contraption with way more components than are needed.\n\nThe promise of the new system, in part, was that it would be able to provide a variety of customized options  ballots in different languages, audio ballots for the visually impaired and the like. Yet it has not only proved hard to use in the early going; it is also something of a long and winding digital road to the same end as the old hand-marking systems  a marked ballot fed into a scanner.\n\nIn the new systems, voters begin the process by checking in at an electronic poll book, maintained on a digital tablet.

Thats a very low number for a statewide voting system rollout across 159 counties, she said.\n\nMany of the problems, she said, involved difficulties activating voter verification cards  which are inserted into the machines to start voting.\n\nThe potential for problems with the new system was somewhat well known from the states small-scale test in the 2019 elections, when a software glitch in the electronic poll books caused delays in most of the six counties where the test took place.\n\nA lot of people saw this coming, this meltdown, months in advance, said Andrew Appel, a computer scientist at Princeton who studies voting machines.\n\nCalling it way too complex, Marilyn Marks, the executive director of the Coalition for Good Governance, which had argued for a slower rollout of the equipment, described the technology as a Rube Goldberg contraption with way more components than are needed.\n\nThe promise of the new system, in part, was that it would be able to provide a variety of customized options  ballots in different languages, audio ballots for the visually impaired and the like. Yet it has not only proved hard to use in the early going; it is also something of a long and winding digital road to the same end as the old hand-marking systems  a marked ballot fed into a scanner.\n\nIn the new systems, voters begin the process by checking in at an electronic poll book, maintained on a digital tablet. There, the voter verification card with a microchip in it is programmed with the voters information. The card is then brought over to a big touch-screen tablet and inserted into a reader to display the voters ballot. After making the selections on the touch screen, the voter clicks print ballot.

Derek, I want to start by asking you if you could tell me about your first ever memory of the Postal Service.\n\nderek harpe\n\nWhen I was growing up in rural Davie County  of course, then there wasnt all the video games and computers and everything. We were in the yard with balls and bats, and the summers, when we would be home from school, we would be out. The mail carrier that came through, we were always right there to see him, and hed give me a little piece of candy, or a piece of bubble gum, or something that we dont do now, by any means.\n\n[laughter]\n\nderek harpe\n\nMy parents knew him. I got to know him. He was an all around good guy. And then as I grew up seeing him, same guy all through my teen years. He wasnt family, but he was close, you know what I mean?\n\nmichael barbaro\n\nAnd what was his name?\n\nderek harpe\n\nVernon.\n\nmichael barbaro\n\nVernon.\n\nderek harpe\n\nAs a child, he was what I knew to be the Postal Service. The rural carriers in a lot of areas, they are the picture of the Postal Service.\n\nmichael barbaro\n\nRight. In a place like where you grew up, that is the Postal Service  one man.\n\nderek harpe\n\nThat was pretty much what I knew growing up, yes. And then when I went to technical school and decided that wasnt what I wanted to do, I told the guy at the post office, I said, Look, seems like Id like to do what yall do. And I talked to him about it and ended up on the route that my parents lived on when I was growing up as a boy. I deliver to that house, and I fell in love with it once I started.\n\nmichael barbaro\n\nI wonder if you can tell me about a typical day on your route in Advance, N.C.\n\nderek harpe\n\nI live in Advance. I work out of Mocksville. And I go into the office each morning, I gather up my mail, and gather my packages, and I go to the street with it and start my route. And we do the last mile for some of our competitors, because I am in rural America.\n\nmichael barbaro\n\nAnd when you say last mile, what do you mean?\n\nderek harpe\n\nWere constitutionally bound to go to every house every day.\n\nmichael barbaro\n\nIn the United States Constitution?\n\nderek harpe\n\nYes. And the private companies, the Walmarts and the Amazons, and of course, UPS and FedEx, they bring their parcels to us to deliver what we call the last mile.\n\nmichael barbaro\n\nSo even though we think of those companies as doing their own delivery from wherever a package originates to a persons home, youre saying that in many cases, its the United States Postal Service, its you, who ends up literally taking it the last couple of miles to the destination.\n\nderek harpe\n\nYes.\n\nmichael barbaro\n\nI feel like thats something a lot of people dont quite understand.\n\nderek harpe\n\nOh, yes. Lots of folks dont realize it.\n\nmichael barbaro\n\nRight.\n\nderek harpe\n\nA guy asked me at church, he said he was following his package by one of our competing delivery companies, and he was following it to each one of their hubs and their facilities, and then all of a sudden it said its at the post office. And then it said it was out for delivery at the post office. Then he said, Then the mailman brings it to my door. Whats the deal? He said, How does that happen? And I said, Well, we carry the last mile for some of the companies to get it out there.\n\nmichael barbaro\n\nRight, and if you werent there, what would happen to those packages? Where would they go?\n\nderek harpe\n\nThe private companies would have to deliver them if the post office wasnt there. And if its a long ways away from town out in rural America, its not profitable for them to go.\n\nmichael barbaro\n\nSo since the pandemic started, I have to imagine there have been significant changes to your routine, right? I mean, how is delivering the mail different now?\n\nderek harpe\n\nWell, now, of course, we have PPE, social distancing, post offices supplying the masks, the gloves. Or, I was carrying a paint stick some days ringing the doorbell, to prevent \n\nmichael barbaro\n\nA paint stick?\n\nderek harpe\n\nYeah. They didnt have to worry about me touching their doorbell or me worry about their doorbell. And Im carrying a lot more essential needs. I think were always essential, but now, with folks not being able to get out or getting out, weve stepped it up, especially the ones that have underlying health issues. Theres a lot of essential needs there that were meeting now. And I sense that from a lot of them in the past few weeks. I would depart from their porch, and they would step out and call my name and say, Derek, we appreciate you. And that means a lot.\n\nmichael barbaro\n\nAnd whats your sense of how the Postal Service is doing in this moment?\n\nderek harpe\n\nWell, what I read and hear, its not good, that its crippled us to a degree. But I just hope that it can continue on. Its the number one loved entity of the government, and I just dont understand how we could not be there for the American citizen.\n\n[music]\n\nmichael barbaro\n\nFrom the New York Times, Im Michael Barbaro. This is The Daily. Today, Americas most beloved government agency has never been more vital, and yet, as thousands of companies receive federal bailouts, the United States Postal Service finds itself at the back of the line. My colleague, Nick Fandos, on why that is. Its Wednesday, May 27. Nick, tell me about the history of the U.S. Postal Service.\n\nnicholas fandos\n\nThe Postal Service traces its roots back basically as far or farther than the country itself.\n\n[music]\n\nnicholas fandos\n\nIn the 1770s, Benjamin Franklin, everybodys favorite founding father, was actually appointed to be the first postmaster general of the new United States.\n\narchived recording Postal business is transacted through some 47,000 post offices, contract stations, and branches in 42,000 U.S. communities.\n\nnicholas fandos\n\nAnd over the years, it becomes what the founding fathers wanted it to be then, which is something that could connect the country, allow Americans to correspond with each other, do business with each other. Basically bring these disparate colonies and communities together.\n\narchived recording The biggest retail business in the world today is the United States Post Office, devoted exclusively to the service of its owners, the American public.\n\nnicholas fandos\n\nIt has grown into basically the most trusted government service, this kind of ubiquitous and beloved face of the federal government, that is massive in its own right.\n\narchived recording Today, postal employees must cope with an ever-increasing avalanche of mail which, in the past decade, has quadrupled in volume.\n\nnicholas fandos\n\nIts a big, complex business that employs over 600,000 people. If it was a private company, it would be easily on the Fortune 500 list.\n\narchived recording Though 90 percent of its income is derived from the sale of stamps, the post office is also the largest savings bank in the country, and the largest agency with a transfer of money. It takes in more than $1.5 billion annually.\n\nnicholas fandos\n\nAnd so while the Postal Service was not set up to be a kind of moneymaking engine for the government, it did, for much of its modern life, either break even or make modest profits based on the sale of postage.\n\nmichael barbaro\n\nSo when does that all start to change?\n\nnicholas fandos\n\nSo starting in the early to mid 2000s, there is a relatively quick succession of major changes in the kind of environment for the Postal Service, some of which are foreseen and some of which are not, that begin to dramatically erode its finances. The first one is this large change that were all familiar with in consumer habits and the way that people communicate and spend money, and thats just \n\narchived recording Youve got mail.\n\nnicholas fandos\n\nThe advent of the kind of like, everyday worldwide web.\n\narchived recording 1 You can now glimpse the future with nothing more than a modem, a phone line, and a few dollars a month. archived recording 2 And then theres email. archived recording 3 Email? I heard thats really neat. My cousin has a pen pal in Sweden, and they write back and forth, and it transmits right away, and doesnt cost anything. archived recording 4 Yeah. You can even talk with people all over the world on chat lines.\n\nnicholas fandos\n\nThese things directly replace a lot of the Postal Services bottom line. Personal correspondence, billing, business solicitations, and things like that. And so you start in kind of the early years of the new Millennium, and the trend picks up to see a decline in overall mail volume.\n\narchived recording The House will be in order.\n\nnicholas fandos\n\nAnd then a few years into this trend, Congress makes another consequential decision.\n\narchived recording This legislation mandates transparency in the services finances, costs, and operations, creates a modern system of rate regulation, establishes fair competition rules, and a powerful new regulator to oversee operations. I urge my colleagues to adopt.\n\nnicholas fandos\n\nThe Postal Service is financing itself. Its self-sustainable. But Congress sees on the horizon an issue with this very large, relatively well-paid federal workforce hitting retirement age.\n\narchived recording 1 Those in favor, say aye, archived recording 2 Aye. archived recording 3 Those opposed, no. The bill is passed, and without objection, the motion to reconsider is laid upon the table.\n\nnicholas fandos\n\nAnd it decides that the Postal Service ought to set aside money in advance to fund the health care benefits of all of its retirees. This is, in actuality, billions of dollars a year on top of its normal operating costs that the Postal Service needs to start setting aside, basically. And that proposition makes a lot of sense in a world where the Postal Service has a healthy business model, is in the black, and bringing in revenue. What they cant foresee is the financial crisis.\n\n[music]\n\narchived recording 1 The U.S. Postal Service says it will be insolvent next month, and wants to lay off 120,000 people. archived recording 2 By the end of September, the Postal Service will be on the brink of defaulting on all its employee pension obligations, unable to borrow any more money, and only have enough cash to cover one week of operations.\n\nnicholas fandos\n\nSo businesses are spending less money on mail, individuals are spending less money, and the Postal Service, saddled with this new obligation to fund its retirees health care well into the future, and battling a recession that any business was struggling with at that time, finds itself very quickly moving further and further into the red.\n\narchived recording The Postal Service adapting to this economy right now surely wont be easy.\n\nmichael barbaro\n\nSo Nick, I have to imagine if that financial crisis hurts the Postal Service, that this one thats now underway has just clobbered them.\n\nnicholas fandos\n\nAbsolutely. I mean, the agency never really fully recovered or regained its footing. And here, basically the whole world and the economy shuts down overnight, and theres a precipitous decline  5 percent a first, 10 percent, 15 percent, 20 percent, 30 percent  of overall mail volume.\n\nmichael barbaro\n\nWow.\n\nnicholas fandos\n\nSo it may seem like youre getting more packages than ever and that the Postal Service  you know, your mailman is the one person that keeps coming to your building and your door, and theres kind of a greater awareness about it. And package volume is up overall, which has helped offset some losses. But for the Postal Service, where they really make their money  and its helpful to think about the mail you get at home  are the kind of solicitations, the bills, the flyers, the things that form the bulk of that stack if you bring letters into your house from the mailbox.\n\nmichael barbaro\n\nRight.\n\nnicholas fandos\n\nAnd thats what has contracted at an alarming rate. And those losses have not, at least to this point, been able to be offset. And so the Postal Service begins to put together projections that say, if these trends continue, we could be looking at a volume in mail decline by half by the middle of the summer. And so what weve seen in the last few weeks is the Postal Service come to Congress, basically hat in hand. and say, look, if you dont come and bail us out right now, if you cant help us get a infusion of billions and billions of dollars, we could be out of cash by the fall. And that will threaten service and threaten the very viability of this thing that Americans seem to be more cognizant of and more relying on than they have been in a really long time.\n\n[music]\n\nmichael barbaro\n\nWell be right back. So I have to imagine that this pretty beloved institution is at the front of the line for any kind of bailout at a moment when Congress is handing out money to a lot of businesses across the country.\n\nnicholas fandos\n\nI think thats a fair assumption. And so we saw in March, when Congress was racing to put together the CARES Act, its big $2 trillion relief bill to try and prop up the economy, Democrats and Republicans get kind of a handshake deal to send it $13 billion in direct funding that will help it keep operating through the summer and the fall, and hopefully weather the worst of the crisis. But in the middle of these high-stakes negotiations, the White House comes, and out of trillions of dollars of spending, points to the United States Postal Service and says, Uh-uh, were not going to support a bailout. Were not interested in including them in this bill, and you better not put it in our way, because we dont want to have a problem.\n\nmichael barbaro\n\nAnd why is that? Why wont the White House bail out the Postal Service?\n\nnicholas fandos\n\nSo it actually starts with The Washington Post, the newspaper that the president feels has covered him too critically, too unfairly. He perceives it as one of his biggest enemies in Washington. That paper happens to be owned by Jeff Bezos, the founder and chief executive of Amazon. And Amazon, as we know, is heavily reliant on the United States Postal Service to deliver many of its packages all across the country. The details of its contracts are kept private, but the Postal Service does quite a bit of business with Amazon.\n\narchived recording Whats Amazon done that bugs you, sir? archived recording (donald trump) Well, you take a look at the post office \n\nnicholas fandos\n\nAnd this, as much as anything else, is what has informed Trumps view of the Postal Service.\n\narchived recording (donald trump)  and the post office is losing billions of dollars, and the taxpayers are paying for that money, because it delivers packages for Amazon at a very below cost, and thats not fair \n\nnicholas fandos\n\nHes of the opinion that Amazon is basically ripping off the Postal Service.\n\narchived recording (donald trump) And Amazon has the money to pay the fare rate at the post office, which would be much more than theyre paying right now.\n\nnicholas fandos\n\nThat its getting its packages delivered far too cheaply, and that Bezos is being enriched off of this government service.\n\narchived recording (donald trump) Amazon is going to have to pay much more money to the post office. Theres no doubt about that.\n\nnicholas fandos\n\nAnd so hes basically put down a line in the sand and said, Unless the Postal Service agrees to jack up prices 400 or even 500 percent on Amazon packages  thats quite a lot of money  Im not going to give them a cent. Im not going to bail him out, I wont give them a loan, Im not going to do anything for them because theyre being such suckers.\n\nmichael barbaro\n\nWow. So the president has specifically linked his reluctance to assist the Postal Service financially with his frustrations with Amazon and Jeff Bezos.\n\nnicholas fandos\n\nAbsolutely. There is, though, a second thing going on here, and this is kind of  this other interest is maybe better represented by Steve Mnuchin, who is the treasury secretary. So what Mnuchin and some of these others want are basically to change the Postal Service in ways that will cut its costs, that will increase its prices, and kind of shrink its footprint. Both so that it can meet its own financial obligations and start to address this big debt that its racked up, but also in ways that will allow its private competitors like FedEx and UPS to get a little bit more of an upper hand in the market. I mean, they would say that this is about competition, and that the Postal Service has been given some unfair monopolies in certain areas, or has been allowed to keep its rates too low in a way that harmed these private businesses and needs to be changed in a way that will make the whole field more competitive.\n\n[music]\n\nnicholas fandos\n\nSo this is all in the White Houses mind when Congress comes to it a few weeks ago and says, we want this money to bail out the ailing Postal Service. And all of a sudden, they realize that theyre presented with a real new opportunity to put a mark on the Postal Service in this moment of flux that could effectuate a lot of both what President Trump and what Mnuchin and his allies want to see.\n\nmichael barbaro\n\nAnd how? How could this be an opportunity for the White House?\n\nnicholas fandos\n\nSo Mnuchin recognizes that the Postal Service is in a bad way, that it has a real financial need. And if instead of giving it a no-strings-attached bailout, the Treasury Department instead gets authority to give it a loan, then he, as treasury secretary, could essentially dictate terms, changes that the Postal Service would have to adopt if it wants to get this loan money from the Treasury Department. And so it gives him significant new leverage to try and put in place some of these long-held ambitions that he has for the Postal Service, most explicitly this question of rates. Mnuchin wants more not only rate increases, but increases where Amazon would essentially have to pay more. But he wants to be able to look at those contracts himself and make sure that they are meeting, I suppose, his standard for what that ought to look like.\n\nmichael barbaro\n\nNick, is it possible that thats exactly what the Postal Service should be doing? I mean, Im mindful of the fact that Amazon, for example, is the countrys most profitable business. It could probably stand to pay higher rates, and would that be better for the Postal Service?\n\nnicholas fandos\n\nIts a very good question, and thats very possible. At a time when the volume of packages, because of the pandemic, is increasing significantly at the Postal Service, this could be an area to really close some of the revenue gap. But theres a couple of things to keep in mind. One, theres a big difference between modest changes and re-evaluating a contract to increase prices maybe 10 percent or 15 percent, I dont know, and what President Trump is talking about. Which is a wholesale increase of four- or five-fold so that if a package today costs $8 to ship, its going to be $32 or higher. And that kind of thing, independent business analysts will quickly tell you, is kind of ludicrous. It just wont work, and it would probably backfire on the Postal Service, because Amazon could easily find a way to deliver that package cheaper. Its too drastic an increase all at once. And the other thing to keep in mind that the presidents comments often obscure is that these contracts with companies like Amazon, while they are secretive, or we, the public, havent seen them, they are certified to be profitable. They are making the Postal Service money. So the idea that the Postal Service is just being totally ripped off by Amazon isnt exactly right either.\n\nmichael barbaro\n\nNick, how does this approach from the White House sit with congressional Republicans who presumably represent a lot of Americans who like the Postal Service?\n\nnicholas fandos\n\nSo this is the biggest question for the Postal Service right now, because if you have the White House on one side and Democrats on the other, its really congressional Republicans that could tip the outcome here one way or another, and they seem to be split in their own way. Traditionally, Republicans, particularly those that represent rural states or districts, places like Maine, or Alaska, or just congressional districts that are outside of big cities all over the country, have been big supporters of the Postal Service because their constituents are heavily reliant on it. And so they have generally been on the side of giving the Postal Service what it asks for. I mean, take the case of Dan Sullivan, who is a Republican senator from the state of Alaska, very rural state, heavily reliant on the Postal Service, whos up for re-election this fall. Sullivan was, not too long ago, actually, at the White House.\n\narchived recording (donald trump) The Postal Service is a joke.\n\nnicholas fandos\n\nWhen President Trump went off on a riff against the Postal Service and about how they were being ripped off by Amazon \n\narchived recording (donald trump) The post office, if they raised the price of a package by approximately four times, it would be a whole new ballgame.\n\nnicholas fandos\n\nHe stood there silently watching it, and then, hearing the view of the president of his party \n\narchived recording (donald trump) If they dont raise the price, Im not signing anything.\n\nnicholas fandos\n\nA short time later, speaking with constituents back in Alaska at a town hall \n\narchived recording (dan sullivan) Im concerned about the post office and whats going on with the post office \n\nnicholas fandos\n\nBasically expressed the view that many Republicans have.\n\narchived recording (dan sullivan)  that other states might be like, Oh wait, why cant you just drive there? Well, you guys all know why we cant just drive there  because so many of our communities dont even have roads.\n\nnicholas fandos\n\nI recognize how important the Postal Service is to my state, and Im not going to let anything happen to it that would jeopardize the ability of the mail to reach all of you.\n\narchived recording (dan sullivan) We are defenders of all of these programs, because you cant be treated differently just because youre an American and you live in a village without a road.\n\nnicholas fandos\n\nOn the other hand, there are Republicans in Congress that I think are sympathetic to that point of view, but feel like the Postal Service has been losing money for quite a long time, that its business model wasnt working even before the pandemic. And that if theyre going to be giving them a bunch of money, if theyre going to be asking taxpayers that dont normally fund the Postal Service to be chipping in billions of dollars, they want to see some changes from it, maybe changes that look like what the White House wants along the way.\n\nmichael barbaro\n\nSo where does this all leave the post office, Nick? I mean, the White House is saying, take this loan. Sounds like the post office is not thrilled about the conditions that would be attached to it. I suppose it could just not take the money, or maybe it could wait and see whether the election changes the composition of Congress, or even the White House.\n\nnicholas fandos\n\nI think all of those things are possible, but another interesting thing has happened as this whole dynamic has played out, which is that there have been some pretty significant personnel changes at the top of the Postal Service. President Trump, as is his prerogative, named in recent weeks a new postmaster general, not somebody that comes from within the agency, but is a Republican donor who comes from private business.\n\nmichael barbaro\n\nDuring the pandemic?\n\nnicholas fandos\n\nDuring the pandemic, who is believed to be much more sympathetic to the presidents views and Secretary Mnuchins views. And so there is a possibility that the Postal Service could ultimately decide either to take the loan, or maybe financial conditions improve enough that they dont need to take the loan, but they still make some of the kind of changes that the White House is asking for. Regardless of whether or not Democrats want them to take them or their own workforce wants them to take them, it may well be that what the president has finally succeeded in doing is putting a kind of like-minded or sympathetic leadership team in place, and thats what it takes.\n\nmichael barbaro\n\nAnd if the Postal Service doesnt take this money, how much longer can it operate as it currently does?\n\nnicholas fandos\n\nSo obviously, in the context of the pandemic, a lot of things are subject to change. But by the Postal Services own projections, it could run into serious cash flow problems as early as September, this fall. And without a major infusion either in the form of bailout from Congress or a loan coming from the Treasury Department, it would struggle to meet its obligations and put even delivering the mail in jeopardy.\n\nmichael barbaro\n\nNick, thank you very much.\n\nnicholas fandos\n\nThank you, Michael.\n\n[music]\n\nmichael barbaro\n\nDerek, why do you think it is that the federal government is offering financial assistance to many private companies across the U.S. economy and not to the Postal Service? What do you think that the rationale is?\n\nderek harpe\n\nI know Ive read some things about us not charging enough for some of the package business, but the Postal Service is not a for-profit private company like some of the others. The founding fathers I dont think ever meant for it to be that, according to what Ive read. The post office surviving  I hope that it survives at a uniformity that every American deserves.\n\nmichael barbaro\n\nWell, Derek, we really appreciate you spending time with us, and wish you the best of luck on your routes and good health.\n\nderek harpe\n\nCertainly appreciate that.\n\nmichael barbaro\n\nGood talking to you.\n\nderek harpe\n\nThank you very much for the opportunity.\n\nmichael barbaro\n\nWell be right back.\n\n[music]\n\nmichael barbaro\n\nHeres what else you need to know today.\n\narchived recording The disease can jump up at any time. We cannot make assumptions that just because the disease is on the way down now that its going to keep going down and were going to get a number of months to get ready for a second wave.\n\nmichael barbaro\n\nThe World Health Organization is warning that even before a second wave of infections may arrive in the fall, there could be a surge of infections in the coming weeks as measures to contain the virus are lifted in places like the U.S. The W.H.O. described such a surge as a second peak.\n\narchived recording We may get a second peak in this wave. This happened during pandemics in the past. It certainly happened in the pandemic of 1919 and the Spanish flu. We got a second peak, not necessarily a second wave.\n\nmichael barbaro'	b'A Fight Over the Future of the Mail Breaks Down Along Familiar Lines'	2020-05-10	[b'Nicholas Fandos', b'Reid J.

Derek, I want to start by asking you if you could tell me about your first ever memory of the Postal Service.\n\nderek harpe\n\nWhen I was growing up in rural Davie County  of course, then there wasnt all the video games and computers and everything. We were in the yard with balls and bats, and the summers, when we would be home from school, we would be out. The mail carrier that came through, we were always right there to see him, and hed give me a little piece of candy, or a piece of bubble gum, or something that we dont do now, by any means.\n\n[laughter]\n\nderek harpe\n\nMy parents knew him. I got to know him. He was an all around good guy. And then as I grew up seeing him, same guy all through my teen years. He wasnt family, but he was close, you know what I mean?\n\nmichael barbaro\n\nAnd what was his name?\n\nderek harpe\n\nVernon.\n\nmichael barbaro\n\nVernon.\n\nderek harpe\n\nAs a child, he was what I knew to be the Postal Service. The rural carriers in a lot of areas, they are the picture of the Postal Service.\n\nmichael barbaro\n\nRight. In a place like where you grew up, that is the Postal Service  one man.\n\nderek harpe\n\nThat was pretty much what I knew growing up, yes. And then when I went to technical school and decided that wasnt what I wanted to do, I told the guy at the post office, I said, Look, seems like Id like to do what yall do. And I talked to him about it and ended up on the route that my parents lived on when I was growing up as a boy. I deliver to that house, and I fell in love with it once I started.\n\nmichael barbaro\n\nI wonder if you can tell me about a typical day on your route in Advance, N.C.\n\nderek harpe\n\nI live in Advance. I work out of Mocksville. And I go into the office each morning, I gather up my mail, and gather my packages, and I go to the street with it and start my route. And we do the last mile for some of our competitors, because I am in rural America.\n\nmichael barbaro\n\nAnd when you say last mile, what do you mean?\n\nderek harpe\n\nWere constitutionally bound to go to every house every day.\n\nmichael barbaro\n\nIn the United States Constitution?\n\nderek harpe\n\nYes. And the private companies, the Walmarts and the Amazons, and of course, UPS and FedEx, they bring their parcels to us to deliver what we call the last mile.\n\nmichael barbaro\n\nSo even though we think of those companies as doing their own delivery from wherever a package originates to a persons home, youre saying that in many cases, its the United States Postal Service, its you, who ends up literally taking it the last couple of miles to the destination.\n\nderek harpe\n\nYes.\n\nmichael barbaro\n\nI feel like thats something a lot of people dont quite understand.\n\nderek harpe\n\nOh, yes. Lots of folks dont realize it.\n\nmichael barbaro\n\nRight.\n\nderek harpe\n\nA guy asked me at church, he said he was following his package by one of our competing delivery companies, and he was following it to each one of their hubs and their facilities, and then all of a sudden it said its at the post office. And then it said it was out for delivery at the post office. Then he said, Then the mailman brings it to my door. Whats the deal? He said, How does that happen? And I said, Well, we carry the last mile for some of the companies to get it out there.\n\nmichael barbaro\n\nRight, and if you werent there, what would happen to those packages? Where would they go?\n\nderek harpe\n\nThe private companies would have to deliver them if the post office wasnt there. And if its a long ways away from town out in rural America, its not profitable for them to go.\n\nmichael barbaro\n\nSo since the pandemic started, I have to imagine there have been significant changes to your routine, right? I mean, how is delivering the mail different now?\n\nderek harpe\n\nWell, now, of course, we have PPE, social distancing, post offices supplying the masks, the gloves. Or, I was carrying a paint stick some days ringing the doorbell, to prevent \n\nmichael barbaro\n\nA paint stick?\n\nderek harpe\n\nYeah. They didnt have to worry about me touching their doorbell or me worry about their doorbell. And Im carrying a lot more essential needs. I think were always essential, but now, with folks not being able to get out or getting out, weve stepped it up, especially the ones that have underlying health issues. Theres a lot of essential needs there that were meeting now. And I sense that from a lot of them in the past few weeks. I would depart from their porch, and they would step out and call my name and say, Derek, we appreciate you. And that means a lot.\n\nmichael barbaro\n\nAnd whats your sense of how the Postal Service is doing in this moment?\n\nderek harpe\n\nWell, what I read and hear, its not good, that its crippled us to a degree. But I just hope that it can continue on. Its the number one loved entity of the government, and I just dont understand how we could not be there for the American citizen.\n\n[music]\n\nmichael barbaro\n\nFrom the New York Times, Im Michael Barbaro. This is The Daily. Today, Americas most beloved government agency has never been more vital, and yet, as thousands of companies receive federal bailouts, the United States Postal Service finds itself at the back of the line. My colleague, Nick Fandos, on why that is. Its Wednesday, May 27.

But for the Postal Service, where they really make their money  and its helpful to think about the mail you get at home  are the kind of solicitations, the bills, the flyers, the things that form the bulk of that stack if you bring letters into your house from the mailbox.\n\nmichael barbaro\n\nRight.\n\nnicholas fandos\n\nAnd thats what has contracted at an alarming rate. And those losses have not, at least to this point, been able to be offset. And so the Postal Service begins to put together projections that say, if these trends continue, we could be looking at a volume in mail decline by half by the middle of the summer. And so what weve seen in the last few weeks is the Postal Service come to Congress, basically hat in hand. and say, look, if you dont come and bail us out right now, if you cant help us get a infusion of billions and billions of dollars, we could be out of cash by the fall. And that will threaten service and threaten the very viability of this thing that Americans seem to be more cognizant of and more relying on than they have been in a really long time.\n\n[music]\n\nmichael barbaro\n\nWell be right back. So I have to imagine that this pretty beloved institution is at the front of the line for any kind of bailout at a moment when Congress is handing out money to a lot of businesses across the country.\n\nnicholas fandos\n\nI think thats a fair assumption. And so we saw in March, when Congress was racing to put together the CARES Act, its big $2 trillion relief bill to try and prop up the economy, Democrats and Republicans get kind of a handshake deal to send it $13 billion in direct funding that will help it keep operating through the summer and the fall, and hopefully weather the worst of the crisis. But in the middle of these high-stakes negotiations, the White House comes, and out of trillions of dollars of spending, points to the United States Postal Service and says, Uh-uh, were not going to support a bailout. Were not interested in including them in this bill, and you better not put it in our way, because we dont want to have a problem.\n\nmichael barbaro\n\nAnd why is that? Why wont the White House bail out the Postal Service?\n\nnicholas fandos\n\nSo it actually starts with The Washington Post, the newspaper that the president feels has covered him too critically, too unfairly. He perceives it as one of his biggest enemies in Washington. That paper happens to be owned by Jeff Bezos, the founder and chief executive of Amazon. And Amazon, as we know, is heavily reliant on the United States Postal Service to deliver many of its packages all across the country. The details of its contracts are kept private, but the Postal Service does quite a bit of business with Amazon.\n\narchived recording Whats Amazon done that bugs you, sir? archived recording (donald trump) Well, you take a look at the post office \n\nnicholas fandos\n\nAnd this, as much as anything else, is what has informed Trumps view of the Postal Service.\n\narchived recording (donald trump)  and the post office is losing billions of dollars, and the taxpayers are paying for that money, because it delivers packages for Amazon at a very below cost, and thats not fair \n\nnicholas fandos\n\nHes of the opinion that Amazon is basically ripping off the Postal Service.\n\narchived recording (donald trump) And Amazon has the money to pay the fare rate at the post office, which would be much more than theyre paying right now.\n\nnicholas fandos\n\nThat its getting its packages delivered far too cheaply, and that Bezos is being enriched off of this government service.\n\narchived recording (donald trump) Amazon is going to have to pay much more money to the post office. Theres no doubt about that.\n\nnicholas fandos\n\nAnd so hes basically put down a line in the sand and said, Unless the Postal Service agrees to jack up prices 400 or even 500 percent on Amazon packages  thats quite a lot of money  Im not going to give them a cent. Im not going to bail him out, I wont give them a loan, Im not going to do anything for them because theyre being such suckers.\n\nmichael barbaro\n\nWow. So the president has specifically linked his reluctance to assist the Postal Service financially with his frustrations with Amazon and Jeff Bezos.\n\nnicholas fandos\n\nAbsolutely. There is, though, a second thing going on here, and this is kind of  this other interest is maybe better represented by Steve Mnuchin, who is the treasury secretary. So what Mnuchin and some of these others want are basically to change the Postal Service in ways that will cut its costs, that will increase its prices, and kind of shrink its footprint. Both so that it can meet its own financial obligations and start to address this big debt that its racked up, but also in ways that will allow its private competitors like FedEx and UPS to get a little bit more of an upper hand in the market. I mean, they would say that this is about competition, and that the Postal Service has been given some unfair monopolies in certain areas, or has been allowed to keep its rates too low in a way that harmed these private businesses and needs to be changed in a way that will make the whole field more competitive.\n\n[music]\n\nnicholas fandos\n\nSo this is all in the White Houses mind when Congress comes to it a few weeks ago and says, we want this money to bail out the ailing Postal Service. And all of a sudden, they realize that theyre presented with a real new opportunity to put a mark on the Postal Service in this moment of flux that could effectuate a lot of both what President Trump and what Mnuchin and his allies want to see.\n\nmichael barbaro\n\nAnd how? How could this be an opportunity for the White House?\n\nnicholas fandos\n\nSo Mnuchin recognizes that the Postal Service is in a bad way, that it has a real financial need. And if instead of giving it a no-strings-attached bailout, the Treasury Department instead gets authority to give it a loan, then he, as treasury secretary, could essentially dictate terms, changes that the Postal Service would have to adopt if it wants to get this loan money from the Treasury Department. And so it gives him significant new leverage to try and put in place some of these long-held ambitions that he has for the Postal Service, most explicitly this question of rates. Mnuchin wants more not only rate increases, but increases where Amazon would essentially have to pay more. But he wants to be able to look at those contracts himself and make sure that they are meeting, I suppose, his standard for what that ought to look like.\n\nmichael barbaro\n\nNick, is it possible that thats exactly what the Postal Service should be doing? I mean, Im mindful of the fact that Amazon, for example, is the countrys most profitable business. It could probably stand to pay higher rates, and would that be better for the Postal Service?\n\nnicholas fandos\n\nIts a very good question, and thats very possible. At a time when the volume of packages, because of the pandemic, is increasing significantly at the Postal Service, this could be an area to really close some of the revenue gap. But theres a couple of things to keep in mind. One, theres a big difference between modest changes and re-evaluating a contract to increase prices maybe 10 percent or 15 percent, I dont know, and what President Trump is talking about. Which is a wholesale increase of four- or five-fold so that if a package today costs $8 to ship, its going to be $32 or higher. And that kind of thing, independent business analysts will quickly tell you, is kind of ludicrous. It just wont work, and it would probably backfire on the Postal Service, because Amazon could easily find a way to deliver that package cheaper. Its too drastic an increase all at once. And the other thing to keep in mind that the presidents comments often obscure is that these contracts with companies like Amazon, while they are secretive, or we, the public, havent seen them, they are certified to be profitable. They are making the Postal Service money. So the idea that the Postal Service is just being totally ripped off by Amazon isnt exactly right either.\n\nmichael barbaro\n\nNick, how does this approach from the White House sit with congressional Republicans who presumably represent a lot of Americans who like the Postal Service?\n\nnicholas fandos\n\nSo this is the biggest question for the Postal Service right now, because if you have the White House on one side and Democrats on the other, its really congressional Republicans that could tip the outcome here one way or another, and they seem to be split in their own way. Traditionally, Republicans, particularly those that represent rural states or districts, places like Maine, or Alaska, or just congressional districts that are outside of big cities all over the country, have been big supporters of the Postal Service because their constituents are heavily reliant on it. And so they have generally been on the side of giving the Postal Service what it asks for. I mean, take the case of Dan Sullivan, who is a Republican senator from the state of Alaska, very rural state, heavily reliant on the Postal Service, whos up for re-election this fall. Sullivan was, not too long ago, actually, at the White House.\n\narchived recording (donald trump) The Postal Service is a joke.\n\nnicholas fandos\n\nWhen President Trump went off on a riff against the Postal Service and about how they were being ripped off by Amazon \n\narchived recording (donald trump) The post office, if they raised the price of a package by approximately four times, it would be a whole new ballgame.\n\nnicholas fandos\n\nHe stood there silently watching it, and then, hearing the view of the president of his party \n\narchived recording (donald trump) If they dont raise the price, Im not signing anything.\n\nnicholas fandos\n\nA short time later, speaking with constituents back in Alaska at a town hall \n\narchived recording (dan sullivan) Im concerned about the post office and whats going on with the post office \n\nnicholas fandos\n\nBasically expressed the view that many Republicans have.\n\narchived recording (dan sullivan)  that other states might be like, Oh wait, why cant you just drive there? Well, you guys all know why we cant just drive there  because so many of our communities dont even have roads.\n\nnicholas fandos\n\nI recognize how important the Postal Service is to my state, and Im not going to let anything happen to it that would jeopardize the ability of the mail to reach all of you.\n\narchived recording (dan sullivan) We are defenders of all of these programs, because you cant be treated differently just because youre an American and you live in a village without a road.\n\nnicholas fandos\n\nOn the other hand, there are Republicans in Congress that I think are sympathetic to that point of view, but feel like the Postal Service has been losing money for quite a long time, that its business model wasnt working even before the pandemic. And that if theyre going to be giving them a bunch of money, if theyre going to be asking taxpayers that dont normally fund the Postal Service to be chipping in billions of dollars, they want to see some changes from it, maybe changes that look like what the White House wants along the way.\n\nmichael barbaro\n\nSo where does this all leave the post office, Nick? I mean, the White House is saying, take this loan. Sounds like the post office is not thrilled about the conditions that would be attached to it. I suppose it could just not take the money, or maybe it could wait and see whether the election changes the composition of Congress, or even the White House.\n\nnicholas fandos\n\nI think all of those things are possible, but another interesting thing has happened as this whole dynamic has played out, which is that there have been some pretty significant personnel changes at the top of the Postal Service. President Trump, as is his prerogative, named in recent weeks a new postmaster general, not somebody that comes from within the agency, but is a Republican donor who comes from private business.\n\nmichael barbaro\n\nDuring the pandemic?\n\nnicholas fandos\n\nDuring the pandemic, who is believed to be much more sympathetic to the presidents views and Secretary Mnuchins views. And so there is a possibility that the Postal Service could ultimately decide either to take the loan, or maybe financial conditions improve enough that they dont need to take the loan, but they still make some of the kind of changes that the White House is asking for. Regardless of whether or not Democrats want them to take them or their own workforce wants them to take them, it may well be that what the president has finally succeeded in doing is putting a kind of like-minded or sympathetic leadership team in place, and thats what it takes.\n\nmichael barbaro\n\nAnd if the Postal Service doesnt take this money, how much longer can it operate as it currently does?\n\nnicholas fandos\n\nSo obviously, in the context of the pandemic, a lot of things are subject to change. But by the Postal Services own projections, it could run into serious cash flow problems as early as September, this fall. And without a major infusion either in the form of bailout from Congress or a loan coming from the Treasury Department, it would struggle to meet its obligations and put even delivering the mail in jeopardy.\n\nmichael barbaro\n\nNick, thank you very much.\n\nnicholas fandos\n\nThank you, Michael.\n\n[music]\n\nmichael barbaro\n\nDerek, why do you think it is that the federal government is offering financial assistance to many private companies across the U.S. economy and not to the Postal Service? What do you think that the rationale is?\n\nderek harpe\n\nI know Ive read some things about us not charging enough for some of the package business, but the Postal Service is not a for-profit private company like some of the others. The founding fathers I dont think ever meant for it to be that, according to what Ive read. The post office surviving  I hope that it survives at a uniformity that every American deserves.\n\nmichael barbaro\n\nWell, Derek, we really appreciate you spending time with us, and wish you the best of luck on your routes and good health.\n\nderek harpe\n\nCertainly appreciate that.\n\nmichael barbaro\n\nGood talking to you.\n\nderek harpe\n\nThank you very much for the opportunity.\n\nmichael barbaro\n\nWell be right back.\n\n[music]\n\nmichael barbaro\n\nHeres what else you need to know today.\n\narchived recording The disease can jump up at any time.

This happened during pandemics in the past. It certainly happened in the pandemic of 1919 and the Spanish flu. We got a second peak, not necessarily a second wave.\n\nmichael barbaro'

Maybe its because they really are still head-in-the-sand and coming to terms with the realities of America on the issue of race.\n\nDo you think were having a moment where the politics around this issue is starting to shift?\n\nIve been out there with the protesters. I feel very optimistic when I see who is out there. I very much think of this as not a moment but a movement.\n\nAnd theres a specific thing that is different about this, and that is the significance of smartphones. I will tell you that probably over the last 10 years, my white friends would come up to me and say, Kamala, what is going on all of a sudden with all this excessive force? And I would say to them, You sound like a colonist. Because youre seeing it for the first time, you think youve discovered it.\n\nCommunities  and in particular the black community  have been shouting and crying, mothers over their dead childrens bodies, been crying in deep pain about these things. But people turned a blind eye or they didnt believe it or they didnt want to believe it. But now, because of the smartphone, America and the world are seeing in vivid detail the brutality that communities have known for generations.\n\nYou cant deny. You cant look away. Its there. I do believe people are seeing the injustice of it all and are prepared to take action in a way that weve not seen before. And that gives me hope.\n\nOf course, in Congress, that involves getting Republican support for legislation.\n\nRight, it does. But look at Mitt Romney  God love him  out there marching, and had the courage and the fortitude and the humanity to speak the phrase: Black Lives Matter.\n\nAre there any other Senate Republicans who you believe could work with you?\n\nThere are a number. Honestly, Lisa, the concern I have is just that, once again, the politics of fear. You see Donald Trump starting that up. Its a playbook that has worked over and over again, which is to present false choices, suggesting that if we have real change, if we shake up the system in a way that is about reimagining it and re-establishing norms based on what should be, chaos will occur. And I hope that my colleagues are immune and see it for what it is.'

Choice'	true	[]		trusted	[]	https://www.nytimes.com/2020/08/11/us/politics/kamala-bio.html	https://www.nytimes.com/	b'michael barbaro\n\nFrom The New York Times, Im Michael Barbaro. This is The Daily. Today: Joe Biden picks Senator Kamala Harris of California as his running mate, making her the first Black woman and the first Asian-American woman to run for vice president on a major party ticket. Alex Burns on the historic decision. Its Wednesday, August 12. Alex, did you get the text message from the Biden campaign?\n\nalex burns\n\nYou know, I had the text messages forwarded to me by several other people before I got it myself. But I suppose I was notified by text message, just not directly from the Biden campaign.\n\nmichael barbaro\n\nJust not the Biden text message? I actually am pretty disappointed. Because I signed up for the text message from the Biden campaign, and I didnt get a text message. So I suppose this answers the inevitable question, how do you make an enormous announcement during a pandemic? Which is you do it via text message. You just dont send it to Alex Burns or Michael Barbaro.\n\nalex burns\n\n[LAUGHS]\n\nmichael barbaro\n\nOK. So onto the decision itself. It is 7:00 p.m. on Tuesday evening. Joe Biden announced his choice about three hours ago, that it was going to be Kamala Harris. And Alex, the last time that we spoke with you, we talked about three overlapping realities that you said were influencing Bidens choice of a running mate  the nationwide protests over race and policing, the pandemic and the economic collapse. And then there was Bidens age, the fact that he would be the oldest president to assume the office. So how does Biden get from those realities to Kamala Harris?\n\nalex burns\n\nSo I think in some ways they are three distinct forces. And in some ways, they really are different strands of the same big current. Which is that Biden was looking from the start for a running mate who he saw and who he believed the country would see as a really serious person for really serious times. Now that could mean a whole bunch of different things. But one of the reasons why I think you end up seeing Kamala Harris emerge as the vice president is that she straddles all the different forces of this moment in a way that nobody else on the short list did or, at least demonstrated that they did. She was a senator who marched in racial justice protests this spring and who led a charge in the Senate to make lynching a federal crime. She is a familiar face to Democratic voters, not only from her presidential campaign, but from her interrogations of Trump officials in the Judiciary Committee at a time when Democrats are really struggling to hold the administration to account over its handling of the coronavirus pandemic. And shes somebody of, clearly in Joe Bidens eyes, sufficient and diverse enough political experience and stature that she will look to voters like somebody who is ready to be president.\n\nmichael barbaro\n\nMhm. Well lets drill into these three realities, each individually, just a little bit further. And I want to start with the nationwide protests, the questions around race. How did that influence the choice? You mentioned Kamala Harris marching in some of these protests and the work she has done in the Senate.\n\nalex burns\n\nRight. You had, at the outset of the season of protest, a number of figures on Bidens vice presidential list really speak up about matters of racial justice and policing. You had Val Demings, the congresswoman from Florida, a former police chief, become an outspoken champion of police reform. But you also saw people come under the microscope in less flattering ways, including Val Demings. That there was a sense from the start among Democrats that anybody on the short list who has touched the criminal justice system in their career is going to really need to have their record picked over. And that happened with Val Demings. She was the police chief in Orlando. And there are some questions about how appropriately she handled matters of police misconduct on her watch.\n\nmichael barbaro\n\nWell, what about Harriss history as attorney general in California? Because that was a significant focus during her own primary run for president. And my sense is that a lot of progressive voters, a lot of Black voters  especially in California  are skeptical of her record and question whether or not shes the right figure in this moment. I recall that she once described herself as the states top cop.\n\nalex burns\n\nI think thats one of the questions that we are going to see play out in this campaign going forward  is whether she can address the criticism of her record as a prosecutor more convincingly in a general election than she did during the primary. And the question is, has she done enough in the last few months, in the wake of George Floyd, in the midst of these demonstrations, to show that she is serious about criminal justice reform as a matter of governing now, that people who looked askance at her record during the Democratic primaries say, you know what? This is good enough or even better than good enough.\n\nmichael barbaro\n\nAnd in thinking about race and this moment, how should we be thinking about fact that Harris is herself a Black woman?\n\nalex burns\n\nWell thats of course of enormous importance in this moment. That I think starting in the late spring, the sense among people close to Biden was that it would be tough in this moment to really meet the political mood of the country if the Democrats put forward an all white ticket. That Joe Biden, as a 77-year-old white guy, needed a running mate who could speak to the countrys multiracial future in a way that he with his identity could not. And so, between her identity as a Black woman and as an Indian-American woman, Senator Harris, I think, clearly has an opportunity to speak to the country in a different way than a white running mate with her criminal justice record might have had. That there are people who may be willing to accept her embrace, her evolution on certain matters of police misconduct, police reform, criminal justice, because she can speak to those issues from the perspective of her own identity in a way that a white candidate could not.\n\nmichael barbaro\n\nOK. So next in these overlapping realities that guided Bidens choice, we have the pandemic, both as a public health crisis and an economic crisis. So how did that further narrow the field, influence the choice?\n\nalex burns\n\nSo this is a trickier one. Because the candidates for vice president who were most directly in contact with the pandemic, most directly involved in responding to the pandemic, were governors and mayors. But the pandemic has made it really hard for a lot of people to imagine choosing a running mate who would be campaigning for vice president at the same time as they were managing a crisis on the ground, where it would just be awfully difficult to imagine the governor of a state being out at a political fundraiser every day, or doing political morning shows when their state is experiencing a second wave of the virus in October.\n\nmichael barbaro\n\nSo are you saying that Kamala Harriss lack of responsibility in this pandemic was actually kind of an asset.\n\nalex burns\n\nWell, I think for all the senators the lack of day-to-day management responsibility in the coronavirus pandemic  yes, absolutely an asset to them in being considered as a political candidate for the fall.\n\nmichael barbaro\n\nAnd finally, Bidens age and his energy are kind of this third overlapping reality that you said would shape the decision. So how did that shape it?\n\nalex burns\n\nIt shapes it in a couple ways. Some of them are about governing, and some of them are about the political future of the Democratic party. When you talk to voters, when you see polls about how people see Biden, how people think about his vice presidential choice, there is clearly a sense that he is choosing a back up president in a way that you might not have if Biden were 57. And you put that together with the gravity of the crisis that this country is in, and the bar for what a vice president needs to bring to the table on the first day gets a lot higher. Kamala Harris ran for president. People know her as a former presidential candidate. Shes not a new face to most of the country. And that feeds into the dimension to this thats about the political future of the Democratic party as well.\n\nmichael barbaro\n\nWell, so youre starting to get at this. But how strongly do you think the age question, the succession question, influenced who Biden felt he could select in terms of their politics? Not just in terms of the future of the party, but the future of his ticket, whether he can win in the fall. And Im thinking about a voter who might be comfortable with the idea of a Vice President Warren, for example, right? But if they are thinking to themselves, but if something happens to Biden or if he doesnt seek re-election, am I comfortable with a President Warren? And therefore, he needed to choose a candidate whose politics aligned with his, resembled his, so that voters didnt feel like a more progressive figure was kind of being snuck into office through the back door of Joe Biden.\n\nalex burns\n\nWell, that is exactly the message that the Trump campaign is trying to push about Joe Biden. That he is a Trojan horse for the left. So we know that Joe Biden feels an affinity and a respect for Elizabeth Warren. And theyve gotten closer over the last few months. It clearly would have been a significant political risk for him to choose a running mate who is seen by a lot of the moderate white folks who are currently supporting him as an alternative to President Trump  might make them feel, like, maybe the president has a point. But in Kamala Harris, I think they feel they have somebody who cannot easily be caricatured as some flag burning radical who wants to burn down police stations. Right? Thats not the truth of her political biography. And it leaves the Trump campaign with a somewhat difficult task in trying to caricature the Biden ticket and a potential Biden administration as some kind of stealth project of the extreme left in this country.\n\nmichael barbaro\n\nSo with everything that you have laid out here, did all this leave Biden with many choices? Did you expect it to be Harris?\n\nalex burns\n\nSo Ill say two things to that. The first is, and Im glad you asked this. Because part of how weve been talking about this, I hope it doesnt sound to people like this was merely a process of elimination with Kamala Harris as the last person standing. She was one of the strongest candidates at the start, and in the middle, and obviously at the end. And there was never really any doubt that she would be one of the finalists. And the second part of this is that one thing we heard consistently was that he was making the selection from a position of political strength. That he is substantially ahead of President Trump in the polls right now. And if he had felt like, you know, the governing partner I want is somebody who I will have to defend from attacks that she is too liberal, like Elizabeth Warren, or that shes inexperienced, like Keisha Lance Bottoms, he definitely could have done that. And he didnt. He chose Kamala Harris.\n\nmichael barbaro\n\nSo now that we have Harris as the running mate, lets talk about what she brings and what kind of voters she is meant to appeal to. Who might go to the polls, or I guess the mailbox in this case, because of this choice of Kamala Harris? In the mind of Joe Biden and his advisers, I mean, how does this help him win in the fall?\n\nalex burns\n\nI think that they hope she will keep the broad appeal that Joe Biden currently has, while exciting groups that are currently voting for him but maybe without an enormous amount of enthusiasm. Think about young people. Think about educated left of left of center voters who may have supported Elizabeth Warren in the Democratic primary and see Joe Biden as just a figure from the past. Theyre not looking at Kamala Harris as somebody who is going to go out there and electrify the left the way somebody closer to Bernie Sanders or Elizabeth Warren might. Theyre looking at her as somebody who will excite Democrats and liberals and young people, because she does represent a breakthrough for the country, because she can speak about the themes of the Biden campaign with a perspective and a biography that Joe Biden himself lacks. And so the hope among Democrats and the hope of the Biden campaign is that Kamala Harris can do all of that without becoming a divisive or scary figure to voters in the center and to the right of center who are currently supporting Joe Biden but maybe havent voted for a Democrat in a while or ever.\n\nmichael barbaro\n\nSo what Harris does theoretically, in the eyes of the Biden campaign, is she firms up Biden supporters who may be skeptical. She helps bring in some people who might be on the fence. And she does that without alienating his existing base of supporters and without inflaming a whole bunch of other Americans, including Trump supporters.\n\nalex burns\n\nAgain, thats the hope. Whether it turns out that way I think is a really open question. And there are Democrats, including pretty senior Democrats who are pretty close to the Biden campaign, who will acknowledge at least in private that they really dont know how a lot of those voters in the middle will react to the idea of a Black woman being a 78-year-old heartbeat away from the presidency. So its not that theres no risk involved here. There is just a bet that there are more people in the country by a lot who will be excited by somebody who looks and sounds like Kamala Harris than people who will be turned off, or at least people who will be turned off who were open to Joe Biden to begin with. But, again, I think there is a high degree of confidence that the country is broadly ready for a ticket that looks like this. There is just some uncertainty about exactly who is ready for it.\n\n[music]\n\nmichael barbaro\n\nWell be right back Alex, weve been talking a lot about Biden, how hes thinking about this decision of a running mate. We havent talked much about how Kamala Harris is thinking about it. And I am mindful that she delivered the single most searing and memorable attack on Joe Biden \n\narchived recording (kamala harris) Vice President Biden \n\nmichael barbaro\n\n during the Democratic primary.\n\narchived recording (kamala harris) I do not believe you are a racist. But I also believe, and it is personal  and I was actually very  it was hurtful to hear you talk about the reputations of two United States senators who built their reputations and career on the segregation of race in this country. And it was not only that, but you also worked with them to oppose busing.\n\nmichael barbaro\n\nBasically saying that he was sympathetic to segregation and segregationists.\n\narchived recording (kamala harris) Do you agree today that you were wrong to oppose busing in America then? Do you agree? archived recording (joe biden) I did not oppose busing in America. What I opposed is busing ordered by the Department of Education.\n\nmichael barbaro\n\nWords that you really cant ever take back when you have said them on live television. So how does Harris square that  that point of view, that statement  with this decision to be Bidens running mate?\n\nalex burns\n\nIn a couple ways. You know, even at the most pitched moments of conflict between Joe Biden and Kamala Harris in the Democratic primary, I didnt talk to anybody in either of their camps who suggested that they just cannot stand each other, that they fundamentally see each other as bad people who were in politics for the wrong reasons. I think its pretty clear at this point that she did not think that his views on race were utterly disqualifying. And one of the things that I am personally going to be watching for with great interest is: What is the public chemistry and personal rapport between Joe Biden and Kamala Harris? How do they talk about this stuff when they get asked about it?\n\nmichael barbaro\n\nRight.\n\nalex burns\n\nI think its hard to imagine that Joe Biden would have chosen her if he didnt feel he had sufficient confidence based on their private conversations that the past is the past. But lets hear him say that for himself, if that is indeed how he feels.\n\nmichael barbaro\n\nAlex, do you think in any way the Biden campaign liked the idea of picking someone who had so publicly attacked him? Did they see any value in that?\n\nalex burns\n\nIll tell you what they did like, is they liked the idea of picking somebody who can deliver that kind of attack. Not against Joe Biden, but against Donald Trump, against Mike Pence in a vice presidential debate. You know, just a recognition that that person has real moves and real skills.\n\nmichael barbaro\n\nRight.\n\nalex burns\n\nAnd that even people who didnt like what she did to Joe Biden recognize that there was a kind of political dexterity and panache that Joe Biden himself has really not exhibited in this race.\n\nmichael barbaro\n\nWell, to that point, are we expecting Kamala Harris to be used to attack the president over the next three months or so? I mean, I vividly remember people during the Democratic debates, the pundit class, talking about the prospect of seeing Harris apply the same kind of sharp prosecutorial flair that she had used against Biden on Donald Trump.\n\nalex burns\n\nI think theres a universal expectation among Democrats that Kamala Harris will be a obviously major carrier of a message of criticism and denunciation against the Trump administration. And that in her role in the Senate, she will continue to really hold the administrations feet to the fire in different ways. There is  not to get too far ahead of the game here  but if we did have a Supreme Court confirmation battle in the middle of all of this, she is a member of the Judiciary Committee. That has been a major source of her stature and popularity within the Democratic party, because of how she handled moments like the Brett Kavanaugh confirmations.\n\narchived recording (kamala harris) So Im going to ask you one last time, are you willing to ask the White House to authorize the F.B.I. to investigate the claims that have been made against you? archived recording (brett kavanaugh) Well, Ill do whatever the committee wants, of course. archived recording (kamala harris) And Ive heard you say that. archived recording (brett kavanaugh) The witness statements  archived recording (kamala harris) Ive not heard you ask  Ive not heard you answer a very specific question thats been asked.\n\nalex burns\n\nSo I think theres a high degree of optimism and sky high expectations for the role that Harris will play in, as she would put it, prosecuting the case against Donald Trump.\n\narchived recording (kamala harris) So are you willing to ask the White House to do it? And say yes or no, and then we can move on. archived recording (brett kavanaugh) Ive had six background investigations over 26 years. archived recording (kamala harris) Sir, as it relates to the recent allegations, are you willing to have them do it. archived recording (brett kavanaugh) The witness testimony is before you. No witness who was there supports that I was there. archived recording (kamala harris) OK. Im going to take that as a no. And we can move on. You have said \n\nmichael barbaro\n\nWell, with that in mind, I mean, what are we expecting the Trump campaign to say about Kamala Harris, about this choice? What are they saying about her so far?\n\nalex burns\n\nIts been pretty scattershot so far.\n\narchived recording (ad for donald trump) Voters rejected Harris. They smartly spotted a phony.\n\nalex burns\n\nYou have had the Trump campaign immediately putting out videos, statements attacking her as yet another Trojan horse for the radical left.\n\narchived recording (ad for donald trump) Kamala Harris ran for president by rushing to the radical left, embracing Bernies plan for socialized medicine, calling for trillions in new taxes, attacking \n\nalex burns\n\nThat she adopted these more left-wing ideas during the primary and that, in her heart, that is truly her agenda, just like they claim it is for Joe Biden. The president himself we saw at the White House earlier today come out and call Kamala Harris a nasty for how she handled the Kavanaugh hearing.\n\narchived recording (donald trump) I was a little surprised. She was extraordinarily nasty to Judge Kavanaugh then, now Justice Kavanaugh. She was nasty to a level that was just a horrible thing the way she was. The way she \n\nalex burns\n\nAgain, there was the sort of she, like Joe, is just going to be another radical lefty.\n\narchived recording Shes also known, from what I understand, as being just about the most liberal person in the U.S. Senate. And I would have thought that Biden would have tried to stay away from that a little bit. Because \n\nalex burns\n\nI dont know how convincing that is going to be as an attack on Senator Harris. And a lot of the stuff thats been said about her by the Trump folks so far, with the exception of what the president said on the Kavanaugh hearings, you could really imagine them saying about basically anybody Biden chose as a running mate. So theres kind of a boilerplate quality to it. And I think you still do kind of have the sense that they are trying to run against the Democratic ticket as though the Democrats nominated Bernie Sanders, when obviously they nominated somebody much more moderate than that.\n\nmichael barbaro\n\nYou know, Alex, its actually been a pretty long time since weve had big political news. You know, politics is not the dominant story of America right now.\n\nalex burns\n\nMichael, that hurts my feelings.\n\nmichael barbaro\n\nI know that. I know that. And look, youre just as essential as youve ever been. But that being said, what are you thinking about with this decision, knowing everything else thats going on?\n\nalex burns\n\nWhat do you mean? Just, like, whats on my mind personally?\n\nmichael barbaro\n\nNot like, what are you making for dinner? But like, you know.\n\n[laughter]\n\nalex burns\n\nYou know, we have been talking about these intertwined realities of the campaign that all fed into this decision by Biden. What ties together everything Joe Biden has done in this race so far  I think including his choice of the vice president  is his real conviction that you can bring the country together again, that you can run as a unity candidate in a country this divided and in so much painful turmoil. It worked out for him in the Democratic primary. It seems to be working out for him so far in the general election. But just because it seems to be working out for him politically so far with Donald Trump as your opponent doesnt necessarily mean that that is an achievable thing for any president to do in this country at this time.\n\n[music]\n\nThis is, in some ways, less of a question for the next few months of this election than for the next four years if Joe Biden and Kamala Harris are elected. Is how justified is Joe Bidens faith that you can put things together again? And how much is he setting himself and his party up for disappointment and turmoil if it turns out that a coalition that you put together to beat Donald Trump in November isnt necessarily held together by a whole lot besides this urgent desire to beat an unpopular president?\n\nmichael barbaro\n\nAlex, thank you very much.\n\nalex burns\n\nThanks, Michael.\n\nmichael barbaro\n\nBiden and Harris are scheduled to appear together for the first time as a ticket later today at a hotel in Delaware, the same hotel where Biden first announced his campaign for U.S. Senate in 1972. Well be right back. Heres what else you need to know today.\n\narchived recording [CROWDS YELLING AND SIRENS BLARING]\n\nmichael barbaro\n\nProtests in Belarus are entering their fourth consecutive day over suspicious election results that gave the countrys authoritarian president his latest landslide victory. The election is widely viewed as rigged by President Alexandra Lukashenko, who is known as Europes last dictator, fueling the biggest anti-government demonstrations since Belarus left the Soviet Union in 1991 and a massive government crackdown in response. And \n\narchived recording (kevin warren) When you look at this decision, we just believe collectively theres too much uncertainty at this point in time in our country to really  to encourage our student athletes to participate in fall sports.

Joe Biden announced his choice about three hours ago, that it was going to be Kamala Harris. And Alex, the last time that we spoke with you, we talked about three overlapping realities that you said were influencing Bidens choice of a running mate  the nationwide protests over race and policing, the pandemic and the economic collapse. And then there was Bidens age, the fact that he would be the oldest president to assume the office. So how does Biden get from those realities to Kamala Harris?\n\nalex burns\n\nSo I think in some ways they are three distinct forces. And in some ways, they really are different strands of the same big current. Which is that Biden was looking from the start for a running mate who he saw and who he believed the country would see as a really serious person for really serious times.

So how did that shape it?\n\nalex burns\n\nIt shapes it in a couple ways. Some of them are about governing, and some of them are about the political future of the Democratic party. When you talk to voters, when you see polls about how people see Biden, how people think about his vice presidential choice, there is clearly a sense that he is choosing a back up president in a way that you might not have if Biden were 57. And you put that together with the gravity of the crisis that this country is in, and the bar for what a vice president needs to bring to the table on the first day gets a lot higher. Kamala Harris ran for president. People know her as a former presidential candidate. Shes not a new face to most of the country. And that feeds into the dimension to this thats about the political future of the Democratic party as well.\n\nmichael barbaro\n\nWell, so youre starting to get at this. But how strongly do you think the age question, the succession question, influenced who Biden felt he could select in terms of their politics? Not just in terms of the future of the party, but the future of his ticket, whether he can win in the fall. And Im thinking about a voter who might be comfortable with the idea of a Vice President Warren, for example, right? But if they are thinking to themselves, but if something happens to Biden or if he doesnt seek re-election, am I comfortable with a President Warren? And therefore, he needed to choose a candidate whose politics aligned with his, resembled his, so that voters didnt feel like a more progressive figure was kind of being snuck into office through the back door of Joe Biden.\n\nalex burns\n\nWell, that is exactly the message that the Trump campaign is trying to push about Joe Biden. That he is a Trojan horse for the left. So we know that Joe Biden feels an affinity and a respect for Elizabeth Warren. And theyve gotten closer over the last few months. It clearly would have been a significant political risk for him to choose a running mate who is seen by a lot of the moderate white folks who are currently supporting him as an alternative to President Trump  might make them feel, like, maybe the president has a point. But in Kamala Harris, I think they feel they have somebody who cannot easily be caricatured as some flag burning radical who wants to burn down police stations. Right? Thats not the truth of her political biography. And it leaves the Trump campaign with a somewhat difficult task in trying to caricature the Biden ticket and a potential Biden administration as some kind of stealth project of the extreme left in this country.\n\nmichael barbaro\n\nSo with everything that you have laid out here, did all this leave Biden with many choices? Did you expect it to be Harris?\n\nalex burns\n\nSo Ill say two things to that. The first is, and Im glad you asked this. Because part of how weve been talking about this, I hope it doesnt sound to people like this was merely a process of elimination with Kamala Harris as the last person standing. She was one of the strongest candidates at the start, and in the middle, and obviously at the end. And there was never really any doubt that she would be one of the finalists. And the second part of this is that one thing we heard consistently was that he was making the selection from a position of political strength. That he is substantially ahead of President Trump in the polls right now. And if he had felt like, you know, the governing partner I want is somebody who I will have to defend from attacks that she is too liberal, like Elizabeth Warren, or that shes inexperienced, like Keisha Lance Bottoms, he definitely could have done that. And he didnt. He chose Kamala Harris.\n\nmichael barbaro\n\nSo now that we have Harris as the running mate, lets talk about what she brings and what kind of voters she is meant to appeal to. Who might go to the polls, or I guess the mailbox in this case, because of this choice of Kamala Harris? In the mind of Joe Biden and his advisers, I mean, how does this help him win in the fall?\n\nalex burns\n\nI think that they hope she will keep the broad appeal that Joe Biden currently has, while exciting groups that are currently voting for him but maybe without an enormous amount of enthusiasm. Think about young people. Think about educated left of left of center voters who may have supported Elizabeth Warren in the Democratic primary and see Joe Biden as just a figure from the past. Theyre not looking at Kamala Harris as somebody who is going to go out there and electrify the left the way somebody closer to Bernie Sanders or Elizabeth Warren might. Theyre looking at her as somebody who will excite Democrats and liberals and young people, because she does represent a breakthrough for the country, because she can speak about the themes of the Biden campaign with a perspective and a biography that Joe Biden himself lacks. And so the hope among Democrats and the hope of the Biden campaign is that Kamala Harris can do all of that without becoming a divisive or scary figure to voters in the center and to the right of center who are currently supporting Joe Biden but maybe havent voted for a Democrat in a while or ever.\n\nmichael barbaro\n\nSo what Harris does theoretically, in the eyes of the Biden campaign, is she firms up Biden supporters who may be skeptical. She helps bring in some people who might be on the fence. And she does that without alienating his existing base of supporters and without inflaming a whole bunch of other Americans, including Trump supporters.\n\nalex burns\n\nAgain, thats the hope. Whether it turns out that way I think is a really open question. And there are Democrats, including pretty senior Democrats who are pretty close to the Biden campaign, who will acknowledge at least in private that they really dont know how a lot of those voters in the middle will react to the idea of a Black woman being a 78-year-old heartbeat away from the presidency. So its not that theres no risk involved here. There is just a bet that there are more people in the country by a lot who will be excited by somebody who looks and sounds like Kamala Harris than people who will be turned off, or at least people who will be turned off who were open to Joe Biden to begin with. But, again, I think there is a high degree of confidence that the country is broadly ready for a ticket that looks like this. There is just some uncertainty about exactly who is ready for it.\n\n[music]\n\nmichael barbaro\n\nWell be right back Alex, weve been talking a lot about Biden, how hes thinking about this decision of a running mate. We havent talked much about how Kamala Harris is thinking about it. And I am mindful that she delivered the single most searing and memorable attack on Joe Biden \n\narchived recording (kamala harris) Vice President Biden \n\nmichael barbaro\n\n during the Democratic primary.\n\narchived recording (kamala harris) I do not believe you are a racist. But I also believe, and it is personal  and I was actually very  it was hurtful to hear you talk about the reputations of two United States senators who built their reputations and career on the segregation of race in this country. And it was not only that, but you also worked with them to oppose busing.\n\nmichael barbaro\n\nBasically saying that he was sympathetic to segregation and segregationists.\n\narchived recording (kamala harris) Do you agree today that you were wrong to oppose busing in America then? Do you agree? archived recording (joe biden) I did not oppose busing in America. What I opposed is busing ordered by the Department of Education.\n\nmichael barbaro\n\nWords that you really cant ever take back when you have said them on live television. So how does Harris square that  that point of view, that statement  with this decision to be Bidens running mate?\n\nalex burns\n\nIn a couple ways. You know, even at the most pitched moments of conflict between Joe Biden and Kamala Harris in the Democratic primary, I didnt talk to anybody in either of their camps who suggested that they just cannot stand each other, that they fundamentally see each other as bad people who were in politics for the wrong reasons. I think its pretty clear at this point that she did not think that his views on race were utterly disqualifying. And one of the things that I am personally going to be watching for with great interest is: What is the public chemistry and personal rapport between Joe Biden and Kamala Harris? How do they talk about this stuff when they get asked about it?\n\nmichael barbaro\n\nRight.\n\nalex burns\n\nI think its hard to imagine that Joe Biden would have chosen her if he didnt feel he had sufficient confidence based on their private conversations that the past is the past. But lets hear him say that for himself, if that is indeed how he feels.\n\nmichael barbaro\n\nAlex, do you think in any way the Biden campaign liked the idea of picking someone who had so publicly attacked him? Did they see any value in that?\n\nalex burns\n\nIll tell you what they did like, is they liked the idea of picking somebody who can deliver that kind of attack. Not against Joe Biden, but against Donald Trump, against Mike Pence in a vice presidential debate. You know, just a recognition that that person has real moves and real skills.\n\nmichael barbaro\n\nRight.\n\nalex burns\n\nAnd that even people who didnt like what she did to Joe Biden recognize that there was a kind of political dexterity and panache that Joe Biden himself has really not exhibited in this race.\n\nmichael barbaro\n\nWell, to that point, are we expecting Kamala Harris to be used to attack the president over the next three months or so? I mean, I vividly remember people during the Democratic debates, the pundit class, talking about the prospect of seeing Harris apply the same kind of sharp prosecutorial flair that she had used against Biden on Donald Trump.\n\nalex burns\n\nI think theres a universal expectation among Democrats that Kamala Harris will be a obviously major carrier of a message of criticism and denunciation against the Trump administration. And that in her role in the Senate, she will continue to really hold the administrations feet to the fire in different ways. There is  not to get too far ahead of the game here  but if we did have a Supreme Court confirmation battle in the middle of all of this, she is a member of the Judiciary Committee. That has been a major source of her stature and popularity within the Democratic party, because of how she handled moments like the Brett Kavanaugh confirmations.\n\narchived recording (kamala harris) So Im going to ask you one last time, are you willing to ask the White House to authorize the F.B.I. to investigate the claims that have been made against you? archived recording (brett kavanaugh) Well, Ill do whatever the committee wants, of course. archived recording (kamala harris) And Ive heard you say that. archived recording (brett kavanaugh) The witness statements  archived recording (kamala harris) Ive not heard you ask  Ive not heard you answer a very specific question thats been asked.\n\nalex burns\n\nSo I think theres a high degree of optimism and sky high expectations for the role that Harris will play in, as she would put it, prosecuting the case against Donald Trump.\n\narchived recording (kamala harris) So are you willing to ask the White House to do it? And say yes or no, and then we can move on. archived recording (brett kavanaugh) Ive had six background investigations over 26 years. archived recording (kamala harris) Sir, as it relates to the recent allegations, are you willing to have them do it. archived recording (brett kavanaugh) The witness testimony is before you. No witness who was there supports that I was there. archived recording (kamala harris) OK. Im going to take that as a no. And we can move on. You have said \n\nmichael barbaro\n\nWell, with that in mind, I mean, what are we expecting the Trump campaign to say about Kamala Harris, about this choice? What are they saying about her so far?\n\nalex burns\n\nIts been pretty scattershot so far.\n\narchived recording (ad for donald trump) Voters rejected Harris. They smartly spotted a phony.\n\nalex burns\n\nYou have had the Trump campaign immediately putting out videos, statements attacking her as yet another Trojan horse for the radical left.\n\narchived recording (ad for donald trump) Kamala Harris ran for president by rushing to the radical left, embracing Bernies plan for socialized medicine, calling for trillions in new taxes, attacking \n\nalex burns\n\nThat she adopted these more left-wing ideas during the primary and that, in her heart, that is truly her agenda, just like they claim it is for Joe Biden. The president himself we saw at the White House earlier today come out and call Kamala Harris a nasty for how she handled the Kavanaugh hearing.\n\narchived recording (donald trump) I was a little surprised. She was extraordinarily nasty to Judge Kavanaugh then, now Justice Kavanaugh. She was nasty to a level that was just a horrible thing the way she was. The way she \n\nalex burns\n\nAgain, there was the sort of she, like Joe, is just going to be another radical lefty.\n\narchived recording Shes also known, from what I understand, as being just about the most liberal person in the U.S. Senate. And I would have thought that Biden would have tried to stay away from that a little bit. Because \n\nalex burns\n\nI dont know how convincing that is going to be as an attack on Senator Harris. And a lot of the stuff thats been said about her by the Trump folks so far, with the exception of what the president said on the Kavanaugh hearings, you could really imagine them saying about basically anybody Biden chose as a running mate. So theres kind of a boilerplate quality to it. And I think you still do kind of have the sense that they are trying to run against the Democratic ticket as though the Democrats nominated Bernie Sanders, when obviously they nominated somebody much more moderate than that.\n\nmichael barbaro\n\nYou know, Alex, its actually been a pretty long time since weve had big political news. You know, politics is not the dominant story of America right now.\n\nalex burns\n\nMichael, that hurts my feelings.\n\nmichael barbaro\n\nI know that. I know that. And look, youre just as essential as youve ever been. But that being said, what are you thinking about with this decision, knowing everything else thats going on?\n\nalex burns\n\nWhat do you mean? Just, like, whats on my mind personally?\n\nmichael barbaro\n\nNot like, what are you making for dinner? But like, you know.\n\n[laughter]\n\nalex burns\n\nYou know, we have been talking about these intertwined realities of the campaign that all fed into this decision by Biden. What ties together everything Joe Biden has done in this race so far  I think including his choice of the vice president  is his real conviction that you can bring the country together again, that you can run as a unity candidate in a country this divided and in so much painful turmoil. It worked out for him in the Democratic primary. It seems to be working out for him so far in the general election. But just because it seems to be working out for him politically so far with Donald Trump as your opponent doesnt necessarily mean that that is an achievable thing for any president to do in this country at this time.\n\n[music]\n\nThis is, in some ways, less of a question for the next few months of this election than for the next four years if Joe Biden and Kamala Harris are elected. Is how justified is Joe Bidens faith that you can put things together again? And how much is he setting himself and his party up for disappointment and turmoil if it turns out that a coalition that you put together to beat Donald Trump in November isnt necessarily held together by a whole lot besides this urgent desire to beat an unpopular president?\n\nmichael barbaro\n\nAlex, thank you very much.\n\nalex burns\n\nThanks, Michael.\n\nmichael barbaro\n\nBiden and Harris are scheduled to appear together for the first time as a ticket later today at a hotel in Delaware, the same hotel where Biden first announced his campaign for U.S. Senate in 1972. Well be right back. Heres what else you need to know today.\n\narchived recording [CROWDS YELLING AND SIRENS BLARING]\n\nmichael barbaro\n\nProtests in Belarus are entering their fourth consecutive day over suspicious election results that gave the countrys authoritarian president his latest landslide victory. The election is widely viewed as rigged by President Alexandra Lukashenko, who is known as Europes last dictator, fueling the biggest anti-government demonstrations since Belarus left the Soviet Union in 1991 and a massive government crackdown in response. And \n\narchived recording (kevin warren) When you look at this decision, we just believe collectively theres too much uncertainty at this point in time in our country to really  to encourage our student athletes to participate in fall sports. And we just, I take this responsibility seriously.\n\nmichael barbaro'

Its Wednesday, July 31.\n\n[phone ringing]\n\nspeaker\n\nGood afternoon, and thank you for calling Aloft Detroit. This is Ferris speaking.

Weve reached Alex Burns in Detroit, where hes covering the Democratic debates. Alex, the last time we spoke, it was right after the first Democratic debate, and all the attention had been on this exchange between Kamala Harris and Joe Biden about busing. But then this other interesting thing happened.\n\narchived recording (kamala harris) No one should have to work more than one job to have a roof over their head and food on the table.\n\nalexander burns\n\nRight, there was this more muddled moment for Kamala Harris.\n\narchived recording (lester holt) Youve all expressed an interest in talking about health care  archived recording (marianne williamson) Id like to say something if I might. archived recording (lester holt)  so lets talk about health care. And this is going to be a show-of-hands question. Many people watching at home have health insurance at their employer. Who here would abolish their private health insurance in favor of a government-run plan?\n\nalexander burns\n\nShe raised her hand on the debate stage, and then after the debate, clarified that she thought the question was referring to whether she would give up her own personal private health insurance and enroll in a single-payer plan, and that in fact, she did not favor getting rid of private health insurance entirely.\n\narchived recording (kamala harris) So the question was, would you be willing to give up your private insurance  archived recording (tony dokoupil) Thats not how it was asked. archived recording (kamala harris)  for such a plan, and  archived recording (tony dokoupil) Thats what you heard, right? archived recording (kamala harris) O.K. Yeah, thats certainly what I heard. And in terms of  I am supportive of Medicare for all. And under a Medicare for all policy, private insurance would certainly exist and for supplemental coverage. But \n\nmichael barbaro\n\nAnd it feels like this is kind of emblematic of Kamala Harris and her entire candidacy.\n\nalexander burns\n\nThats right, that shes somebody who is deeply inspiring to liberals, a lot of people who are on the more progressive end of the Democratic Party. But she has consistently stopped short of fully embracing a lot of the big ideological litmus test issues that tend to define those candidates, that folks like Bernie Sanders and Elizabeth Warren have been much clearer about where they fall on the left-right spectrum. And on the other side of the spectrum, folks like Joe Biden have been just as clear. Kamala Harris, somewhere in between.\n\nmichael barbaro\n\nAnd Alex, why does that matter?\n\nalexander burns\n\nIn a presidential election, we tend to try to sort candidates both in terms of how liberal or conservative they are, but also just in terms of what their overarching vision for the country is. What would the country look like after four or eight years of this persons presidency if they could do anything they wanted or if they could do a lot of the things they wanted? Now, Kamala Harris has been taking her time to sort of lay out exactly what that would look like. And at this point in the campaign, where she has clearly caught on as a very serious contender for the nomination, a lot of Democratic voters I talked to still feel like they dont totally have their arms around what the vision is supposed to be.\n\nmichael barbaro\n\nSo what have you been doing in the time since the first debate on that front of trying to understand what she stands for?\n\nalexander burns\n\nWell, we really set out after that first debate to try to get a hold of what that vision was, to try to clarify. To that end, I spent a lot of time talking to people who have worked with her, reading her most recent book, reading columns she wrote over the years, both in San Francisco and nationally, looking at commencement speeches she gave to see sort of what she talks about when she talks about inspirational values. There were some consistent themes that came out of all of that. A number of people  five different people I spoke to about her who have worked quite closely with her said in different ways that she was just not an ideological person. In almost identical language, shes not ideological. Shes not an ideologue. One man who was one of her most senior advisers as attorney general of California said that he thinks ideology is just not relevant to the way she makes decisions. So all those conversations, all of that reporting was really helpful in getting a broad picture of how she approaches issues, some sense of what goes on in her head as she executes the powers of government. But of course, you cant really get inside someones head without talking to them. And even then, it can be kind of a stretch. So I went to L.A. to actually sit down with her about a week and a half ago. She was out there doing a whole bunch of fundraising, was doing some debate prep. And so on a Sunday afternoon, I trekked out to Century City, to a pretty desolate, corporate part of town where I think she had been doing debate prep. And we sat down at a very, very long conference table in a very, very nice office suite and sort of went right at it.\n\nalexander burns I spoke to a lot of people who youve worked with over the years, and there are some pretty consistent themes that come out of that. And one of them that  I dont know if it was surprising to me, but it was interesting to me. Four or five different people in almost exactly the same language just said, like, she is not ideological. Shes not an ideologue. And I was wondering, just to start, does that ring true to you? kamala harris Yeah. Yeah, it does. alexander burns And what does that mean?\n\nalexander burns\n\nSo right off the bat, she basically endorses that description of her and her approach to policy, that shes not ideological.\n\nkamala harris I mean, Im not really into labels. For me, I come at issues through the lens of how it actually impacts people, as opposed to, does this issue fit in a certain category of perspective, right?\n\nalexander burns\n\nThat she thinks about policy in terms of a series of practical tests, but not necessarily trying to fit it into a particular ideological umbrella or even necessarily some big sweeping integrated vision.\n\nkamala harris You know, if anything, what they would have told you probably is that I have often asked  I always ask questions about policy there based on how will this actually impact a person, to the point that sometimes it just drives them bananas, because I literally get into that level of detail.\n\nalexander burns\n\nYou know, for me, that was sort of an interesting statement that she just rejected the basic terms of a debate that a lot of the other candidates and certainly a lot of political analysts want to use to understand campaigns. What it didnt say to me was if somebody is just a pragmatist, if somebody is just interested in making concrete policy change, well, how do they choose what kinds of policies to pursue and what counts to them as important change? And she talked a lot about less an ideology and more an orientation, that her grounding in thinking about government and in thinking about the role of policy comes from her background as a lawyer, as a prosecutor, as an executive. And when she thinks about policy, asking a series of pretty concrete, ground-level questions to assess whether something is worth doing, not trying to slot it into a bigger picture.\n\nkamala harris Because it really, for me, policy has to be relevant. Thats my guiding principle. Is it relevant? Not does it  is it a beautiful sonnet, right? Is it actually relevant? Because if its not, it does not matter. If not, then its just, its an idea, right? As opposed to what its  maybe because my orientation is also as an executive, which is I believe that the things that I say are going to happen will actually happen. Not just supposed to happen, I believe they will actually happen. So for me, knowing that they will actually happen, how will they impact real people? So if anything, there are tests that I have for the relevancy or the significance of policy, but its not an ideological test. alexander burns What else is in that list of tests besides just, will it help actual people?\n\nalexander burns\n\nShe listed three questions. The first is does it help a substantial number of people?\n\nkamala harris Because policy, if it only impacts just a few, I dont know that its really as relevant, right? To the greater number.\n\nalexander burns\n\nThe second question was whether it affects children, how it affects children. And the third question is how long will it take?\n\nkamala harris The significance of the passage of time. So using Brown v. Board of Education as an example of this, the significance of the passage of time is that all those who knew the importance of getting that case there had to be patient to some extent, knowing that they had to build a precedent. So then Brown v. Board of Education was decided in 1954, I believe, May of 1954. And everyone is sitting around. This is my interpretation of what happened. Cha-ching, cha-ching. There are glasses of chardonnay and champagne. Oh, this is lovely and wonderful. We won, right? But not until almost 20 years later did it hit the streets of Berkeley, California. alexander burns Mm-hmm.\n\nalexander burns\n\nAnd that one to me was sort of the most revealing, that there are a lot of candidates in this race who are promising really, really big changes because they feel they would have profound consequences on everyday peoples lives. The notion that a fundamental test for Kamala Harris is can this be done quickly, to me, was sort of eye opening.\n\nkamala harris Every day in the life of someone who is being denied justice is a very long time. So part of how I think about policy is also through that lens. How long will it take us to get where we need to go? And what will be the cost-benefit of the significance of the passage of time? I guess thats it.\n\nmichael barbaro\n\nAlex, when you pushed her on this, did she give you any examples from her own time in government?\n\nalexander burns\n\nWell, she talked about her decision to, when she was attorney general, walk away from the initial settlement with the big banks around the mortgage crisis.\n\nkamala harris Im going to tell you, that was one of the most difficult professional and personal experiences that Ive had.\n\nalexander burns\n\nThere was a settlement offer of several billion dollars that she ultimately decided was not adequate. And she, along with several other state attorneys general, walked away from the deal until the banks offered them something substantially greater than that.\n\nkamala harris I knew that every day that we did not have a deal was a day people would lose their homes in real time.\n\nalexander burns\n\nThe question was do you help more people later or fewer people sooner, right? Give less help faster or more help after more time has passed. And she chose the latter option in this case, which, in some ways, is the exception that proves the rule, right? But the notion that the pressure to do something quickly was weighing on her, to me, was a pretty vivid description of how she thinks about making big decisions.\n\nkamala harris The way I used to talk about it is that there are people barely holding on with their fingernails in their homes. And the issue there was that, well, that deal would have helped me save, if I remember the numbers correctly, about 40,000, versus what I knew the settlement actually should be, that would have been a lot more.\n\nalexander burns\n\nShe talked about this real internal tension around whether to push it even further with the banks, which, of course, is ultimately what she did.\n\nkamala harris But again, its the significance of the passage of time. And maybe my orientation comes, again  Ill repeat  from being an executive and knowing that the decisions that I make are decisions that will actually happen, as opposed to me writing an article or writing a book. alexander burns Just to try to make the subtext text here, like, is that the Elizabeth Warren agenda here, that this is like, yeah, this looks great in a journal article, but, like  kamala harris I dont know. I dont know. I mean, I think shes got some good ideas. And definitely, shes got some good ideas. But I dont say what Im saying to contrast myself with her. Yeah.\n\nalexander burns\n\nIt also, to me, explains why, in some ways, she has seemed resistant to or skeptical of some of the really, really monumental policy commitments that other candidates have made, like Medicare for all, because its certainly a transformational change. Its a change that, on a practical level, may or may not be able to happen within the term of one president.\n\nalexander burns I mean, something like Medicare for all, right? The idea that, like, yeah, in four years, everybodys going to be on a different health plan, and its going to be amazing. Do you look at that as a worthy aspiration, but probably not really? kamala harris Well, this is really interesting. I mean, I havent been talking about it a lot publicly, but certainly, I certainly do think a lot about that, about what is that transition really going to look like? Because I know that the goal is achievable. But whats the transition going to look like? And I do give that a lot of thought. I do, because, again, to your point, its about  well, and maybe to my point  [LAUGHTER] Im sorry. Its just Ive been working every day, and Ive got stuff to do non-stop. It is about relevance, right? Like, how are we going to actually get there? This thing sounds great, but how are we going to actually get there?\n\n[music]\n\nmichael barbaro\n\nWell be right back. Harris seems to be describing a vision of governing within a system that has real limitations and constraints. But a lot of her rivals in this race and the people that shes going to be standing next to on stage Wednesday night stand for sweeping change that would kind of swap out a burdened system and replace it with something where they can do more.\n\nalexander burns\n\nYeah, I asked her about exactly that.\n\nalexander burns Tell me if you totally disagree with this, obviously, right? But on the one hand in the race, you have Warren and Sanders, who very clearly want to restructure society, right? kamala harris Right. alexander burns And on the other side  youre shaking your head. kamala harris Yeah, well, because Im not trying to restructure society. Im just trying to take care of the issues that wake people up in the middle of the night. alexander burns Yeah. And you think those people can be essentially relieved of that in a meaningful, durable way without changing fundamental structures? kamala harris Well, no, no, no. But let me tell you the fundamental structures that I think about. And its probably not what you have in mind, but its certainly how I think about it. Infrastructure  Americas infrastructure, 125, 150 years old, bridges and highways falling apart. Almost half of American families are a $400 unexpected expense away from complete upheaval. Do you know how much four tires cost? alexander burns I dont. kamala harris Its about that. speaker Hes a New Yorker. kamala harris But  I know, but this is my point about the details of how I think about it. Because heres how I think about the whole infrastructure issue. People are driving every day on roads and bridges that have potholes. Why do you need to buy new tires? Because youre driving on those damn potholes every day. Another fact that I know to be true for working families, many working families cannot afford to live where they work. So they got these long commutes, and their cars are breaking down. Like, this is what I mean about looking at the policy through the lens of real people. I would \n\nalexander burns\n\nSo her argument is if you fix the roads and fewer people have to replace their tires because of these potholes, that ought to be seen as a fundamental change. Its not getting rid of the electoral college. Its not reforming the Supreme Court. Its not creating a Canadian-style health care system, right? Its infrastructure. Is that fundamental change? Thats a question that other people, I guess, can assess what counts to them. But to me, its super revealing that she would say, no, I am in favor of fundamental change. And the example of that is this extremely non-controversial, broadly supported idea of spending more money on roads. Its not really a dividing line between her and other candidates. What is a dividing line between her and other candidates is that she considers that fundamental change.\n\nkamala harris Now, I dont know. Do you call that grand systems change or not? I dont know. But Ill tell you that itll have a profound impact on a lot of peoples lives  profound.\n\nalexander burns\n\nI guess one of my big takeaways here is that its not just that she resists positioning herself on a left-right spectrum. Its that she doesnt necessarily have a thematic vision of all the kinds of change she wants to make that you can just fit all her policies into. What there is is a unifying attitude towards what counts as important policy and how government power ought to be used.\n\nmichael barbaro\n\nSo in other words, she has a clear definition of why something is worth pursuing, why its important. But the result can look a little bit like a grab bag  different policies that dont necessarily all line up.\n\nalexander burns\n\nI think thats a great way of describing it, that its different policies that pass her practical tests, but dont necessarily have a whole lot to do with each other.\n\nalexander burns Is there anything that I havent asked you that you think is essential? kamala harris Theres so much stuff. speaker You have to go to your next thing. kamala harris I know. But is there anything I should \n\nmichael barbaro\n\nAlex, at the end of this conversation, did you feel satisfied? Did you feel like you had a deeper understanding of this question that you went into the room with about Kamala Harris?\n\nalexander burns\n\nI do feel like after having that conversation, its clear to me that her longtime colleagues, her friends, her associates and supporters really had it right, that shes not an ideological candidate, that theres not a hidden ideology that shes declining to articulate or struggling to articulate, that she truly is just not somebody who approaches policy and politics that way. What she did do is explain in, I think, illuminating detail why she makes the decisions she does.\n\nmichael barbaro\n\nAlex, lets talk about whether this approach from Kamala Harris can satisfy voters. Does it really matter that Kamala Harris does not want to be defined by ideology? Im asking that broadly, in terms of what we know about politics in general and in the context of this particular primary and the calculations that the whole party is making this year.\n\nalexander burns\n\nI dont think it matters that she wont put an exact ideological label on herself. When I go to campaign events, I dont hear a lot of voters who say, you know, I consider myself an economic populist, and therefore Im voting for Elizabeth Warren. I do think it matters that she has resisted this idea of putting her policy under a comprehensive vision, right? An umbrella that people can use to gauge her instincts, even on issues that shes not speaking to directly. I think there are a lot of people who, if you were to take an Elizabeth Warren voter or a Joe Biden voter, and ask them, what position do you think they would take on issue X? They have a framework for understanding how those candidates approach issues generally and what matters to them and might have at least some gut sense of how Elizabeth Warren would address an issue that shes never been directly asked about before. I do think it matters that people may not have that same sense for Kamala Harris.\n\nmichael barbaro\n\nMm-hmm. Right. I mean, the value of an ideology that people can easily grasp is that its a road map. It helps you understand how someones likely to respond to a particular set of circumstances, a crisis, any kind of situation. Its very clarifying. And without it, things feel a little more rudderless.\n\nalexander burns\n\nRight, and youre asking people to put a lot of trust in your judgment to deal with things on a case by case basis. And if you can win their trust, then that gives you a lot of flexibility to choose your fights and how youre going approach policy and sort of what methods youre going to use. If you dont win their trust, then people can end up feeling like they dont quite know what your core is. And I think thats the big challenge for her right now in this race. So the best-case scenario for Kamala Harris is that she gets through this primary by really firing up a critical mass of the Democratic coalition with the kinds of targeted policies that weve been talking about and with her identity and political narrative. I think the evidence so far is that Democrats are willing to give Kamala Harris somewhat more room to figure out what she wants her vision to be than some of the other candidates in this race. And then in the general election, shes not necessarily tied to all of the same economic populist, liberal ideas that some of the other candidates in this race would be.\n\nmichael barbaro\n\nAlex, thank you very much. Appreciate it.\n\nalexander burns\n\nThank you.\n\nmichael barbaro\n\nWell be right back. Heres what else you need to know today.\n\narchived recording (john delaney) Folks, we have a choice. We can go down the road that Senator Sanders and Senator Warren want to take us, which is with bad policies like Medicare for all, free everything, and impossible promises thatll turn off independent voters and get Trump re-elected. Thats what happened with \n\nmichael barbaro\n\nIn Tuesday nights Democratic debate, the leading liberal candidates, Senators Bernie Sanders and Elizabeth Warren, fought back against claims by more moderate opponents that their plans are impractical and that their chances of beating President Trump are slim.\n\narchived recording (jake tapper) You support Medicare for all, which would eventually take private health insurance away from more than 150 million Americans in exchange for government-sponsored health care for everyone. Congressman Delaney just referred to it as bad policy. And previously, he has called the idea political suicide that will just get President Trump re-elected. What do you say to Congressman Delaney? archived recording (bernie sanders) Youre wrong. [LAUGHTER] [APPLAUSE] Right now, we have a dysfunctional health care system.\n\nmichael barbaro\n\nDuring the debate, former Colorado governor John Hickenlooper, Montana governor Steve Bullock, and former Maryland congressman John Delaney warned of, quote, wish-list economics, massive government expansions and radical plans from Warren and Sanders, which they said risked turning off mainstream voters.\n\narchived recording (elizabeth warren) You know, I dont understand why anybody goes to all the trouble of running for president of the United States just to talk about what we really cant do and shouldnt fight for. [APPLAUSE] Well, Im ready to get in this fight. Im ready to win this fight.\n\nmichael barbaro\n\nBoth Warren and Sanders responded with defiance, rejecting the moderate candidates as offering policies that failed to meet the moment and drawing a measure of sympathy from Mayor Pete Buttigieg, who said that Republicans would label any Democratic nominee as radical.\n\narchived recording (pete buttigieg) If  its true that if we embrace a far-left agenda, theyre going to say were a bunch of crazy socialists. If we embrace a conservative agenda, you know what theyre going to do? Theyre going to say were a bunch of crazy socialists. So lets just stand up for the right policy, go out there \n\nmichael barbaro'	b'What Kamala Harris Believes'	2019-07-27	[b'Alexander Burns']	[b'dont', b'policy', b'lot', b'think', b'right', b'really', b'believes', b'harris', b'know', b'going', b'kamala']	b'michael barbaro\n\nFrom The New York Times, Im Michael Barbaro. This is The Daily. Today: Democratic voters have been drawn to Kamala Harris as a messenger, even though her message remains a work-in-progress. Ahead of her debate performance tonight, what Harris herself says she stands for. Plus, last nights debate. Its Wednesday, July 31.\n\n[phone ringing]\n\nspeaker\n\nGood afternoon, and thank you for calling Aloft Detroit. This is Ferris speaking. How may I assist?\n\nmichael barbaro\n\nHey, Im trying to reach room 825, Alex Burns.\n\nspeaker\n\nCan you hold one second for me?\n\nmichael barbaro\n\nYes.\n\narchived recording\n\nMix, meet and mingle over cocktails and music at our happening WXYZ Bar. Youll find everything from pints to pinot noirs to signature drinks. Plus, a snack attack menu and cant-miss Live at Aloft Hotels events.\n\nalexander burns\n\nHello?\n\nmichael barbaro\n\nHey, its Michael.\n\nalexander burns\n\nHey.\n\nmichael barbaro\n\nWe just were serenaded with descriptions of snack attacks, sound-centric scenes, and pinot noir. Weve reached Alex Burns in Detroit, where hes covering the Democratic debates. Alex, the last time we spoke, it was right after the first Democratic debate, and all the attention had been on this exchange between Kamala Harris and Joe Biden about busing. But then this other interesting thing happened.\n\narchived recording (kamala harris) No one should have to work more than one job to have a roof over their head and food on the table.\n\nalexander burns\n\nRight, there was this more muddled moment for Kamala Harris.\n\narchived recording (lester holt) Youve all expressed an interest in talking about health care  archived recording (marianne williamson) Id like to say something if I might. archived recording (lester holt)  so lets talk about health care. And this is going to be a show-of-hands question. Many people watching at home have health insurance at their employer. Who here would abolish their private health insurance in favor of a government-run plan?\n\nalexander burns\n\nShe raised her hand on the debate stage, and then after the debate, clarified that she thought the question was referring to whether she would give up her own personal private health insurance and enroll in a single-payer plan, and that in fact, she did not favor getting rid of private health insurance entirely.\n\narchived recording (kamala harris) So the question was, would you be willing to give up your private insurance  archived recording (tony dokoupil) Thats not how it was asked. archived recording (kamala harris)  for such a plan, and  archived recording (tony dokoupil) Thats what you heard, right? archived recording (kamala harris) O.K. Yeah, thats certainly what I heard. And in terms of  I am supportive of Medicare for all. And under a Medicare for all policy, private insurance would certainly exist and for supplemental coverage. But \n\nmichael barbaro\n\nAnd it feels like this is kind of emblematic of Kamala Harris and her entire candidacy.\n\nalexander burns\n\nThats right, that shes somebody who is deeply inspiring to liberals, a lot of people who are on the more progressive end of the Democratic Party. But she has consistently stopped short of fully embracing a lot of the big ideological litmus test issues that tend to define those candidates, that folks like Bernie Sanders and Elizabeth Warren have been much clearer about where they fall on the left-right spectrum. And on the other side of the spectrum, folks like Joe Biden have been just as clear. Kamala Harris, somewhere in between.\n\nmichael barbaro\n\nAnd Alex, why does that matter?\n\nalexander burns\n\nIn a presidential election, we tend to try to sort candidates both in terms of how liberal or conservative they are, but also just in terms of what their overarching vision for the country is. What would the country look like after four or eight years of this persons presidency if they could do anything they wanted or if they could do a lot of the things they wanted? Now, Kamala Harris has been taking her time to sort of lay out exactly what that would look like. And at this point in the campaign, where she has clearly caught on as a very serious contender for the nomination, a lot of Democratic voters I talked to still feel like they dont totally have their arms around what the vision is supposed to be.\n\nmichael barbaro\n\nSo what have you been doing in the time since the first debate on that front of trying to understand what she stands for?\n\nalexander burns\n\nWell, we really set out after that first debate to try to get a hold of what that vision was, to try to clarify. To that end, I spent a lot of time talking to people who have worked with her, reading her most recent book, reading columns she wrote over the years, both in San Francisco and nationally, looking at commencement speeches she gave to see sort of what she talks about when she talks about inspirational values. There were some consistent themes that came out of all of that. A number of people  five different people I spoke to about her who have worked quite closely with her said in different ways that she was just not an ideological person. In almost identical language, shes not ideological. Shes not an ideologue. One man who was one of her most senior advisers as attorney general of California said that he thinks ideology is just not relevant to the way she makes decisions. So all those conversations, all of that reporting was really helpful in getting a broad picture of how she approaches issues, some sense of what goes on in her head as she executes the powers of government. But of course, you cant really get inside someones head without talking to them. And even then, it can be kind of a stretch. So I went to L.A. to actually sit down with her about a week and a half ago. She was out there doing a whole bunch of fundraising, was doing some debate prep. And so on a Sunday afternoon, I trekked out to Century City, to a pretty desolate, corporate part of town where I think she had been doing debate prep. And we sat down at a very, very long conference table in a very, very nice office suite and sort of went right at it.\n\nalexander burns I spoke to a lot of people who youve worked with over the years, and there are some pretty consistent themes that come out of that. And one of them that  I dont know if it was surprising to me, but it was interesting to me. Four or five different people in almost exactly the same language just said, like, she is not ideological. Shes not an ideologue. And I was wondering, just to start, does that ring true to you? kamala harris Yeah. Yeah, it does. alexander burns And what does that mean?\n\nalexander burns\n\nSo right off the bat, she basically endorses that description of her and her approach to policy, that shes not ideological.\n\nkamala harris I mean, Im not really into labels. For me, I come at issues through the lens of how it actually impacts people, as opposed to, does this issue fit in a certain category of perspective, right?\n\nalexander burns\n\nThat she thinks about policy in terms of a series of practical tests, but not necessarily trying to fit it into a particular ideological umbrella or even necessarily some big sweeping integrated vision.\n\nkamala harris You know, if anything, what they would have told you probably is that I have often asked  I always ask questions about policy there based on how will this actually impact a person, to the point that sometimes it just drives them bananas, because I literally get into that level of detail.\n\nalexander burns\n\nYou know, for me, that was sort of an interesting statement that she just rejected the basic terms of a debate that a lot of the other candidates and certainly a lot of political analysts want to use to understand campaigns. What it didnt say to me was if somebody is just a pragmatist, if somebody is just interested in making concrete policy change, well, how do they choose what kinds of policies to pursue and what counts to them as important change? And she talked a lot about less an ideology and more an orientation, that her grounding in thinking about government and in thinking about the role of policy comes from her background as a lawyer, as a prosecutor, as an executive. And when she thinks about policy, asking a series of pretty concrete, ground-level questions to assess whether something is worth doing, not trying to slot it into a bigger picture.\n\nkamala harris Because it really, for me, policy has to be relevant. Thats my guiding principle. Is it relevant? Not does it  is it a beautiful sonnet, right? Is it actually relevant? Because if its not, it does not matter. If not, then its just, its an idea, right? As opposed to what its  maybe because my orientation is also as an executive, which is I believe that the things that I say are going to happen will actually happen. Not just supposed to happen, I believe they will actually happen. So for me, knowing that they will actually happen, how will they impact real people? So if anything, there are tests that I have for the relevancy or the significance of policy, but its not an ideological test. alexander burns What else is in that list of tests besides just, will it help actual people?\n\nalexander burns\n\nShe listed three questions. The first is does it help a substantial number of people?\n\nkamala harris Because policy, if it only impacts just a few, I dont know that its really as relevant, right? To the greater number.\n\nalexander burns\n\nThe second question was whether it affects children, how it affects children. And the third question is how long will it take?\n\nkamala harris The significance of the passage of time. So using Brown v. Board of Education as an example of this, the significance of the passage of time is that all those who knew the importance of getting that case there had to be patient to some extent, knowing that they had to build a precedent. So then Brown v. Board of Education was decided in 1954, I believe, May of 1954. And everyone is sitting around. This is my interpretation of what happened. Cha-ching, cha-ching. There are glasses of chardonnay and champagne. Oh, this is lovely and wonderful. We won, right? But not until almost 20 years later did it hit the streets of Berkeley, California. alexander burns Mm-hmm.\n\nalexander burns\n\nAnd that one to me was sort of the most revealing, that there are a lot of candidates in this race who are promising really, really big changes because they feel they would have profound consequences on everyday peoples lives. The notion that a fundamental test for Kamala Harris is can this be done quickly, to me, was sort of eye opening.\n\nkamala harris Every day in the life of someone who is being denied justice is a very long time. So part of how I think about policy is also through that lens. How long will it take us to get where we need to go? And what will be the cost-benefit of the significance of the passage of time?

But the notion that the pressure to do something quickly was weighing on her, to me, was a pretty vivid description of how she thinks about making big decisions.\n\nkamala harris The way I used to talk about it is that there are people barely holding on with their fingernails in their homes.

Like, how are we going to actually get there? This thing sounds great, but how are we going to actually get there?\n\n[music]\n\nmichael barbaro\n\nWell be right back. Harris seems to be describing a vision of governing within a system that has real limitations and constraints. But a lot of her rivals in this race and the people that shes going to be standing next to on stage Wednesday night stand for sweeping change that would kind of swap out a burdened system and replace it with something where they can do more.\n\nalexander burns\n\nYeah, I asked her about exactly that.\n\nalexander burns Tell me if you totally disagree with this, obviously, right?

But is there anything I should \n\nmichael barbaro\n\nAlex, at the end of this conversation, did you feel satisfied? Did you feel like you had a deeper understanding of this question that you went into the room with about Kamala Harris?\n\nalexander burns\n\nI do feel like after having that conversation, its clear to me that her longtime colleagues, her friends, her associates and supporters really had it right, that shes not an ideological candidate, that theres not a hidden ideology that shes declining to articulate or struggling to articulate, that she truly is just not somebody who approaches policy and politics that way. What she did do is explain in, I think, illuminating detail why she makes the decisions she does.\n\nmichael barbaro\n\nAlex, lets talk about whether this approach from Kamala Harris can satisfy voters. Does it really matter that Kamala Harris does not want to be defined by ideology? Im asking that broadly, in terms of what we know about politics in general and in the context of this particular primary and the calculations that the whole party is making this year.\n\nalexander burns\n\nI dont think it matters that she wont put an exact ideological label on herself. When I go to campaign events, I dont hear a lot of voters who say, you know, I consider myself an economic populist, and therefore Im voting for Elizabeth Warren. I do think it matters that she has resisted this idea of putting her policy under a comprehensive vision, right? An umbrella that people can use to gauge her instincts, even on issues that shes not speaking to directly. I think there are a lot of people who, if you were to take an Elizabeth Warren voter or a Joe Biden voter, and ask them, what position do you think they would take on issue X? They have a framework for understanding how those candidates approach issues generally and what matters to them and might have at least some gut sense of how Elizabeth Warren would address an issue that shes never been directly asked about before. I do think it matters that people may not have that same sense for Kamala Harris.\n\nmichael barbaro\n\nMm-hmm. Right. I mean, the value of an ideology that people can easily grasp is that its a road map. It helps you understand how someones likely to respond to a particular set of circumstances, a crisis, any kind of situation. Its very clarifying. And without it, things feel a little more rudderless.\n\nalexander burns\n\nRight, and youre asking people to put a lot of trust in your judgment to deal with things on a case by case basis. And if you can win their trust, then that gives you a lot of flexibility to choose your fights and how youre going approach policy and sort of what methods youre going to use. If you dont win their trust, then people can end up feeling like they dont quite know what your core is. And I think thats the big challenge for her right now in this race. So the best-case scenario for Kamala Harris is that she gets through this primary by really firing up a critical mass of the Democratic coalition with the kinds of targeted policies that weve been talking about and with her identity and political narrative. I think the evidence so far is that Democrats are willing to give Kamala Harris somewhat more room to figure out what she wants her vision to be than some of the other candidates in this race. And then in the general election, shes not necessarily tied to all of the same economic populist, liberal ideas that some of the other candidates in this race would be.\n\nmichael barbaro\n\nAlex, thank you very much. Appreciate it.\n\nalexander burns\n\nThank you.\n\nmichael barbaro\n\nWell be right back. Heres what else you need to know today.\n\narchived recording (john delaney) Folks, we have a choice. We can go down the road that Senator Sanders and Senator Warren want to take us, which is with bad policies like Medicare for all, free everything, and impossible promises thatll turn off independent voters and get Trump re-elected. Thats what happened with \n\nmichael barbaro\n\nIn Tuesday nights Democratic debate, the leading liberal candidates, Senators Bernie Sanders and Elizabeth Warren, fought back against claims by more moderate opponents that their plans are impractical and that their chances of beating President Trump are slim.\n\narchived recording (jake tapper) You support Medicare for all, which would eventually take private health insurance away from more than 150 million Americans in exchange for government-sponsored health care for everyone. Congressman Delaney just referred to it as bad policy. And previously, he has called the idea political suicide that will just get President Trump re-elected. What do you say to Congressman Delaney? archived recording (bernie sanders) Youre wrong. [LAUGHTER] [APPLAUSE] Right now, we have a dysfunctional health care system.\n\nmichael barbaro\n\nDuring the debate, former Colorado governor John Hickenlooper, Montana governor Steve Bullock, and former Maryland congressman John Delaney warned of, quote, wish-list economics, massive government expansions and radical plans from Warren and Sanders, which they said risked turning off mainstream voters.\n\narchived recording (elizabeth warren) You know, I dont understand why anybody goes to all the trouble of running for president of the United States just to talk about what we really cant do and shouldnt fight for. [APPLAUSE] Well, Im ready to get in this fight. Im ready to win this fight.\n\nmichael barbaro\n\nBoth Warren and Sanders responded with defiance, rejecting the moderate candidates as offering policies that failed to meet the moment and drawing a measure of sympathy from Mayor Pete Buttigieg, who said that Republicans would label any Democratic nominee as radical.\n\narchived recording (pete buttigieg) If  its true that if we embrace a far-left agenda, theyre going to say were a bunch of crazy socialists. If we embrace a conservative agenda, you know what theyre going to do? Theyre going to say were a bunch of crazy socialists. So lets just stand up for the right policy, go out there \n\nmichael barbaro'

My name is Monika Evstatieva, and Im a producer for The Daily. And I am here with Astead. Astead, introduce yourself. astead herndon Hi. Im Astead Herndon. Im a politics reporter covering the election. And Im driving on a very long highway. monika evstatieva Were driving on a very long highway in South Carolina because we came here to try to answer an interesting question. What is that question? astead herndon What happened to Kamala Harriss presidential campaign that took her from top-tier, front-runner status to the middle of the pack? monika evstatieva O.K. Lets try to figure this out.\n\n[music]\n\nmichael barbaro\n\nFrom The New York Times, Im Michael Barbaro. This is The Daily. When Senator Kamala Harris launched her presidential campaign 10 months ago, she drew a crowd of 20,000 to her kickoff rally, the biggest of any candidate, and was talked about as a potential heir to the political coalition that carried Barack Obama to the White House  twice. Today, shes polling in the single digits. My colleagues Astead Herndon and Monika Evstatieva went to South Carolina with the Harris campaign. Its Wednesday, November 20.\n\nmonika evstatieva\n\nAstead and I are in the car. We are driving from the capital, Columbia, to Greenwood, and Greenwood is a small town.\n\nastead herndon Folks are in suits? You know this is South Carolina.\n\nmonika evstatieva\n\nAnd why is South Carolina essential to her campaign?\n\nastead herndon\n\nSo shes in South Carolina because, frankly, thats where their campaign is putting their chips. Theyve had to, after falling on hard times, fire most of their New Hampshire team and really focus their resources on the first state, Iowa, and then South Carolina, where they think they can unlock black support. The thought process here is based somewhat on what Barack Obama did in 2008  that if you win white support in Iowa, it proves viability, it proves electability, and that the black voters who like you but are scared you cant win will eventually come around if you prove yourself in the early states. And South Carolina, the electorates more than 65 percent black. And she thinks that she shares a real kinship there. And while shes been in South Carolina many times before, this is her first time in this community. Her campaign understands these things arent going well and needs to reach out to people they havent talked to before.\n\nmonika evstatieva O.K. Were actually walking now. Lets see whats happening.\n\nmonika evstatieva\n\nWe get to the building. Its a very small building.\n\nastead herndon Hi. My name is Astead \n\nmonika evstatieva\n\nAnd its Veterans Day.\n\n[chatter] monika evstatieva So describe this room now. astead herndon Its like a veterans hall. There are rows of people kind of set up in a half circle around what will be a panel. Some people have on their veterans regalia. Weve got flags behind them. Pretty much a standard, intimate political event. monika evstatieva O.K. Lets go talk to some people. Sir, do you have a minute to just talk with us? speaker I dont do interviews. [LAUGHTER]\n\nastead herndon\n\nWe talk to voters to try to get a sense of why they decided to come.\n\nmonika evstatieva Why are you here today? speaker 1 Well, Im here to support Kamala Harris. speaker 2 Im here to be enlightened about her policies.\n\nastead herndon\n\nHave they decided on a particular candidate?\n\nspeaker 1 I really havent picked no candidate yet, you know. speaker 2 I havent made up my mind. speaker 3 Im still shopping, looking at all the options. monika evstatieva Today, youll be listening to what she has to say and if she can basically win you over? speaker Possible. Its possible, yes.\n\nmonika evstatieva\n\nA lot of people actually dont know a lot about her. Some people dont know anything about her.\n\nspeaker Well, I really hadnt ever heard of Senator Harris before, until Wednesday.\n\nastead herndon\n\nI think thats something people forget about voters. Not everyone is tuned in all the time.\n\nspeaker 1 I really hadnt been watching the news. speaker 2 I dont even think I watched the debate. As a matter of fact, I know I didnt. I didnt watch the debate.\n\nastead herndon\n\nThey know the field is large. And they know, kind of generally, whos up and whos down.\n\nmonika evstatieva\n\nAnd in every conversation we have with these voters \n\nspeaker This is still the South.\n\nmonika evstatieva\n\n race keeps coming up.\n\nastead herndon\n\nYou have to remember the context for these largely older African-American voters.\n\nspeaker And, good Lord willing and the creek dont rise, come March of next year, Ill be 70 years old. So Ive seen a lot. And basically, I still see the world as being one great big plantation.\n\nastead herndon\n\nThese are folks who have grown up in the shadow of the Confederacy their whole lives. They have lived under the brunt of Jim Crow, some of them. And that informs how they are making pragmatic political decisions moving forward.\n\nspeaker Within South Carolina, within the African-American community, we dont want to take a chance on someone that doesnt have a chance of beating Trump.\n\nastead herndon\n\nSo things like 2008 and Barack Obama defied their wildest dreams. It was an anomaly to them, and so theres still a fear, a risk that a lot of them associate with a person of color leading the ticket.\n\nspeaker I hope shes electable, but we have to change the minds of the people.\n\nastead herndon\n\nFear that maybe in this time, where black voters are very worried about the Trump presidency, that a black candidate or a woman of color was too risky.\n\nastead herndon Do you think that black men will have problems supporting a black woman candidate? speaker Yes. astead herndon Why do you think so? speaker The men have been the head.\n\nmonika evstatieva\n\nMany people we speak to mention as an alternative \n\nspeaker Joe Biden. I think that hes a good candidate.\n\nmonika evstatieva\n\n Joe Biden.\n\nspeaker 1 I like Joe. speaker 2 I would say Biden. speaker 3 Ive looked at Joe Biden.\n\nmonika evstatieva\n\nWhy?\n\nastead herndon\n\nTheres a lot of reasons why Joe Biden looms over South Carolina. One is name recognition.\n\nspeaker 1 Because he has been vice president, and I dont think we need someone now thats on-the-job training. speaker 2 He has a track record because he was there in an administration before.\n\nastead herndon\n\nThey know who he is. Hes a known quantity, and he is someone who has longstanding relationships in those communities.\n\nspeaker He has the debate experience. And I feel like he can go after him, also.\n\nastead herndon\n\nAnother reason is he has pitched himself as the candidate who is most likely to beat Trump.\n\nastead herndon Something kind of explicit. Like, when you say that he can beat Trump, do you think thats because white people are more likely to vote for Joe Biden than they are to vote for Kamala Harris? speaker Yes. Yes.\n\nastead herndon\n\nAnd so this is one of the big challenges Harris has to overcome. Even black voters, who sometimes like her instinctively, think that her identity as a black woman might be a liability for the election. And so they see Joe Biden, a white man with experience in the White House, and even this community thinks that maybe he is better suited to beat Trump. And ultimately, thats what they care about the most.\n\n[applause] floyd nicholson So again, we thank each one of you for taking time out of your busy schedule coming out today. And without further ado, it gives me great pleasure \n\nmonika evstatieva\n\nThen the event actually kicks off. There are several introductions.\n\nfloyd nicholson  the U.S. senator from that great state of California, the honorable Kamala Harris. [applause]\n\nmonika evstatieva\n\nAnd after some time, its her time to speak. And she needs to convince the people in this room that shes uniquely positioned to represent them best.\n\nkamala harris Thank you, Senator Nicholson! Hi, mama.\n\nmonika evstatieva\n\nWhat are some of the key points she makes in this speech?\n\nkamala harris Please have a seat. So I will tell you, my background is I am a daughter of parents who met when they were active in the civil rights movement in the 1960s in Berkeley and Oakland, California.\n\nastead herndon\n\nShe introduces herself to the audience, her personal narrative.\n\nkamala harris I grew up surrounded by a bunch of adults who spent full time marching and shouting for justice.\n\nastead herndon\n\nAnd then she turns very quickly to an issue she has gotten a lot of criticism for, her position on health care.\n\nkamala harris So Im running for president to put in place a Medicare for all plan, which means everyone will be covered, including people with pre-existing conditions.\n\nastead herndon\n\nAnd for her, health care looks like what she calls a Medicare for all plan that still preserves a role for the private insurance industry.\n\nmonika evstatieva\n\nAnd this is confusing, right?\n\nastead herndon\n\nIt can be. Shes had different positions on health care. She started the race as a co-sponsor on Bernie Sanderss Medicare for all bill, which is a single-payer system that eliminates private insurance. But she kind of hemmed and hawed about the specifics of that bill and then eventually offers her own plan \n\nkamala harris Im not trying to get rid of private insurance. So I heard from too many folks who said, Kamala, dont take away our choice.\n\nastead herndon\n\n which preserves a role for private insurance. And so, this is another one of the issues people cite around Kamala Harriss campaign, is that when you look at key policies, if you look at health care, the number one issue for Democrats in this race, she has not always stood for a singular position. Shes tried to have her cake and eat it, too, some voters say. Even now, as shes in between the progressive and moderate approaches, shes still borrowing language from that progressive lane.\n\nkamala harris We want the choice between a private plan or a public plan. Well, my plan will give you the choice that you deserve.\n\nmonika evstatieva\n\nAnd this is why I was a little bit confused when I hear her say that.\n\nastead herndon\n\n[LAUGHS] Youre not the only one.\n\nkamala harris But we need reasonable gun safety laws, including universal background checks.\n\nmonika evstatieva\n\nSo she goes through some other issues that are important to the Democratic voters, like gun safety, the challenges facing veterans.\n\nkamala harris  and putting them out of business when they were targeting our veterans.\n\nmonika evstatieva\n\nBut then \n\nkamala harris And Im just going to share with you one last thing, and then I would love to start our conversation.\n\nmonika evstatieva\n\n she turns to the issue of her electability. What does she say?\n\nastead herndon\n\nSenator Harris has added this in in the last couple months. As electability has become an increasing point of conversation in this race, shes decided to address it directly.\n\nkamala harris So I just want to have a brief conversation about something thats been coming up in connection with the campaign that I call the elephant in the room. But really its the donkey in the room. And its this conversation about electability. And the conversation goes something like this. Well, I dont know if America is ready for a woman of color to be president of the United States.\n\nastead herndon\n\nShes addressing the identity question head-on. Are Democrats too scared, or is it too much of a risk to put a black woman up against Donald Trump in this critical election?\n\nkamala harris I know Im ready, but I dont know if my neighbors are ready. Theyll say, well, maybe its not your turn.\n\nastead herndon\n\nAnd she says, this is not a new conversation for me.\n\nkamala harris In fact, this is a conversation I have heard in every campaign I have  and, now, here is the operative word  won. [applause]\n\nastead herndon\n\nAnd what shes trying to evoke there is that she has broken barriers before, and that if voters put their trust in her, she will do it again. And so, in this short time, shes addressing the two big challenges of her campaign, and shes trying to solve both. Shes trying to put forth a clear position on health care and sort of suggest that there was never any lack of clarity to begin with. And then she also tries to present her identity not as a hurdle to her success, but as a rallying point. That people can come together, and again, just like in the past, theyll overcome it.\n\nkamala harris Thank you all very much. Thank you. Thank you. Thank you.\n\n[music]\n\nmichael barbaro\n\nWell be right back.\n\nmonika evstatieva O.K. So were now headed to the town hall.\n\nmonika evstatieva\n\nThen were back on the road, and we keep following Senator Harris. And the next stop is Greenville.\n\nmonika evstatieva This is a bigger city, over 62,000 people.\n\nastead herndon\n\nYeah. Were headed from Greenwood to Greenville, a more urban community.\n\nmonika evstatieva Astead cannot be bothered with nothing but Beyonc right now. astead herndon (SINGING) To the left, to the left.\n\nmonika evstatieva\n\nAnd I actually find out you can sing.\n\nastead herndon\n\n[LAUGHS]\n\nmonika evstatieva\n\nSo we get to Greenville.\n\nspeaker Hi, welcome. Thank you very much for coming. Just through the glass doors on your right. I got to tell yall that.\n\nastead herndon\n\nWhen we come in, its a larger gymnasium. Its probably double or triple the amount of people in terms of crowd size, even though theres some empty seats. And theres also just a more elaborate setup. Thats all kind of just the campaign doing the more operational flexing of muscle for the bigger city.\n\nmonika evstatieva\n\nRight. So this is a more diverse place. Its more highly educated. Its younger. And people are following the election more closely, and so here, many people already know her.\n\nastead herndon Im sorry. You all are people who have picked a candidate? I know I see the shirts. speaker Yes. astead herndon But youre all in. speaker 1 Yes. Yes, all in. speaker 2 All in for Kamala.\n\nmonika evstatieva\n\nWhat are some of the things they tell us?\n\nastead herndon\n\nThey say what you hear from the Kamala Harris diehards, that she first came on their radar during the Senate committee hearings, where she was praised for her aggressive questioning of Bill Barr and Jeff Sessions.\n\nspeaker So I think it was during Sessionss confirmation hearings that I thought, shes going to run for president, and if she is, shes got my vote.\n\nastead herndon\n\nEventually, Brett Kavanaugh.\n\nspeaker Especially during the Kavanaugh hearings, when she talked to Dr. Ford and just looked at her in the eyes and said, I believe you, I believe you.\n\nastead herndon\n\nThey tell you that they like her debate interaction with Joe Biden in the first debate. She looked tough on the debate stage. And shes the one that they want to see go up against Donald Trump.\n\nmonika evstatieva\n\nAnd you asked them, but why is she not polling better?\n\nastead herndon What have you thought about the trajectory of her campaign? I mean, she started up there, but shes since kind of fallen. Why do you think that is?\n\nmonika evstatieva\n\nWhat are some of the things they cite as examples?\n\nastead herndon\n\nThese folks are following the race closely, and so they know that theres been a change in political standing from where Senator Harris started the race to where she arrived now. And when you ask her supporters that  why did that happen?  they again point to her identity.\n\nspeaker Shes been erased by the media. Shes been misrepresented by the media.\n\nastead herndon\n\nThey blame media for preferring, often, white candidates over people of color. And they point to a top tier, where the four candidates at the top are all white now in the Democratic Party.\n\nspeaker I mean, shes a black woman in a race that everyones looking for a white savior candidate. And so  but I think dont count her out. Shes got a strong ground game.\n\nmonika evstatieva\n\nThe event kicks off with a couple of introductions, including from a high school student.\n\nspeaker Ladies and gentlemen, I am proud to present to you someone who looks just like me.\n\nastead herndon\n\nYeah, theyve started having organizers introduce her, particularly women of color, to lean into that representation aspect.\n\nkamala harris Well, good afternoon, Greenville. It is wonderful to be back.\n\nmonika evstatieva\n\nAnd throughout the speech, the thing that gets the most ovation is when she goes after Trump.\n\nkamala harris We will need, as our nominee, someone who can stand on that debate stage and go toe-to-toe with Donald Trump. And Greenville, youre looking at her. Youre looking at her! ^[APPLAUSE]^\n\nastead herndon\n\nTheres a couple lines that any Democrat can say, and theyll get the audience on their feet. A surefire crowd-pleaser is to attack the president.\n\nkamala harris And somebody needs to remind Donald Trump that some of his closest relatives are immigrants, too. ^[APPLAUSE]^\n\nastead herndon\n\nAnd especially with the impeachment proceedings going on, Senator Harriss lines of justice being on the ballot or prosecuting the case against Donald Trump are always going to get the crowd on their feet. The question is if its just about Trump, why is that a reason to prefer Kamala Harris over the rest of the Democratic field, who are also making those same arguments?\n\nkamala harris And thats why Im running. I thank you all so very much. Thank you. Thank you. [applause] monika evstatieva O.K. Where are we going?\n\nastead herndon\n\nWe are in Greer, South Carolina \n\nmonika evstatieva\n\nThe following day, bright and early, we join her again.\n\nmonika evstatieva Its next to Greenville. And this time its raining.\n\nastead herndon\n\n at a community center \n\nmonika evstatieva O.K. Needmore Recreation Community Center. We are here.\n\nastead herndon\n\n where she is speaking to maybe 20, 25 people, all African-American, older residents.\n\nkamala harris So you all know, and have lived long, wonderful lives. And youll remember that for a large part of your life \n\nastead herndon\n\nShe spent a lot of her speech on lowering prescription drug costs and her health care plan, but she also mentions more systemic problems.\n\nkamala harris And remember those zero percent loans, nothing down? Predatory practices. The brokers made all kinds of money.\n\nastead herndon\n\nLike housing inequality and equitable education, issues that matter to older black voters.\n\nkamala harris And the father can look at his son and say, son, you dont have to go and get a loan from one of those private companies that are going to charge you these outrageous interest rates. Ill take some of the equity out of my home to help you pay for tuition. So thank you very much. Thank you, thank you. [applause]\n\nmonika evstatieva\n\nAfter the speech, we see something that I havent experienced so far.\n\nspeaker Pastor T., if you wanted to come up and say a couple words, or maybe pray over the senator. kamala harris Oh, yeah, I would love that.\n\nmonika evstatieva\n\nA pastor starts a prayer for her.\n\ntelley lynnette gadson So, were going to pray. kamala harris Yes. Yes. telley lynnette gadson Were going to pray. Were going to pray for protection.\n\nmonika evstatieva\n\nShe is literally holding her hands, and the whole room, everyone is standing up.\n\ntelley lynnette gadson Kamala Devi Harris, when you were in your mothers womb, God already knew about this stage of your life, and already knew that you would be in Greer, South Carolina, at the Needmore Community Center. It wasnt an accident.\n\nastead herndon\n\nThis is one of the cool things you can see while campaigning, specifically in South Carolina. Because the Democratic electorate is so black, and because the black electorate, particularly in these Southern states, is so religious, a lot of the campaigning happens through these religious communities. Pastors in black communities are not just religious leaders. They are community leaders. Theyre political leaders. Theyre cultural hubs. And particularly with black candidates, theres a sense of kinship there.\n\ntelley lynnette gadson God, for every flight that she will take, I pray that you are the pilot. God, for every car that she journeys in, I ask you to be the driver. And for every thought that she would think, I ask you to be the orchestrator.\n\nastead herndon\n\nKamala Harris is a religious woman. And there is a shared language of faith that happens at these events that you see with other candidates  its not like they wouldnt pray for a white candidate  but theres something different when its someone who they know has worshipped in their churches for their whole lives. And so she prays for her, and she mentions that the last presidential candidate she prayed for \n\ntelley lynnette gadson Now, the last person that I made my hands on and prayed for in the presidential election \n\nastead herndon\n\n was Barack Obama.\n\ntelley lynnette gadson  was Barack Hussein Obama. [applause]\n\nmonika evstatieva\n\nThe reverend is Reverend Gadson, but she goes by Pastor T.\n\ntelley lynnette gadson So we can be clear, they call me Pastor T., but Reverend Telley Lynnette Gadson. Thats who I am.\n\nmonika evstatieva\n\nAnd we actually catch up with her after the prayer.\n\nastead herndon That was your first time seeing the senator, I imagine, right? telley lynnette gadson First time seeing, but not first time hearing about.\n\nastead herndon\n\nAnd then we ask her about the race.\n\nastead herndon Are you someone who personally has made a decision about who you want to vote for? telley lynnette gadson I have not. I have not. And thats been because the field is so wide. But where I am, as Ive shared, is just a posture of, first of all, praying for our country. What is it that we \n\nastead herndon\n\nYou can see how that represents a problem for Kamala Harris.\n\n[music]\n\nmonika evstatieva\n\nSo we have this pastor who says she last laid hands on Barack Obama, but isnt ready to give her support to Kamala Harris, someone who started this race so strongly by trying to capture the same kind of coalition that Obama did. Weve heard that the challenges to her campaign are her identity and the lack of clarity on policy, but those same things could have been said for Obama. So whats different in 2019?\n\nastead herndon\n\nThe Barack Obama coalition that he rose to power with combined young people, liberals and historic turnout from black people. And theres not one candidate in this race that has yet been able to win those different demographic groups. And that was supposed to be Kamala Harris. I mean, it was supposed to be a number of people. It could have been Beto ORourke. It could have been Cory Booker. It could have been Kirsten Gillibrand. But when we entered this race, the thought, the reason why her candidacy was so feared, was because she was thought to be the one who could most quickly tap in to that coalition. Well, there are differences that we knew would be true from the start, and theres things that weve learned over the last six to eight months. From the start, we knew that, as a black woman running, she would have no historical touchstone and she would face unique barriers. And I think if you ask the campaign, they would say thats true. But its really about messaging. We knew that this race would be defined by a progressive wing, led by figures like Elizabeth Warren and Bernie Sanders, and a moderate wing, led by Joe Biden, and that people like Kamala Harris would have to exist threading both worlds. And thats been difficult. When you talk to voters, the most consistently repeated thing is, well, I dont necessarily know what she stands for. And I think that is borne out of those two wings, the progressive and moderate wings, defining this primary through their fight. And so Bernie Sanders and Elizabeth Warren can say, if you arent with single-payer health care, youre not a progressive. If youre not willing to raise taxes on corporations and wealthy individuals, then you dont have big ideas. And the moderate wing has defined themselves by rejecting that, by defining themselves by saying, well, we cant do that or we wont beat Trump. But if youre trying to do both of those things, if youre trying to thread in between those worlds, we have seen electorates that arent really willing to give people that benefit of the doubt. And thats driving a lot of the anxiety right now, particularly among the partys moderates.\n\nmonika evstatieva\n\nAnd thats why we see all these new candidates jump in the race.\n\nastead herndon\n\nThe anxiety breeds restlessness, right? And Deval Patrick, who just announced, Mike Bloomberg, whos expected to, are trying to capitalize on that anxiety. Because in the circles that like them, in the circles of elite, Democratic moderates, they are a group that expected to have more options. Theyre not that surprised at the way Joe Bidens candidacy has turned out. Where the biggest surprise is is they thought they would have an alternative figure to Joe Biden who could replicate that Obama lane. Now remember, these are a group of people who think that Warren and Sanderss progressive policies will lose them the general election. They think that Warren and Sanders, if they are the nominee, will struggle to bring out the type of people that put Democrats over the top. And without that, without someone in the top tier who is winning black voters and exciting young voters at the same time, there is fear that you cannot replicate what Obama did. Now, their argument is that thats because of the campaigns, that the individual candidates and individual campaigns havent done the things necessary to produce that support. But it could be because of a changing electorate and two wings of the party that just arent looking for a merging savior anymore.\n\n[music]\n\nmichael barbaro\n\nWell be right back. Heres what else you need to know today.\n\narchived recording (adam schiff) Colonel Vindman, what was your real-time reaction to hearing that call? archived recording (alexander vindman) Chairman, without hesitation, I knew that I had to report this to the White House counsel. I had concerns. And it was my duty to report my concerns to the proper people in the chain of command.\n\nmichael barbaro\n\nIn dramatic testimony on Tuesday, two White House officials who listened in on President Trumps phone call with the president of Ukraine described their alarm over his request for investigations into his political rivals.\n\narchived recording (adam schiff) And what was your concern? archived recording (alexander vindman) It was inappropriate. It was improper for the president to request an  to demand an investigation into a political opponent, especially a foreign power where there is, at best, dubious belief that this would be a completely impartial investigation.\n\nmichael barbaro'	b'Progressive Prosecutor: Can Kamala Harris Square the Circle?'	2019-02-11	[b'Kate Zernike']	[b'evstatieva', b'speaker', b'circle', b'thats', b'black', b'progressive', b'square', b'think', b'harris', b'know', b'herndon', b'shes', b'kamala', b'prosecutor']	b'monika evstatieva Hi. My name is Monika Evstatieva, and Im a producer for The Daily. And I am here with Astead. Astead, introduce yourself. astead herndon Hi. Im Astead Herndon. Im a politics reporter covering the election. And Im driving on a very long highway. monika evstatieva Were driving on a very long highway in South Carolina because we came here to try to answer an interesting question. What is that question? astead herndon What happened to Kamala Harriss presidential campaign that took her from top-tier, front-runner status to the middle of the pack? monika evstatieva O.K. Lets try to figure this out.\n\n[music]\n\nmichael barbaro\n\nFrom The New York Times, Im Michael Barbaro. This is The Daily. When Senator Kamala Harris launched her presidential campaign 10 months ago, she drew a crowd of 20,000 to her kickoff rally, the biggest of any candidate, and was talked about as a potential heir to the political coalition that carried Barack Obama to the White House  twice. Today, shes polling in the single digits. My colleagues Astead Herndon and Monika Evstatieva went to South Carolina with the Harris campaign. Its Wednesday, November 20.\n\nmonika evstatieva\n\nAstead and I are in the car. We are driving from the capital, Columbia, to Greenwood, and Greenwood is a small town.\n\nastead herndon Folks are in suits? You know this is South Carolina.\n\nmonika evstatieva\n\nAnd why is South Carolina essential to her campaign?\n\nastead herndon\n\nSo shes in South Carolina because, frankly, thats where their campaign is putting their chips. Theyve had to, after falling on hard times, fire most of their New Hampshire team and really focus their resources on the first state, Iowa, and then South Carolina, where they think they can unlock black support. The thought process here is based somewhat on what Barack Obama did in 2008  that if you win white support in Iowa, it proves viability, it proves electability, and that the black voters who like you but are scared you cant win will eventually come around if you prove yourself in the early states. And South Carolina, the electorates more than 65 percent black. And she thinks that she shares a real kinship there. And while shes been in South Carolina many times before, this is her first time in this community. Her campaign understands these things arent going well and needs to reach out to people they havent talked to before.\n\nmonika evstatieva O.K. Were actually walking now. Lets see whats happening.\n\nmonika evstatieva\n\nWe get to the building. Its a very small building.\n\nastead herndon Hi. My name is Astead \n\nmonika evstatieva\n\nAnd its Veterans Day.\n\n[chatter] monika evstatieva So describe this room now. astead herndon Its like a veterans hall. There are rows of people kind of set up in a half circle around what will be a panel. Some people have on their veterans regalia. Weve got flags behind them. Pretty much a standard, intimate political event. monika evstatieva O.K. Lets go talk to some people. Sir, do you have a minute to just talk with us? speaker I dont do interviews. [LAUGHTER]\n\nastead herndon\n\nWe talk to voters to try to get a sense of why they decided to come.\n\nmonika evstatieva Why are you here today? speaker 1 Well, Im here to support Kamala Harris. speaker 2 Im here to be enlightened about her policies.\n\nastead herndon\n\nHave they decided on a particular candidate?\n\nspeaker 1 I really havent picked no candidate yet, you know. speaker 2 I havent made up my mind. speaker 3 Im still shopping, looking at all the options. monika evstatieva Today, youll be listening to what she has to say and if she can basically win you over? speaker Possible. Its possible, yes.\n\nmonika evstatieva\n\nA lot of people actually dont know a lot about her. Some people dont know anything about her.\n\nspeaker Well, I really hadnt ever heard of Senator Harris before, until Wednesday.\n\nastead herndon\n\nI think thats something people forget about voters. Not everyone is tuned in all the time.\n\nspeaker 1 I really hadnt been watching the news. speaker 2 I dont even think I watched the debate. As a matter of fact, I know I didnt. I didnt watch the debate.\n\nastead herndon\n\nThey know the field is large. And they know, kind of generally, whos up and whos down.\n\nmonika evstatieva\n\nAnd in every conversation we have with these voters \n\nspeaker This is still the South.\n\nmonika evstatieva\n\n race keeps coming up.\n\nastead herndon\n\nYou have to remember the context for these largely older African-American voters.\n\nspeaker And, good Lord willing and the creek dont rise, come March of next year, Ill be 70 years old. So Ive seen a lot. And basically, I still see the world as being one great big plantation.\n\nastead herndon\n\nThese are folks who have grown up in the shadow of the Confederacy their whole lives. They have lived under the brunt of Jim Crow, some of them. And that informs how they are making pragmatic political decisions moving forward.\n\nspeaker Within South Carolina, within the African-American community, we dont want to take a chance on someone that doesnt have a chance of beating Trump.\n\nastead herndon\n\nSo things like 2008 and Barack Obama defied their wildest dreams. It was an anomaly to them, and so theres still a fear, a risk that a lot of them associate with a person of color leading the ticket.\n\nspeaker I hope shes electable, but we have to change the minds of the people.\n\nastead herndon\n\nFear that maybe in this time, where black voters are very worried about the Trump presidency, that a black candidate or a woman of color was too risky.\n\nastead herndon Do you think that black men will have problems supporting a black woman candidate? speaker Yes. astead herndon Why do you think so? speaker The men have been the head.\n\nmonika evstatieva\n\nMany people we speak to mention as an alternative \n\nspeaker Joe Biden. I think that hes a good candidate.\n\nmonika evstatieva\n\n Joe Biden.\n\nspeaker 1 I like Joe. speaker 2 I would say Biden. speaker 3 Ive looked at Joe Biden.\n\nmonika evstatieva\n\nWhy?\n\nastead herndon\n\nTheres a lot of reasons why Joe Biden looms over South Carolina. One is name recognition.\n\nspeaker 1 Because he has been vice president, and I dont think we need someone now thats on-the-job training. speaker 2 He has a track record because he was there in an administration before.\n\nastead herndon\n\nThey know who he is. Hes a known quantity, and he is someone who has longstanding relationships in those communities.\n\nspeaker He has the debate experience. And I feel like he can go after him, also.\n\nastead herndon\n\nAnother reason is he has pitched himself as the candidate who is most likely to beat Trump.\n\nastead herndon Something kind of explicit. Like, when you say that he can beat Trump, do you think thats because white people are more likely to vote for Joe Biden than they are to vote for Kamala Harris? speaker Yes. Yes.\n\nastead herndon\n\nAnd so this is one of the big challenges Harris has to overcome. Even black voters, who sometimes like her instinctively, think that her identity as a black woman might be a liability for the election. And so they see Joe Biden, a white man with experience in the White House, and even this community thinks that maybe he is better suited to beat Trump. And ultimately, thats what they care about the most.\n\n[applause] floyd nicholson So again, we thank each one of you for taking time out of your busy schedule coming out today. And without further ado, it gives me great pleasure \n\nmonika evstatieva\n\nThen the event actually kicks off. There are several introductions.\n\nfloyd nicholson  the U.S. senator from that great state of California, the honorable Kamala Harris. [applause]\n\nmonika evstatieva\n\nAnd after some time, its her time to speak. And she needs to convince the people in this room that shes uniquely positioned to represent them best.\n\nkamala harris Thank you, Senator Nicholson! Hi, mama.\n\nmonika evstatieva\n\nWhat are some of the key points she makes in this speech?\n\nkamala harris Please have a seat. So I will tell you, my background is I am a daughter of parents who met when they were active in the civil rights movement in the 1960s in Berkeley and Oakland, California.\n\nastead herndon\n\nShe introduces herself to the audience, her personal narrative.\n\nkamala harris I grew up surrounded by a bunch of adults who spent full time marching and shouting for justice.\n\nastead herndon\n\nAnd then she turns very quickly to an issue she has gotten a lot of criticism for, her position on health care.\n\nkamala harris So Im running for president to put in place a Medicare for all plan, which means everyone will be covered, including people with pre-existing conditions.\n\nastead herndon\n\nAnd for her, health care looks like what she calls a Medicare for all plan that still preserves a role for the private insurance industry.\n\nmonika evstatieva\n\nAnd this is confusing, right?\n\nastead herndon\n\nIt can be. Shes had different positions on health care. She started the race as a co-sponsor on Bernie Sanderss Medicare for all bill, which is a single-payer system that eliminates private insurance. But she kind of hemmed and hawed about the specifics of that bill and then eventually offers her own plan \n\nkamala harris Im not trying to get rid of private insurance. So I heard from too many folks who said, Kamala, dont take away our choice.\n\nastead herndon\n\n which preserves a role for private insurance. And so, this is another one of the issues people cite around Kamala Harriss campaign, is that when you look at key policies, if you look at health care, the number one issue for Democrats in this race, she has not always stood for a singular position. Shes tried to have her cake and eat it, too, some voters say. Even now, as shes in between the progressive and moderate approaches, shes still borrowing language from that progressive lane.\n\nkamala harris We want the choice between a private plan or a public plan. Well, my plan will give you the choice that you deserve.\n\nmonika evstatieva\n\nAnd this is why I was a little bit confused when I hear her say that.\n\nastead herndon\n\n[LAUGHS] Youre not the only one.\n\nkamala harris But we need reasonable gun safety laws, including universal background checks.\n\nmonika evstatieva\n\nSo she goes through some other issues that are important to the Democratic voters, like gun safety, the challenges facing veterans.\n\nkamala harris  and putting them out of business when they were targeting our veterans.\n\nmonika evstatieva\n\nBut then \n\nkamala harris And Im just going to share with you one last thing, and then I would love to start our conversation.\n\nmonika evstatieva\n\n she turns to the issue of her electability. What does she say?\n\nastead herndon\n\nSenator Harris has added this in in the last couple months. As electability has become an increasing point of conversation in this race, shes decided to address it directly.\n\nkamala harris So I just want to have a brief conversation about something thats been coming up in connection with the campaign that I call the elephant in the room. But really its the donkey in the room. And its this conversation about electability. And the conversation goes something like this. Well, I dont know if America is ready for a woman of color to be president of the United States.\n\nastead herndon\n\nShes addressing the identity question head-on. Are Democrats too scared, or is it too much of a risk to put a black woman up against Donald Trump in this critical election?\n\nkamala harris I know Im ready, but I dont know if my neighbors are ready. Theyll say, well, maybe its not your turn.\n\nastead herndon\n\nAnd she says, this is not a new conversation for me.\n\nkamala harris In fact, this is a conversation I have heard in every campaign I have  and, now, here is the operative word  won. [applause]\n\nastead herndon\n\nAnd what shes trying to evoke there is that she has broken barriers before, and that if voters put their trust in her, she will do it again. And so, in this short time, shes addressing the two big challenges of her campaign, and shes trying to solve both. Shes trying to put forth a clear position on health care and sort of suggest that there was never any lack of clarity to begin with. And then she also tries to present her identity not as a hurdle to her success, but as a rallying point. That people can come together, and again, just like in the past, theyll overcome it.\n\nkamala harris Thank you all very much. Thank you. Thank you. Thank you.\n\n[music]\n\nmichael barbaro\n\nWell be right back.\n\nmonika evstatieva O.K. So were now headed to the town hall.\n\nmonika evstatieva\n\nThen were back on the road, and we keep following Senator Harris. And the next stop is Greenville.\n\nmonika evstatieva This is a bigger city, over 62,000 people.\n\nastead herndon\n\nYeah. Were headed from Greenwood to Greenville, a more urban community.\n\nmonika evstatieva Astead cannot be bothered with nothing but Beyonc right now. astead herndon (SINGING) To the left, to the left.\n\nmonika evstatieva\n\nAnd I actually find out you can sing.\n\nastead herndon\n\n[LAUGHS]\n\nmonika evstatieva\n\nSo we get to Greenville.\n\nspeaker Hi, welcome. Thank you very much for coming. Just through the glass doors on your right. I got to tell yall that.\n\nastead herndon\n\nWhen we come in, its a larger gymnasium. Its probably double or triple the amount of people in terms of crowd size, even though theres some empty seats. And theres also just a more elaborate setup. Thats all kind of just the campaign doing the more operational flexing of muscle for the bigger city.\n\nmonika evstatieva\n\nRight. So this is a more diverse place. Its more highly educated. Its younger. And people are following the election more closely, and so here, many people already know her.\n\nastead herndon Im sorry. You all are people who have picked a candidate? I know I see the shirts. speaker Yes. astead herndon But youre all in. speaker 1 Yes. Yes, all in. speaker 2 All in for Kamala.\n\nmonika evstatieva\n\nWhat are some of the things they tell us?\n\nastead herndon\n\nThey say what you hear from the Kamala Harris diehards, that she first came on their radar during the Senate committee hearings, where she was praised for her aggressive questioning of Bill Barr and Jeff Sessions.\n\nspeaker So I think it was during Sessionss confirmation hearings that I thought, shes going to run for president, and if she is, shes got my vote.\n\nastead herndon\n\nEventually, Brett Kavanaugh.\n\nspeaker Especially during the Kavanaugh hearings, when she talked to Dr. Ford and just looked at her in the eyes and said, I believe you, I believe you.\n\nastead herndon\n\nThey tell you that they like her debate interaction with Joe Biden in the first debate. She looked tough on the debate stage. And shes the one that they want to see go up against Donald Trump.\n\nmonika evstatieva\n\nAnd you asked them, but why is she not polling better?\n\nastead herndon What have you thought about the trajectory of her campaign? I mean, she started up there, but shes since kind of fallen. Why do you think that is?\n\nmonika evstatieva\n\nWhat are some of the things they cite as examples?\n\nastead herndon\n\nThese folks are following the race closely, and so they know that theres been a change in political standing from where Senator Harris started the race to where she arrived now. And when you ask her supporters that  why did that happen?  they again point to her identity.\n\nspeaker Shes been erased by the media. Shes been misrepresented by the media.\n\nastead herndon\n\nThey blame media for preferring, often, white candidates over people of color. And they point to a top tier, where the four candidates at the top are all white now in the Democratic Party.\n\nspeaker I mean, shes a black woman in a race that everyones looking for a white savior candidate. And so  but I think dont count her out. Shes got a strong ground game.\n\nmonika evstatieva\n\nThe event kicks off with a couple of introductions, including from a high school student.\n\nspeaker Ladies and gentlemen, I am proud to present to you someone who looks just like me.\n\nastead herndon\n\nYeah, theyve started having organizers introduce her, particularly women of color, to lean into that representation aspect.\n\nkamala harris Well, good afternoon, Greenville. It is wonderful to be back.\n\nmonika evstatieva\n\nAnd throughout the speech, the thing that gets the most ovation is when she goes after Trump.\n\nkamala harris We will need, as our nominee, someone who can stand on that debate stage and go toe-to-toe with Donald Trump. And Greenville, youre looking at her. Youre looking at her! ^[APPLAUSE]^\n\nastead herndon\n\nTheres a couple lines that any Democrat can say, and theyll get the audience on their feet. A surefire crowd-pleaser is to attack the president.\n\nkamala harris And somebody needs to remind Donald Trump that some of his closest relatives are immigrants, too. ^[APPLAUSE]^\n\nastead herndon\n\nAnd especially with the impeachment proceedings going on, Senator Harriss lines of justice being on the ballot or prosecuting the case against Donald Trump are always going to get the crowd on their feet. The question is if its just about Trump, why is that a reason to prefer Kamala Harris over the rest of the Democratic field, who are also making those same arguments?\n\nkamala harris And thats why Im running. I thank you all so very much. Thank you. Thank you. [applause] monika evstatieva O.K. Where are we going?\n\nastead herndon\n\nWe are in Greer, South Carolina \n\nmonika evstatieva\n\nThe following day, bright and early, we join her again.\n\nmonika evstatieva Its next to Greenville. And this time its raining.\n\nastead herndon\n\n at a community center \n\nmonika evstatieva O.K. Needmore Recreation Community Center. We are here.\n\nastead herndon\n\n where she is speaking to maybe 20, 25 people, all African-American, older residents.\n\nkamala harris So you all know, and have lived long, wonderful lives. And youll remember that for a large part of your life \n\nastead herndon\n\nShe spent a lot of her speech on lowering prescription drug costs and her health care plan, but she also mentions more systemic problems.\n\nkamala harris And remember those zero percent loans, nothing down? Predatory practices. The brokers made all kinds of money.\n\nastead herndon\n\nLike housing inequality and equitable education, issues that matter to older black voters.\n\nkamala harris And the father can look at his son and say, son, you dont have to go and get a loan from one of those private companies that are going to charge you these outrageous interest rates. Ill take some of the equity out of my home to help you pay for tuition. So thank you very much. Thank you, thank you. [applause]\n\nmonika evstatieva\n\nAfter the speech, we see something that I havent experienced so far.\n\nspeaker Pastor T., if you wanted to come up and say a couple words, or maybe pray over the senator. kamala harris Oh, yeah, I would love that.\n\nmonika evstatieva\n\nA pastor starts a prayer for her.\n\ntelley lynnette gadson So, were going to pray. kamala harris Yes. Yes. telley lynnette gadson Were going to pray. Were going to pray for protection.\n\nmonika evstatieva\n\nShe is literally holding her hands, and the whole room, everyone is standing up.\n\ntelley lynnette gadson Kamala Devi Harris, when you were in your mothers womb, God already knew about this stage of your life, and already knew that you would be in Greer, South Carolina, at the Needmore Community Center. It wasnt an accident.\n\nastead herndon\n\nThis is one of the cool things you can see while campaigning, specifically in South Carolina. Because the Democratic electorate is so black, and because the black electorate, particularly in these Southern states, is so religious, a lot of the campaigning happens through these religious communities. Pastors in black communities are not just religious leaders. They are community leaders. Theyre political leaders. Theyre cultural hubs. And particularly with black candidates, theres a sense of kinship there.\n\ntelley lynnette gadson God, for every flight that she will take, I pray that you are the pilot. God, for every car that she journeys in, I ask you to be the driver. And for every thought that she would think, I ask you to be the orchestrator.\n\nastead herndon\n\nKamala Harris is a religious woman. And there is a shared language of faith that happens at these events that you see with other candidates  its not like they wouldnt pray for a white candidate  but theres something different when its someone who they know has worshipped in their churches for their whole lives. And so she prays for her, and she mentions that the last presidential candidate she prayed for \n\ntelley lynnette gadson Now, the last person that I made my hands on and prayed for in the presidential election \n\nastead herndon\n\n was Barack Obama.\n\ntelley lynnette gadson  was Barack Hussein Obama. [applause]\n\nmonika evstatieva\n\nThe reverend is Reverend Gadson, but she goes by Pastor T.\n\ntelley lynnette gadson So we can be clear, they call me Pastor T., but Reverend Telley Lynnette Gadson. Thats who I am.\n\nmonika evstatieva\n\nAnd we actually catch up with her after the prayer.\n\nastead herndon That was your first time seeing the senator, I imagine, right? telley lynnette gadson First time seeing, but not first time hearing about.\n\nastead herndon\n\nAnd then we ask her about the race.\n\nastead herndon Are you someone who personally has made a decision about who you want to vote for? telley lynnette gadson I have not. I have not. And thats been because the field is so wide. But where I am, as Ive shared, is just a posture of, first of all, praying for our country. What is it that we \n\nastead herndon\n\nYou can see how that represents a problem for Kamala Harris.\n\n[music]\n\nmonika evstatieva\n\nSo we have this pastor who says she last laid hands on Barack Obama, but isnt ready to give her support to Kamala Harris, someone who started this race so strongly by trying to capture the same kind of coalition that Obama did. Weve heard that the challenges to her campaign are her identity and the lack of clarity on policy, but those same things could have been said for Obama. So whats different in 2019?\n\nastead herndon\n\nThe Barack Obama coalition that he rose to power with combined young people, liberals and historic turnout from black people. And theres not one candidate in this race that has yet been able to win those different demographic groups. And that was supposed to be Kamala Harris. I mean, it was supposed to be a number of people. It could have been Beto ORourke. It could have been Cory Booker. It could have been Kirsten Gillibrand. But when we entered this race, the thought, the reason why her candidacy was so feared, was because she was thought to be the one who could most quickly tap in to that coalition. Well, there are differences that we knew would be true from the start, and theres things that weve learned over the last six to eight months. From the start, we knew that, as a black woman running, she would have no historical touchstone and she would face unique barriers. And I think if you ask the campaign, they would say thats true. But its really about messaging. We knew that this race would be defined by a progressive wing, led by figures like Elizabeth Warren and Bernie Sanders, and a moderate wing, led by Joe Biden, and that people like Kamala Harris would have to exist threading both worlds. And thats been difficult. When you talk to voters, the most consistently repeated thing is, well, I dont necessarily know what she stands for. And I think that is borne out of those two wings, the progressive and moderate wings, defining this primary through their fight. And so Bernie Sanders and Elizabeth Warren can say, if you arent with single-payer health care, youre not a progressive. If youre not willing to raise taxes on corporations and wealthy individuals, then you dont have big ideas. And the moderate wing has defined themselves by rejecting that, by defining themselves by saying, well, we cant do that or we wont beat Trump. But if youre trying to do both of those things, if youre trying to thread in between those worlds, we have seen electorates that arent really willing to give people that benefit of the doubt. And thats driving a lot of the anxiety right now, particularly among the partys moderates.\n\nmonika evstatieva\n\nAnd thats why we see all these new candidates jump in the race.\n\nastead herndon\n\nThe anxiety breeds restlessness, right? And Deval Patrick, who just announced, Mike Bloomberg, whos expected to, are trying to capitalize on that anxiety. Because in the circles that like them, in the circles of elite, Democratic moderates, they are a group that expected to have more options. Theyre not that surprised at the way Joe Bidens candidacy has turned out. Where the biggest surprise is is they thought they would have an alternative figure to Joe Biden who could replicate that Obama lane. Now remember, these are a group of people who think that Warren and Sanderss progressive policies will lose them the general election. They think that Warren and Sanders, if they are the nominee, will struggle to bring out the type of people that put Democrats over the top. And without that, without someone in the top tier who is winning black voters and exciting young voters at the same time, there is fear that you cannot replicate what Obama did. Now, their argument is that thats because of the campaigns, that the individual candidates and individual campaigns havent done the things necessary to produce that support. But it could be because of a changing electorate and two wings of the party that just arent looking for a merging savior anymore.\n\n[music]\n\nmichael barbaro\n\nWell be right back.

He has also said he would prefer a running mate with strengths that complement his own, as well as someone who would be willing to challenge him rather than being cowed by the office of the presidency.\n\nFollow-up interviews with poll respondents suggested that many voters are in tune with Mr. Bidens stated approach.\n\nI dont believe that the problems in America can be solved just by having, for example, a black president or a black vice president, said Garfield Campbell, 54, of Scottsdale, Ariz., a poll respondent. Mr. Campbell, who is black, continued, The right person has to be someone that can sort of counterbalance, or add value and strength, to Joe Biden, in areas where he may not be as strong.\n\nMr. Bidens wide lead over President Trump in national polls  he was ahead by 14 percentage points in a Times/Siena survey this week  could give him an unusually free hand in choosing a running mate: He is not desperately seeking a sidekick who could help him shake up the race, as John McCain did in 2008 when he put the charismatic but obscure Alaska governor, Sarah Palin, on his ticket. Nor is Mr. Biden confronting questions about his own readiness for the presidency, as Barack Obama did when he selected Mr. Biden.\n\nChristine Matthews, a Republican pollster who has been critical of Mr. Trump, said that the political impact of Mr. Bidens selection might be limited because he is so far ahead in the race.\n\nIt matters less this year, because of his large lead and his appeal to fairly broad constituencies, said Ms. Matthews, adding that her own view was that Mr. Biden ought to choose a black woman.'

On Sunday, Jared Kushner, President Trumps adviser and son-in-law, said on the CBS program Face the Nation that he and his wife, Ivanka Trump, would be sending their children to school for in-person instruction. Our school is not opening up five days a week, he said.

Vaccines typically require years of research and testing before reaching the clinic, but scientists are racing to produce a safe and effective vaccine by next year.\n\nAntibody produced in response to a vaccine SARS-CoV-2 coronavirus Antibody produced in response to a vaccine SARS-CoV-2 coronavirus Antibody produced in response to a vaccine SARS-CoV-2 coronavirus\n\nWork began in January with the deciphering of the SARS-CoV-2 genome. The first vaccine safety trials in humans started in March, but the road ahead remains uncertain. Some trials will fail, and others may end without a clear result. But a few may succeed in stimulating the immune system to produce effective antibodies against the virus.\n\nHere is the status of all the vaccines that have reached trials in humans, along with a selection of promising vaccines still being tested in cells or animals.\n\nFor an overview of different Covid-19 treatments, see our Coronavirus Drug and Treatment Tracker.\n\n\n\n\n\nNew additions and recent updates:  A Merck, Themis and Institut Pasteur vaccine enters Phase 1.  Russia approves a Gamaleya vaccine before Phase 3 testing.  CanSino Biologics announces Phase 3 trials.  Italys ReiThera enters Phase 1.\n\nThe Vaccine Testing Process\n\nThe development cycle of a vaccine, from lab to clinic.\n\n\n\nPRECLINICAL TESTING: Scientists give the vaccine to animals such as mice or monkeys to see if it produces an immune response.\n\nPHASE 1 SAFETY TRIALS: Scientists give the vaccine to a small number of people to test safety and dosage as well as to confirm that it stimulates the immune system.\n\nPHASE 2 EXPANDED TRIALS: Scientists give the vaccine to hundreds of people split into groups, such as children and the elderly, to see if the vaccine acts differently in them. These trials further test the vaccines safety and ability to stimulate the immune system.\n\nPHASE 3 EFFICACY TRIALS: Scientists give the vaccine to thousands of people and wait to see how many become infected, compared with volunteers who received a placebo. These trials can determine if the vaccine protects against the coronavirus. In June, the F.D.A. said that a coronavirus vaccine would have to protect at least 50% of vaccinated people to be considered effective. In addition, Phase 3 trials are large enough to reveal evidence of relatively rare side effects that might be missed in earlier studies.\n\nAPPROVED: Regulators in each country review the trial results and decide whether to approve the vaccine or not. During a pandemic, a vaccine may receive emergency use authorization before getting formal approval. Once a vaccine is licensed, researchers continue to monitor people who receive it to make sure its safe and effective.\n\nCOMBINED PHASES: Another way to accelerate vaccine development is to combine phases. Some coronavirus vaccines are now in Phase 1/2 trials, for example, in which they are tested for the first time on hundreds of people. (Note that our tracker would count a combined Phase 1/2 trial as both Phase 1 and Phase 2.)\n\nFilter the list of vaccines:\n\nAll vaccines Preclinical Phase 1 Phase 2 Phase 3 Approved\n\nGenetic Vaccines\n\nVaccines that use one or more of the coronaviruss own genes to provoke an immune response.\n\nDNA RNA DNA RNA DNA RNA\n\nPHASE 3\n\n\n\nModerna develops vaccines based on messenger RNA (mRNA) to produce viral proteins in the body. They have yet to bring one to the market. The government has bankrolled Modernas efforts on a coronavirus vaccine with nearly $1 billion. In partnership with National Institutes of Health, they found that the vaccine protects monkeys from the coronavirus. In March, the company put the first Covid-19 vaccine into human trials, which yielded promising results, After carrying out a Phase 2 study they launched a Phase 3 trial on July 27. The final trial will enroll 30,000 healthy people at about 89 sites around the United States. On August 11, the government awarded the company an additional $1.5 billion in exchange for 100 million doses if the vaccine proves safe and effective.\n\n\n\nPHASE 2 PHASE 3 COMBINED PHASES\n\n\n\nThe German company BioNTech entered into collaborations with Pfizer, based in New York, and the Chinese drug maker Fosun Pharma to develop an mRNA vaccine. In May they launched a Phase 1/2 trial. The volunteers produced antibodies against SARS-CoV-2, as well as immune cells called T cells that respond to the virus. Some volunteers experienced moderate side effects such as sleep disturbances and sore arms. On July 27, the companies announced the launch of a Phase 2/3 trial with 30,000 volunteers in the United States and other countries including Argentina, Brazil, and Germany.\n\n\n\nThe Trump administration awarded a $1.9 billion contract for 100 million doses to be delivered by December and the option to acquire 500 million more doses. Meanwhile, Japan made a deal for 120 million doses, while the European Union secured 400 million. If approved, Pfizer said they expect to manufacture over 1.3 billion doses of their vaccine worldwide by the end of 2021.\n\n\n\nPHASE 2\n\n\n\nIndian vaccine-maker Zydus Cadila began testing a DNA-based vaccine in July, becoming the second company in India to enter the Covid-19 vaccine race after Bharat Biotech. They launched a Phase 2 trial on Aug. 6.\n\n\n\nPHASE 1 PHASE 2 COMBINED PHASES\n\n\n\nImperial College London researchers have developed a self-amplifying RNA vaccine, which boosts production of a viral protein to stimulate the immune system. They began Phase 1/2 trials on June 15 and have partnered with Morningside Ventures to manufacture and distribute the vaccine through a new company called VacEquity Global Health. The researchers expect to know if the vaccine is effective by the end of the year.\n\nPHASE 1 PHASE 2 COMBINED PHASES\n\n\n\nOn June 30, the Japanese biotechnology company AnGes announced they had started Phase 1 trials on a DNA-based vaccine, developed in partnership with Osaka University and Takara Bio.\n\n\n\nPHASE 1 PHASE 2 COMBINED PHASES\n\n\n\nThe California-based company Arcturus Therapeutics and Duke-NUS Medical School in Singapore have developed an mRNA vaccine. The self-replicating design of the molecules in the vaccine led to strong immune responses in animal experiments. In August, they launched a Phase 1/2 trial at Singapore General Hospital.\n\n\n\nPHASE 1\n\n\n\nThe American company Inovio has developed DNA-based vaccines which are delivered into the skin with electric pulses from a hand-held device. They have vaccines in clinical trials for a number of diseases, and in June they announced interim data from a Phase 1 trial on Covid-19. They found no serious adverse effects, and measured an immune response in 34 out of 36 volunteers. Inovio has yet to publish detailed results of these studies, however, and it is embroiled in several lawsuits with stockholders and a company partner. They plan to start Phase 2/3 trials by the end of the summer.\n\n\n\nPHASE 1\n\n\n\nIn March, the Trump administration unsuccessfully tried to entice CureVac to move its research from Germany to the United States. In June, the company launched Phase 1 trials of its mRNA vaccine. The company said its German facility can make hundreds of millions of vaccine doses a year.\n\n\n\nPHASE 1\n\n\n\nThe Korean company Genexine started testing the safety of a DNA-based vaccine in June. They anticipate moving to Phase 2 trials in the fall.\n\n\n\nPHASE 1\n\n\n\nIn June, Chinese researchers at the Academy of Military Medical Sciences, Suzhou Abogen Biosciences and Walvax Biotechnology announced they would start their countrys first safety trials on a mRNA-based vaccine, called ARCoV. Earlier studies on monkeys reportedly showed protective effects.\n\n\n\nPRECLINICAL\n\n\n\nThe French pharmaceutical company Sanofi is developing an mRNA vaccine in partnership with Translate Bio. On June 23, they announced they were planning Phase 1 trials in the fall.\n\nViral Vector Vaccines\n\nVaccines that use a virus to deliver coronavirus genes into cells and provoke an immune response.\n\nPHASE 3 APPROVED FOR LIMITED USE\n\n\n\nThe Chinese company CanSino Biologics developed a vaccine based on an adenovirus called Ad5, in partnership with the Institute of Biology at the countrys Academy of Military Medical Sciences. In May, they published promising results from a Phase 1 safety trial, and in July they reported that their Phase 2 trials demonstrated the vaccine produced a strong immune response. In an unprecedented move, the Chinese military approved the vaccine on June 25 for a year as a specially needed drug. CanSino would not say whether vaccination would be mandatory or optional for soldiers. On August 9, the Saudi health ministry announced that CanSino Biologics would run a Phase 3 trial in Saudi Arabia. The company is in negotiations with other countries for more trials.\n\n\n\nPHASE 2 PHASE 3 COMBINED PHASES\n\n\n\nA vaccine in development by the British-Swedish company AstraZeneca and the University of Oxford is based on a chimpanzee adenovirus called ChAdOx1. A study on monkeys found that the vaccine provided them protection. In May, the United States awarded the project $1.2 billion in support. Their Phase 1/2 trial revealed that the vaccine was safe, causing no severe side effects. It raised antibodies against the coronavirus as well as other immune defenses. The vaccine is now in Phase 2/3 trials in England and India, as well as Phase 3 trials in Brazil and South Africa.\n\n\n\nIf these large-scale trials yield positive results, AstraZeneca has indicated they could deliver emergency vaccines as soon as October. The company has said their total manufacturing capacity for the vaccine, if approved, stands at two billion doses. Indias Serum Institute has already produced millions of doses to be used in trials.\n\n\n\nPHASE 1 PHASE 2 COMBINED PHASES\n\n\n\nA decade ago, researchers at Beth Israel Deaconess Medical Center in Boston developed a method for making vaccines out of a virus called Adenovirus 26, or Ad26 for short. Johnson & Johnson developed vaccines for Ebola and other diseases with Ad26 and have now made one for the coronavirus. In March they received $456 million from the United States government to support their move towards production. The vaccine has provided protection in experiments on monkeys. Johnson & Johnson launched Phase 1/2 trials in July and is planning for Phase 3 trials in September. In August, the federal government agreed to pay $1 billion for 100 million doses if the vaccine is approved. The company is aiming for production of at least a billion doses in 2021.\n\n\n\nPHASE 1 APPROVED FOR EARLY USE\n\n\n\nThe Gamaleya Research Institute, part of Russias Ministry of Health, launched a Phase 1 trial in June of a vaccine they called Gam-Covid-Vac Lyo. It is a combination of two adenoviruses, Ad5 and Ad26, both engineered with a coronavirus gene. In July, the chair of the upper house of Russias Parliament announced the country might start vaccine production by the end of the year. On Aug. 11, President Vladimir V. Putin announced that a Russian health care regulator had approved the vaccine, renamed Sputnik V, before Phase 3 trials had even begun. Vaccine experts decried the move as risky. Nevertheless, Tass reported, Vietnam soon agreed to purchase 50 to 150 million doses.\n\n\n\nPHASE 1\n\n\n\nThe Italian biotechnology company ReiThera has developed a Covid-19 vaccine, called GRAd-COV2, that is based on an adenovirus that infects gorillas. Working in collaboration with the Lazzaro Spallanzani National Institute for Infectious Diseases in Rome, they launched a Phase 1 trial at the end of July.\n\n\n\nPRECLINICAL\n\n\n\nThe Swiss company Novartis will manufacture a vaccine based on a gene therapy treatment developed by the Massachusetts Eye and Ear Hospital. A virus called an adeno-associated virus delivers coronavirus gene fragments into cells. Phase 1 trials are set to begin in late 2020.\n\nPRECLINICAL\n\n\n\nThe American company Merck announced in May it would develop a vaccine from vesicular stomatitis viruses, the same approach it successfully used to produce the first approved vaccine for Ebola. The company is partnering with IAVI and has received $38 million in support from the United States government. Unlike most other vaccines, this one could be taken orally.\n\n\n\nPHASE 1\n\n\n\nMerck acquired the Austrian firm Themis Bioscience in June and is now pursuing a second vaccine. Originally developed at Institut Pasteur, the vaccine uses weakened measles virus to carry genetic material into patients cells. Researchers launched a Phase I trial in August.\n\n\n\nPRECLINICAL\n\n\n\nVaxarts vaccine is an oral tablet containing an adenovirus that delivers coronavirus genes. They are preparing for Phase 1 trials this summer.\n\n\n\nProtein-Based Vaccines\n\nVaccines that use a coronavirus protein or a protein fragment to provoke an immune response.\n\nPHASE 2\n\n\n\nIn July, the Chinese company Anhui Zhifei Longcom began Phase 2 trials for a vaccine that is a combination of viral proteins and an adjuvant that stimulates the immune system. The company is part of Chongqing Zhifei Biological Products and has partnered with the Chinese Academy of Medical Sciences.\n\n\n\nPHASE 1 PHASE 2 COMBINED PHASES\n\n\n\nMaryland-based Novavax makes vaccines by sticking proteins onto microscopic particles. Theyve taken on a number of different diseases this way; their flu vaccine finished Phase 3 trials in March. The company launched trials for a Covid-19 vaccine in May, and the Coalition for Epidemic Preparedness Innovations has invested $384 million in the vaccine. In July the U.S. government awarded $1.6 billion to support the vaccines clinical trials and manufacturing.\n\n\n\nOn Aug. 4, Novavax announced promising results from two preliminary studies in monkeys and humans. Phase 3 trials are expected to start in October.\n\n\n\nIf the trials succeed, Novavax expects to deliver 100 million doses for use in the United States by the first quarter of 2021. In August, an executive at the company said it could make well over a billion doses a year for worldwide demand.\n\n\n\nPHASE 1\n\n\n\nClover Biopharmaceuticals has developed a vaccine containing a protein from coronaviruses. To further stimulate the immune system, the vaccine is being given in conjunction with so-called adjuvants made by British drugmaker GSK and the American company Dynavax. Investments from CEPI will support the development of manufacturing that could lead to the production of hundreds of millions of doses a year.\n\nPHASE 1\n\n\n\nThe Australian company Vaxine developed a vaccine that combines viral proteins with an adjuvant that stimulates the immune system. They successfully completed Phase 1 trials in July and expect to start Phase 2 trials in September.\n\n\n\nPHASE 1\n\n\n\nCanada-based Medicago, partly funded by the cigarette maker Philip Morris, uses a species of tobacco to make vaccines. They deliver virus genes into leaves, and the plant cells then create protein shells that mimic viruses. In July, Medicago launched Phase 1 trials on a plant-based Covid-19 vaccine in combination with adjuvants from drug makers GSK and Dynavax. If the trial goes well, they plan to start Phase 2/3 trials in October.\n\n\n\nPHASE 1\n\n\n\nA vaccine from Australias University of Queensland delivers viral proteins altered to draw a stronger immune response. The university launched Phase 1 trials in July, combining the proteins with an adjuvant made by CSL. If the results are positive, CSL will advance late stage clinical trials and expects to make tens of millions of doses.\n\n\n\nPHASE 1\n\n\n\nA second tobacco-based vaccine is in development at Kentucky BioProcessing, an American subsidiary of British American Tobacco, the maker of Lucky Strike and other cigarettes. Like Medicago, Kentucky BioProcessing engineers a species of tobacco called Nicotiana benthamiana to make viral proteins. The company previously used this technique to make a drug called Zmapp for Ebola. After preclinical testing in the spring, they registered a Phase 1 trial for their coronavirus vaccine in July.\n\n\n\nPHASE 1\n\n\n\nTaiwan-based vaccine maker Medigen is making a vaccine made of a combination of spike proteins and an adjuvant from Dynavax. They have registered a Phase 1 trial set to start in September.\n\n\n\nPHASE 1 ?\n\n\n\nOn July 18, North Koreas State Commission of Science and Technology announced on their web site that they had started clinical trials on a vaccine based on part of the coronavirus spike protein. Its hard to independently determine how much truth there is in the claim from the isolated dictatorship. The commission claimed to have tested the vaccine on animals, but provided no data. Whats more, it stated that effectiveness trials would have to be carried out in another country since there is no case of Covid-19 in DPR Korea. Thats a claim outside experts find highly doubtful.\n\n\n\nPRECLINICAL\n\n\n\nAfter the SARS epidemic in 2002, Baylor College of Medicine researchers began developing a vaccine that could prevent a new outbreak. Despite promising early results, support for the research disappeared. Because the coronaviruses that cause SARS and Covid-19 are very similar, the researchers are reviving the project in partnership with the Texas Childrens Hospital.\n\nPRECLINICAL\n\n\n\nA vaccine in development by the University of Pittsburgh, called PittCoVacc, is a skin patch tipped with 400 tiny needles made of sugar. When placed on the skin, the needles dissolve and deliver virus proteins into the body.\n\nPRECLINICAL\n\n\n\nIn addition to their mRNA vaccine, Sanofi is developing a vaccine based on viral proteins. They are producing the proteins with engineered viruses that grow inside insect cells. GSK will supplement these proteins with adjuvants that stimulate the immune system. The companies expect to enter clinical trials in September.\n\n\n\nIn July they reached two major deals for supplying the vaccine next year. They reached an agreement with the British government to provide up to 60 million doses if the vaccine succeeds in trials. Meanwhile, the United States will give the companies $2.1 billion for 100 million doses. Sanofi has said it could potentially produce at least 600 million doses a year.\n\n\n\nWhole-Virus Vaccines\n\nVaccines that use a weakened or inactivated version of the coronavirus to provoke an immune response.\n\nInactivated virus Inactivated virus Inactivated virus\n\nPHASE 3\n\n\n\nThe Wuhan Institute of Biological Products developed an inactivated virus vaccine, which the state-owned Chinese company Sinopharm put into clinical tests. The Phase 1/2 trial showed that the vaccine produced antibodies in volunteers, some of whom experienced fevers and other side effects. In July, they launched Phase 3 trials in the United Arab Emirates. In the same month, the chairman of Sinopharm told Chinese state media that the vaccine could be ready for public use by the end of the year.\n\n\n\nPHASE 3\n\n\n\nSinopharm is also testing a second inactivated virus vaccine, this one developed by the Beijing Institute of Biological Products. In Phase 3 trials in the United Arab Emirates, 5,000 people are receiving the Wuhan Institute version, while another 5,000 are receiving the Beijing Institute one.\n\n\n\nPHASE 3\n\n\n\nThe private Chinese company Sinovac Biotech is testing an inactivated vaccine called CoronaVac. In June the company announced that Phase 1/2 trials on 743 volunteers found no severe adverse effects and produced an immune response. Sinovac then launched a Phase 3 trial in Brazil in July and another in Indonesia the following month. The company is also building a facility to manufacture up to 100 million doses annually.\n\n\n\nPHASE 2\n\n\n\nResearchers at the Institute of Medical Biology at the Chinese Academy of Medical Sciences, which has invented vaccines for polio and hepatitis A, started a Phase 2 trial of an inactivated virus vaccine in June.\n\n\n\nPHASE 1 PHASE 2 COMBINED PHASES\n\n\n\nIn collaboration with the Indian Council of Medical Research and the National Institute of Virology, the Indian company Bharat Biotech designed a vaccine called Covaxin based on an inactivated form of the coronavirus. When the company launched Phase 1/2 trials in July, reports circulated that the vaccine would be ready by August 15. But the C.E.O. of Bharat told reporters it would be available no sooner than early 2021.\n\n\n\nRepurposed Vaccines\n\nVaccines already in use for other diseases that may also protect against Covid-19.\n\nPHASE 3\n\n\n\nThe Bacillus Calmette-Guerin vaccine was developed in the early 1900s as a protection against tuberculosis. The Murdoch Childrens Research Institute in Australia is conducting a Phase 3 trial, and several other trials are underway to see if the vaccine partly protects against the coronavirus.\n\n\n\n\n\nNote: Vaccines will be added to the tracker when they reach Phase 1, and tracked until they succeed or fail.

The self-replicating design of the molecules in the vaccine led to strong immune responses in animal experiments. In August, they launched a Phase 1/2 trial at Singapore General Hospital.\n\n\n\nPHASE 1\n\n\n\nThe American company Inovio has developed DNA-based vaccines which are delivered into the skin with electric pulses from a hand-held device. They have vaccines in clinical trials for a number of diseases, and in June they announced interim data from a Phase 1 trial on Covid-19. They found no serious adverse effects, and measured an immune response in 34 out of 36 volunteers. Inovio has yet to publish detailed results of these studies, however, and it is embroiled in several lawsuits with stockholders and a company partner. They plan to start Phase 2/3 trials by the end of the summer.\n\n\n\nPHASE 1\n\n\n\nIn March, the Trump administration unsuccessfully tried to entice CureVac to move its research from Germany to the United States. In June, the company launched Phase 1 trials of its mRNA vaccine. The company said its German facility can make hundreds of millions of vaccine doses a year.\n\n\n\nPHASE 1\n\n\n\nThe Korean company Genexine started testing the safety of a DNA-based vaccine in June. They anticipate moving to Phase 2 trials in the fall.\n\n\n\nPHASE 1\n\n\n\nIn June, Chinese researchers at the Academy of Military Medical Sciences, Suzhou Abogen Biosciences and Walvax Biotechnology announced they would start their countrys first safety trials on a mRNA-based vaccine, called ARCoV. Earlier studies on monkeys reportedly showed protective effects.\n\n\n\nPRECLINICAL\n\n\n\nThe French pharmaceutical company Sanofi is developing an mRNA vaccine in partnership with Translate Bio. On June 23, they announced they were planning Phase 1 trials in the fall.\n\nViral Vector Vaccines\n\nVaccines that use a virus to deliver coronavirus genes into cells and provoke an immune response.\n\nPHASE 3 APPROVED FOR LIMITED USE\n\n\n\nThe Chinese company CanSino Biologics developed a vaccine based on an adenovirus called Ad5, in partnership with the Institute of Biology at the countrys Academy of Military Medical Sciences. In May, they published promising results from a Phase 1 safety trial, and in July they reported that their Phase 2 trials demonstrated the vaccine produced a strong immune response. In an unprecedented move, the Chinese military approved the vaccine on June 25 for a year as a specially needed drug. CanSino would not say whether vaccination would be mandatory or optional for soldiers. On August 9, the Saudi health ministry announced that CanSino Biologics would run a Phase 3 trial in Saudi Arabia. The company is in negotiations with other countries for more trials.\n\n\n\nPHASE 2 PHASE 3 COMBINED PHASES\n\n\n\nA vaccine in development by the British-Swedish company AstraZeneca and the University of Oxford is based on a chimpanzee adenovirus called ChAdOx1. A study on monkeys found that the vaccine provided them protection. In May, the United States awarded the project $1.2 billion in support. Their Phase 1/2 trial revealed that the vaccine was safe, causing no severe side effects. It raised antibodies against the coronavirus as well as other immune defenses. The vaccine is now in Phase 2/3 trials in England and India, as well as Phase 3 trials in Brazil and South Africa.\n\n\n\nIf these large-scale trials yield positive results, AstraZeneca has indicated they could deliver emergency vaccines as soon as October. The company has said their total manufacturing capacity for the vaccine, if approved, stands at two billion doses. Indias Serum Institute has already produced millions of doses to be used in trials.\n\n\n\nPHASE 1 PHASE 2 COMBINED PHASES\n\n\n\nA decade ago, researchers at Beth Israel Deaconess Medical Center in Boston developed a method for making vaccines out of a virus called Adenovirus 26, or Ad26 for short. Johnson & Johnson developed vaccines for Ebola and other diseases with Ad26 and have now made one for the coronavirus. In March they received $456 million from the United States government to support their move towards production. The vaccine has provided protection in experiments on monkeys. Johnson & Johnson launched Phase 1/2 trials in July and is planning for Phase 3 trials in September. In August, the federal government agreed to pay $1 billion for 100 million doses if the vaccine is approved. The company is aiming for production of at least a billion doses in 2021.\n\n\n\nPHASE 1 APPROVED FOR EARLY USE\n\n\n\nThe Gamaleya Research Institute, part of Russias Ministry of Health, launched a Phase 1 trial in June of a vaccine they called Gam-Covid-Vac Lyo. It is a combination of two adenoviruses, Ad5 and Ad26, both engineered with a coronavirus gene. In July, the chair of the upper house of Russias Parliament announced the country might start vaccine production by the end of the year. On Aug. 11, President Vladimir V. Putin announced that a Russian health care regulator had approved the vaccine, renamed Sputnik V, before Phase 3 trials had even begun. Vaccine experts decried the move as risky. Nevertheless, Tass reported, Vietnam soon agreed to purchase 50 to 150 million doses.\n\n\n\nPHASE 1\n\n\n\nThe Italian biotechnology company ReiThera has developed a Covid-19 vaccine, called GRAd-COV2, that is based on an adenovirus that infects gorillas. Working in collaboration with the Lazzaro Spallanzani National Institute for Infectious Diseases in Rome, they launched a Phase 1 trial at the end of July.\n\n\n\nPRECLINICAL\n\n\n\nThe Swiss company Novartis will manufacture a vaccine based on a gene therapy treatment developed by the Massachusetts Eye and Ear Hospital. A virus called an adeno-associated virus delivers coronavirus gene fragments into cells. Phase 1 trials are set to begin in late 2020.\n\nPRECLINICAL\n\n\n\nThe American company Merck announced in May it would develop a vaccine from vesicular stomatitis viruses, the same approach it successfully used to produce the first approved vaccine for Ebola. The company is partnering with IAVI and has received $38 million in support from the United States government. Unlike most other vaccines, this one could be taken orally.\n\n\n\nPHASE 1\n\n\n\nMerck acquired the Austrian firm Themis Bioscience in June and is now pursuing a second vaccine. Originally developed at Institut Pasteur, the vaccine uses weakened measles virus to carry genetic material into patients cells. Researchers launched a Phase I trial in August.\n\n\n\nPRECLINICAL\n\n\n\nVaxarts vaccine is an oral tablet containing an adenovirus that delivers coronavirus genes. They are preparing for Phase 1 trials this summer.\n\n\n\nProtein-Based Vaccines\n\nVaccines that use a coronavirus protein or a protein fragment to provoke an immune response.\n\nPHASE 2\n\n\n\nIn July, the Chinese company Anhui Zhifei Longcom began Phase 2 trials for a vaccine that is a combination of viral proteins and an adjuvant that stimulates the immune system. The company is part of Chongqing Zhifei Biological Products and has partnered with the Chinese Academy of Medical Sciences.\n\n\n\nPHASE 1 PHASE 2 COMBINED PHASES\n\n\n\nMaryland-based Novavax makes vaccines by sticking proteins onto microscopic particles. Theyve taken on a number of different diseases this way; their flu vaccine finished Phase 3 trials in March. The company launched trials for a Covid-19 vaccine in May, and the Coalition for Epidemic Preparedness Innovations has invested $384 million in the vaccine. In July the U.S. government awarded $1.6 billion to support the vaccines clinical trials and manufacturing.\n\n\n\nOn Aug. 4, Novavax announced promising results from two preliminary studies in monkeys and humans. Phase 3 trials are expected to start in October.\n\n\n\nIf the trials succeed, Novavax expects to deliver 100 million doses for use in the United States by the first quarter of 2021. In August, an executive at the company said it could make well over a billion doses a year for worldwide demand.\n\n\n\nPHASE 1\n\n\n\nClover Biopharmaceuticals has developed a vaccine containing a protein from coronaviruses. To further stimulate the immune system, the vaccine is being given in conjunction with so-called adjuvants made by British drugmaker GSK and the American company Dynavax. Investments from CEPI will support the development of manufacturing that could lead to the production of hundreds of millions of doses a year.\n\nPHASE 1\n\n\n\nThe Australian company Vaxine developed a vaccine that combines viral proteins with an adjuvant that stimulates the immune system. They successfully completed Phase 1 trials in July and expect to start Phase 2 trials in September.\n\n\n\nPHASE 1\n\n\n\nCanada-based Medicago, partly funded by the cigarette maker Philip Morris, uses a species of tobacco to make vaccines. They deliver virus genes into leaves, and the plant cells then create protein shells that mimic viruses. In July, Medicago launched Phase 1 trials on a plant-based Covid-19 vaccine in combination with adjuvants from drug makers GSK and Dynavax. If the trial goes well, they plan to start Phase 2/3 trials in October.\n\n\n\nPHASE 1\n\n\n\nA vaccine from Australias University of Queensland delivers viral proteins altered to draw a stronger immune response. The university launched Phase 1 trials in July, combining the proteins with an adjuvant made by CSL. If the results are positive, CSL will advance late stage clinical trials and expects to make tens of millions of doses.\n\n\n\nPHASE 1\n\n\n\nA second tobacco-based vaccine is in development at Kentucky BioProcessing, an American subsidiary of British American Tobacco, the maker of Lucky Strike and other cigarettes. Like Medicago, Kentucky BioProcessing engineers a species of tobacco called Nicotiana benthamiana to make viral proteins. The company previously used this technique to make a drug called Zmapp for Ebola. After preclinical testing in the spring, they registered a Phase 1 trial for their coronavirus vaccine in July.\n\n\n\nPHASE 1\n\n\n\nTaiwan-based vaccine maker Medigen is making a vaccine made of a combination of spike proteins and an adjuvant from Dynavax. They have registered a Phase 1 trial set to start in September.\n\n\n\nPHASE 1 ?\n\n\n\nOn July 18, North Koreas State Commission of Science and Technology announced on their web site that they had started clinical trials on a vaccine based on part of the coronavirus spike protein. Its hard to independently determine how much truth there is in the claim from the isolated dictatorship. The commission claimed to have tested the vaccine on animals, but provided no data. Whats more, it stated that effectiveness trials would have to be carried out in another country since there is no case of Covid-19 in DPR Korea. Thats a claim outside experts find highly doubtful.\n\n\n\nPRECLINICAL\n\n\n\nAfter the SARS epidemic in 2002, Baylor College of Medicine researchers began developing a vaccine that could prevent a new outbreak. Despite promising early results, support for the research disappeared. Because the coronaviruses that cause SARS and Covid-19 are very similar, the researchers are reviving the project in partnership with the Texas Childrens Hospital.\n\nPRECLINICAL\n\n\n\nA vaccine in development by the University of Pittsburgh, called PittCoVacc, is a skin patch tipped with 400 tiny needles made of sugar. When placed on the skin, the needles dissolve and deliver virus proteins into the body.\n\nPRECLINICAL\n\n\n\nIn addition to their mRNA vaccine, Sanofi is developing a vaccine based on viral proteins. They are producing the proteins with engineered viruses that grow inside insect cells. GSK will supplement these proteins with adjuvants that stimulate the immune system. The companies expect to enter clinical trials in September.\n\n\n\nIn July they reached two major deals for supplying the vaccine next year. They reached an agreement with the British government to provide up to 60 million doses if the vaccine succeeds in trials. Meanwhile, the United States will give the companies $2.1 billion for 100 million doses. Sanofi has said it could potentially produce at least 600 million doses a year.\n\n\n\nWhole-Virus Vaccines\n\nVaccines that use a weakened or inactivated version of the coronavirus to provoke an immune response.\n\nInactivated virus Inactivated virus Inactivated virus\n\nPHASE 3\n\n\n\nThe Wuhan Institute of Biological Products developed an inactivated virus vaccine, which the state-owned Chinese company Sinopharm put into clinical tests. The Phase 1/2 trial showed that the vaccine produced antibodies in volunteers, some of whom experienced fevers and other side effects. In July, they launched Phase 3 trials in the United Arab Emirates. In the same month, the chairman of Sinopharm told Chinese state media that the vaccine could be ready for public use by the end of the year.\n\n\n\nPHASE 3\n\n\n\nSinopharm is also testing a second inactivated virus vaccine, this one developed by the Beijing Institute of Biological Products. In Phase 3 trials in the United Arab Emirates, 5,000 people are receiving the Wuhan Institute version, while another 5,000 are receiving the Beijing Institute one.\n\n\n\nPHASE 3\n\n\n\nThe private Chinese company Sinovac Biotech is testing an inactivated vaccine called CoronaVac. In June the company announced that Phase 1/2 trials on 743 volunteers found no severe adverse effects and produced an immune response. Sinovac then launched a Phase 3 trial in Brazil in July and another in Indonesia the following month. The company is also building a facility to manufacture up to 100 million doses annually.\n\n\n\nPHASE 2\n\n\n\nResearchers at the Institute of Medical Biology at the Chinese Academy of Medical Sciences, which has invented vaccines for polio and hepatitis A, started a Phase 2 trial of an inactivated virus vaccine in June.\n\n\n\nPHASE 1 PHASE 2 COMBINED PHASES\n\n\n\nIn collaboration with the Indian Council of Medical Research and the National Institute of Virology, the Indian company Bharat Biotech designed a vaccine called Covaxin based on an inactivated form of the coronavirus. When the company launched Phase 1/2 trials in July, reports circulated that the vaccine would be ready by August 15. But the C.E.O. of Bharat told reporters it would be available no sooner than early 2021.\n\n\n\nRepurposed Vaccines\n\nVaccines already in use for other diseases that may also protect against Covid-19.\n\nPHASE 3\n\n\n\nThe Bacillus Calmette-Guerin vaccine was developed in the early 1900s as a protection against tuberculosis. The Murdoch Childrens Research Institute in Australia is conducting a Phase 3 trial, and several other trials are underway to see if the vaccine partly protects against the coronavirus.\n\n\n\n\n\nNote: Vaccines will be added to the tracker when they reach Phase 1, and tracked until they succeed or fail. Did we miss something? To notify The Times of new developments, send updates to vaccinetracker@nytimes.com.\n\nTracking the Coronavirus\n\n\n\n\n\n\n\nAdditional reporting by Carlos Tejada and Li Cao.\n\nNote: Early versions of the tracker combined two vaccines by Sinopharm into one entry. Subsequent reporting confirmed they are two different vaccines.\n\nSources: World Health Organization, National Institute of Allergy and Infectious Diseases, National Center for Biotechnology Information, New England Journal of Medicine'

Mr. Trump would avoid such steps until March.\n\nDespite Mr. Trumps denial weeks later, he was told at the time about a Jan. 29 memo produced by his trade adviser, Peter Navarro, laying out in striking detail the potential risks of a coronavirus pandemic: as many as half a million deaths and trillions of dollars in economic losses.\n\nThe health and human services secretary, Alex M. Azar II, directly warned Mr. Trump of the possibility of a pandemic during a call on Jan. 30, the second warning he delivered to the president about the virus in two weeks. The president, who was on Air Force One while traveling for appearances in the Midwest, responded that Mr. Azar was being alarmist.\n\nMr. Azar publicly announced in February that the government was establishing a surveillance system in five American cities to measure the spread of the virus and enable experts to project the next hot spots. It was delayed for weeks. The slow start of that plan, on top of the well-documented failures to develop the nations testing capacity, left administration officials with almost no insight into how rapidly the virus was spreading. We were flying the plane with no instruments, one official said.\n\nBy the third week in February, the administrations top public health experts concluded they should recommend to Mr. Trump a new approach that would include warning the American people of the risks and urging steps like social distancing and staying home from work. But the White House focused instead on messaging and crucial additional weeks went by before their views were reluctantly accepted by the president  time when the virus spread largely unimpeded.\n\nWhen Mr. Trump finally agreed in mid-March to recommend social distancing across the country, effectively bringing much of the economy to a halt, he seemed shellshocked and deflated to some of his closest associates. One described him as subdued and baffled by how the crisis had played out. An economy that he had wagered his re-election on was suddenly in shambles.\n\nHe only regained his swagger, the associate said, from conducting his daily White House briefings, at which he often seeks to rewrite the history of the past several months. He declared at one point that he felt it was a pandemic long before it was called a pandemic, and insisted at another that he had to be a cheerleader for the country, as if that explained why he failed to prepare the public for what was coming.\n\nMr. Trumps allies and some administration officials say the criticism has been unfair. The Chinese government misled other governments, they say. And they insist that the president was either not getting proper information, or the people around him werent conveying the urgency of the threat. In some cases, they argue, the specific officials he was hearing from had been discredited in his eyes, but once the right information got to him through other channels, he made the right calls.\n\nWhile the media and Democrats refused to seriously acknowledge this virus in January and February, President Trump took bold action to protect Americans and unleash the full power of the federal government to curb the spread of the virus, expand testing capacities and expedite vaccine development even when we had no true idea the level of transmission or asymptomatic spread, said Judd Deere, a White House spokesman.\n\nThere were key turning points along the way, opportunities for Mr. Trump to get ahead of the virus rather than just chase it. There were internal debates that presented him with stark choices, and moments when he could have chosen to ask deeper questions and learn more. How he handled them may shape his re-election campaign. They will certainly shape his legacy.\n\nThe Containment Illusion\n\nBy the last week of February, it was clear to the administrations public health team that schools and businesses in hot spots would have to close. But in the turbulence of the Trump White House, it took three more weeks to persuade the president that failure to act quickly to control the spread of the virus would have dire consequences.'	b'He Could Have Seen What Was Coming: Behind Trumps Failure on the Virus'	2020-04-11	[b'Eric Lipton', b'David E.

At this same time, daily Covid-19 fatalities decreased slightly, leading President Trump to proclaim that deaths were way down.

Treatment has improved and young people, who are less likely to die from Covid-19, make up a larger share of new cases.\n\nAdditionally, more widespread testing means cases are caught sooner, on average. That means that the lag between diagnosis and death would be longer than in March, when tests were in critically short supply.\n\nThat lag may have come to an end last week, as the number of new deaths began to rise.

Most of the states seeing the sharpest increase in deaths also have some of the countrys highest positive test rates, as well as soaring hospitalization rates, an indicator that many more residents may be gravely ill.\n\nIn addition, a high share of positive tests most likely signals that there are a larger number of people whose infections are going undetected in a states official numbers.\n\nHow the number of deaths per day has changed since June 1 Daily deaths\n\nper million per 1M Change Change hospitalized\n\nper million per 1M Positive\n\ntest rate Arizona 9.6 +319% 500 25% Texas 3.3 +307% 380 16% Oregon 0.8 +267% 60 6% Tennessee 2 +252% 190 8% Idaho 1.1 +225% 80 13% Florida 4.4 +204% 400 19% Nevada 3.1 +163% 360 14% Utah 1.5 +113% 80 9% Alabama 4.5 +91% 280 16% South Carolina 3.3 +90% 310 18% Arkansas 1.4 +88% 150 11% Washington 1.8 +60% 50 6% California 2.4 +38% 210 7% Oklahoma 0.9 +19% 140 9% Louisiana 3.7 +10% 290 10% South Dakota 2.1 +8% 70 7% Kansas 0.8 +6%  11% Mississippi 4.9 -2% 370 17% North Carolina 1.8 -10% 110 7% Kentucky 1.1 -19% 100 6% New Mexico 2 -29% 80 4% Georgia 2.2 -33% 270 15% Missouri 1.2 -43% 140 6% Virginia 1.5 -53% 130 6% Nebraska 0.8 -61% 60 6% Iowa 1.7 -61% 60 9% Ohio 1 -62% 90 6% New Jersey 3.4 -63% 100 1% Maine 0.4 -64% 10 1% Pennsylvania 1.6 -65% 50 5% Indiana 1.1 -66% 130 8% Colorado 1 -70% 70 6% New York 1.2 -73% 40 1% Maryland 1.6 -74% 70 5% Washington, D.C. 1.5 -75% 140 2% Michigan 1 -76% 50 3% New Hampshire 0.9 -77% 20 2% Illinois 1.3 -78% 110 3% Minnesota 0.9 -79% 50 4% Wisconsin 0.4 -80% 50 7% Massachusetts 2.6 -80% 80 2% Delaware 0.9 -83% 50 5% Connecticut 1.5 -83% 20 1% Rhode Island 2.2 -86% 60 3% Sources: New York Times database from state and local governments; the Covid-19 Tracking Project\n\nNote: Data is as of July 15, 2020.

Most of the states seeing the sharpest increase in deaths also have some of the countrys highest positive test rates, as well as soaring hospitalization rates, an indicator that many more residents may be gravely ill.\n\nIn addition, a high share of positive tests most likely signals that there are a larger number of people whose infections are going undetected in a states official numbers.\n\nHow the number of deaths per day has changed since June 1 Daily deaths\n\nper million per 1M Change Change hospitalized\n\nper million per 1M Positive\n\ntest rate Arizona 9.6 +319% 500 25% Texas 3.3 +307% 380 16% Oregon 0.8 +267% 60 6% Tennessee 2 +252% 190 8% Idaho 1.1 +225% 80 13% Florida 4.4 +204% 400 19% Nevada 3.1 +163% 360 14% Utah 1.5 +113% 80 9% Alabama 4.5 +91% 280 16% South Carolina 3.3 +90% 310 18% Arkansas 1.4 +88% 150 11% Washington 1.8 +60% 50 6% California 2.4 +38% 210 7% Oklahoma 0.9 +19% 140 9% Louisiana 3.7 +10% 290 10% South Dakota 2.1 +8% 70 7% Kansas 0.8 +6%  11% Mississippi 4.9 -2% 370 17% North Carolina 1.8 -10% 110 7% Kentucky 1.1 -19% 100 6% New Mexico 2 -29% 80 4% Georgia 2.2 -33% 270 15% Missouri 1.2 -43% 140 6% Virginia 1.5 -53% 130 6% Nebraska 0.8 -61% 60 6% Iowa 1.7 -61% 60 9% Ohio 1 -62% 90 6% New Jersey 3.4 -63% 100 1% Maine 0.4 -64% 10 1% Pennsylvania 1.6 -65% 50 5% Indiana 1.1 -66% 130 8% Colorado 1 -70% 70 6% New York 1.2 -73% 40 1% Maryland 1.6 -74% 70 5% Washington, D.C. 1.5 -75% 140 2% Michigan 1 -76% 50 3% New Hampshire 0.9 -77% 20 2% Illinois 1.3 -78% 110 3% Minnesota 0.9 -79% 50 4% Wisconsin 0.4 -80% 50 7% Massachusetts 2.6 -80% 80 2% Delaware 0.9 -83% 50 5% Connecticut 1.5 -83% 20 1% Rhode Island 2.2 -86% 60 3% Sources: New York Times database from state and local governments; the Covid-19 Tracking Project\n\nNote: Data is as of July 15, 2020.

Liberals, for instance, often express more concern about health care, whereas conservatives generally pay more attention to foreign affairs. Among ambivalent swing voters, it is often candidates personalities  whether they are perceived as relatable, trustworthy, evenhanded and so on  that make a difference.\n\nBut this years presidential race may be an anomaly. With the response to the pandemic taking center stage, issues like health care, the economy and voting rights are likely to be viewed through the lens of the virus. So how the president handles the response  and how his presumptive opponent, former Vice President Joseph R. Biden Jr., proposes to confront the outbreak  could become a kind of omni-issue.\n\nAt his daily news conferences, and in frequent tweets about the virus, Mr. Trump has sought to project authority as the nation weathers the storm. But he has hardly let up on his habit of lashing out at political opponents, and he has refused to take responsibility for things like shortages of test kits and medical supplies, which many governors say they need.\n\nMost Americans are not convinced of the presidents position. Roughly seven in 10 said the federal government should be doing more to address shortages in personal protective equipment and medical devices, the CNN poll found. And by a 14-percentage-point margin, most respondents to that survey said the federal government had done a bad job of preventing the viruss spread. (That is a significant change since last month, when back-to-back CNN polls found the public more split on the question.)\n\nAs the pandemic has worsened nationwide, Americans have expressed widespread approval of their own governors (72 percent, according to a Monmouth University poll released this week) and of federal health agencies (66 percent, per the Monmouth poll). This bucks the trend in recent years of waning faith in American institutions.\n\nBut Mr. Trump has never shed his public persona as an anti-establishment firebrand. Throughout the crisis he has criticized everyone from nonpartisan inspectors general to popular state governors. So the president will need to contend with Americans belief in core institutions  which Mr. Biden has consistently echoed  alongside their wavering confidence in Mr. Trump himself.\n\nHe likes to say, Well, the governors messed up, and China lied to me, and all this other stuff, Bob Shrum, the director of the Center for the Political Future at the University of Southern California, said in an interview.

This bucks the trend in recent years of waning faith in American institutions.\n\nBut Mr. Trump has never shed his public persona as an anti-establishment firebrand. Throughout the crisis he has criticized everyone from nonpartisan inspectors general to popular state governors. So the president will need to contend with Americans belief in core institutions  which Mr. Biden has consistently echoed  alongside their wavering confidence in Mr. Trump himself.\n\nHe likes to say, Well, the governors messed up, and China lied to me, and all this other stuff, Bob Shrum, the director of the Center for the Political Future at the University of Southern California, said in an interview. I think its a little like Herbert Hoover saying, The Great Depression, you know, thats really a world problem. Peoples reaction was: Well, wait. Youre the president of the United States. Fix it.'

Its just sensationalist click bait.\n\nIn the early weeks of the pandemic, some people in China, Japan and South Korea tested positive twice, sparking similar fears.\n\nSouth Koreas Centers for Disease Control and Prevention investigated 285 of those cases, and found that several of the second positives came two months after the first, and in one case 82 days later. Nearly half of the people had symptoms at the second test. But the researchers were unable to grow live virus from any of the samples, and the infected people hadnt spread the virus to others.'

Dr. Scott Boyd and his team developed this test, and now theyre ramping up quickly. Theyve just received a new shipment of robots called ELISA Instruments. Soon, the team hopes to process at least 4,000 samples a day. They use controls to validate their tests, so they know it works. The positive controls are from coronavirus patients at Stanford, and the negative are from healthy blood donors, taken before coronavirus jumped to humans. Out of 200 people, the results for a few may be inaccurate. But this kind of test is among the best we have. You can see the controls here in the left column of each assay plate. Once the plate finishes processing, you can see a yellow color in the patient samples that have antibodies. The darker the color, the more antibodies there are. But just measuring the total quantity doesnt tell you all the information youd like to know. The question is, does somebody likely have immunity. The answers are not yet as clear. Only some antibodies actually fight or neutralize the virus. So the next step for researchers is to identify those ones. Then, how much of those neutralizing antibodies are needed to block the virus and prevent re infection? So were also now working on developing a neutralizing anybody test that would allow us to test a lot of patients in the hospital, and also health care workers. That neutralizing antibody test, which Dr. Boyd hopes to have ready by the end of May, will give a better sense of who is actually immune. Remember Heidi from earlier? Well, we watched her sample go through the process. Coronavirus. And now her results are in. Not detected. All right, so what did the results say? Negative. Negative COVID and negative serology, unfortunately. But its a good thing, right? It can still be good. Todays really my only safe day, because I go back to work tomorrow.

Hawaii 2nd round data through May 1  Source: Small Business Administration\n\nThe countrys largest banks are often heavy lenders to small businesses, but during the first of the programs two rounds, community banks and regional institutions did most of the lending, according to an analysis by a group of University of Chicago and M.I.T. economists.\n\nThat contributed to a disproportionately large share of loans going to areas that were not as hard-hit by the virus.\n\nBusinesses in Iowa, Nebraska and North Dakota were among the biggest beneficiaries of the early aid when accounting for the number of people working for small businesses in each state, a Times analysis shows. All three states are below the national median for cases of the virus per capita, and none imposed statewide lockdowns as the outbreak began to spread nationwide.\n\nOne reason for the uneven distribution is because big banks were slow to lend when the program first began, in part because of bureaucratic delays, and they imposed rules that blocked many people seeking help. The 20 largest banks accounted for 41 percent of small-business lending throughout the country before the pandemic, but issued only 20 percent of the first-round loans, the Chicago and M.I.T. economists found.\n\nSince then, big banks made vastly more loans. Businesses in harder-hit states like California and New York have claimed a larger share of the money so far in the second round, which started in late April after Congress approved a fresh round of funds when money quickly ran out during the initial wave.\n\nMany small loans were recently issued, but loans worth more than $1 million made up a large share of the early money handed out.\n\n1st round Size of loans 70% Share of loans in the round UP TO $150,000 15% Number of loans 15% $150,000 TO $350,000 Value of total loans 14% 10% $350,000 TO $1 MILLION 24% 5% OVER $1 MILLION 47% 2nd round 90% UP TO $150,000 37% 6% $150,000 TO $350,000 17% 3% $350,000 TO $1 MILLION 19% 1% OVER $1 MILLION 27% 1st round Size of loans 70% Share of loans in the round UP TO $150,000 15% 15% $150,000 TO $350,000 Number of loans 14% Value of total loans 10% $350,000 TO $1 MILLION 24% 5% OVER $1 MILLION 47% 2nd round 90% UP TO $150,000 37% 6% $150,000 TO $350,000 17% 3% $350,000 TO $1 MILLION 19% 1% OVER $1 MILLION 27% 2nd round data through May 1  Source: Small Business Administration\n\nLoans of more than $1 million made up just 5 percent of those approved in the first round, but they accounted for roughly half of the overall money. That favored large companies seeking greater sums.\n\nMany of those companies already had deep relationships with their banks, which helped them get to the front of the line, and some banks prioritized their most lucrative customers. More than 300 public companies disclosed receiving the loans, though many have since returned the money after a growing backlash.\n\nScrutiny over the program prompted officials to impose new eligibility rules for companies. Lending has since shifted toward smaller amounts, suggesting smaller businesses were benefiting from the assistance. In the first round, the average loan size was $206,000, according to the S.B.A. After one week of the second round, it was $79,000.\n\nSmall businesses employ roughly half of the countrys nongovernment workers, and most have under 100 employees.\n\nShare of U.S. employment by company size NUMBER OF EMPLOYEES: 1-4 5% 5-9 5% 10 - 19 7% Small businesses 52% 20 - 49 10% 50 - 99 8% 100 - 249 10% 250 - 499 7% 500 - 999 7% Large businesses 48% 1,000 or more 41% Share of U.S. employment by company size NUMBER OF EMPLOYEES: 100- 249 250- 499 500- 999 1-4 5-9 10-19 20-49 50-99 1,000 or more 7% 41% 5% 5% 7% 10% 8% 10% 7% Large businesses Small businesses 48% 52% Share of U.S. employment by company size NUMBER OF EMPLOYEES: 1-4 5-9 10-19 20-49 50-99 100-249 250-499 500-999 1,000 or more 5% 5% 7% 10% 8% 10% 7% 7% 41% Large businesses Small businesses 48% 52% Figures are as of the first quarter of 2019 and are not seasonally adjusted.

Hawaii 2nd round data through May 1  Source: Small Business Administration\n\nThe countrys largest banks are often heavy lenders to small businesses, but during the first of the programs two rounds, community banks and regional institutions did most of the lending, according to an analysis by a group of University of Chicago and M.I.T. economists.\n\nThat contributed to a disproportionately large share of loans going to areas that were not as hard-hit by the virus.\n\nBusinesses in Iowa, Nebraska and North Dakota were among the biggest beneficiaries of the early aid when accounting for the number of people working for small businesses in each state, a Times analysis shows. All three states are below the national median for cases of the virus per capita, and none imposed statewide lockdowns as the outbreak began to spread nationwide.\n\nOne reason for the uneven distribution is because big banks were slow to lend when the program first began, in part because of bureaucratic delays, and they imposed rules that blocked many people seeking help. The 20 largest banks accounted for 41 percent of small-business lending throughout the country before the pandemic, but issued only 20 percent of the first-round loans, the Chicago and M.I.T. economists found.\n\nSince then, big banks made vastly more loans. Businesses in harder-hit states like California and New York have claimed a larger share of the money so far in the second round, which started in late April after Congress approved a fresh round of funds when money quickly ran out during the initial wave.\n\nMany small loans were recently issued, but loans worth more than $1 million made up a large share of the early money handed out.\n\n1st round Size of loans 70% Share of loans in the round UP TO $150,000 15% Number of loans 15% $150,000 TO $350,000 Value of total loans 14% 10% $350,000 TO $1 MILLION 24% 5% OVER $1 MILLION 47% 2nd round 90% UP TO $150,000 37% 6% $150,000 TO $350,000 17% 3% $350,000 TO $1 MILLION 19% 1% OVER $1 MILLION 27% 1st round Size of loans 70% Share of loans in the round UP TO $150,000 15% 15% $150,000 TO $350,000 Number of loans 14% Value of total loans 10% $350,000 TO $1 MILLION 24% 5% OVER $1 MILLION 47% 2nd round 90% UP TO $150,000 37% 6% $150,000 TO $350,000 17% 3% $350,000 TO $1 MILLION 19% 1% OVER $1 MILLION 27% 2nd round data through May 1  Source: Small Business Administration\n\nLoans of more than $1 million made up just 5 percent of those approved in the first round, but they accounted for roughly half of the overall money. That favored large companies seeking greater sums.\n\nMany of those companies already had deep relationships with their banks, which helped them get to the front of the line, and some banks prioritized their most lucrative customers. More than 300 public companies disclosed receiving the loans, though many have since returned the money after a growing backlash.\n\nScrutiny over the program prompted officials to impose new eligibility rules for companies. Lending has since shifted toward smaller amounts, suggesting smaller businesses were benefiting from the assistance. In the first round, the average loan size was $206,000, according to the S.B.A. After one week of the second round, it was $79,000.\n\nSmall businesses employ roughly half of the countrys nongovernment workers, and most have under 100 employees.\n\nShare of U.S. employment by company size NUMBER OF EMPLOYEES: 1-4 5% 5-9 5% 10 - 19 7% Small businesses 52% 20 - 49 10% 50 - 99 8% 100 - 249 10% 250 - 499 7% 500 - 999 7% Large businesses 48% 1,000 or more 41% Share of U.S. employment by company size NUMBER OF EMPLOYEES: 100- 249 250- 499 500- 999 1-4 5-9 10-19 20-49 50-99 1,000 or more 7% 41% 5% 5% 7% 10% 8% 10% 7% Large businesses Small businesses 48% 52% Share of U.S. employment by company size NUMBER OF EMPLOYEES: 1-4 5-9 10-19 20-49 50-99 100-249 250-499 500-999 1,000 or more 5% 5% 7% 10% 8% 10% 7% 7% 41% Large businesses Small businesses 48% 52% Figures are as of the first quarter of 2019 and are not seasonally adjusted.

Biden Jr. make their decision in November.\n\nBefore the coronavirus crisis consumed his White House, his 2016 rallying cry of build the wall still echoed in his re-election campaign. Construction of a wall along the countrys southern border, intended to halt the flow of undocumented immigrants into the country, has been slow going, but an immigration crackdown has remained one of the policy issues that enlivens his base. Mr. Trump has even tried to use immigration as a way to change the subject from criticism of his administrations handling of the pandemic.\n\nMr. Trump has also made eliminating federal regulations a priority, with a focus on dismantling Obama-era environmental regulations.

Construction of a wall along the countrys southern border, intended to halt the flow of undocumented immigrants into the country, has been slow going, but an immigration crackdown has remained one of the policy issues that enlivens his base. Mr. Trump has even tried to use immigration as a way to change the subject from criticism of his administrations handling of the pandemic.\n\nMr. Trump has also made eliminating federal regulations a priority, with a focus on dismantling Obama-era environmental regulations.

But their collective opposition, or even resounding silence, could offer something of a permission structure for Trump-skeptical Republicans to put party loyalty aside.\n\nJohn Kelly, Mr. Trumps former chief of staff and a retired Marine general, would not say whom he would vote for, though he did allow that he wished we had some additional choices.\n\nDan Coats, the former Republican senator who was Mr. Trumps director of national intelligence, has been concerned about the negative effect on the intelligence community by the turmoil of turnover at D.N.I., said Kevin Kellems, a longtime adviser to Mr. Coats, adding that the former spy chief is encouraged by the confirmation of a new D.N.I. and career intelligence deputy.\n\nAs for whom Mr. Coats will vote for, ultimately he remains a loyal Republican but he believes the American people will decide on Nov. 3, said Mr. Kellems.\n\n\n\nJoseph Maguire, a retired three-star admiral who served as Mr. Trumps acting intelligence chief, invoked the comments of Mr. Mattis and two former chairmen of the Joint Chiefs of Staff who also criticized the president this week.\n\n\n\nJim Mattis, Mike Mullen and Marty Dempsey are all good friends, and I respect them tremendously, Admiral Maguire said in an interview. I am in alignment with their views.\n\nAsked who Mr. Boehner and Mr. Ryan will vote for in November, representatives to both former House speakers declined to say.\n\nFormer Secretary of State Condoleezza Rice, asked if she would support Mr. Trump for re-election, said on CBSs Face the Nation that she didnt want to discuss politics right now, adding that her focus was on addressing divisions in the country. She did not support Mr. Trump in 2016.'

This is The Daily. Today: This falls presidential race is likely to be decided by a handful of battleground states won by President Trump in 2016. Nate Cohn on what a major new poll from The New York Times found about how voters in those states view the president and his Democratic rival. Its Thursday, June 25. Nate, the last time we talked about polling in the presidential race, it was still the Democratic primary. It was back in November. And the polling that you all did showed that no matter which Democrat Donald Trump would face, he was doing OK.\n\nnate cohn\n\nYeah. The polls showed that Donald Trump was pretty competitive. He was in a close race against all of his major Democratic rivals. He wasnt always ahead. He was losing to Joe Biden, for instance. But he was in a pretty good and highly competitive spot, even at a moment where he was facing imminent prospect of impeachment in the House of Representatives. And so after all of that, for him still to be so close, it sure seemed like he was in a pretty decent position, all considered.\n\nmichael barbaro\n\nSo what was your thinking going into this next big poll that you all just finished?\n\nnate cohn\n\nWell, I did not think that Donald Trump would be doing quite as well as he had done in October. And there have been a lot of polls over the last couple of months indicating that Joe Biden has had a gradually building lead, both nationwide and in the battleground states. But given that we had such good results for the president in the past, I thought there was a pretty distinct possibility that we would show a race that was, you know, even if not extremely close, still competitive.\n\nmichael barbaro\n\nAnd what happened once this polling got underway?\n\nnate cohn\n\nWell, we get the results back every morning from the last night of interviews. And from the start, it was pretty clear that this was a very different set of polling data. The first mornings numbers were really bad for Trump. And you know, its something you try not to pay any attention to. Its just one day of interviews, and the numbers change a lot. But you know, the next morning, and the next morning after that, it was bad again. And in the end, we polled for 14 days. And for all 14, the numbers were bad for the president. And they never got better.\n\nmichael barbaro\n\nAnd just how bad?\n\nnate cohn\n\nReally bad. We did seven different polls. We have a national survey that showed Joe Biden leading by 14 points, 50 to 36 percent.\n\nmichael barbaro\n\nWow.\n\nnate cohn\n\nWe have six battleground state polls. These are the six states that Donald Trump won in 2016, but that were most closely fought last time  Pennsylvania, Michigan, Wisconsin, Florida, Arizona and North Carolina. And here again, Joe Biden had a considerable lead. He was up 9 percentage points across those six states, including a lead of at least six points in every one of them.\n\nmichael barbaro\n\nWow. So that is legitimately, seriously bad polling data for the incumbent President, Donald Trump?\n\nnate cohn\n\nYeah. I mean, if you look back historically, it is really hard to find an example of an incumbent president sitting in such a bad position heading into re-election. Its worse than Jimmy Carter in 1980 at this stage, or even in the final polls, for instance.\n\nmichael barbaro\n\nHuh.\n\nnate cohn\n\nTheres just not much for the president to hang his hat on here.\n\nmichael barbaro\n\nSo lets talk about what the battleground state polls show, specifically about why voters seem to be souring on President Trump. Whats the story that the data from these battleground state polls tell you about why that is?\n\nnate cohn\n\nThe polls tell a really simple story. They say that voters across the battleground states have concluded that the president has failed to meet the most important crises of our political moment. They think hes failed on the coronavirus. They think hes failed on race relations. And they think hes failed in the protests, and so on. And as a result, there has been a rebellion among white voters in the battleground states, the very voters that four years ago were responsible for the presidents persistent strength in these states.\n\nmichael barbaro\n\nSo before we get to the revolt of these white voters, which seems very important, lets talk about these issues that voters do not think the president has properly managed and maybe go through a few of them, one by one.\n\nnate cohn\n\nI think its worth just breaking them down into two groups. One is the coronavirus. Voters disapprove of the way hes handled it by a wide margin. 56 percent of voters in the battleground states say they disapprove, includes a significant number of people who voted for him in 2016. And its not just that they take issue with the presidents effectiveness. Theres an underlying disagreement between the president and the electorate about priorities.\n\nmichael barbaro\n\nWhat do you mean?\n\nnate cohn\n\nSo we asked voters whether they thought the federal governments priority should be to limit the spread of the coronavirus, even if it hurts the economy. Or if they think the federal governments priority should be to restart the economy, even if it increases the risk to public health. And voters in the battleground states said, by a 20-plus point margin, that they thought the priority ought to be to limit the spread of the coronavirus. And incredibly, that even includes the people who have lost their jobs as a result of the coronavirus over the last few months.\n\nmichael barbaro\n\nI want to pause on this. Because this seems really fascinating. By 20 percent, voters favor conquering the virus over reopening the American economy. Because that is the complete opposite of the message from the president.\n\nnate cohn\n\nIts the complete opposite. And it really goes against so much of what we usually assume about American politics, right? Its the economy, stupid. But here we have a rare issue where voters very explicitly are prioritizing something else. I cant think of another comparison for it except war.\n\nmichael barbaro\n\nHm.\n\nnate cohn\n\nYou know? In World War II, its not like if you had asked voters, what should be the priority, you know, helping the economy or beating the Japanese, that they would be like, oh, its the economy, stupid.\n\nmichael barbaro\n\nRight. Youre saying with lives on the line, voters are telling us in this poll that the economy takes something of a backseat.\n\nnate cohn\n\nThats right.\n\nmichael barbaro\n\nWhat seems interesting is that the president is banking on an economic recovery, or goodwill over his management of the economy prior to the pandemic, to win re-election. But it sounds like from what youre saying, that wouldnt necessarily give him a boost, because voters are not prioritizing the economy the way they usually do.\n\nnate cohn\n\nYeah. I mean, hes right to think thats his advantage. I mean, astonishingly, given the overall economic numbers, voters in the battleground states say they approve of the presidents handling of the economy, by a 15-point margin. Thats a \n\nmichael barbaro\n\nWow.\n\nnate cohn\n\n what, 30 points different than his overall approval rating? And the reason for that disconnect is just fundamental and simple. The coronavirus is more important. And they may appreciate what hes done on the economy. But in this case, emphasizing the economy isnt what theyre looking for.\n\nmichael barbaro\n\nSo what about the second big issue that you said voters disapprove of the presidents management of, which is race and the protests over race and policing?\n\nnate cohn\n\nRight. Just a whole spectrum of different issues relating to race and criminal justice and the protests, the presidents ratings are even worse on those issues than they are on the coronavirus. And here again, the president has this fundamental disconnect with the electorate, where his priorities arent the same as theirs. I mean, we asked whether they would rather have a candidate who says that we need to be tough on protests that go too far, or whether they would rather have a candidate who says we need to focus on the cause of protests, even when they go too far. And voters said, by a 40-point margin, that they would rather have the candidate who focuses on the cause of the protests, even when theyre going too far. And its also including a significant number of people who backed the president.\n\nmichael barbaro\n\nSo the gulf between how the president is talking about these protests and how voters across the battleground states are thinking about these protests is enormous.\n\nnate cohn\n\nYeah. And I wouldnt have guessed that, personally.\n\nmichael barbaro\n\nSo Nate, how does this disapproval of how the presidents handling these major crises, how does that explain this concept you touched on earlier of white voters revolting against the President?\n\nnate cohn\n\nWell, a pretty significant number of white voters in the battleground states do not side with the president, either his handling of the coronavirus or on these racial issues. And these are now the issues that are most important in the minds of voters in the battleground states. And so while maybe in 2016, a lot of these voters were focused on who would do the best on trade or immigration, now whats on their mind is who is the best job handling protests and coronavirus. Theyre not so sure they want to vote for the President anymore. In our poll, nearly 15 percent of the people who say they voted for President Trump in 2016 arent willing to say they support him against Joe Biden. And 7 percent of those voters say theres almost no chance theyll vote for him again.\n\nmichael barbaro\n\nSo 7 percent of his base plans on flipping, and 15 percent is very open to flipping, because of the way he has handled all of these complex questions over the past few months or year?\n\nnate cohn\n\nYeah. And I should note they may not necessarily flip. They could vote third party. They could stay home. They have other options here. But a meaningful number of them at the moment say they would back Joe Biden for president.\n\nmichael barbaro\n\nWow.\n\nnate cohn\n\nSo at the moment, the presidents coalition, this core base of support among white voters that got him to victory in 2016, just is not there for him anymore. It has suffered serious defections, mainly at its periphery, you know, not the people wearing MAGA hats. But the sort of people who voted for Obama in 2012, backed Donald Trump in 2016 because they liked what he had to say about illegal immigration and trade, are not putting up with him right now.\n\nmichael barbaro\n\nAnd who is this voter, this white voter who is now turning on the president four years later?\n\nnate cohn\n\nIts a pretty broad group of white voters. It includes college-educated white voters. It includes white voters without a college degree. It includes young voters. Young white voters now back Joe Biden by 20 points.\n\nmichael barbaro\n\nWow.\n\nnate cohn\n\nIt includes older white voters. At the moment, the president is losing among seniors, who were the bedrock of his support in 2016.\n\nmichael barbaro\n\nWow. You know, Nate, Im curious if theres a prototypical swing state region that you think of as being illustrative of everything that youre describing here, this alienation, this disapproval of the way the president is handling everything since we last polled these battleground states.\n\nnate cohn\n\nWell, I could indulge you on that question. I could tell you about how in the Green Bay region of Wisconsin or in Northeast Pennsylvania or something that Joe Biden is now ahead, and Donald Trump won there big in 2016. But you know, frankly, its true everywhere. There are no exceptions here. Theres no place where the presidents holding up fairly well and I can be like, thats the place where its particularly bad. Theres no region that epitomizes this more than any other. I could choose anywhere and tell you that the president appears to be losing ground among white voters. Its true in the battleground states. Its true nationally. Its true everywhere.\n\nmichael barbaro\n\nWell be right back. OK. Nate, lets talk about what these polls, both the national poll, but especially the six battleground state polls, have told us about Joe Biden and why he seems to be leading so handsomely over Donald Trump.\n\nnate cohn\n\nYou know, my honest answer is that I think our answers on Joe Biden are kind of boring.\n\nmichael barbaro\n\nBoring how?\n\nnate cohn\n\nYou know, the voters, they like Joe Biden. Hes got a 50 percent favorability rating. Its fine. They dont seem to have a very strong opinion of him either way. They do think he would do a better job than Trump on almost every issue, except the economy and China. But theres not a groundswelling of support for him. And theres not particularly deep opposition to him either. Instead, 55 percent of voters say there is at least some chance they would vote for him. So that to me indicates that a pretty broad swath of the electorate is at least considering the guy at this stage.\n\nmichael barbaro\n\nHm. And what youre describing is an alternative, rather than a charismatic figure that voters are looking to with great ardor.\n\nnate cohn\n\nI think thats right. A lot of the divides that you might think about in American politics today, like between young and old, and so on. They dont really even exist on Joe Biden. Everyone just kind of has a modestly favorable view of him. And there are many circumstances in which maybe thats not the exact candidate youd want to run for president. But it may be exactly the right candidate at a time when a clear majority of the electorate has resolved that it does not want to reelect the current president.\n\nmichael barbaro\n\nNate, youre painting a scenario in which Joe Biden seems to be thriving as a reflection of President Trumps weakness. And thats a familiar concept in presidential campaigns. But I went through the battleground state poll that you sent me about 24 hours ago. And I was really struck by the number of issues on which respondents to the poll said they thought that Joe Biden would do a better job than President Trump. It was immigration. It was protests. It was the pandemic. And so how do we know whether that is a reflection of President Trump, or a true sense that people believe Joe Biden is inherently the best person to do those things?\n\nnate cohn\n\nYou know, its a great question. Unfortunately, the way that weve asked this question to voters, I dont think we can disentangle whether they think Joe Biden would be good versus believing that Donald Trump is bad. Were just asking voters whether they think Joe Biden would do a better job than Donald Trump. And so I dont think we can pull out the varying effects of Joe Biden and Donald Trump on that. I do think, though, that one thing that stands out to me is how much the results of those questions matches up with Trumps approval rating on those issues, which at least to me implies that its more about the president than it is about Joe Biden.\n\nmichael barbaro\n\nHm. In other words, disapproval of the president is kind of mirrored in the data of approval or the belief that Joe Biden would do something better?\n\nnate cohn\n\nThats right.\n\nmichael barbaro\n\nThis data clearly suggests theres not a tremendous amount of passion around Joe Biden. And yet, hes developed this very significant lead over President Trump. And so I wonder whether that means that the electability case for Joe Biden, which was debated endlessly throughout the primary, has kind of proven to be exactly what Joe Biden and the people around him said it would be now that theres a two person race, Biden versus Trump.\n\nnate cohn\n\nWell, I dont think we can run the counterfactual and see whether Elizabeth Warren would be leading today if she had been the Democratic nominee or Bernie Sanders. What I think we can say is that the case for Joe Bidens electability is playing out here. The case for Joe Bidens electability was always that a sufficient number of voters do not want to re-elect the president, so choose someone who maximizes the appeal of the Democratic candidate with the broadest number of voters. I dont know whether that means that a different candidate would be doing better or worse than Joe Biden. But what we do know is that Joe Biden is up nine points across battleground states that voted for Trump last time. Hes up 14 points nationwide. And he would have a distinct chance of winning by the widest margin of any candidate in my lifetime.\n\nmichael barbaro\n\nWell, Nate, that leads me to a very important and delicate question that involves you and me. Because four years ago, we were having a conversation about polling. And Donald Trump was down in those polls. I was the host of a different show called The Run Up. You were the first guest on the first episode. And the title of that episode was, Could Hillary Clinton Win in a Landslide? So I think you know where this question is now headed.\n\nnate cohn\n\nHow could I not?\n\nmichael barbaro\n\nSo what is different about this lead, if anything, that makes you and should make us trust it?\n\nnate cohn\n\nWell, I think we should all approach this with a lot of humility. I mean, polling is tough the day before the election. Its really tough five months before the election. The national environment has changed a lot in the last five months. It can change a lot in the next five months. That said, I think that this lead is different from Hillary Clintons lead. It doesnt mean that Donald Trump cant win. But it is different. Its different in two ways. One, its a wider lead. Joe Biden is up by more. If the polls were just as wrong as they were in 2016, and the election were held tomorrow, Joe Biden would still win. I mean, the polls could be more wrong. Theres no law of polling that says that 2016 is the worst case scenario or something. But this is a bigger advantage than Hillary Clinton had down the final stretch. Its a more persistent advantage. And its wider than even her peaks. The second difference is a methodological one, which is that we are much more focused on the battleground states this time than we were in 2016. In 2016, we had really good national polling. And we did not have very much good polling in the battleground states. We have resolved to flip that around, to try and deal with the things that went wrong four years ago. None of that ensures that our results will be perfect if the election were held tomorrow. But it is a reason why it is less likely that these polls would be fundamentally wrong in the same way that so many state polls were fundamentally wrong four years ago.\n\nmichael barbaro\n\nA key caveat, however, seems to be that the lead that Joe Biden has developed over these past few months has occurred when he has been largely invisible. Right? I mean, this has been a very unusual campaign in the sense that the President is as visible as hes ever been, every day  at the White House, on Twitter and now campaign rallies. Whereas Joe Biden has been largely quarantined and kind of offstage. Inevitably, that will change. And I wonder how much that could begin to alter some of the dynamics of these polls.\n\nnate cohn\n\nI think that it absolutely could begin to help narrow the race. And this was the pattern in 2016, by the way. There were these moments of the race when the talk was always about Donald Trump. And he would get in these fights. The news would be all about how Donald Trump said this ridiculous stuff. All these Republicans would be criticizing him. And then Hillary Clinton would have this lead. And then two weeks later, something would happen, when it was her emails, or the deplorables line, or random health scares, and so on. And Hillary Clintons lead would fall right back down to a more competitive race. And I think it is certainly possible that if voters focus as much on Joe Biden at any point in this election cycle as they focused on Hillary Clinton, that would probably lead to a tighter race than the one we have now.\n\n[music]\n\nmichael barbaro\n\nPerhaps put more simply, what youre saying is that campaigning in absentia, essentially, is working for Joe Biden. And its working pretty well.\n\nnate cohn\n\nAbsolutely. I mean, the fundamentals of the race right now are that Donald Trump is really unpopular. Donald Trump is the defining feature of the race. That adds up to a big win for Joe Biden right now. If that formulation changes, and Joe Biden is just as important in the minds of voters as Donald Trump, maybe Joe Bidens lead would shrink a lot. Maybe it would shrink a little. I dont know. But what I can say is that this particular dynamic is working out really well for Joe Biden.\n\nmichael barbaro\n\nNate, thank you very much. And I want to warn you that we are going to be doing this a lot for the next five months, but not too much.\n\nnate cohn\n\nThank you for having me. And I am looking forward to it.\n\nmichael barbaro\n\nWell be right back. Heres what else you need to know today.\n\narchived recording (joyette holmes) Good afternoon. Today the Sun County grand jury did return an indictment against Travis McMichael, Greg McMichael and William Bryant.\n\nmichael barbaro\n\nOn Wednesday, four months after a 25-year-old black man, Ahmaud Arbery, was chased down and killed while jogging in South Georgia, three white men were indicted on charges ranging from malice murder to false imprisonment.\n\narchived recording (joyette holmes) This is another positive step, another great step for finding justice for Ahmaud, for finding justice for this family and the community beyond.\n\nmichael barbaro\n\nLocal police were slow to arrest and charge the three men, prompting the first in a series of public protests in the past few months over the extrajudicial killing of black Americans. And the U.S. recorded nearly 37,000 new coronavirus infections on Wednesday, the highest single-day total since the pandemic began. With infections rising so quickly, the City of Houston said it was running out of intensive care beds. The governor of Texas urged residents to stay inside. And Washington and North Carolina said they would require that masks be worn in public.\n\narchived recording (ned lamont) Were going to have a quarantine on visitors from those states that have a positivity rate north of 10 percent over a seven day moving average. So it could change a little bit over time. Hopefully, those states that are so grave  Florida, Texas, Arizona  will come back with a lower infection rate.\n\nmichael barbaro\n\nIn the Northeast, where infection rates have declined, the governors of three neighboring states  New York, New Jersey and Connecticut  said they would require a two-week quarantine for travelers coming from states where cases are surging.\n\narchived recording (ned lamont) What that means in terms of quarantine will be enforced differently in different states. What we want to do here in the state of Connecticut is one, if you come up from those states and you havent tested, and you havent had a negative test, youre coming up here, youve got to quarantine for 14 days.\n\nmichael barbaro'	b'Biden Takes Lead Over Trump in 2020 Presidential Poll'	2020-06-24	[b'Alexander Burns', b'Jonathan Martin', b'Matt Stevens']	[b'president', b'voters', b'trump', b'takes', b'states', b'think', b'donald', b'poll', b'battleground', b'presidential', b'biden', b'joe', b'know', b'2020', b'lead']	b'michael barbaro\n\nFrom The New York Times, Im Michael Barbaro.

Just a whole spectrum of different issues relating to race and criminal justice and the protests, the presidents ratings are even worse on those issues than they are on the coronavirus. And here again, the president has this fundamental disconnect with the electorate, where his priorities arent the same as theirs. I mean, we asked whether they would rather have a candidate who says that we need to be tough on protests that go too far, or whether they would rather have a candidate who says we need to focus on the cause of protests, even when they go too far. And voters said, by a 40-point margin, that they would rather have the candidate who focuses on the cause of the protests, even when theyre going too far. And its also including a significant number of people who backed the president.\n\nmichael barbaro\n\nSo the gulf between how the president is talking about these protests and how voters across the battleground states are thinking about these protests is enormous.\n\nnate cohn\n\nYeah. And I wouldnt have guessed that, personally.\n\nmichael barbaro\n\nSo Nate, how does this disapproval of how the presidents handling these major crises, how does that explain this concept you touched on earlier of white voters revolting against the President?\n\nnate cohn\n\nWell, a pretty significant number of white voters in the battleground states do not side with the president, either his handling of the coronavirus or on these racial issues. And these are now the issues that are most important in the minds of voters in the battleground states. And so while maybe in 2016, a lot of these voters were focused on who would do the best on trade or immigration, now whats on their mind is who is the best job handling protests and coronavirus. Theyre not so sure they want to vote for the President anymore. In our poll, nearly 15 percent of the people who say they voted for President Trump in 2016 arent willing to say they support him against Joe Biden. And 7 percent of those voters say theres almost no chance theyll vote for him again.\n\nmichael barbaro\n\nSo 7 percent of his base plans on flipping, and 15 percent is very open to flipping, because of the way he has handled all of these complex questions over the past few months or year?\n\nnate cohn\n\nYeah. And I should note they may not necessarily flip. They could vote third party. They could stay home. They have other options here. But a meaningful number of them at the moment say they would back Joe Biden for president.\n\nmichael barbaro\n\nWow.\n\nnate cohn\n\nSo at the moment, the presidents coalition, this core base of support among white voters that got him to victory in 2016, just is not there for him anymore. It has suffered serious defections, mainly at its periphery, you know, not the people wearing MAGA hats. But the sort of people who voted for Obama in 2012, backed Donald Trump in 2016 because they liked what he had to say about illegal immigration and trade, are not putting up with him right now.\n\nmichael barbaro\n\nAnd who is this voter, this white voter who is now turning on the president four years later?\n\nnate cohn\n\nIts a pretty broad group of white voters. It includes college-educated white voters. It includes white voters without a college degree. It includes young voters. Young white voters now back Joe Biden by 20 points.\n\nmichael barbaro\n\nWow.\n\nnate cohn\n\nIt includes older white voters. At the moment, the president is losing among seniors, who were the bedrock of his support in 2016.\n\nmichael barbaro\n\nWow. You know, Nate, Im curious if theres a prototypical swing state region that you think of as being illustrative of everything that youre describing here, this alienation, this disapproval of the way the president is handling everything since we last polled these battleground states.\n\nnate cohn\n\nWell, I could indulge you on that question. I could tell you about how in the Green Bay region of Wisconsin or in Northeast Pennsylvania or something that Joe Biden is now ahead, and Donald Trump won there big in 2016. But you know, frankly, its true everywhere. There are no exceptions here. Theres no place where the presidents holding up fairly well and I can be like, thats the place where its particularly bad. Theres no region that epitomizes this more than any other. I could choose anywhere and tell you that the president appears to be losing ground among white voters. Its true in the battleground states. Its true nationally. Its true everywhere.\n\nmichael barbaro\n\nWell be right back. OK. Nate, lets talk about what these polls, both the national poll, but especially the six battleground state polls, have told us about Joe Biden and why he seems to be leading so handsomely over Donald Trump.\n\nnate cohn\n\nYou know, my honest answer is that I think our answers on Joe Biden are kind of boring.\n\nmichael barbaro\n\nBoring how?\n\nnate cohn\n\nYou know, the voters, they like Joe Biden. Hes got a 50 percent favorability rating. Its fine. They dont seem to have a very strong opinion of him either way. They do think he would do a better job than Trump on almost every issue, except the economy and China. But theres not a groundswelling of support for him. And theres not particularly deep opposition to him either. Instead, 55 percent of voters say there is at least some chance they would vote for him. So that to me indicates that a pretty broad swath of the electorate is at least considering the guy at this stage.\n\nmichael barbaro\n\nHm. And what youre describing is an alternative, rather than a charismatic figure that voters are looking to with great ardor.\n\nnate cohn\n\nI think thats right. A lot of the divides that you might think about in American politics today, like between young and old, and so on. They dont really even exist on Joe Biden. Everyone just kind of has a modestly favorable view of him. And there are many circumstances in which maybe thats not the exact candidate youd want to run for president. But it may be exactly the right candidate at a time when a clear majority of the electorate has resolved that it does not want to reelect the current president.\n\nmichael barbaro\n\nNate, youre painting a scenario in which Joe Biden seems to be thriving as a reflection of President Trumps weakness. And thats a familiar concept in presidential campaigns. But I went through the battleground state poll that you sent me about 24 hours ago. And I was really struck by the number of issues on which respondents to the poll said they thought that Joe Biden would do a better job than President Trump. It was immigration. It was protests. It was the pandemic. And so how do we know whether that is a reflection of President Trump, or a true sense that people believe Joe Biden is inherently the best person to do those things?\n\nnate cohn\n\nYou know, its a great question. Unfortunately, the way that weve asked this question to voters, I dont think we can disentangle whether they think Joe Biden would be good versus believing that Donald Trump is bad. Were just asking voters whether they think Joe Biden would do a better job than Donald Trump. And so I dont think we can pull out the varying effects of Joe Biden and Donald Trump on that. I do think, though, that one thing that stands out to me is how much the results of those questions matches up with Trumps approval rating on those issues, which at least to me implies that its more about the president than it is about Joe Biden.\n\nmichael barbaro\n\nHm. In other words, disapproval of the president is kind of mirrored in the data of approval or the belief that Joe Biden would do something better?\n\nnate cohn\n\nThats right.\n\nmichael barbaro\n\nThis data clearly suggests theres not a tremendous amount of passion around Joe Biden. And yet, hes developed this very significant lead over President Trump. And so I wonder whether that means that the electability case for Joe Biden, which was debated endlessly throughout the primary, has kind of proven to be exactly what Joe Biden and the people around him said it would be now that theres a two person race, Biden versus Trump.\n\nnate cohn\n\nWell, I dont think we can run the counterfactual and see whether Elizabeth Warren would be leading today if she had been the Democratic nominee or Bernie Sanders. What I think we can say is that the case for Joe Bidens electability is playing out here. The case for Joe Bidens electability was always that a sufficient number of voters do not want to re-elect the president, so choose someone who maximizes the appeal of the Democratic candidate with the broadest number of voters. I dont know whether that means that a different candidate would be doing better or worse than Joe Biden. But what we do know is that Joe Biden is up nine points across battleground states that voted for Trump last time. Hes up 14 points nationwide. And he would have a distinct chance of winning by the widest margin of any candidate in my lifetime.\n\nmichael barbaro\n\nWell, Nate, that leads me to a very important and delicate question that involves you and me. Because four years ago, we were having a conversation about polling. And Donald Trump was down in those polls. I was the host of a different show called The Run Up. You were the first guest on the first episode. And the title of that episode was, Could Hillary Clinton Win in a Landslide? So I think you know where this question is now headed.\n\nnate cohn\n\nHow could I not?\n\nmichael barbaro\n\nSo what is different about this lead, if anything, that makes you and should make us trust it?\n\nnate cohn\n\nWell, I think we should all approach this with a lot of humility. I mean, polling is tough the day before the election. Its really tough five months before the election. The national environment has changed a lot in the last five months. It can change a lot in the next five months. That said, I think that this lead is different from Hillary Clintons lead. It doesnt mean that Donald Trump cant win. But it is different. Its different in two ways. One, its a wider lead. Joe Biden is up by more. If the polls were just as wrong as they were in 2016, and the election were held tomorrow, Joe Biden would still win. I mean, the polls could be more wrong. Theres no law of polling that says that 2016 is the worst case scenario or something. But this is a bigger advantage than Hillary Clinton had down the final stretch. Its a more persistent advantage. And its wider than even her peaks. The second difference is a methodological one, which is that we are much more focused on the battleground states this time than we were in 2016. In 2016, we had really good national polling. And we did not have very much good polling in the battleground states. We have resolved to flip that around, to try and deal with the things that went wrong four years ago. None of that ensures that our results will be perfect if the election were held tomorrow. But it is a reason why it is less likely that these polls would be fundamentally wrong in the same way that so many state polls were fundamentally wrong four years ago.\n\nmichael barbaro\n\nA key caveat, however, seems to be that the lead that Joe Biden has developed over these past few months has occurred when he has been largely invisible. Right? I mean, this has been a very unusual campaign in the sense that the President is as visible as hes ever been, every day  at the White House, on Twitter and now campaign rallies. Whereas Joe Biden has been largely quarantined and kind of offstage. Inevitably, that will change. And I wonder how much that could begin to alter some of the dynamics of these polls.\n\nnate cohn\n\nI think that it absolutely could begin to help narrow the race. And this was the pattern in 2016, by the way. There were these moments of the race when the talk was always about Donald Trump. And he would get in these fights. The news would be all about how Donald Trump said this ridiculous stuff. All these Republicans would be criticizing him. And then Hillary Clinton would have this lead. And then two weeks later, something would happen, when it was her emails, or the deplorables line, or random health scares, and so on. And Hillary Clintons lead would fall right back down to a more competitive race. And I think it is certainly possible that if voters focus as much on Joe Biden at any point in this election cycle as they focused on Hillary Clinton, that would probably lead to a tighter race than the one we have now.\n\n[music]\n\nmichael barbaro\n\nPerhaps put more simply, what youre saying is that campaigning in absentia, essentially, is working for Joe Biden. And its working pretty well.\n\nnate cohn\n\nAbsolutely. I mean, the fundamentals of the race right now are that Donald Trump is really unpopular. Donald Trump is the defining feature of the race. That adds up to a big win for Joe Biden right now. If that formulation changes, and Joe Biden is just as important in the minds of voters as Donald Trump, maybe Joe Bidens lead would shrink a lot. Maybe it would shrink a little. I dont know. But what I can say is that this particular dynamic is working out really well for Joe Biden.\n\nmichael barbaro\n\nNate, thank you very much. And I want to warn you that we are going to be doing this a lot for the next five months, but not too much.\n\nnate cohn\n\nThank you for having me. And I am looking forward to it.\n\nmichael barbaro\n\nWell be right back. Heres what else you need to know today.\n\narchived recording (joyette holmes) Good afternoon. Today the Sun County grand jury did return an indictment against Travis McMichael, Greg McMichael and William Bryant.\n\nmichael barbaro\n\nOn Wednesday, four months after a 25-year-old black man, Ahmaud Arbery, was chased down and killed while jogging in South Georgia, three white men were indicted on charges ranging from malice murder to false imprisonment.\n\narchived recording (joyette holmes) This is another positive step, another great step for finding justice for Ahmaud, for finding justice for this family and the community beyond.\n\nmichael barbaro\n\nLocal police were slow to arrest and charge the three men, prompting the first in a series of public protests in the past few months over the extrajudicial killing of black Americans. And the U.S. recorded nearly 37,000 new coronavirus infections on Wednesday, the highest single-day total since the pandemic began. With infections rising so quickly, the City of Houston said it was running out of intensive care beds. The governor of Texas urged residents to stay inside. And Washington and North Carolina said they would require that masks be worn in public.\n\narchived recording (ned lamont) Were going to have a quarantine on visitors from those states that have a positivity rate north of 10 percent over a seven day moving average. So it could change a little bit over time. Hopefully, those states that are so grave  Florida, Texas, Arizona  will come back with a lower infection rate.\n\nmichael barbaro\n\nIn the Northeast, where infection rates have declined, the governors of three neighboring states  New York, New Jersey and Connecticut  said they would require a two-week quarantine for travelers coming from states where cases are surging.\n\narchived recording (ned lamont) What that means in terms of quarantine will be enforced differently in different states. What we want to do here in the state of Connecticut is one, if you come up from those states and you havent tested, and you havent had a negative test, youre coming up here, youve got to quarantine for 14 days.\n\nmichael barbaro'

This is The Daily.\n\n[music]\n\nToday: A full-scale meltdown of new voting systems in Georgia is alarming Democratic leaders ahead of the states general election in November. My colleague, Astead Herndon, on why voting access in Georgia has become a national issue for the party. Its Thursday, June 11. OK, Astead, so tell me what happened on Tuesday in Georgia.\n\nastead herndon\n\nTuesday was Georgias primary elections, where they were slated to send Senate candidates and House candidates ahead to Novembers general election, but \n\narchived recording After twice being delayed due to the coronavirus pandemic, finally primary election day, and some of the polls, simply did not go as planned.\n\nastead herndon\n\nWhat we saw on Tuesday did not look much like an election at all.\n\narchived recording Our newsroom is flooded with emails, calls, tweets, texts of voters reporting issues and irregularities at precincts across the metro.\n\nastead herndon\n\nAt the beginning of the day, polling sites were not opening on time, and then it became very clear that they werent adequately staffed.\n\narchived recording Health concerns kept many longtime poll workers from showing up today, leaving inexperienced volunteers to run new voting machines for the first time.\n\nastead herndon\n\nAlso, there were problems with the machines that were at the polling sites.\n\narchived recording 1 Poll workers said they had difficulties turning on the voter check-in computers, and encoding voter access cards, and installing touch screens. archived recording 2 They had printer problems, missing some electrical plugs, as well.\n\nastead herndon\n\nThere are also fewer polling places to begin with because of the coronavirus pandemic, so the virus has added more emphasis on mail-in ballots and absentee ballots, many of which some Georgia residents said they did not receive in the mail. And this created massive lines \n\narchived recording We saw repeated over and over people standing, sitting, waiting for the opportunity to have their say in our states political future.\n\nastead herndon\n\n causing people to wait more than four or five hours in some cases.\n\narchived recording 1 53 years Ive been voting, and never have seen a line like this in 53 years. archived recording 2 This is wrong. This is America. This is a crisis in our world to make us not exercise our right to vote.\n\nastead herndon\n\nIt also caused some people to turn away, just throwing up their hands and saying, you know, they cant spend a whole day waiting for a line that they dont know is going to move.\n\narchived recording The system is a joke, and were not laughing.\n\ncaitlin dickerson\n\nSo why was this happening, Astead? Whats the reason for all this chaos?\n\nastead herndon\n\nTuesday was a confluence of local and state problems. And what you hear from the counties that were particularly affected was that certainly, their machines and their processes did not work, and they take some blame for that. But what Democrats say is a larger problem is a state and Republican administration system that runs the elections process that is not interested in helping these counties succeed.\n\ncaitlin dickerson\n\nWhat I hear you saying is that what happened on Tuesday was not simply a fluke.\n\nastead herndon\n\nRight. The roots of Georgias fights over ballot access and voting rights start way before Tuesday.\n\narchived recording David, what has been the reaction there in Washington to the Supreme Court effectively hobbling the Voting Rights Act?\n\nastead herndon\n\nIn 2013, the Supreme Court opened the door for states to have more autonomy in changing their voting procedures without input from the federal government.\n\narchived recording (david leonhardt) You see Democrats very upset about this rule, And you see Republicans who have come out so far praising it, saying the Voting Rights Act has done its work. It may not be needed anymore.\n\nastead herndon\n\nAnd that allowed states like Georgia, states that had historically been closely watched in the South, to really overhaul their ballot process. This has included closing polling locations across the state that have predominantly been in Democratic and African-American communities. And also, they passed in 2017 whats called the Exact Match Law, which means when someone registers for the ballot, if there is any difference between that registration and the identification the state has on file  whether that is a misplaced letter or an incorrect hyphen  it allows the state to throw out that ballot registration. That has led to thousands of people being purged from Georgias voting rolls. And both of these things, closing the polling locations and the Exact Match Law, have disproportionately impacted minority communities, and black communities especially. I remember in 2018 \n\narchived recording In Georgia, a record-breaking two million early votes were cast, and all eyes are focused on the states race for governor.\n\nastead herndon\n\n being in Georgia for the closely-watched governors race between Stacey Abrams and Brian Kemp.\n\narchived recording A poll released today shows that Georgias secretary of state and Republican candidate Brian Kemp leads the Democratic candidate, Stacey Abrams, by just one point.\n\nastead herndon\n\nAnd you would be at peoples homes, and you would watch them look up whether their voting registration was still on file. And many would be shocked to find out that they had been purged even without their knowledge. And this came in the middle of a governors race that was just as much about voting rights as it was about Democrat versus Republican.\n\narchived recording (stacey abrams) Im Stacey Abrams, and Im running for governor, because where you come from shouldnt determine how far you can go.\n\nastead herndon\n\nStacey Abrams, who had previously been the House Minority Leader in Georgia, had built a career off of registering new voters, bringing people  new people into the process, and kind of a vision of a blue Georgia on the backs of a multiracial coalition that had yet to be achieved.\n\narchived recording (stacey abrams) The blue wave is African-American. [CHEERING] Its white. Its Latino. Its Asian Pacific Islander. archived recording (crowd) Yes! archived recording (stacey abrams) It is made up of those whove been told that they are not worthy of being here. archived recording (crowd) Yes! archived recording (stacey abrams) It is comprised of those who are documented and undocumented. archived recording (crowd) Yes!\n\nastead herndon\n\nAnd she was facing the secretary of state, Brian Kemp \n\narchived recording (brian kemp) Well, thankfully, the truth here is very simple. Georgians should simply watch what she says. Youll know that shes talking about this election, and talking about illegals voting for her in this election. They filed a lawsuit.\n\nastead herndon\n\n who had refused to recuse himself from overseeing the states election, even as he ran. And this race was wrapped up in accusations of voter suppression.\n\narchived recording (stacey abrams) My worry is that hes using his position as secretary of state to tilt the playing field in his direction.\n\nastead herndon\n\nAnd from Republicans about voter fraud.\n\narchived recording (brian kemp) I think hardworking Georgians should decide who their governor is, not people here illegally like my opponent wants.\n\nastead herndon\n\nThere was a real sense that whoever won this would be determining the direction, and most importantly, would be the referee for the states elections going forward. And on election day \n\narchived recording 1 Good morning. There is no lull in this line, and you can see people lined up here. archived recording 2 The worst of the issues was in Fulton County. At the Pittman Park location, only three voting machines were sent, but eight were supposed to be there. archived recording 3 I live in East Point, and I updated my address at least two times before election day. And on Tuesday when I went to my polling place, they denied me a ballot.\n\nastead herndon\n\nStacey Abrams lost by a little less than 55,000 votes. And when she lost, accused Republicans of voter suppression tactics that changed the outcome of the race.\n\narchived recording (stacey abrams) Democracy only works when we work for it, and apparently today, when we stand in line for hours to meet it at the ballot box, thats when democracy works.\n\nastead herndon\n\nFor a while, Abrams wouldnt concede to Kemp.\n\narchived recording (stacey abrams) Friends, friends, we are still on the verge of history, and the best is yet to come. [CHEERING]\n\ncaitlin dickerson\n\nAstead, how do Republicans respond to these allegations from Democrats that the prior election was unfair?\n\nastead herndon\n\nOn the defensive side, Republicans say that there is not evidence that they are proactively trying to suppress votes. They flip the blame, saying that it is local Democratic officials in these areas who have not lived up to their task in administrating clean elections. They also say that they are focused on things like voter fraud, which we should note does not have real evidence. And they justify things like exact match as a tool to combat this voter fraud. But theyve also done offensive moves. The state purchased new voting machines after criticism that the previous ones were not safe, and a court ordered to do so, and those were used for the first time in Tuesdays election.\n\ncaitlin dickerson\n\nAnd based on what you saw Tuesday, those measures to address problems in the electoral system, they dont seem to have worked.\n\nastead herndon\n\nCertainly, those measures do not meet the scope of the crisis. So for whatever new voting machines, or for whatever back and forth this happening between county and state officials, what is clear is that voting in Georgia does not go the way voting should be. But for Republicans, theyll say that the vast majority of Georgias countys, 150 out of 159, had fine days on Tuesday. But its important to recognize that those nine counties that had the biggest issues on Tuesday, theyre not only Democratic areas, but those are the counties that have the largest minority populations in the state.\n\ncaitlin dickerson\n\nSo from everything youve said, it sounds like Democrats would see the problems with Tuesdays election as being just a continuation of voting issues that have plagued these same communities in the past, and that they feel Republicans have either ignored or even made worse.\n\nastead herndon\n\nThats what Democrats will tell you. I remember running into the state Democratic chair when she was trying to vote. It took her five hours on what was her 10-year wedding anniversary. And she was talking about how familiar it felt, and encouraging people in the line to hold that feeling with them as they look towards the general election. But when you look at the reaction across the country and how much interest there was in what was happening in Georgia, I think a part of that is because the national Democratic and Republican parties realize just how important this state is  not just for November, but what could be a preview of how Southern politics is changing in the future.\n\n[music]\n\ncaitlin dickerson\n\nWell be right back. Astead, what do you mean? Why is Georgia such a key state for the Democratic party?\n\nastead herndon\n\nFor decades now, Democrats have been virtually shut out of the South. It has been almost impossible for the party to find consistent success in getting a candidate elected to statewide office, whether thats a governor or the Senate, and in presidential elections. And what Democrats have been trying to do over the past decade is create a grassroots momentum that can change the way that they operate in the South. And Georgia has been the focal point of that.\n\ncaitlin dickerson\n\nAstead, help me understand the Democrats strategy in Georgia.\n\nastead herndon\n\nIt basically breaks down to three areas. The first is just the changing demographics of the state. New industries, particularly movie and film, have caused an influx of a new Southerner, as some folks called it, who is living in places like Atlanta and the metro areas, that has made the South their home in the way that has given Democrats a new type of voter to target. Another key point of the strategy is in registering Georgians who may not have participated in previous elections. So that includes predominately young people and people of color, and going to those communities that have kind of felt distant from the political process and bringing them along and involved. The third piece, which has been accelerated in the last three years, has been trying to persuade a white, often college-educated voter, who probably had voted Republican before, that Democrats are now more acceptable party. And this is something that Democrats have said Donald Trump is their best recruiter for. That theres a type of upscale Southerner who doesnt like the incivility that they feel coming from the White House, and is just not as much of a hardened Republican as maybe some others. This is where Democrats, combining all of those three, think they can make big inroads.\n\ncaitlin dickerson\n\nSo it sounds like Democrats see Georgia as ripe for flipping from red to blue because of these shifts youre talking about.\n\nastead herndon\n\nYes. They see it as their most likely opportunity to deliver a blue state in the South for Joe Biden in November, and in the U.S. Senate. But they also see it as a gateway to a playbook that other Southern states can replicate. The thought process is, if Georgia can put it together after years and years of coming close, that allows places like South Carolina, places like Texas, to have a real roadmap on how Democrats can make inroads. What theyre missing is a victory to prove to other states and to prove to the Democratic party that the South is worth investing in.\n\ncaitlin dickerson\n\nAnd how likely is it that this victory youre describing is actually going to happen?\n\nastead herndon\n\nWhile its certainly a possibility, you have to note that Georgia has been kind of fools gold for Democrats for some years now, which makes the kind of conundrum for what the national party and Joe Bidens campaign should do this year. Should they invest in Georgia, which is the only state in the country that has both its Senate seats up in November? Or, do they spend that money, that time, that investment in states that they know are more likely to be the tipping point for the electoral college? Its kind of a choice between playing it safe or putting all their chips on the table.\n\ncaitlin dickerson\n\nSo in light of what they saw on Tuesday, which of these two strategies do you think the Democratic leadership is leaning toward right now?\n\nastead herndon\n\nIn the short term, what Biden chooses to prioritize for the November election, we dont really know. But one of the best ways that the campaign can signal its intentions is through the vice presidential selection. If Joe Biden was to select someone who represents the kind of new Southern democrat  someone like Stacey Abrams or Keisha Lance Bottoms, or even Val Demings, the representative in Florida  that could signal that the campaign is trying to unlock this type of new Democratic future in the region that weve talked about. And I dont think that you can separate race from this question also. The South and Southern Democrats are overwhelmingly black, and those are the same people that helped revive Joe Bidens campaign after he was struggling in Iowa, New Hampshire and Nevada. To me, an important question as we look towards November is, will Joe Biden try to reward those communities with an increased focus on them as he moves towards the general election, or is the primary over and this is all about just the ways that the campaign believes it needs to beat Donald Trump?\n\ncaitlin dickerson\n\nSo weve been talking about how important Georgia is to the Democratic party in 2020, but I can imagine that for that same reason, Georgia is equally as important to Republicans. So what are they doing to hold on to the state?\n\nastead herndon\n\nI think like Democrats, Georgia Republicans have short-term and long-term considerations. In the short term, they just think the state remains kind of structurally red. But in the long term, Republicans will concede that the demographics of the state are not moving in their direction. And what they need to do to stop this kind of rising tide is to appeal to kind of new communities there. And theres kind of a pitch that, we should tell them that the reason youre leaving California, or New York, or other places is because those states have high taxes and Georgias business friendly. The why liberals have wanted to come here is because of the kind of conservative values, and thats what we should try to hold on to. The problem is, when the President has so defined the parties by kind of social and cultural concerns, can the state Republican make a pitch to an immigrant community, a black professional, around Republicanism with that not being tied in to what Trump has made the focus of the party?\n\ncaitlin dickerson\n\nYoure talking about this cultural clash going on in the country, and thats very top of mind for a lot of Americans right now, obviously. So can you put this election were talking about into the context of this broader cultural moment that we are all living right now?\n\nastead herndon\n\nMm-hmm. For both Democrats and Republicans, I think that this moment, this re-emergence of race and racial justice as the countrys top even electoral or voting concern, plays into the strategies that we have laid out. For the Republican side, when we talk about the way that state Republicans and the President have tried to appeal to voters, youve seen Republicans in the last week or so try to make defund the police a scare tactic to bring back that suburban voter. Youve seen them try to focus on the more destructive or looting aspects of the protests to discredit the movement as a whole. But frankly, public opinion shows that there has been widespread agreement around police brutality as a growing issue, and I think thats important to note about what candidates for both sides are saying right now in Georgia. Doug Collins, the representative on the Republican side who is running for Senate, he was the member who wrote and helped pass the First Step Act, the criminal justice reform that President Trump signed into law. And this is a deeply conservative representative who has made that criminal justice pitch a part of his appeal, even in minority communities. And on the Democratic side, the Senate candidates are running very explicit campaigns about race and criminal justice, and about inequalities that were kind of unfathomable in the South years ago. They say that the times are changing, that you dont have to be cagey or calibrate to the ideological middle on things like race. That white Democrats are willing and open to talking about things in explicit terms, and they think that that can be a winning strategy.\n\ncaitlin dickerson\n\nAstead, youve been describing how important Georgia could be in the 2020 elections. So what does what happened on Tuesday night tell us about what we might expect?\n\nastead herndon\n\nI think Tuesday is a signal for both the country and the parties of things that we might have to expect come November. For one, if elected officials do not proactively prepare for an election that could be upended by virus concerns, we might have lines like we saw on Tuesday. If theyre not prepared to count as thousands and thousands of absentee and mail-in ballots in ways that are unprecedented in presidential history, we might not get results from key states on election night. And even more so, about the type of messages that politicians are giving to the public right now, if people dont feel as if going to the ballot box and voting is a process that is equitable and fair to them, it is going to be harder for particularly Democratic politicians to tell their base, this is where you should put your energy. This is how you make change. What we saw on Tuesday was not an encouraging scene.\n\ncaitlin dickerson\n\nThank you so much, Astead.\n\nastead herndon\n\nThank you, Caitlin.\n\ncaitlin dickerson\n\nWell be right back. Heres what else you need to know today.\n\narchived recording (philonise floyd) The man who took his life, who suffocated him for 8 minutes and 46 seconds, he still called him sir as he begged for his life. I cant tell you the kind of pain you feel when you watch something like that.\n\ncaitlin dickerson\n\nOn Wednesday, George Floyds brother, Philonise Floyd, testified before Congress.\n\narchived recording (philonise floyd) George wasnt hurting anyone that day. He didnt deserve to die over $20. Im asking you, is that what a black man is worth, $20? This is 2020. Enough is enough.\n\ncaitlin dickerson\n\nSpeaking to the House Judiciary Committee, Floyd called on lawmakers to pass reforms that would address police brutality and racial discrimination.\n\narchived recording (philonise floyd) If his death ends up changing the world for the better  and I think it will  then he died as he lived. It is on you to make sure his death is not in vain.\n\ncaitlin dickerson'	b'I Refuse Not to Be Heard: Georgia in Uproar Over Voting Meltdown'	2020-06-09	[b'Richard Fausset', b'Reid J.

This is The Daily.\n\n[music]\n\nToday: A full-scale meltdown of new voting systems in Georgia is alarming Democratic leaders ahead of the states general election in November. My colleague, Astead Herndon, on why voting access in Georgia has become a national issue for the party. Its Thursday, June 11. OK, Astead, so tell me what happened on Tuesday in Georgia.\n\nastead herndon\n\nTuesday was Georgias primary elections, where they were slated to send Senate candidates and House candidates ahead to Novembers general election, but \n\narchived recording After twice being delayed due to the coronavirus pandemic, finally primary election day, and some of the polls, simply did not go as planned.\n\nastead herndon\n\nWhat we saw on Tuesday did not look much like an election at all.\n\narchived recording Our newsroom is flooded with emails, calls, tweets, texts of voters reporting issues and irregularities at precincts across the metro.\n\nastead herndon\n\nAt the beginning of the day, polling sites were not opening on time, and then it became very clear that they werent adequately staffed.\n\narchived recording Health concerns kept many longtime poll workers from showing up today, leaving inexperienced volunteers to run new voting machines for the first time.\n\nastead herndon\n\nAlso, there were problems with the machines that were at the polling sites.\n\narchived recording 1 Poll workers said they had difficulties turning on the voter check-in computers, and encoding voter access cards, and installing touch screens. archived recording 2 They had printer problems, missing some electrical plugs, as well.\n\nastead herndon\n\nThere are also fewer polling places to begin with because of the coronavirus pandemic, so the virus has added more emphasis on mail-in ballots and absentee ballots, many of which some Georgia residents said they did not receive in the mail. And this created massive lines \n\narchived recording We saw repeated over and over people standing, sitting, waiting for the opportunity to have their say in our states political future.\n\nastead herndon\n\n causing people to wait more than four or five hours in some cases.\n\narchived recording 1 53 years Ive been voting, and never have seen a line like this in 53 years. archived recording 2 This is wrong. This is America. This is a crisis in our world to make us not exercise our right to vote.\n\nastead herndon\n\nIt also caused some people to turn away, just throwing up their hands and saying, you know, they cant spend a whole day waiting for a line that they dont know is going to move.\n\narchived recording The system is a joke, and were not laughing.\n\ncaitlin dickerson\n\nSo why was this happening, Astead? Whats the reason for all this chaos?\n\nastead herndon\n\nTuesday was a confluence of local and state problems. And what you hear from the counties that were particularly affected was that certainly, their machines and their processes did not work, and they take some blame for that. But what Democrats say is a larger problem is a state and Republican administration system that runs the elections process that is not interested in helping these counties succeed.\n\ncaitlin dickerson\n\nWhat I hear you saying is that what happened on Tuesday was not simply a fluke.\n\nastead herndon\n\nRight. The roots of Georgias fights over ballot access and voting rights start way before Tuesday.\n\narchived recording David, what has been the reaction there in Washington to the Supreme Court effectively hobbling the Voting Rights Act?\n\nastead herndon\n\nIn 2013, the Supreme Court opened the door for states to have more autonomy in changing their voting procedures without input from the federal government.\n\narchived recording (david leonhardt) You see Democrats very upset about this rule, And you see Republicans who have come out so far praising it, saying the Voting Rights Act has done its work. It may not be needed anymore.\n\nastead herndon\n\nAnd that allowed states like Georgia, states that had historically been closely watched in the South, to really overhaul their ballot process. This has included closing polling locations across the state that have predominantly been in Democratic and African-American communities. And also, they passed in 2017 whats called the Exact Match Law, which means when someone registers for the ballot, if there is any difference between that registration and the identification the state has on file  whether that is a misplaced letter or an incorrect hyphen  it allows the state to throw out that ballot registration. That has led to thousands of people being purged from Georgias voting rolls. And both of these things, closing the polling locations and the Exact Match Law, have disproportionately impacted minority communities, and black communities especially. I remember in 2018 \n\narchived recording In Georgia, a record-breaking two million early votes were cast, and all eyes are focused on the states race for governor.\n\nastead herndon\n\n being in Georgia for the closely-watched governors race between Stacey Abrams and Brian Kemp.\n\narchived recording A poll released today shows that Georgias secretary of state and Republican candidate Brian Kemp leads the Democratic candidate, Stacey Abrams, by just one point.\n\nastead herndon\n\nAnd you would be at peoples homes, and you would watch them look up whether their voting registration was still on file. And many would be shocked to find out that they had been purged even without their knowledge. And this came in the middle of a governors race that was just as much about voting rights as it was about Democrat versus Republican.\n\narchived recording (stacey abrams) Im Stacey Abrams, and Im running for governor, because where you come from shouldnt determine how far you can go.\n\nastead herndon\n\nStacey Abrams, who had previously been the House Minority Leader in Georgia, had built a career off of registering new voters, bringing people  new people into the process, and kind of a vision of a blue Georgia on the backs of a multiracial coalition that had yet to be achieved.\n\narchived recording (stacey abrams) The blue wave is African-American. [CHEERING] Its white. Its Latino. Its Asian Pacific Islander. archived recording (crowd) Yes! archived recording (stacey abrams) It is made up of those whove been told that they are not worthy of being here. archived recording (crowd) Yes! archived recording (stacey abrams) It is comprised of those who are documented and undocumented. archived recording (crowd) Yes!\n\nastead herndon\n\nAnd she was facing the secretary of state, Brian Kemp \n\narchived recording (brian kemp) Well, thankfully, the truth here is very simple. Georgians should simply watch what she says. Youll know that shes talking about this election, and talking about illegals voting for her in this election. They filed a lawsuit.\n\nastead herndon\n\n who had refused to recuse himself from overseeing the states election, even as he ran. And this race was wrapped up in accusations of voter suppression.\n\narchived recording (stacey abrams) My worry is that hes using his position as secretary of state to tilt the playing field in his direction.\n\nastead herndon\n\nAnd from Republicans about voter fraud.\n\narchived recording (brian kemp) I think hardworking Georgians should decide who their governor is, not people here illegally like my opponent wants.\n\nastead herndon\n\nThere was a real sense that whoever won this would be determining the direction, and most importantly, would be the referee for the states elections going forward. And on election day \n\narchived recording 1 Good morning. There is no lull in this line, and you can see people lined up here. archived recording 2 The worst of the issues was in Fulton County. At the Pittman Park location, only three voting machines were sent, but eight were supposed to be there. archived recording 3 I live in East Point, and I updated my address at least two times before election day. And on Tuesday when I went to my polling place, they denied me a ballot.\n\nastead herndon\n\nStacey Abrams lost by a little less than 55,000 votes. And when she lost, accused Republicans of voter suppression tactics that changed the outcome of the race.\n\narchived recording (stacey abrams) Democracy only works when we work for it, and apparently today, when we stand in line for hours to meet it at the ballot box, thats when democracy works.\n\nastead herndon\n\nFor a while, Abrams wouldnt concede to Kemp.\n\narchived recording (stacey abrams) Friends, friends, we are still on the verge of history, and the best is yet to come. [CHEERING]\n\ncaitlin dickerson\n\nAstead, how do Republicans respond to these allegations from Democrats that the prior election was unfair?\n\nastead herndon\n\nOn the defensive side, Republicans say that there is not evidence that they are proactively trying to suppress votes. They flip the blame, saying that it is local Democratic officials in these areas who have not lived up to their task in administrating clean elections. They also say that they are focused on things like voter fraud, which we should note does not have real evidence. And they justify things like exact match as a tool to combat this voter fraud. But theyve also done offensive moves. The state purchased new voting machines after criticism that the previous ones were not safe, and a court ordered to do so, and those were used for the first time in Tuesdays election.\n\ncaitlin dickerson\n\nAnd based on what you saw Tuesday, those measures to address problems in the electoral system, they dont seem to have worked.\n\nastead herndon\n\nCertainly, those measures do not meet the scope of the crisis. So for whatever new voting machines, or for whatever back and forth this happening between county and state officials, what is clear is that voting in Georgia does not go the way voting should be. But for Republicans, theyll say that the vast majority of Georgias countys, 150 out of 159, had fine days on Tuesday. But its important to recognize that those nine counties that had the biggest issues on Tuesday, theyre not only Democratic areas, but those are the counties that have the largest minority populations in the state.\n\ncaitlin dickerson\n\nSo from everything youve said, it sounds like Democrats would see the problems with Tuesdays election as being just a continuation of voting issues that have plagued these same communities in the past, and that they feel Republicans have either ignored or even made worse.\n\nastead herndon\n\nThats what Democrats will tell you. I remember running into the state Democratic chair when she was trying to vote. It took her five hours on what was her 10-year wedding anniversary. And she was talking about how familiar it felt, and encouraging people in the line to hold that feeling with them as they look towards the general election. But when you look at the reaction across the country and how much interest there was in what was happening in Georgia, I think a part of that is because the national Democratic and Republican parties realize just how important this state is  not just for November, but what could be a preview of how Southern politics is changing in the future.\n\n[music]\n\ncaitlin dickerson\n\nWell be right back. Astead, what do you mean? Why is Georgia such a key state for the Democratic party?\n\nastead herndon\n\nFor decades now, Democrats have been virtually shut out of the South. It has been almost impossible for the party to find consistent success in getting a candidate elected to statewide office, whether thats a governor or the Senate, and in presidential elections. And what Democrats have been trying to do over the past decade is create a grassroots momentum that can change the way that they operate in the South. And Georgia has been the focal point of that.\n\ncaitlin dickerson\n\nAstead, help me understand the Democrats strategy in Georgia.\n\nastead herndon\n\nIt basically breaks down to three areas.

New industries, particularly movie and film, have caused an influx of a new Southerner, as some folks called it, who is living in places like Atlanta and the metro areas, that has made the South their home in the way that has given Democrats a new type of voter to target. Another key point of the strategy is in registering Georgians who may not have participated in previous elections. So that includes predominately young people and people of color, and going to those communities that have kind of felt distant from the political process and bringing them along and involved. The third piece, which has been accelerated in the last three years, has been trying to persuade a white, often college-educated voter, who probably had voted Republican before, that Democrats are now more acceptable party.

And I dont think that you can separate race from this question also. The South and Southern Democrats are overwhelmingly black, and those are the same people that helped revive Joe Bidens campaign after he was struggling in Iowa, New Hampshire and Nevada. To me, an important question as we look towards November is, will Joe Biden try to reward those communities with an increased focus on them as he moves towards the general election, or is the primary over and this is all about just the ways that the campaign believes it needs to beat Donald Trump?\n\ncaitlin dickerson\n\nSo weve been talking about how important Georgia is to the Democratic party in 2020, but I can imagine that for that same reason, Georgia is equally as important to Republicans. So what are they doing to hold on to the state?\n\nastead herndon\n\nI think like Democrats, Georgia Republicans have short-term and long-term considerations. In the short term, they just think the state remains kind of structurally red. But in the long term, Republicans will concede that the demographics of the state are not moving in their direction. And what they need to do to stop this kind of rising tide is to appeal to kind of new communities there. And theres kind of a pitch that, we should tell them that the reason youre leaving California, or New York, or other places is because those states have high taxes and Georgias business friendly. The why liberals have wanted to come here is because of the kind of conservative values, and thats what we should try to hold on to. The problem is, when the President has so defined the parties by kind of social and cultural concerns, can the state Republican make a pitch to an immigrant community, a black professional, around Republicanism with that not being tied in to what Trump has made the focus of the party?\n\ncaitlin dickerson\n\nYoure talking about this cultural clash going on in the country, and thats very top of mind for a lot of Americans right now, obviously. So can you put this election were talking about into the context of this broader cultural moment that we are all living right now?\n\nastead herndon\n\nMm-hmm. For both Democrats and Republicans, I think that this moment, this re-emergence of race and racial justice as the countrys top even electoral or voting concern, plays into the strategies that we have laid out. For the Republican side, when we talk about the way that state Republicans and the President have tried to appeal to voters, youve seen Republicans in the last week or so try to make defund the police a scare tactic to bring back that suburban voter. Youve seen them try to focus on the more destructive or looting aspects of the protests to discredit the movement as a whole.

Doug Collins, the representative on the Republican side who is running for Senate, he was the member who wrote and helped pass the First Step Act, the criminal justice reform that President Trump signed into law. And this is a deeply conservative representative who has made that criminal justice pitch a part of his appeal, even in minority communities. And on the Democratic side, the Senate candidates are running very explicit campaigns about race and criminal justice, and about inequalities that were kind of unfathomable in the South years ago. They say that the times are changing, that you dont have to be cagey or calibrate to the ideological middle on things like race. That white Democrats are willing and open to talking about things in explicit terms, and they think that that can be a winning strategy.\n\ncaitlin dickerson\n\nAstead, youve been describing how important Georgia could be in the 2020 elections. So what does what happened on Tuesday night tell us about what we might expect?\n\nastead herndon\n\nI think Tuesday is a signal for both the country and the parties of things that we might have to expect come November. For one, if elected officials do not proactively prepare for an election that could be upended by virus concerns, we might have lines like we saw on Tuesday. If theyre not prepared to count as thousands and thousands of absentee and mail-in ballots in ways that are unprecedented in presidential history, we might not get results from key states on election night. And even more so, about the type of messages that politicians are giving to the public right now, if people dont feel as if going to the ballot box and voting is a process that is equitable and fair to them, it is going to be harder for particularly Democratic politicians to tell their base, this is where you should put your energy. This is how you make change. What we saw on Tuesday was not an encouraging scene.\n\ncaitlin dickerson\n\nThank you so much, Astead.\n\nastead herndon\n\nThank you, Caitlin.\n\ncaitlin dickerson\n\nWell be right back.

The only real debates are over how fast and how far the climate will change, and what society should do  the global-warming equivalents of lockdowns and social distancing  to slow or stop it and limit the damage.\n\nAs of now, the damage seems to be getting worse. As I wrote in December, impacts that scientists predicted years ago  including severe storms, heat waves and the melting of glaciers and ice sheets  are accelerating.\n\nThe coronavirus pandemic can seem overwhelming because of its sheer scope; so can climate change. As a science writer at The Times for more than 20 years, Ive learned that, to avoid being overwhelmed, it helps to start by understanding one part of the larger problem.\n\nSo lets take a closer look at one piece: whats happening at the top of the world, the Arctic. Its a good place to understand the science of climate change, and, it turns out, a critically important one to understand its effects.\n\nSince the mid-1990s, the Arctic has been warming faster than any other region of the planet: currently, at least two and a half times as fast. (Last year, average air temperatures were about 3.5 degrees Fahrenheit, or 1.9 degrees Celsius, higher than the average from 1981-2010.)\n\nIn large part, the Arctic is warming the way the rest of the world warms, only up north the process has run amok.\n\nAs the concentration of carbon dioxide and other greenhouse gases increase in the atmosphere, so does the amount of heat they trap. But the source of that heat is sunlight striking the Earth, and the amount of heat radiated differs depending on the surface the sunlight hits. Just as a black car gets much hotter than a white car on a sunny day, darker parts of the planet absorb more sunlight, and in turn radiate more heat, than lighter parts.\n\nThe Central Arctic is all ocean  dark water that is covered, to a varying extent, by light ice. The ice absorbs only about 30 to 40 percent of the sunlight hitting it; the rest is reflected. Ocean, on the other hand, absorbs more than 90 percent.\n\nAs the Arctic warms more of the ice disappears, leaving more dark ocean to absorb more sunlight and radiate even more heat, causing even more loss of ice. Its a vicious cycle that contributes to rapid warming in the region.\n\nIs this happening at the South Pole as well? No, because while the Arctic is mostly water surrounded by land, Antarctica is the opposite, a huge land mass surrounded by ocean. Some of the ice that covers the continent is melting, but no dark ocean is being exposed. (Thats not to say that the continent isnt losing ice: it is, mostly through calving of icebergs and melting of the undersides of ice shelves.)\n\nIn the Arctic, currents and winds flow out of the region and affect weather elsewhere.\n\nWeakening of the high-altitude winds known as the polar jet stream can bring extra-frigid winter weather to North America and Europe. Cold snaps like these have occurred for a long time although, because of global warming, studies have found that they are not as cold as they used to be. But some scientists now say they think Arctic warming is causing the jet stream to wobble in ways that lead to more extreme weather year round, by creating zones of high-pressure air that can cause weather systems  the ones that bring extreme heat, for example  to stall.\n\nArctic warming may also be affecting climate over the longer term. As Greenlands ice sheet melts, the fresh water it releases lowers the saltiness of the nearby ocean. These salinity changes may eventually have an effect on some of the large ocean currents that help determine long-term climate trends in parts of the world.\n\nAs climate researchers are fond of saying, what happens in the Arctic doesnt stay in the Arctic.'	b'How bad is climate change now?'	2020-04-19	[b'Henry Fountain', b'Kendra Pierre-Louis', b'Hiroko Tabuchi', b'Brad Plumer', b'Lisa Friedman', b'Christopher Flavelle', b'Somini Sengupta']	[b'sunlight', b'ice', b'heat', b'weather', b'water', b'ocean', b'bad', b'change', b'arctic', b'warming', b'climate', b'world']	b'Amid the horror and uncertainty of a global health crisis it can be easy to forget that another worldwide disaster is unfolding, although much more slowly.\n\nGlobal warming is happening, and its effects are being felt around the world.

Australia shattered its summer heat records as wildfires, fueled by prolonged drought, turned the sky fever red.\n\nFor 150 years of industrialization, the combustion of coal, oil and gas has steadily released heat-trapping gases into the atmosphere, driving up average global temperatures and setting heat records. Nearly everywhere around the world, heat waves are more frequent and longer lasting than they were 70 years ago.\n\nBut a hotter planet does not hurt equally. If youre poor and marginalized, youre likely to be much more vulnerable to extreme heat. You might be unable to afford an air-conditioner, and you might not even have electricity when you need it. You may have no choice but to work outdoors under a sun so blistering that first your knees feel weak and then delirium sets in.

Australia shattered its summer heat records as wildfires, fueled by prolonged drought, turned the sky fever red.\n\nFor 150 years of industrialization, the combustion of coal, oil and gas has steadily released heat-trapping gases into the atmosphere, driving up average global temperatures and setting heat records. Nearly everywhere around the world, heat waves are more frequent and longer lasting than they were 70 years ago.\n\nBut a hotter planet does not hurt equally. If youre poor and marginalized, youre likely to be much more vulnerable to extreme heat. You might be unable to afford an air-conditioner, and you might not even have electricity when you need it.

For California, repeal wont make much difference. For West Virginia, it could matter a lot.\n\nWhen the Obama administration unveiled the Clean Power Plan in 2015, each state was given individual goals to slash power sector emissions. The aim was to shift utilities away from coal in favor of cleaner sources like natural gas, wind, solar and nuclear to help address global warming.\n\nEven though the rule has never taken effect  it was temporarily blocked by the Supreme Court in 2016 and is now slated for repeal by the White House  dozens of states were making that shift anyway, driven by economic considerations and local clean-energy policies.\n\nBut the Obama-era regulation would have pushed a smaller handful of other states, like North Dakota and Indiana, to cut emissions more deeply than market forces alone are doing. Without the Clean Power Plan, those states may not take more forceful action on climate change.\n\nA new analysis from the research firm Rhodium Group breaks down which states appear to be still on track to meet their Clean Power Plan targets even after repeal and which are not. Nationwide, the group projected that emissions from electricity would fall 27 to 35 percent below 2005 levels by 2030 even without the plan  but could have declined even further if the rule had gone into effect.\n\n25 states are likely to beat their targets.\n\nWash.

Oregon and New York plan to retire their last coal units by 2020. Californias legislature has authorized a sweeping climate program to decarbonize not just electricity, but transportation and buildings as well.\n\nA number of Republican-controlled states that filed lawsuits to block the Clean Power Plan are also likely to meet their targets anyway. In Oklahoma, a glut of cheap natural gas from hydraulic fracturing has displaced coal power, and wind turbines now provide a quarter of the states electricity.\n\nBrian Alford, a spokesman for OG&E, a utility in Oklahoma, suggested the trends show that the industry can achieve meaningful CO2 reductions without a complex federal rule.

(A recent proposal by the Energy Department to subsidize existing coal plants could also make a difference here.) And if the current growth in renewable energy slows unexpectedly, states like North Carolina and Maryland could end up with emissions higher than the Clean Power Plan would have required.\n\nBut, conversely, if natural gas remains cheap and the cost of wind and solar continues to fall sharply, these 10 states should hit their targets.\n\nTed J. Thomas, the chairman of the Arkansas Public Service commission, said that he expected Arkansas to beat the Clean Power Plan goals years ahead of the original 2030 deadline.

I've embraced the vision of John F. Kennedy and Ronald Reagan through a strategy that reverses the spread of these weapons and seeks a world without them. To reduce our stockpiles and launchers, while ensuring our deterrent, the United States and Russia are completing negotiations on the farthest-reaching arms control treaty in nearly two decades. (Applause.) And at April's Nuclear Security Summit, we will bring 44 nations together here in Washington, D.C. behind a clear goal: securing all vulnerable nuclear materials around the world in four years, so that they never fall into the hands of terrorists.

But we also do it because it is right. That's why, as we meet here tonight, over 10,000 Americans are working with many nations to help the people of Haiti recover and rebuild. (Applause.)

I've embraced the vision of John F. Kennedy and Ronald Reagan through a strategy that reverses the spread of these weapons and seeks a world without them. To reduce our stockpiles and launchers, while ensuring our deterrent, the United States and Russia are completing negotiations on the farthest-reaching arms control treaty in nearly two decades. (Applause.) And at April's Nuclear Security Summit, we will bring 44 nations together here in Washington, D.C. behind a clear goal: securing all vulnerable nuclear materials around the world in four years, so that they never fall into the hands of terrorists.

The thousands of Central Americans on their way to the United States were border jumpers, not refugees, he said. Will anyone in power do anything to protect America this time, he asked, or will leaders sit passively back as the invasion continues?\n\nWhen another group approached the border six months later, Ann Coulter, appearing as a guest on Jeanine Pirros Fox News show, offered a dispassionately violent suggestion about what could be done to stem the flow of migrants: You can shoot invaders.\n\nA few days after, Rush Limbaugh issued a grim prognosis to his millions of radio listeners: If the immigrants from Central America werent stopped, the United States would lose its identity. The objective is to dilute and eventually eliminate or erase what is known as the distinct or unique American culture, Mr. Limbaugh said, adding: This is why people call this an invasion.\n\nThere is a striking degree of overlap between the words of right-wing media personalities and the language used by the Texas man who confessed to killing 22 people at a Walmart in El Paso this month. In a 2,300-word screed posted on the website 8chan, the killer wrote that he was simply defending my country from cultural and ethnic replacement brought on by an invasion.\n\nIt remains unclear what, or who, ultimately shaped the views of the white, 21-year-old gunman, or whether he was aware of the media commentary. But his post contains numerous references to invasion and cultural replacement  ideas that, until recently, were relegated to the fringes of the nationalist right.\n\nAn extensive New York Times review of popular right-wing media platforms found hundreds of examples of language, ideas and ideologies that overlapped with the mass killers written statement  a shared vocabulary of intolerance that stokes fears centered on immigrants of color. The programs, on television and radio, reach an audience of millions.\n\n We are so overwhelmed by this  it literally is an invasion of people crossing into Texas.   Laura Ingraham on The OReilly Factor, May 29, 2014  We are letting folks invade our home, walk into our home, and we wont even defend it or protect it.   Patrick Buchanan on Hannity, June 9, 2014  This isnt reunification. This is a government-sanctioned invasion of our country.   Todd Starnes on Fox & Friends Sunday, July 6, 2014  The invasion of illegal immigrants, and in particular unaccompanied children, at our southern border continues to spiral out of control.   Sean Hannity on Hannity, July 12, 2014  When the federal government is not able or is not willing to protect from an invasion, a state has the right to reach its own agreements, levy its own taxes and do whatever it has to, to secure its border from further invasion. And this is an invasion. Twice as big already than D-Day and twice as many again still coming.   Louie Gohmert on Justice With Judge Jeanine, July 13, 2014  The other top story is the fact that weve got this invasion across our southern border of all these illegals. Many are children.   Steve Doocy on Fox & Friends, July 16, 2014  In the Constitution, the founding fathers called it repelling invasion.   Allen West on On the Record With Greta Van Susteren, Aug. 11, 2015  Trumps great accomplishment is to expose the fact that the establishment of this country is responsible for insecure borders, the masses coming across our borders, invading our country.   Patrick Buchanan on Hannity, Oct. 21, 2016  Its a mass of humanity right now, just walking across the border, coming across the Rio Grande. This is a peacetime invasion of the United States.   Laura Ingraham on Special Report With Bret Baier, Nov. 16, 2016  These are illegal aliens who have invaded our country. And illegal alien equals criminal.   Mary Ann Mendoza on Fox & Friends, March 29, 2017  They used to call that an invasion. And they used to fight wars over stuff like that. But these days its a voter registration drive for the D.N.C.   Todd Starnes on Fox & Friends, May 9, 2017  Were going to be confronted by even more serious invasion, in terms of those crossing the border with drugs.   Jeanine Pirro on Fox & Friends, July 28, 2017  Will anyone in power do anything to protect America this time, or will our leaders sit passively back while the invasion continues?   Tucker Carlson on Tucker Carlson Tonight, April 2, 2018  What else would you call it? Its gotta be  its an invasion of our country and of our rights. Its just  its despicable.   Art Del Cueto on The Ingraham Angle, April 9, 2018  You use the word invasion, people say oh, thats so mean. What else do you call this?   Laura Ingraham on The Ingraham Angle, April 12, 2018  We'll also expose the Americans aiding and abetting a mass invasion of illegal immigrants looking to exploit our laws.   Laura Ingraham on The Ingraham Angle, April 26, 2018  It doesnt look like people seeking asylum, it looks more like an invasion of our country. And thats sad.   Art Del Cueto on Americas Newsroom, May 1, 2018  Were going to abolish ICE? I mean thats the second line of defense to prevent an invasion of the United States and to kick out people who are criminals and child molesters, MS-13.   Patrick Buchanan on Cavuto Live, July 7, 2018  I dont think we should sit back and get invaded by foreigners. I dont. That doesnt make me a racist, it makes me an American.   Tucker Carlson on Tucker Carlson Tonight, Aug. 20, 2018  When MS-13 invades our country  10,000 members across 40 states  Nancy Pelosi talks about the spark of divinity.   Kayleigh McEnany on Americas Newsroom, Aug. 23, 2018  The reality is, our southern border is on the verge of an invasion.   Herman Cain on Hannity, Nov. 15, 2018  This is not migrants coming into the country. This is nothing short of an invasion.   Art Del Cueto on Americas Newsroom, Nov. 16, 2018  You have our troops at the border and they are meant there for a deterrence effect, to say, dont come here, dont invade, you have to go to the proper channels.   Morgan Ortagus on Hannity, Nov. 17, 2018  I.C.E. are the agents  theyre just police officers  who protect this nation from invading illegal immigrants.   Sebastian Gorka on Justice With Judge Jeanine, Nov. 17, 2018  You cant shoot Americans. You can shoot invaders.   Ann Coulter on Justice With Judge Jeanine, Nov. 25, 2018  This isnt going to stop the flow of illegals who are invading our country.   Mary Ann Mendoza on Fox & Friends First, Feb. 1, 2019  There is an invasion going on right now.   Jeff Crouere on Americas News HQ, March 10, 2019  What about us? What about our country? Were being invaded.   Tucker Carlson on Tucker Carlson Tonight, April 9, 2019  We are going to change the underlying broken laws to stop what I think is literally an invasion of people from Central America.   Lindsey Graham on Sunday Morning Futures With Maria Bartiromo, May 12, 2019  You guys know what its like. This is a walking invasion. Wheres the action?   Brian Kilmeade on Fox & Friends, June 3, 2019  Calling it anything but an invasion at this point is just not being honest with people.   Laura Ingraham on The Ingraham Angle, July 10, 2019 Here are three dozen instances on Fox News when immigration along the Mexican border was discussed in terms of an invasion. In November 2018  as Republicans, who were facing a tough midterm election, pushed the notion of a migrant caravan  references to immigrants as invaders came up on more than three shows a day on average. Calling it anything but an invasion at this point is just not being honest with people, Laura Ingraham, host of The Ingraham Angle, said on her show on July 10. Days after the shooting, the Fox & Friends co-host Brian Kilmeade dismissed a connection between words used by the gunman and by President Trump, saying: If you use the term invasion, thats not anti-Hispanic. Its a fact.\n\nIn the four years since Mr. Trump electrified Republican voters with slashing comments about Muslims and Mexicans, demonizing references to immigrants have become more widespread in the news media, the Times review found.\n\nSometimes the hosts are repeating the presidents signature phrases. Sometimes the president appears to take his cues from television pundits. The cumulative effect is a public dialogue in which denigrating sentiments about immigrants are common.\n\nBefore the first groups of Central American migrants received heavy news media coverage in 2018, words like invaders or invasion were rarely used by American outlets. In the last year, the use of such terms has surged, with references to an immigrant invasion appearing on more than 300 Fox News broadcasts. The vast majority of those were spoken by Fox News hosts and guests, but some included clips of Mr. Trump using that language at rallies and other public appearances.\n\nThe Times analysis examined the last five years of show transcripts from Fox News, CNN and MSNBC to measure the frequency of terms like invasion and replacement. Segments that included this language were verified by watching clips of the shows to determine whether hosts and guests were speaking in their own words or reporting on the language of others.\n\nIts a bit of a vicious cycle, said the conservative writer William Kristol, a Republican critic of Mr. Trumps who has worked at Fox News and other networks. Something is said on Fox News, and Trump repeats it, and that legitimizes it  and then someone else goes a little further.\n\nHe added, The use of what once would have been viewed as really extreme and inappropriate and sometimes conspiratorial, sometimes dehumanizing language is really striking.\n\nWhile the notion of immigrants as a national threat was a feature of the conservative Patrick Buchanans unsuccessful bids to win the Republican presidential nominations in 1992 and 1996 (he used the phrase illegal invasion then), they ran counter to the Republican Partys efforts to make itself more appealing to Hispanics and other minorities in the two decades before Mr. Trump became its front-runner.\n\nThe portrayal of immigration as a menace has returned with force, a shift brought on not just by radio and TV hosts, but by Republican leaders in Congress and the president himself. This year Mr. Trump has used the terms invasion or invaded seven times on Twitter to describe the situation at the border, at one point referring to the approach of the migrants as the attempted Invasion of Illegals. At rallies, he has injected terms like predator, killer, and animal in his descriptions of immigrants.\n\nThe Trump-friendly media world  from outlets like Sinclair Broadcast Group and The Drudge Report to platforms like Breitbart News and Gateway Pundit  has used similar incendiary rhetoric. The fact of the matter is that this is an attempted invasion of our country  period, Boris Epshteyn, a former Trump campaign adviser, said last year in a commentary on migrants that aired on nearly 200 Sinclair television stations.\n\nAt the start of the El Paso suspects screed, he refers to the great replacement, a white supremacist conspiracy theory based on a French book that claims the migration of minority groups can lead to a genocide of white culture.\n\nThe El Paso suspect, who confessed to the mass shooting last week, claimed in the document he posted to be defending against a Hispanic invasion of Texas. The words invasion and invaders appear six times in the text, a stark parallel to the language heard on conservative television and talk radio today.\n\nBefore the El Paso shootings, others with deadly or hateful motives used the same language.\n\nThe replacement theory was prominent in a document posted on 8chan by the suspect in the massacre that killed 51 people in a mosque in Christchurch, New Zealand, in March.\n\nThe man who is alleged to have killed 11 people in a Pittsburgh synagogue last October had expressed his contempt for invaders before he opened fire on the congregation with an AR-15-style assault rifle, the authorities say. During the white supremacist demonstrations in Charlottesville, Va., in 2017 that left one woman dead, marchers shouted, You will not replace us.\n\nLawrence Rosenthal, a professor at the Berkeley Center for Right-Wing Studies, said that the shared vocabulary of white nationalists and many prominent conservatives was chilling. Where that intersects with the Republican Party today, he added, is the Republican argument that the Democrats are in favor of immigration because that will give them a permanent majority.\n\nMr. Limbaugh, whose syndicated radio show has a weekly audience of 15 million, has trafficked in similar themes.\n\n So here weve got hundreds of people flooding our southern border claiming refugee status.   The Rush Limbaugh Show, Aug. 12, 2013  When you flood the country with millions of people who are predestined to vote Democrat, in a vast majority sense, who are inexperienced and low wage, what in the world is going to happen? When you bring in that many or legalize that many and youve given up your assimilation, the assimilation aspect of immigration?   The Rush Limbaugh Show, Jan. 30, 2014  So now the regime is considering a plan to stem the surge of migrants, but what instead is actually going to happen  and any fool should know this  this is going to encourage a flood of new illegal immigrants to try their luck using the refugee excuse.   The Rush Limbaugh Show, July 25, 2014  Meanwhile, the flow of illegal immigrant children into the U.S. is expected to rise this year. Record breaking numbers. This is an untold story. We think it was the story of last year, where you had all these minors from Central America flooding the border, and they were.   The Rush Limbaugh Show, Feb. 24, 2016  If just threatening to enforce the law has slowed the flood of illegal immigrants, think what actually enforcing it will do.   The Rush Limbaugh Show, April 11, 2017  And Trump is exactly right. They do want the country flooded with illegal immigrants and refugees.   The Rush Limbaugh Show, Nov. 28, 2017  You think its not an immigration issue; it is. Their express purpose is to flood the United States. Their express purpose is to storm the border and flood in.   The Rush Limbaugh Show, Oct. 23, 2018  Theyre headed this way, and if the flood is not stopped, this is all  its gonna become demographically axiomatic after a while. It has to be stopped. It has to be stopped.   The Rush Limbaugh Show, Jan. 21, 2019  I think theyre gonna continue to flood the border no matter what Trump does because I think this is all politics. I dont think that the root of this is people escaping disease and poverty and what have you.   The Rush Limbaugh Show, March 6, 2019  Theres something behind this, folks, all these caravans amassing. This just doesnt happen organically. This is part of a targeted political project to flood this country and to paralyze the Trump administration.   The Rush Limbaugh Show, April 2, 2019  They want the illegal immigrants, and they want the flood. They want invasion because they dont like America, and they want to restructure America and erase all aspects of the founding.   The Rush Limbaugh Show, April 15, 2019  My memory is there are three different funding organizations with U.S. dollars and U.S. organizations that are behind the assemblage of these caravans, including the drug cartels and human traffickers who are attempting to participate in this swarming and flooding of the border.   The Rush Limbaugh Show, July 16, 2019 Mr. Limbaugh has repeatedly described the flow of migrants across the Mexico border as a flood that will overtake America with cheap labor and dilute the countrys identity.\n\nOn Wednesday, responding to the El Paso shootings, Mr. Limbaugh said, What is it about the word invasion that so bothers these people? Is it because thats what it is? Have we ever seen anything like this?\n\nOn Fox News, Mr. Carlson has proffered a version of this idea, albeit in less extreme language than that of the 8chan message boards where the El Paso killer lurked.\n\n Their political success does not depend on good policies but on demographic replacement, and theyll do anything to make sure it happens.   Tucker Carlson on Tucker Carlson Tonight, Dec. 20, 2017  Have they ever proposed shutting the government down to protest on behalf of American workers? Whove been harmed by immigration policies that have replaced them with cheap foreign labor?   Michelle Malkin on Fox & Friends, Jan. 19, 2018  This is really destroying one culture and replacing it with the new foreign culture.   Tucker Carlson on Tucker Carlson Tonight, Aug. 3, 2018  Of this my friends you can be sure  your views on immigration will have zero impact and zero influence on a House dominated by Democrats who want to replace you, the American voters, with newly amnestied citizens and an ever increasing number of chain migrants.   Laura Ingraham on The Ingraham Angle, Oct. 16, 2018  Im not against the immigrants. Im just  Im for Americans, and nobody cares about them. Its like, shut up, youre dying. Were going to replace you.   Tucker Carlson on Tucker Carlson Tonight, Dec. 4, 2018  So our plan here in the West is to just let the depressed people die off and replace them with people from other countries. What do you think of that plan?   Tucker Carlson on Tucker Carlson Tonight, Feb. 13, 2019  If the citys unemployment rate is high, its just more proof that they deserve replacement by foreign workers of some kind.   Tucker Carlson on Tucker Carlson Tonight, March 4, 2019  We need to stop viewing struggling Americans as defective people who deserve to be replaced by superior foreign immigrants  the Pelosi model.   Tucker Carlson on Tucker Carlson Tonight, May 17, 2019 Mr. Carlsons shows routinely feature discussions of being replaced by immigrants.\n\nMr. Carlson, whose show averages about three million viewers a night, has featured guests who subscribe to the replacement theory, like Peter Szijjarto, the foreign minister to Hungarys nationalistic president, Viktor Orban. In February, Mr. Carlson and Mr. Szijjarto discussed the need to increase birthrates in their respective countries. Otherwise, Mr. Carlson said, our plan here in the West is to just let the depressed people die off and replace them with people from other countries.\n\nAnother prime-time Fox News host, Laura Ingraham, who was considered for a communications job in the Trump administration, has used similar language. Last October, she warned viewers that their opinions will have zero impact and zero influence on a House dominated by Democrats who want to replace you, the American voters, with newly amnestied citizens and an ever-increasing number of chain migrants.\n\nFox News had no comment.\n\nThe overlap between fringe ideology and the words of conservative talk show hosts is not accidental, critics say. Theyre putting that into the zeitgeist, said Carl Cameron, the former chief political correspondent for Fox News, who is now working for a news aggregator aimed at a progressive audience, Front Page Live.\n\nFox goes out and looks for stuff that is inherently on fire and foments fear and anger, Mr. Cameron added.\n\nThe use of invasion and invaders has also surfaced on outlets away from right-wing media. The Times review of demonizing terms for immigrants found a spike in such terms in 2018 on CNN and MSNBC, but almost exclusively in the context of reporting how leading conservatives had been using such language.\n\nFox News, it should be noted, is not monolithic. While its prime-time lineup of Mr. Carlson, Sean Hannity and Ms. Ingraham is devoted to right-wing commentary, some of the networks news reporters, like the anchor Shepard Smith, have taken pains to refute misleading language about migrants. Chris Wallace, the Fox News Sunday host, recently grilled the White House chief of staff, Mick Mulvaney, about the racism inherent in Mr. Trumps critical remarks about Baltimore.\n\nDays after the El Paso massacre, Mr. Carlson said on-air that white supremacy was actually not a real problem in America and likened it to a hoax. His words ignited widespread criticism, including from fellow conservative commentators like Erick Erickson and a Fox News weekend anchor, Arthel Neville.\n\nThe next night, Mr. Carlson returned to his show and urged his critics to calm down, warning about the roiling divisions in the country, before announcing that he was leaving on a vacation that he and Fox News said had been previously planned."""	b'How the El Paso Killer Echoed the Incendiary Words of Conservative Media Stars'	2019-08-11	[b'Jeremy W.

Tucker Carlson on Tucker Carlson Tonight, April 9, 2019  We are going to change the underlying broken laws to stop what I think is literally an invasion of people from Central America.   Lindsey Graham on Sunday Morning Futures With Maria Bartiromo, May 12, 2019  You guys know what its like. This is a walking invasion. Wheres the action?   Brian Kilmeade on Fox & Friends, June 3, 2019  Calling it anything but an invasion at this point is just not being honest with people.   Laura Ingraham on The Ingraham Angle, July 10, 2019 Here are three dozen instances on Fox News when immigration along the Mexican border was discussed in terms of an invasion. In November 2018  as Republicans, who were facing a tough midterm election, pushed the notion of a migrant caravan  references to immigrants as invaders came up on more than three shows a day on average. Calling it anything but an invasion at this point is just not being honest with people, Laura Ingraham, host of The Ingraham Angle, said on her show on July 10. Days after the shooting, the Fox & Friends co-host Brian Kilmeade dismissed a connection between words used by the gunman and by President Trump, saying: If you use the term invasion, thats not anti-Hispanic. Its a fact.\n\nIn the four years since Mr. Trump electrified Republican voters with slashing comments about Muslims and Mexicans, demonizing references to immigrants have become more widespread in the news media, the Times review found.\n\nSometimes the hosts are repeating the presidents signature phrases. Sometimes the president appears to take his cues from television pundits. The cumulative effect is a public dialogue in which denigrating sentiments about immigrants are common.\n\nBefore the first groups of Central American migrants received heavy news media coverage in 2018, words like invaders or invasion were rarely used by American outlets. In the last year, the use of such terms has surged, with references to an immigrant invasion appearing on more than 300 Fox News broadcasts. The vast majority of those were spoken by Fox News hosts and guests, but some included clips of Mr. Trump using that language at rallies and other public appearances.\n\nThe Times analysis examined the last five years of show transcripts from Fox News, CNN and MSNBC to measure the frequency of terms like invasion and replacement. Segments that included this language were verified by watching clips of the shows to determine whether hosts and guests were speaking in their own words or reporting on the language of others.\n\nIts a bit of a vicious cycle, said the conservative writer William Kristol, a Republican critic of Mr. Trumps who has worked at Fox News and other networks. Something is said on Fox News, and Trump repeats it, and that legitimizes it  and then someone else goes a little further.\n\nHe added, The use of what once would have been viewed as really extreme and inappropriate and sometimes conspiratorial, sometimes dehumanizing language is really striking.\n\nWhile the notion of immigrants as a national threat was a feature of the conservative Patrick Buchanans unsuccessful bids to win the Republican presidential nominations in 1992 and 1996 (he used the phrase illegal invasion then), they ran counter to the Republican Partys efforts to make itself more appealing to Hispanics and other minorities in the two decades before Mr. Trump became its front-runner.\n\nThe portrayal of immigration as a menace has returned with force, a shift brought on not just by radio and TV hosts, but by Republican leaders in Congress and the president himself. This year Mr. Trump has used the terms invasion or invaded seven times on Twitter to describe the situation at the border, at one point referring to the approach of the migrants as the attempted Invasion of Illegals. At rallies, he has injected terms like predator, killer, and animal in his descriptions of immigrants.\n\nThe Trump-friendly media world  from outlets like Sinclair Broadcast Group and The Drudge Report to platforms like Breitbart News and Gateway Pundit  has used similar incendiary rhetoric. The fact of the matter is that this is an attempted invasion of our country  period, Boris Epshteyn, a former Trump campaign adviser, said last year in a commentary on migrants that aired on nearly 200 Sinclair television stations.\n\nAt the start of the El Paso suspects screed, he refers to the great replacement, a white supremacist conspiracy theory based on a French book that claims the migration of minority groups can lead to a genocide of white culture.\n\nThe El Paso suspect, who confessed to the mass shooting last week, claimed in the document he posted to be defending against a Hispanic invasion of Texas. The words invasion and invaders appear six times in the text, a stark parallel to the language heard on conservative television and talk radio today.\n\nBefore the El Paso shootings, others with deadly or hateful motives used the same language.\n\nThe replacement theory was prominent in a document posted on 8chan by the suspect in the massacre that killed 51 people in a mosque in Christchurch, New Zealand, in March.\n\nThe man who is alleged to have killed 11 people in a Pittsburgh synagogue last October had expressed his contempt for invaders before he opened fire on the congregation with an AR-15-style assault rifle, the authorities say. During the white supremacist demonstrations in Charlottesville, Va., in 2017 that left one woman dead, marchers shouted, You will not replace us.\n\nLawrence Rosenthal, a professor at the Berkeley Center for Right-Wing Studies, said that the shared vocabulary of white nationalists and many prominent conservatives was chilling. Where that intersects with the Republican Party today, he added, is the Republican argument that the Democrats are in favor of immigration because that will give them a permanent majority.\n\nMr. Limbaugh, whose syndicated radio show has a weekly audience of 15 million, has trafficked in similar themes.\n\n So here weve got hundreds of people flooding our southern border claiming refugee status.   The Rush Limbaugh Show, Aug. 12, 2013  When you flood the country with millions of people who are predestined to vote Democrat, in a vast majority sense, who are inexperienced and low wage, what in the world is going to happen? When you bring in that many or legalize that many and youve given up your assimilation, the assimilation aspect of immigration?   The Rush Limbaugh Show, Jan. 30, 2014  So now the regime is considering a plan to stem the surge of migrants, but what instead is actually going to happen  and any fool should know this  this is going to encourage a flood of new illegal immigrants to try their luck using the refugee excuse.   The Rush Limbaugh Show, July 25, 2014  Meanwhile, the flow of illegal immigrant children into the U.S. is expected to rise this year. Record breaking numbers. This is an untold story. We think it was the story of last year, where you had all these minors from Central America flooding the border, and they were.   The Rush Limbaugh Show, Feb. 24, 2016  If just threatening to enforce the law has slowed the flood of illegal immigrants, think what actually enforcing it will do.   The Rush Limbaugh Show, April 11, 2017  And Trump is exactly right. They do want the country flooded with illegal immigrants and refugees.   The Rush Limbaugh Show, Nov. 28, 2017  You think its not an immigration issue; it is. Their express purpose is to flood the United States. Their express purpose is to storm the border and flood in.   The Rush Limbaugh Show, Oct. 23, 2018  Theyre headed this way, and if the flood is not stopped, this is all  its gonna become demographically axiomatic after a while. It has to be stopped. It has to be stopped.   The Rush Limbaugh Show, Jan. 21, 2019  I think theyre gonna continue to flood the border no matter what Trump does because I think this is all politics. I dont think that the root of this is people escaping disease and poverty and what have you.   The Rush Limbaugh Show, March 6, 2019  Theres something behind this, folks, all these caravans amassing. This just doesnt happen organically. This is part of a targeted political project to flood this country and to paralyze the Trump administration.   The Rush Limbaugh Show, April 2, 2019  They want the illegal immigrants, and they want the flood. They want invasion because they dont like America, and they want to restructure America and erase all aspects of the founding.   The Rush Limbaugh Show, April 15, 2019  My memory is there are three different funding organizations with U.S. dollars and U.S. organizations that are behind the assemblage of these caravans, including the drug cartels and human traffickers who are attempting to participate in this swarming and flooding of the border.   The Rush Limbaugh Show, July 16, 2019 Mr. Limbaugh has repeatedly described the flow of migrants across the Mexico border as a flood that will overtake America with cheap labor and dilute the countrys identity.\n\nOn Wednesday, responding to the El Paso shootings, Mr. Limbaugh said, What is it about the word invasion that so bothers these people? Is it because thats what it is? Have we ever seen anything like this?\n\nOn Fox News, Mr. Carlson has proffered a version of this idea, albeit in less extreme language than that of the 8chan message boards where the El Paso killer lurked.\n\n Their political success does not depend on good policies but on demographic replacement, and theyll do anything to make sure it happens.   Tucker Carlson on Tucker Carlson Tonight, Dec. 20, 2017  Have they ever proposed shutting the government down to protest on behalf of American workers? Whove been harmed by immigration policies that have replaced them with cheap foreign labor?   Michelle Malkin on Fox & Friends, Jan. 19, 2018  This is really destroying one culture and replacing it with the new foreign culture.   Tucker Carlson on Tucker Carlson Tonight, Aug. 3, 2018  Of this my friends you can be sure  your views on immigration will have zero impact and zero influence on a House dominated by Democrats who want to replace you, the American voters, with newly amnestied citizens and an ever increasing number of chain migrants.   Laura Ingraham on The Ingraham Angle, Oct. 16, 2018  Im not against the immigrants. Im just  Im for Americans, and nobody cares about them. Its like, shut up, youre dying. Were going to replace you.   Tucker Carlson on Tucker Carlson Tonight, Dec. 4, 2018  So our plan here in the West is to just let the depressed people die off and replace them with people from other countries. What do you think of that plan?   Tucker Carlson on Tucker Carlson Tonight, Feb. 13, 2019  If the citys unemployment rate is high, its just more proof that they deserve replacement by foreign workers of some kind.   Tucker Carlson on Tucker Carlson Tonight, March 4, 2019  We need to stop viewing struggling Americans as defective people who deserve to be replaced by superior foreign immigrants  the Pelosi model.   Tucker Carlson on Tucker Carlson Tonight, May 17, 2019 Mr. Carlsons shows routinely feature discussions of being replaced by immigrants.\n\nMr. Carlson, whose show averages about three million viewers a night, has featured guests who subscribe to the replacement theory, like Peter Szijjarto, the foreign minister to Hungarys nationalistic president, Viktor Orban. In February, Mr. Carlson and Mr. Szijjarto discussed the need to increase birthrates in their respective countries. Otherwise, Mr. Carlson said, our plan here in the West is to just let the depressed people die off and replace them with people from other countries.\n\nAnother prime-time Fox News host, Laura Ingraham, who was considered for a communications job in the Trump administration, has used similar language. Last October, she warned viewers that their opinions will have zero impact and zero influence on a House dominated by Democrats who want to replace you, the American voters, with newly amnestied citizens and an ever-increasing number of chain migrants.\n\nFox News had no comment.\n\nThe overlap between fringe ideology and the words of conservative talk show hosts is not accidental, critics say. Theyre putting that into the zeitgeist, said Carl Cameron, the former chief political correspondent for Fox News, who is now working for a news aggregator aimed at a progressive audience, Front Page Live.\n\nFox goes out and looks for stuff that is inherently on fire and foments fear and anger, Mr. Cameron added.\n\nThe use of invasion and invaders has also surfaced on outlets away from right-wing media. The Times review of demonizing terms for immigrants found a spike in such terms in 2018 on CNN and MSNBC, but almost exclusively in the context of reporting how leading conservatives had been using such language.\n\nFox News, it should be noted, is not monolithic. While its prime-time lineup of Mr. Carlson, Sean Hannity and Ms. Ingraham is devoted to right-wing commentary, some of the networks news reporters, like the anchor Shepard Smith, have taken pains to refute misleading language about migrants. Chris Wallace, the Fox News Sunday host, recently grilled the White House chief of staff, Mick Mulvaney, about the racism inherent in Mr. Trumps critical remarks about Baltimore.\n\nDays after the El Paso massacre, Mr. Carlson said on-air that white supremacy was actually not a real problem in America and likened it to a hoax. His words ignited widespread criticism, including from fellow conservative commentators like Erick Erickson and a Fox News weekend anchor, Arthel Neville.\n\nThe next night, Mr. Carlson returned to his show and urged his critics to calm down, warning about the roiling divisions in the country, before announcing that he was leaving on a vacation that he and Fox News said had been previously planned."""

The resulting backlog can leave sick people undiagnosed, with the potential to further spread the virus as states reopen.\n\nThe Harvard researchers say that at minimum there should be enough daily capacity to test anyone who has flu-like symptoms and an additional 10 people for any symptomatic person who tests positive for the virus. That level of testing  which, according to researchers, is the minimum necessary to mitigate the disease  would require more than double the number of daily tests currently being performed. Their estimates for the testing required to suppress the spread of the virus are much higher.\n\nAside from current testing levels, another important indicator of a states testing performance is its positive test rate, which is the percent of tests that come back positive. Lower rates suggest that testing is more widespread and that it is not limited to those with severe symptoms. Positive rates should be at or below 5 percent for at least 14 days before a state or country can safely reopen, according to the World Health Organization.

Antibody tests, authorities said, dont reflect new infections, because they do not determine whether the person developed the disease, how long it has been since he or she has developed immunity.\n\nSince late April, the tally of confirmed cases includes data obtained from PCR diagnostic tests only, which caused a drop in the number of known infections, from around 220,000 to just over 200,000. In late May, Spain announced yet another way of collecting data, by counting a death based on when it occurred instead of when authorities were notified. As a result, the countrys death toll saw a drop of around 2,000 deaths.\n\nConfused? Many people and news outlets have been too. Although authorities have argued that the new data collection system provides a better picture of the pandemic, Spanish news media have reported incomprehensible figures and the thousands of casualties that suddenly disappeared from the series.\n\nSpain, like most countries, is only counting fatalities of those who have tested positive for coronavirus. The Madrid region and Catalonia, the countrys worst hit areas, have reported confirmed or suspected coronavirus deaths provided by funeral homes in daily updates, but those updated numbers are not included in the daily death tolls published by Spains health ministry.

The totals include deaths from Covid-19 as well as those from other causes, likely including people who could not be treated as hospitals became overwhelmed. These numbers undermine the notion that many people who have died from the virus may soon have died anyway.\n\nWhere we found higher deaths than normal Area PCT. above normal Excess\n\ndeaths  Reported Covid-19 deaths = Difference U.S.\n\nMarch 15 - July 11 20% 179,800  134,522 = 45,300 Peru\n\nMarch - June 111% 37,900  12,308 = 25,600 Mexico City\n\nMarch 16 - July 19 106% 26,300  8,205 = 18,100 Ecuador\n\nMarch - June 93% 22,400  4,527 = 17,900 Spain\n\nMarch 16 - July 26 32% 44,500  28,092 = 16,400 Italy\n\nMarch - May 29% 44,100  33,373 = 10,700 U.K.\n\nMarch 14 - July 17 31% 62,600  55,763 = 6,900 Six cities in Brazil\n\nApril - May 35% 19,700  13,459 = 6,200 Jakarta\n\nMarch - May 46% 4,200  520 = 3,600 Moscow\n\nMarch - June 28% 11,100  8,326 = 2,800 Netherlands\n\nMarch 16 - July 12 17% 8,400  6,029 = 2,300 Chile\n\nMarch - June 23% 8,400  6,133 = 2,200 Istanbul\n\nMarch 16 - July 5 18% 3,900  3,135 = 800 Portugal\n\nMarch 16 - July 5 7% 2,300  1,613 = 700 Sweden\n\nMarch 16 - July 19 21% 6,000  5,664 = 400 Austria\n\nMarch 16 - July 12 4% 1,000  705 = 300 Finland\n\nMarch 16 - July 5 4% 600  328 = 300 Israel\n\nMarch 16 - July 5 3% 400  331 = <100 Norway\n\nMarch 16 - July 12 Normal <0  252 =  Denmark\n\nMarch 16 - July 19 Normal <0  607 =  Belgium\n\nMarch 16 - June 7 36% 8,700  9,594 =  Switzerland\n\nMarch 16 - July 19 4% 900  1,950 =  Tokyo\n\nMarch - May Normal <0  305 =  South Africa\n\nMarch 18 - July 14 1% 1,700  3,136 =  South Korea\n\nFebruary - May Normal <0  271 =  Thailand\n\nMarch - April Normal <0  54 =  France\n\nMarch 16 - June 14 17% 25,000  29,280 =  Germany\n\nMarch 16 - June 28 1% 2,100  9,012 =  Note: Excess deaths are estimates that include deaths from Covid-19 and other causes. Reported Covid-19 deaths reflect official coronavirus deaths during the period when all-cause mortality data is available, including figures that were later revised. Reported Covid-19 deaths in Istanbul are estimated based on the governments statement that 60 percent of the countrys cases are in the city.\n\nMortality data in the middle of a pandemic is not perfect. In most places, the disparities between the official death counts and the total rise in deaths reflect limited testing for the virus rather than intentional undercounting. Officially, more than 673,000 people had died worldwide of the coronavirus as of July 31.\n\nBut the total death numbers offer a more complete portrait of the pandemic, researchers say, especially because most countries report only those Covid-19 deaths that occur in hospitals.\n\nWhatever number is reported on a given day is going to be a gross underestimate, said Tim Riffe, a demographer at the Max Planck Institute for Demographic Research in Germany. In a lot of places the pandemic has been going on for long enough that there has been sufficient time for late death registrations to come in, giving us a more accurate picture of what the mortality really was.\n\nWhere excess deaths are still above normal\n\nThe virus was last to hit Latin America, and excess deaths are still climbing in several countries. Ecuador recorded about 22,400 more deaths than usual compared to the same period in the last three years  about five times higher than the reported number of Covid-19 deaths in the country during that time. And in Peru, more than 37,000 excess deaths were recorded from April to June.\n\nPeru 37,900+ excess deaths from March to June 25,000 monthly deaths 12,000 Jan. March Dec. 2020 Expected deaths in 2020 Mexico City, Mexico 26,300+ excess deaths from March 16 to July 19 4,000 weekly deaths 2,000 Jan.

March Dec. 2020 Expected deaths in 2020 South Africa 1,700+ excess deaths from March 18 to July 14 14,000 weekly deaths 7,000 Jan. March Dec. 2020 Expected deaths in 2020 Notes: Data from weeks 1, 52 and 53 are excluded, as they may represent partial weeks; Data from weeks 1 to 10 in 2020 was not collected for Mexico City; Mexico Citys 2016-2018 death counts are based on mortality data released by the National Institute of Statistics, Geography and Informatics (INEGI). Itts 2019-2020 data is based on death certificate records obtained via the General Directorate of the Civil Registry.\n\nThese estimates were made for each country by comparing the total number of people who died this year to the number of deaths that would be expected given local mortality trends, adjusted to account for changes over time. The Economist is also tracking these deaths, known as excess deaths, in a similar way.\n\nIt is unusual for mortality data to be released so quickly, demographers say, but many countries are working to provide more comprehensive and timely information because of the urgency of the coronavirus outbreak. The data is limited and, if anything, excess deaths are underestimated because not all deaths have been reported.\n\nAt this stage, its a partial snapshot, said Patrick Gerland, a demographer at the United Nations. Its one view of the problem that reflects that most acute side of the situation, primarily through the hospital-based system.\n\nThat is likely to change.\n\nIn the next couple of months, Mr. Gerland said, a much clearer picture will be possible.\n\nWhere excess deaths have returned to normal\n\nThroughout March and early April, many countries across Europe reported clear deviations from normal patterns of deaths, according to data released by the European Mortality Monitoring Project, a research group that collects weekly mortality data from 24 European countries.\n\nBut over the last few weeks many countries have returned to normal levels of death.\n\nU.K. 62,600+ excess deaths from March 14 to July 17 12,000 24,000 weekly deaths Jan.

March Dec. 2020 Expected deaths in 2020 Notes: Data from weeks 1, 52 and 53 are excluded, as they may represent partial weeks.\n\nIn countries like Belgium and France, authorities have worked to include Covid-19 deaths outside of hospitals in their daily death reports, or adjusted the overall Covid-19 death totals once a death is confirmed in a place like a nursing or retirement home.\n\nOther agencies, like Britains Office for National Statistics, release mortality data after death certificates have been processed, confirming those that mention Covid-19. This provides a more accurate, if delayed, account of mortality than the hospital figures released each day by Public Health England.\n\nNot all countries saw excess deaths\n\nIn a handful of countries there has been no clear sign of increased mortality this year. The reasons for this are varied and will become clearer in the months ahead as countries process and certify deaths.\n\nIn Norway, Denmark and Finland, demographers say the low mortality is due in part to a less severe flu season this winter  but also because these countries were quick to implement severe restrictions to slow the spread of the virus when their outbreaks were smaller and easier to contain.\n\nIsrael hasnt seen many more deaths than normal through early July, the latest data available, but a recent spike in infections may raise the level of excess deaths in the coming weeks.\n\nFinland 600+ excess deaths from March 16 to July 5 1,000 weekly deaths Jan. March Dec. 2020 Expected deaths in 2020 Israel 400+ excess deaths from March 16 to July 5 1,000 weekly deaths Jan. March Dec. 2020 Expected deaths in 2020 Denmark No excess deaths 500 weekly deaths Jan. March Dec. 2020 Expected deaths in 2020 Norway No excess deaths 1,000 weekly deaths Jan.

March Dec. 2020 Expected deaths in 2020 Notes: Data from weeks 1, 52 and 53 are excluded, as they may represent partial weeks.\n\nAge breakdowns in mortality data will also provide a clearer picture of the role of Covid-19 in excess deaths. Using relative age-standardized mortality rates, Britains Office for National Statistics found that Spain had the highest rate of all European countries during the peak of the pandemic.\n\nEven taking into account differences in mortality by age, experts say the death toll to date could have been much worse.\n\nTodays rise in all-cause mortality takes place under conditions of extraordinary measures, such as social distancing, lockdowns, closed borders and increased medical care, at least some which have positive impacts, said Vladimir Shkolnikov, a demographer at the Max Planck Institute for Demographic Research. It is likely that without these measures, the current death toll would be even higher.\n\nRead more about the methodology and download data for excess mortality from The New York Times on GitHub.\n\nTo estimate expected deaths, we fit a linear model to reported deaths in each country from 2015 to January 2020. The model has two components  a linear time trend to account for demographic changes and a smoothing spline to account for seasonal variation. For countries limited to monthly data, the model includes month as a fixed effect rather than using a smoothing spline.\n\nSome countries have less historical data available. For countries with three or fewer years of data, the model uses a simple average of deaths in the observed years. For the United Kingdom, the model accounts for the number of bank holidays in a given week, since deaths are not registered during bank holidays.'	b'161,000 Missing Deaths: Tracking the True Toll of the Coronavirus Outbreak'	2020-04-21	[b'Jin Wu', b'Allison Mccann', b'Josh Katz', b'Elian Peltier']	[b'expected', b'tracking', b'missing', b'jan', b'weekly', b'16', b'coronavirus', b'excess', b'mortality', b'161000', b'2020', b'data', b'toll', b'true', b'outbreak', b'deaths', b'dec']	b'Peru 25,000 monthly deaths Jan.

These numbers undermine the notion that many people who have died from the virus may soon have died anyway.\n\nWhere we found higher deaths than normal Area PCT. above normal Excess\n\ndeaths  Reported Covid-19 deaths = Difference U.S.\n\nMarch 15 - July 11 20% 179,800  134,522 = 45,300 Peru\n\nMarch - June 111% 37,900  12,308 = 25,600 Mexico City\n\nMarch 16 - July 19 106% 26,300  8,205 = 18,100 Ecuador\n\nMarch - June 93% 22,400  4,527 = 17,900 Spain\n\nMarch 16 - July 26 32% 44,500  28,092 = 16,400 Italy\n\nMarch - May 29% 44,100  33,373 = 10,700 U.K.\n\nMarch 14 - July 17 31% 62,600  55,763 = 6,900 Six cities in Brazil\n\nApril - May 35% 19,700  13,459 = 6,200 Jakarta\n\nMarch - May 46% 4,200  520 = 3,600 Moscow\n\nMarch - June 28% 11,100  8,326 = 2,800 Netherlands\n\nMarch 16 - July 12 17% 8,400  6,029 = 2,300 Chile\n\nMarch - June 23% 8,400  6,133 = 2,200 Istanbul\n\nMarch 16 - July 5 18% 3,900  3,135 = 800 Portugal\n\nMarch 16 - July 5 7% 2,300  1,613 = 700 Sweden\n\nMarch 16 - July 19 21% 6,000  5,664 = 400 Austria\n\nMarch 16 - July 12 4% 1,000  705 = 300 Finland\n\nMarch 16 - July 5 4% 600  328 = 300 Israel\n\nMarch 16 - July 5 3% 400  331 = <100 Norway\n\nMarch 16 - July 12 Normal <0  252 =  Denmark\n\nMarch 16 - July 19 Normal <0  607 =  Belgium\n\nMarch 16 - June 7 36% 8,700  9,594 =  Switzerland\n\nMarch 16 - July 19 4% 900  1,950 =  Tokyo\n\nMarch - May Normal <0  305 =  South Africa\n\nMarch 18 - July 14 1% 1,700  3,136 =  South Korea\n\nFebruary - May Normal <0  271 =  Thailand\n\nMarch - April Normal <0  54 =  France\n\nMarch 16 - June 14 17% 25,000  29,280 =  Germany\n\nMarch 16 - June 28 1% 2,100  9,012 =  Note: Excess deaths are estimates that include deaths from Covid-19 and other causes. Reported Covid-19 deaths reflect official coronavirus deaths during the period when all-cause mortality data is available, including figures that were later revised. Reported Covid-19 deaths in Istanbul are estimated based on the governments statement that 60 percent of the countrys cases are in the city.\n\nMortality data in the middle of a pandemic is not perfect. In most places, the disparities between the official death counts and the total rise in deaths reflect limited testing for the virus rather than intentional undercounting. Officially, more than 673,000 people had died worldwide of the coronavirus as of July 31.\n\nBut the total death numbers offer a more complete portrait of the pandemic, researchers say, especially because most countries report only those Covid-19 deaths that occur in hospitals.\n\nWhatever number is reported on a given day is going to be a gross underestimate, said Tim Riffe, a demographer at the Max Planck Institute for Demographic Research in Germany. In a lot of places the pandemic has been going on for long enough that there has been sufficient time for late death registrations to come in, giving us a more accurate picture of what the mortality really was.\n\nWhere excess deaths are still above normal\n\nThe virus was last to hit Latin America, and excess deaths are still climbing in several countries. Ecuador recorded about 22,400 more deaths than usual compared to the same period in the last three years  about five times higher than the reported number of Covid-19 deaths in the country during that time. And in Peru, more than 37,000 excess deaths were recorded from April to June.\n\nPeru 37,900+ excess deaths from March to June 25,000 monthly deaths 12,000 Jan. March Dec. 2020 Expected deaths in 2020 Mexico City, Mexico 26,300+ excess deaths from March 16 to July 19 4,000 weekly deaths 2,000 Jan.

Itts 2019-2020 data is based on death certificate records obtained via the General Directorate of the Civil Registry.\n\nThese estimates were made for each country by comparing the total number of people who died this year to the number of deaths that would be expected given local mortality trends, adjusted to account for changes over time. The Economist is also tracking these deaths, known as excess deaths, in a similar way.\n\nIt is unusual for mortality data to be released so quickly, demographers say, but many countries are working to provide more comprehensive and timely information because of the urgency of the coronavirus outbreak. The data is limited and, if anything, excess deaths are underestimated because not all deaths have been reported.\n\nAt this stage, its a partial snapshot, said Patrick Gerland, a demographer at the United Nations. Its one view of the problem that reflects that most acute side of the situation, primarily through the hospital-based system.\n\nThat is likely to change.\n\nIn the next couple of months, Mr. Gerland said, a much clearer picture will be possible.\n\nWhere excess deaths have returned to normal\n\nThroughout March and early April, many countries across Europe reported clear deviations from normal patterns of deaths, according to data released by the European Mortality Monitoring Project, a research group that collects weekly mortality data from 24 European countries.\n\nBut over the last few weeks many countries have returned to normal levels of death.\n\nU.K. 62,600+ excess deaths from March 14 to July 17 12,000 24,000 weekly deaths Jan.

March Dec. 2020 Expected deaths in 2020 Notes: Data from weeks 1, 52 and 53 are excluded, as they may represent partial weeks.\n\nIn countries like Belgium and France, authorities have worked to include Covid-19 deaths outside of hospitals in their daily death reports, or adjusted the overall Covid-19 death totals once a death is confirmed in a place like a nursing or retirement home.\n\nOther agencies, like Britains Office for National Statistics, release mortality data after death certificates have been processed, confirming those that mention Covid-19. This provides a more accurate, if delayed, account of mortality than the hospital figures released each day by Public Health England.\n\nNot all countries saw excess deaths\n\nIn a handful of countries there has been no clear sign of increased mortality this year. The reasons for this are varied and will become clearer in the months ahead as countries process and certify deaths.\n\nIn Norway, Denmark and Finland, demographers say the low mortality is due in part to a less severe flu season this winter  but also because these countries were quick to implement severe restrictions to slow the spread of the virus when their outbreaks were smaller and easier to contain.\n\nIsrael hasnt seen many more deaths than normal through early July, the latest data available, but a recent spike in infections may raise the level of excess deaths in the coming weeks.\n\nFinland 600+ excess deaths from March 16 to July 5 1,000 weekly deaths Jan. March Dec. 2020 Expected deaths in 2020 Israel 400+ excess deaths from March 16 to July 5 1,000 weekly deaths Jan.

March Dec. 2020 Expected deaths in 2020 Notes: Data from weeks 1, 52 and 53 are excluded, as they may represent partial weeks.\n\nAge breakdowns in mortality data will also provide a clearer picture of the role of Covid-19 in excess deaths. Using relative age-standardized mortality rates, Britains Office for National Statistics found that Spain had the highest rate of all European countries during the peak of the pandemic.\n\nEven taking into account differences in mortality by age, experts say the death toll to date could have been much worse.\n\nTodays rise in all-cause mortality takes place under conditions of extraordinary measures, such as social distancing, lockdowns, closed borders and increased medical care, at least some which have positive impacts, said Vladimir Shkolnikov, a demographer at the Max Planck Institute for Demographic Research. It is likely that without these measures, the current death toll would be even higher.\n\nRead more about the methodology and download data for excess mortality from The New York Times on GitHub.\n\nTo estimate expected deaths, we fit a linear model to reported deaths in each country from 2015 to January 2020. The model has two components  a linear time trend to account for demographic changes and a smoothing spline to account for seasonal variation. For countries limited to monthly data, the model includes month as a fixed effect rather than using a smoothing spline.\n\nSome countries have less historical data available. For countries with three or fewer years of data, the model uses a simple average of deaths in the observed years. For the United Kingdom, the model accounts for the number of bank holidays in a given week, since deaths are not registered during bank holidays.'

A New York Times analysis of estimates from the Centers for Disease Control and Prevention shows just how many lives are being lost in the pandemic, as some people die from the virus itself and others from the upheaval it has brought.\n\nU.S. Deaths Above or Below Normal Note: The chart shows the difference between measured deaths and expected deaths each week. Deaths above the expected number are considered to be excess deaths.\n\nNationwide, 211,500 more people have died than usual from March 15 to Aug. 1, according to C.D.C. estimates, which adjust current death records to account for typical reporting lags. That number is 56,000 higher than the official count of coronavirus deaths for that period. Higher-than-normal death rates are now widespread across the country; only Alaska, Hawaii and West Virginia show numbers that look similar to recent years.\n\nOur analysis examines deaths from all causes  not just confirmed cases of coronavirus  beginning in mid-March when the virus took hold. That allows comparisons that dont depend on the availability of coronavirus tests in a given place or on the accuracy of cause-of-death reporting. What it shows is that some places have seen staggering death tolls, while a few states have experienced fewer deaths, but enough to clearly differentiate this year from a typical one.\n\nNew York City, an early epicenter of the U.S. outbreak, has so far experienced the most extreme increase in deaths, which surged to seven times the usual number during the peak of its coronavirus outbreak. But as the pandemic has spread across the country, New York is not the only place where the death counts are far above normal levels.\n\nOver time, the number of states with deaths at least 10 percent above normal levels has grown, and includes states in not just the Northeast, but also the South, West and Midwest.\n\nWhere deaths are far above normal\n\nDeaths above or below normal, by location Deaths in these places are at least 10 percent higher than the normal level.\n\nCounting deaths takes time and many states are weeks or months behind in reporting. These estimates from the C.D.C. are adjusted based on how mortality data has lagged in previous years. Even with this adjustment, its possible they could be an underestimate of the complete death toll if increased mortality is causing states to lag more than they have in the past or if states have changed their reporting systems. Pennsylvanias death counts, for example, have lagged behind the states usual rate of reporting all year, according to the C.D.C.\n\nBut comparing recent totals of deaths from all causes can provide a more complete picture of the pandemics impact than tracking only deaths of people with confirmed diagnoses. Epidemiologists refer to fatalities in the gap between the observed and normal numbers of deaths as excess deaths.\n\nThrough Aug. 1, estimated excess deaths were about 37 percent higher than the official coronavirus fatality count. If this pattern holds, it would put the current death toll at more than 225,000 people.\n\nMany epidemiologists believe measuring excess deaths is the best way to assess the impact of the virus in real time. It shows how the virus is altering normal patterns of mortality. The high numbers from the coronavirus pandemic period undermine arguments that the virus is merely killing vulnerable people who would have died anyway.\n\nOur charts show weekly deaths above or below normal. They include weeks in which the C.D.C. estimates the data to be at least 90 percent complete or estimated deaths are above expected death numbers. Because states vary somewhat in their speed in reporting deaths to the federal government, these state charts show death trends for slightly different time periods.\n\nRecent totals were compared with a simple model of expected deaths based on the number of deaths in the past three years, adjusted to account for trends over time, like population changes.\n\nPublic health researchers use such methods to measure the impact of catastrophic events when official measures of mortality are flawed.\n\nMeasuring excess deaths does not tell us precisely how each person died. It is likely that most of the excess deaths in this period are because of the coronavirus itself, given the dangerousness of the virus and the well-documented problems with testing. But it is also possible that deaths from other causes have risen too, as hospitals in some hot spots have become overwhelmed and people have been scared to seek care for ailments that are typically survivable. Some causes of death may be declining, as people stay inside more, drive less and limit their contact with others.\n\nEven in a normal year, it takes up to eight weeks for full death counts to be reported by the C.D.C. But this is not a normal year, and it is possible that because of the unusual number of recent deaths and the stresses they are placing on medical examiners and public health officials, the totals will take even longer than usual to become complete. We will keep updating the numbers regularly as new data becomes available.\n\nWhere deaths are somewhat above normal\n\nIn another group of states, the increases in deaths were more modest but still higher than normal.\n\nDeaths above or below normal, by location Deaths in these places are elevated, but less than 10 percent above the normal level.\n\nWhere deaths look normal, in the data\n\nreported so far\n\nThere are only four states that appear to have been largely spared from an unusual number of deaths during this period and show death numbers that look similar to those in a normal year. Two of those states  Alaska and Hawaii  are outside the contiguous U.S.\n\nDeaths above or below normal, by location These places have few excess deaths.\n\nHow excess deaths compare with the official coronavirus counts\n\nIn many states with excess deaths, the total number of them exceeded the official number of measured Covid-19 deaths. Given the ongoing limitations on coronavirus testing in the United States, these gaps are not a big surprise. Similar gaps have been found in other countries with high numbers of Covid-19 deaths.\n\nArea PCT. above normal Excess deaths Reported Covid-19 deaths Gap United States United States\n\nMarch 15 - Aug. 1 +20% 211,500 154,858 56,700 New York City N.Y.C.\n\nMarch 15 - Aug. 1 +136% 27,100 23,006 4,100 New Jersey N.J.\n\nMarch 15 - Aug. 1 +66% 18,100 15,828 2,300 Texas Tex.\n\nMarch 15 - Aug. 1 +20% 15,700 7,477 8,200 California Calif.\n\nMarch 15 - Aug. 1 +14% 14,400 9,360 5,100 New York (excluding N.Y.C.)

This page will be updated regularly.\n\n1. The Big Picture: New Cases and Deaths\n\nThe simplest way to track the progress of an outbreak is by seeing how many new cases and deaths are reported in a given area each day.\n\nNew cases per day United States 0 20,000 40,000 60,000 cases March April May June July Aug. New cases 7-day average New deaths per day United States 0 1,000 2,000 deaths March April May June July Aug. Many deaths from unspecified days New deaths 7-day average These are days with a data reporting anomaly.

(Weve set it to the New York City area by default.)\n\nx\n\nNew cases per day New York City area 0 5,000 10,000 15,000 cases March April May June July Aug. New cases 7-day average New deaths per day New York City area 0 500 1,000 1,500 deaths March April May June July Aug. New deaths 7-day average These are days with a data reporting anomaly. Read more here Metro and micropolitan areas are bigger than just the city limits of a given place  they often include the surrounding suburbs and exurbs.\n\n2. Where the Outbreak Is Worst Now\n\nThe metro areas with the greatest number of recently announced cases and deaths, relative to their population, in the last two weeks:\n\nNew cases, last two weeks Metro or micro area Growth in cases Recent cases Per 1,000 1 Brownsville-Harlingen, Texas flat or decreasing 7,463 17.61 2 Eagle Pass, Texas flat or decreasing 839 14.35 3 Corpus Christi, Texas still growing 5,404 11.93 4 Laredo, Texas still growing 3,248 11.77 5 Rio Grande City, Texas flat or decreasing 639 9.90 6 Opelousas, La. flat or decreasing 787 9.51 7 Merced, Calif. still growing 2,496 9.08 8 Panama City, Fla. flat or decreasing 1,698 8.43 9 Jacksonville, Texas flat or decreasing 438 8.33 10 Dublin, Ga. flat or decreasing 443 7.77 11 Lake City, Fla. flat or decreasing 521 7.39 12 Scottsboro, Ala. flat or decreasing 381 7.36 13 Hanford-Corcoran, Calif. flat or decreasing 1,097 7.25 14 Bakersfield, Calif. flat or decreasing 6,426 7.17 15 Mobile, Ala. flat or decreasing 2,926 7.07 515 New York City area flat or decreasing 10,180 0.51 0.5 1 2.5 5 10 20 New deaths, last two weeks Metro or micro area Growth in deaths Recent deaths Per 1,000 1 Rio Grande City, Texas flat or decreasing 43 0.67 2 Brownsville-Harlingen, Texas flat or decreasing 202 0.48 3 Albemarle, N.C. flat or decreasing 21 0.34 4 Dublin, Ga. flat or decreasing 18 0.32 5 El Centro, Calif. flat or decreasing 57 0.31 6 McAllen, Texas flat or decreasing 265 0.31 7 Corpus Christi, Texas flat or decreasing 126 0.28 8 Eagle Pass, Texas flat or decreasing 16 0.27 9 LaGrange, Ga. flat or decreasing 19 0.27 10 Opelousas, La. flat or decreasing 22 0.27 11 Oxford, Miss. flat or decreasing 14 0.26 12 Vicksburg, Miss. still growing 14 0.25 13 Brunswick, Ga. flat or decreasing 30 0.25 14 Columbus, Miss. flat or decreasing 14 0.24 15 Laredo, Texas flat or decreasing 62 0.22 480 New York City area flat or decreasing 2 0.00 0.025 0.05 0.1 0.2 0.3 0.4 Limited to areas with at least 50,000 people. Recent cases and deaths are those announced in the last two weeks, but in some cases may have taken place earlier because of delays in reporting. Flattening means that the number of new cases is still increasing, but the rate of growth is slowing.\n\nHere, weve limited the window of cases to those within the last two weeks. Scaling those cases by the population of the area can help give a sense of the prevalence of the illness there and how strained a communitys health care system may be. Places with curves that are flattening or flat are likely to move down this list over time; those where new cases and deaths continue to increase are on track to move up. (Of course, case counts are subject to variable rates of testing  cases could fall in places simply because fewer tests are being done  so moderate changes in rankings on these tables may not always be meaningful.)\n\n3. Where There May Be Good News Ahead\n\nHere, the metro areas where new cases and deaths have decreased the most, on a population-adjusted basis, in the last week:\n\nWhere new cases are decreasing most Metro or micro area A week ago Now Change per 100k 1 Lake City, Fla. 939 521 -593 2 Rio Grande City, Texas 886 639 -383 3 Abilene, Texas 734 169 -330 4 Lake Charles, La. 1,717 1,061 -312 5 Yuma, Ariz. 1,579 952 -296 6 Brownsville-Harlingen, Texas 8,703 7,463 -293 7 Victoria, Texas 663 385 -279 8 Lumberton, N.C. 655 325 -250 9 Odessa, Texas 853 450 -249 10 Miami 55,127 41,009 -228 11 Hermiston-Pendleton, Ore. 761 561 -225 12 Morristown, Tenn. 761 496 -223 13 Jackson, Miss. 2,975 1,735 -214 14 Bakersfield, Calif. 8,211 6,426 -199 15 Phoenix 23,124 13,657 -195 366 New York City area 10,311 10,180 -0.7 -500 -250 0 250 500 Where new deaths are decreasing most Metro or micro area A week ago Now Change per 100k 1 Show Low, Ariz. 32 17 -13.6 2 Huntsville, Texas 16 5 -12.6 3 Gaffney, S.C. 14 7 -12.3 4 Brownsville-Harlingen, Texas 252 202 -11.8 5 Yuma, Ariz. 68 45 -10.8 6 Lufkin, Texas 26 17 -10.3 7 Sierra Vista-Douglas, Ariz. 21 10 -8.7 8 McAllen, Texas 332 265 -7.7 9 Odessa, Texas 20 8 -7.4 10 El Centro, Calif. 70 57 -7.1 11 San Antonio 526 366 -6.4 12 Houston 1,083 663 -6.0 13 Payson, Ariz. 15 12 -5.6 14 Florence, S.C. 46 35 -5.4 15 Calhoun, Ga. 3 0 -5.2 159 New York City area 37 2 -0.2 -5 -2.5 0 2.5 5 Limited to areas with at least 100 cases and 50,000 people. Figures are sorted by the difference between the number of cases or deaths in the two weeks ending seven days ago compared with the last two weeks. The table showing the change in the number of deaths is limited to areas with more than 20 deaths.\n\nThe places on this list are not necessarily those where the outbreak is no longer severe. But sustained decreases in new cases and deaths are signs that a place is going in the right direction.\n\n4. The Places Hit Hardest\n\nBelow, the metro areas that have had the highest cumulative case and death rates since the start of the outbreak:\n\nCumulative confirmed cases Metro or micro area Population cases Per 1,000 1 Gallup, N.M. 72,290 4,087 56.54 2 Yuma, Ariz. 212,128 11,728 55.29 3 El Centro, Calif. 181,827 9,957 54.76 4 Show Low, Ariz. 110,445 5,430 49.16 5 Marion, Ohio 65,256 2,952 45.24 6 Yakima, Wash. 251,446 11,125 44.24 7 Eagle Pass, Texas 58,485 2,569 43.93 8 Palestine, Texas 58,057 2,437 41.98 9 Lake City, Fla. 70,503 2,958 41.96 10 Brownsville-Harlingen, Texas 423,908 17,618 41.56 11 Rio Grande City, Texas 64,525 2,580 39.98 12 Miami 6.2 mil. 243,930 39.35 13 Corpus Christi, Texas 452,950 17,637 38.94 14 Sioux City, Iowa 169,045 6,476 38.31 15 Huntsville, Texas 87,220 3,290 37.72 45 New York City area 20.0 mil. 540,818 27.07 0.5 1 2.5 5 10 20 Cumulative confirmed deaths Metro or micro area Population deaths Per 1,000 1 Gallup, N.M. 72,290 230 3.18 2 New York City area 20.0 mil. 43,648 2.18 3 Show Low, Ariz. 110,445 204 1.85 4 Trenton-Princeton, N.J. 369,811 622 1.68 5 Albany, Ga. 153,009 251 1.64 6 Fairfield County, Conn. 943,823 1,410 1.49 7 Farmington, N.M. 125,043 185 1.48 8 Milledgeville, Ga. 53,171 77 1.45 9 El Centro, Calif. 181,827 256 1.41 10 Hartford, Conn. 1.2 mil. 1,673 1.39 11 Yuma, Ariz. 212,128 293 1.38 12 Meridian, Miss. 100,948 136 1.35 13 Springfield, Mass. 631,761 839 1.33 14 New Haven, Conn. 857,620 1,109 1.29 15 Rio Grande City, Texas 64,525 81 1.26 0.025 0.05 0.1 0.2 0.3 0.4 Limited to areas with at least 50,000 people.\n\nAs the pandemic progresses, the number of cases and deaths per capita can provide a good measure of the prevalence of coronavirus in a community, even if the deadliest period of the outbreak has passed, as it may have in places like Seattle, New York and New Orleans.\n\nThere are other measurements that would be helpful in understanding the progress of the epidemic in different places, such as the number of new hospitalizations, the number of tests administered or the number of people showing any symptoms of respiratory illness. But confirmed coronavirus cases and deaths, however incomplete, are the most useful daily statistics currently available at a local level everywhere in the country.'	b'Monitoring the Coronavirus Outbreak in Metro Areas Across the U.S.'	2020-04-23	[b'The New York Times']	[b'cases', b'city', b'areas', b'decreasing', b'texas', b'area', b'coronavirus', b'york', b'14', b'monitoring', b'flat', b'metro', b'outbreak', b'deaths']	b'To help provide a detailed picture of the past, present and future of the coronavirus pandemic in the United States, here are four ways of thinking about it in hundreds of metro areas across the country, using data compiled by The New York Times.

Doctors and scientists are scrambling to find treatments and drugs that can save the lives of infected people and perhaps even prevent them from getting sick in the first place.\n\nBelow is an updated list of 20 of the most-talked-about treatments for the coronavirus. While some are accumulating evidence that theyre effective, most are still at early stages of research. We also included a warning about a few that are just bunk.\n\nWe are following 20 coronavirus treatments for effectiveness and safety: 2 2 11 2 3 Widely used Promising evidence Tentative or mixed evidence Not promising Pseudoscience or fraud We are following 20 coronavirus treatments for effectiveness and safety: 2 11 2 Promising evidence Tentative or mixed evidence 2 3 Widely used Not promising Pseudoscience or fraud We are following 20 coronavirus treatments for effectiveness and safety: 2 11 2 Promising evidence Mixed evidence 2 3 Widely used Not promising Pseudoscience or fraud\n\nThere is no cure yet for Covid-19. And even the most promising treatments to date only help certain groups of patients and await validation from further trials. The F.D.A. has not fully licensed any treatment specifically for the coronavirus. Although it has granted emergency use authorization to some treatments, their effectiveness against Covid-19 has yet to be demonstrated in large-scale, randomized clinical trials.\n\nThis list provides a snapshot of the latest research on the coronavirus, but does not constitute medical endorsements. Always consult your doctor about treatments for Covid-19. New additions and recent updates:  Added ivermectin, a drug typically used against parasitic worms that is being increasingly prescribed in Latin America.  Updated descriptions for several treatments.\n\nWe will update and expand the list as new evidence emerges. For details on evaluating treatments, see the N.I.H. Covid-19 Treatment Guidelines. For the current status of vaccine development, see our Coronavirus Vaccine Tracker.\n\nWhat the Labels Mean\n\nWIDELY USED: These treatments have been used widely by doctors and nurses to treat patients hospitalized for diseases that affect the respiratory system, including Covid-19.\n\nPROMISING EVIDENCE: Early evidence from studies on patients suggests effectiveness, but more research is needed. This category includes treatments that have shown improvements in morbidity, mortality and recovery in at least one randomized controlled trial, in which some people get a treatment and others get a placebo.\n\nTENTATIVE OR MIXED EVIDENCE: Some treatments show promising results in cells or animals, which need to be confirmed in people. Others have yielded encouraging results in retrospective studies in humans, which look at existing datasets rather than starting a new trial. Some treatments have produced different results in different experiments, raising the need for larger, more rigorously designed studies to clear up the confusion.\n\nNOT PROMISING: Early evidence suggests that these treatments do not work.\n\nPSEUDOSCIENCE OR FRAUD: These are not treatments that researchers have ever considered using for Covid-19. Experts have warned against trying them, because they do not help against the disease and can instead be dangerous. Some people have even been arrested for their false promises of a Covid-19 cure.\n\nEVIDENCE IN CELLS, ANIMALS or HUMANS: These labels indicate where the evidence for a treatment comes from. Researchers often start out with experiments on cells and then move onto animals. Many of those animal experiments often fail; if they dont, researchers may consider moving on to research on humans, such as retrospective studies or randomized clinical trials. In some cases, scientists are testing out treatments that were developed for other diseases, allowing them to move directly to human trials for Covid-19.\n\nFilter the list of treatments:\n\nAll treatments Widely used\n\nPromising Tentative or mixed Not promising Pseudoscience\n\nBlocking the Virus\n\nAntivirals can stop viruses such as H.I.V. and hepatitis C from hijacking our cells. Scientists are searching for antivirals that work against the new coronavirus.\n\nPROMISING EVIDENCE EVIDENCE IN CELLS, ANIMALS AND HUMANS EMERGENCY USE AUTHORIZATION\n\nRemdesivir\n\nRemdesivir, made by Gilead Sciences, was the first drug to get emergency authorization from the F.D.A. for use on Covid-19. It stops viruses from replicating by inserting itself into new viral genes. Remdesivir was originally tested as an antiviral against Ebola and Hepatitis C, only to deliver lackluster results. But preliminary data from trials that began this spring suggested the drug can reduce the recovery time of people hospitalized with Covid-19 from 15 to 11 days. (The study defined recovery as either discharge from the hospital or hospitalization for infection-control purposes only.) These early results did not show any effect on mortality, though retrospective data released in July hints that the drug might reduce death rates among those who are very ill.\n\nTENTATIVE OR MIXED EVIDENCE EVIDENCE IN CELLS, ANIMALS AND HUMANS\n\nFavipiravir\n\nOriginally designed to beat back influenza, favipiravir blocks a viruss ability to copy its genetic material. A small study in March indicated the drug might help purge the coronavirus from the airway, but results from larger, well-designed clinical trials are still pending.\n\nTENTATIVE OR MIXED EVIDENCE EVIDENCE IN CELLS, ANIMALS AND HUMANS\n\nMK-4482\n\nAnother antiviral originally designed to fight the flu, MK-4482 (previously known as EIDD-2801) has had promising results against the new coronavirus in studies in cells and on animals. Merck, which has been running clinical trials on the drug this summer, has announced it will launch a large Phase III trial in September.\n\n\n\nTENTATIVE OR MIXED EVIDENCE EVIDENCE IN CELLS\n\nRecombinant ACE-2\n\nTo enter cells, the coronavirus must first unlock them  a feat it accomplishes by latching onto a human protein called ACE-2. Scientists have created artificial ACE-2 proteins which might be able to act as decoys, luring the coronavirus away from vulnerable cells. Recombinant ACE-2 proteins have shown promising results in experiments on cells, but not yet in animals or people.\n\nTENTATIVE OR MIXED EVIDENCE EVIDENCE IN CELLS AND HUMANS\n\nIvermectin\n\nFor decades, ivermectin has served as a potent drug to treat parasitic worms. Doctors use it against river blindness and other diseases, while veterinarians give dogs a different formulation to cure heartworm. Studies on cells have suggested ivermectin might also kill viruses. But scientists have yet to find evidence in animal studies or human trials that it can treat viral diseases. As a result, Ivermectin is not approved to use as an antiviral.\n\n\n\nIn April, Australian researchers reported that the drug blocked coronaviruses in cell cultures, but they used a dosage that was so high it might have dangerous side effects in people. The FDA immediately issued a warning against taking pet medications to treat or prevent Covid-19. These animal drugs can cause serious harm in people, the agency warned.\n\n\n\nSince then a number of clinical trials have been launched to see if a safe dose of ivermectin can fight Covid-19. In Singapore, for example, the National University Hospital is running a 5,000-person trial to see if it can prevent people from getting infected. As of now, theres no firm evidence that it works. Nevertheless ivermectin is being prescribed increasingly often in Latin America, much to the distress of disease experts.\n\n\n\nNOT PROMISING EVIDENCE IN CELLS AND HUMANS\n\nLopinavir and ritonavir\n\nTwenty years ago, the F.D.A. approved this combination of drugs to treat H.I.V. Recently, researchers tried them out on the new coronavirus and found that they stopped the virus from replicating. But clinical trials in patients proved disappointing. In early July, the World Health Organization suspended trials on patients hospitalized for Covid-19. They didnt rule out studies to see if the drugs could help patients not sick enough to be hospitalized, or to prevent people exposed to the new coronavirus from falling ill. The drug could also still have a role to play in certain combination treatments.\n\nNOT PROMISING EVIDENCE IN CELLS, ANIMALS AND HUMANS\n\nHydroxychloroquine and chloroquine\n\nGerman chemists synthesized chloroquine in the 1930s as a drug against malaria. A less toxic version, called hydroxychloroquine, was invented in 1946, and later was approved for other diseases such as lupus and rheumatoid arthritis. At the start of the Covid-19 pandemic, researchers discovered that both drugs could stop the coronavirus from replicating in cells.\n\n\n\nSince then, theyve had a tumultuous ride. A few small studies on patients offered some hope that hydroxychloroquine could treat Covid-19. The World Health Organization launched a randomized clinical trial in March to see if it was indeed safe and effective for Covid-19, as did Novartis and a number of universities. Meanwhile, President Trump repeatedly promoted hydroxychloroquine at press conferences, touting it as a game changer, and even took it himself. The F.D.A. temporarily granted hydroxychloroquine emergency authorization for use in Covid-19 patients  which a whistleblower later claimed was the result of political pressure. In the wake of the drugs newfound publicity, demand spiked, resulting in shortages for people who rely on hydroxychloroquine as a treatment for other diseases.\n\n\n\nBut more detailed studies proved disappointing. A study on monkeys found that hydroxychloroquine didnt prevent the animals from getting infected and didnt clear the virus once they got sick. Randomized clinical trials found that hydroxychloroquine didnt help people with Covid-19 get better or prevent healthy people from contracting the coronavirus. Another randomized clinical trial found that giving hydroxychloroquine to people right after being diagnosed with Covid-19 didnt reduce the severity of their disease. (One large-scale study that concluded the drug was harmful as well was later retracted.) The World Health Organization, the National Institutes of Health and Novartis have since halted trials investigating hydroxychloroquine as a treatment for Covid-19, and the F.D.A. revoked its emergency approval. The F.D.A. now warns that the drug can cause a host of serious side effects to the heart and other organs when used to treat Covid-19.\n\n\n\nIn July, researchers at Henry Ford hospital in Detroit published a study finding that hydroxychloroquine was associated with a reduction in mortality in Covid-19 patients. President Trump praised the study on Twitter, but experts raised doubts about it. The study was not a randomized controlled trial, in which some people got a placebo instead of hydroxychloroquine. The studys results might not be due to the drug killing the virus. Instead, doctors may have given the drug to people who were less sick, and thus more likely to recover anyway.\n\n\n\nDespite negative results, a number of hydroxychloroquine trials have continued, although most are small, testing a few dozen or a few hundred patients. A recent analysis by STAT and Applied XL found more than 180 ongoing clinical trials testing hydroxychloroquine or chloroquine, for treating or preventing Covid-19. Although its clear the drugs are no panacea, its theoretically possible they could provide some benefit in combination with other treatments, or when given in early stages of the disease. Only well-designed trials can determine if thats the case.\n\n\n\nMimicking the Immune System\n\nMost people who get Covid-19 successfully fight off the virus with a strong immune response. Drugs might help people who cant mount an adequate defense.\n\nTENTATIVE OR MIXED EVIDENCE EVIDENCE IN CELLS AND HUMANS\n\nConvalescent plasma\n\nA century ago, doctors filtered plasma from the blood of recovered flu patients. So-called convalescent plasma, rich with antibodies, helped people sick with flu fight their illness. Now researchers are trying out this strategy on Covid-19. In May, the F.D.A. designated convalescent plasma an investigational product. That means that despite not yet being shown as safe and effective, plasma can be used in clinical trials and given to some patients who are seriously ill with Covid-19. Tens of thousands of patients in the U.S. have received plasma through a program launched by the Mayo Clinic and the federal government.\n\n\n\nThe Trump administration has praised convalescent plasma, despite the lack of evidence yet that it works. The first wave of trials have been small and the results have been mixed. Large randomized clinical trials are underway, but theyve struggled to enroll enough participants, some of whom worry they will receive a placebo instead of the treatment itself.\n\n\n\nExperts say that its vital to complete these trials to determine if convalescent plasma is safe and effective. If these trials are successful, it could serve as an important stopgap measure until more potent therapies become widely available.\n\n\n\nTENTATIVE OR MIXED EVIDENCE EVIDENCE IN CELLS, ANIMALS AND HUMANS\n\nMonoclonal antibodies\n\nConvalescent plasma from people who recover from Covid-19 contains a mix of different antibodies. Some of the molecules can attack the coronavirus, but many are directed at other pathogens. Researchers have sifted through this slurry to find the most potent antibodies against Covid-19. They have then manufactured synthetic copies of these molecules, known as monoclonal antibodies. Researchers have begun investigating them as a treatment for Covid-19, either individually or in cocktails.\n\n\n\nMonoclonal antibodies were first developed as a therapy in the 1970s, and since then the F.D.A. has approved them for 79 diseases, ranging from cancer to AIDS. Since the start of the pandemic, researchers have found dozens of monoclonal antibodies that show promise against Covid-19 in preclinical studies on cells and animals. Companies like Eli Lilly and Regeneron recently began clinical trials studying monoclonal antibodies. Several other firms, as well as teams at universities, are slated to enter the race soon as well.\n\n\n\nTENTATIVE OR MIXED EVIDENCE EVIDENCE IN CELLS, ANIMALS AND HUMANS\n\nInterferons\n\nInterferons are molecules our cells naturally produce in response to viruses. They have profound effects on the immune system, rousing it to attack the invaders, while also reining it in to avoid damaging the bodys own tissues. Injecting synthetic interferons is now a standard treatment for a number of immune disorders. Rebif, for example, is prescribed for multiple sclerosis.\n\n\n\nAs part of its strategy to attack our bodies, the coronavirus appears to tamp down interferon. That finding has encouraged researchers to see whether a boost of interferon might help people weather Covid-19, particularly early in infection. Early studies, including experiments in cells and mice, have yielded encouraging results that have led to clinical trials.\n\n\n\nAn open-label study in China suggested that the molecules could help prevent healthy people from getting infected. On July 20, the British pharmaceutical company Synairgen announced that an inhaled form of interferon called SNG001 lowered the risk of severe Covid-19 in infected patients in a small clinical trial. The full data have not yet been released to the public, or published in a scientific journal. On August 6, the National Institute of Allergy and Infectious Diseases launched a Phase III trial on a combination of Rebif and the antiviral remdesivir, with results expected by fall 2020.\n\n\n\nPutting Out Friendly Fire\n\nThe most severe symptoms of Covid-19 are the result of the immune systems overreaction to the virus. Scientists are testing drugs that can rein in its attack.\n\nPROMISING EVIDENCE EVIDENCE IN HUMANS\n\nDexamethasone\n\nThis cheap and widely available steroid blunts many types of immune responses. Doctors have long used it to treat allergies, asthma and inflammation. In June, it became the first drug shown to reduce Covid-19 deaths. That study of more than 6,000 people, which in July was published in the New England Journal of Medicine, found that dexamethasone reduced deaths by one-third in patients on ventilators, and by one-fifth in patients on oxygen. It may be less likely to help  and may even harm  patients who are at an earlier stage of Covid-19 infections, however. In its Covid-19 treatment guidelines, the National Institutes of Health recommends only using dexamethasone in patients with COVID-19 who are on a ventilator or are receiving supplemental oxygen.\n\nTENTATIVE OR MIXED EVIDENCE EVIDENCE IN HUMANS\n\nCytokine Inhibitors\n\nThe body produces signaling molecules called cytokines to fight off diseases. But manufactured in excess, cytokines can trigger the immune system to wildly overreact to infections, in a process sometimes called a cytokine storm. Researchers have created a number of drugs to halt cytokine storms, and they have proven effective against arthritis and other inflammatory disorders. Some turn off the supply of molecules that launch the production of the cytokines themselves. Others block the receptors on immune cells to which cytokines would normally bind. A few block the cellular messages they send. Depending on how the drugs are formulated, they can block one cytokine at a time, or muffle signals from several at once.\n\n\n\nAgainst the coronavirus, several of these drugs have offered modest help in some trials, but faltered in others. Drug companies Regeneron and Roche drug both recently announced that two drugs called sarilumab and tocilizumab, which both target the cytokine IL-6, did not appear to benefit patients in Phase 3 clinical trials. Many other trials remain underway, several of which combine cytokine inhibitors with other treatments.\n\n\n\nTENTATIVE OR MIXED EVIDENCE EVIDENCE IN HUMANS EMERGENCY USE AUTHORIZATION\n\nBlood filtration systems\n\nThe F.D.A. has granted emergency use authorization to several devices that filter cytokines from the blood in an attempt to cool cytokine storms. One machine, called Cytosorb, can reportedly purify a patients entire blood supply about 70 times in a 24-hour period. A small study in March suggested that Cytosorb had helped dozens of severely ill Covid-19 patients in Europe and China, but it was not a randomized clinical trial that could conclusively demonstrate it was effective. A number of studies on blood filtration systems are underway, but experts caution that these devices carry some risks. For example, such filters could remove beneficial components of blood as well, such as vitamins or medications.\n\n\n\nTENTATIVE OR MIXED EVIDENCE EVIDENCE IN HUMANS\n\nStem cells\n\nCertain kinds of stem cells can secrete anti-inflammatory molecules. Over the years, researchers have tried to use them as a treatment for cytokine storms, and now dozens of clinical trials are under way to see if they can help patients with Covid-19. But these stem cell treatments havent worked well in the past, and its not clear yet if theyll work against the coronavirus.\n\nOther Treatments\n\nDoctors and nurses often administer other supportive treatments to help patients with Covid-19.\n\nWIDELY USED\n\nProne positioning\n\nThe simple act of flipping Covid-19 patients onto their bellies opens up the lungs. The maneuver has become commonplace in hospitals around the world since the start of the pandemic. It might help some individuals avoid the need for ventilators entirely. The treatments benefits continue to be tested in a range of clinical trials.\n\nWIDELY USED EMERGENCY USE AUTHORIZATION\n\nVentilators and other respiratory support devices\n\nDevices that help people breathe are an essential tool in the fight against deadly respiratory illnesses. Some patients do well if they get an extra supply of oxygen through the nose or via a mask connected to an oxygen machine. Patients in severe respiratory distress may need to have a ventilator breathe for them until their lungs heal. Doctors are divided about how long to treat patients with noninvasive oxygen before deciding whether or not they need a ventilator. Not all Covid-19 patients who go on ventilators survive, but the devices are thought to be lifesaving in many cases.\n\nTENTATIVE OR MIXED EVIDENCE EVIDENCE IN HUMANS\n\nAnticoagulants\n\nThe coronavirus can invade cells in the lining of blood vessels, leading to tiny clots that can cause strokes and other serious harm. Anticoagulants are commonly used for other conditions, such as heart disease, to slow the formation of clots, and doctors sometimes use them on patients with Covid-19 who have clots. Many clinical trials teasing out this relationship are now underway. Some of these trials are looking at whether giving anticoagulants before any sign of clotting is beneficial.\n\nPseudoscience and Fraud\n\nFalse claims about Covid-19 cures abound. The F.D.A. maintains a list of more than 80 fraudulent Covid-19 products, and the W.H.O. debunks many myths about the disease.\n\nWARNING: DO NOT DO THIS\n\nDrinking or injecting bleach and disinfectants\n\nIn April, President Trump suggested that disinfectants such as alcohol or bleach might be effective against the coronavirus if directly injected into the body. His comments were immediately refuted by health professionals and researchers around the world  as well as the makers of Lysol and Clorox. Ingesting disinfectant would not only be ineffective against the virus, but also hazardous  possibly even deadly. In July, Federal prosecutors charged four Florida men with marketing bleach as a cure for COVID-19.\n\nWARNING: NO EVIDENCE\n\nUV light\n\nPresident Trump also speculated about hitting the body with ultraviolet or just very powerful light. Researchers have used UV light to sterilize surfaces, including killing viruses, in carefully managed laboratories. But UV light would not be able to purge the virus from within a sick persons body. This kind of radiation can also damage the skin. Most skin cancers are a result of exposure to the UV rays naturally present in sunlight.\n\nWARNING: NO EVIDENCE\n\nSilver\n\nThe F.D.A. has threatened legal action against a host of people claiming silver-based products are safe and effective against Covid-19  including televangelist Jim Bakker and InfoWars host Alex Jones. Several metals do have natural antimicrobial properties. But products made from them have not been shown to prevent or treat the coronavirus.\n\nTracking the Coronavirus\n\n\n\n\n\nNote: After additional discussions with experts we have adjusted several labels on the tracker. The Strong evidence label has been removed until further research identifies treatments that consistently benefit groups of patients infected by the coronavirus. In its place, Promising evidence will be used for drugs such as remdesivir and dexamethasone that have shown promise in at least one randomized controlled trial, and Widely used for treatments such as proning and ventilators that are often used with severely ill patients, including those with Covid-19. And we may reintroduce the Ineffective label when ongoing clinical trials repeatedly end with disappointing results.\n\nSources: National Library of Medicine; National Institutes of Health; William Amarquaye, University of South Florida; Paul Bieniasz, Rockefeller University; Jeremy Faust, Brigham & Womens Hospital; Matt Frieman, University of Maryland School of Medicine; Noah Haber, Stanford University; Swapnil Hiremath, University of Ottawa; Akiko Iwasaki, Yale University; Paul Knoepfler, University of California, Davis; Elena Massarotti, Brigham and Womens Hospital; John Moore and Douglas Nixon, Weill Cornell Medical College; Erica Ollman Saphire, La Jolla Institute for Immunology; Regina Rabinovich, Harvard T.H.

We also included a warning about a few that are just bunk.\n\nWe are following 20 coronavirus treatments for effectiveness and safety: 2 2 11 2 3 Widely used Promising evidence Tentative or mixed evidence Not promising Pseudoscience or fraud We are following 20 coronavirus treatments for effectiveness and safety: 2 11 2 Promising evidence Tentative or mixed evidence 2 3 Widely used Not promising Pseudoscience or fraud We are following 20 coronavirus treatments for effectiveness and safety: 2 11 2 Promising evidence Mixed evidence 2 3 Widely used Not promising Pseudoscience or fraud\n\nThere is no cure yet for Covid-19. And even the most promising treatments to date only help certain groups of patients and await validation from further trials. The F.D.A. has not fully licensed any treatment specifically for the coronavirus. Although it has granted emergency use authorization to some treatments, their effectiveness against Covid-19 has yet to be demonstrated in large-scale, randomized clinical trials.\n\nThis list provides a snapshot of the latest research on the coronavirus, but does not constitute medical endorsements. Always consult your doctor about treatments for Covid-19. New additions and recent updates:  Added ivermectin, a drug typically used against parasitic worms that is being increasingly prescribed in Latin America.  Updated descriptions for several treatments.\n\nWe will update and expand the list as new evidence emerges. For details on evaluating treatments, see the N.I.H. Covid-19 Treatment Guidelines. For the current status of vaccine development, see our Coronavirus Vaccine Tracker.\n\nWhat the Labels Mean\n\nWIDELY USED: These treatments have been used widely by doctors and nurses to treat patients hospitalized for diseases that affect the respiratory system, including Covid-19.\n\nPROMISING EVIDENCE: Early evidence from studies on patients suggests effectiveness, but more research is needed. This category includes treatments that have shown improvements in morbidity, mortality and recovery in at least one randomized controlled trial, in which some people get a treatment and others get a placebo.\n\nTENTATIVE OR MIXED EVIDENCE: Some treatments show promising results in cells or animals, which need to be confirmed in people. Others have yielded encouraging results in retrospective studies in humans, which look at existing datasets rather than starting a new trial. Some treatments have produced different results in different experiments, raising the need for larger, more rigorously designed studies to clear up the confusion.\n\nNOT PROMISING: Early evidence suggests that these treatments do not work.\n\nPSEUDOSCIENCE OR FRAUD: These are not treatments that researchers have ever considered using for Covid-19. Experts have warned against trying them, because they do not help against the disease and can instead be dangerous. Some people have even been arrested for their false promises of a Covid-19 cure.\n\nEVIDENCE IN CELLS, ANIMALS or HUMANS: These labels indicate where the evidence for a treatment comes from. Researchers often start out with experiments on cells and then move onto animals. Many of those animal experiments often fail; if they dont, researchers may consider moving on to research on humans, such as retrospective studies or randomized clinical trials. In some cases, scientists are testing out treatments that were developed for other diseases, allowing them to move directly to human trials for Covid-19.\n\nFilter the list of treatments:\n\nAll treatments Widely used\n\nPromising Tentative or mixed Not promising Pseudoscience\n\nBlocking the Virus\n\nAntivirals can stop viruses such as H.I.V. and hepatitis C from hijacking our cells. Scientists are searching for antivirals that work against the new coronavirus.\n\nPROMISING EVIDENCE EVIDENCE IN CELLS, ANIMALS AND HUMANS EMERGENCY USE AUTHORIZATION\n\nRemdesivir\n\nRemdesivir, made by Gilead Sciences, was the first drug to get emergency authorization from the F.D.A. for use on Covid-19. It stops viruses from replicating by inserting itself into new viral genes. Remdesivir was originally tested as an antiviral against Ebola and Hepatitis C, only to deliver lackluster results. But preliminary data from trials that began this spring suggested the drug can reduce the recovery time of people hospitalized with Covid-19 from 15 to 11 days. (The study defined recovery as either discharge from the hospital or hospitalization for infection-control purposes only.) These early results did not show any effect on mortality, though retrospective data released in July hints that the drug might reduce death rates among those who are very ill.\n\nTENTATIVE OR MIXED EVIDENCE EVIDENCE IN CELLS, ANIMALS AND HUMANS\n\nFavipiravir\n\nOriginally designed to beat back influenza, favipiravir blocks a viruss ability to copy its genetic material. A small study in March indicated the drug might help purge the coronavirus from the airway, but results from larger, well-designed clinical trials are still pending.\n\nTENTATIVE OR MIXED EVIDENCE EVIDENCE IN CELLS, ANIMALS AND HUMANS\n\nMK-4482\n\nAnother antiviral originally designed to fight the flu, MK-4482 (previously known as EIDD-2801) has had promising results against the new coronavirus in studies in cells and on animals. Merck, which has been running clinical trials on the drug this summer, has announced it will launch a large Phase III trial in September.\n\n\n\nTENTATIVE OR MIXED EVIDENCE EVIDENCE IN CELLS\n\nRecombinant ACE-2\n\nTo enter cells, the coronavirus must first unlock them  a feat it accomplishes by latching onto a human protein called ACE-2. Scientists have created artificial ACE-2 proteins which might be able to act as decoys, luring the coronavirus away from vulnerable cells. Recombinant ACE-2 proteins have shown promising results in experiments on cells, but not yet in animals or people.\n\nTENTATIVE OR MIXED EVIDENCE EVIDENCE IN CELLS AND HUMANS\n\nIvermectin\n\nFor decades, ivermectin has served as a potent drug to treat parasitic worms. Doctors use it against river blindness and other diseases, while veterinarians give dogs a different formulation to cure heartworm. Studies on cells have suggested ivermectin might also kill viruses. But scientists have yet to find evidence in animal studies or human trials that it can treat viral diseases. As a result, Ivermectin is not approved to use as an antiviral.\n\n\n\nIn April, Australian researchers reported that the drug blocked coronaviruses in cell cultures, but they used a dosage that was so high it might have dangerous side effects in people. The FDA immediately issued a warning against taking pet medications to treat or prevent Covid-19. These animal drugs can cause serious harm in people, the agency warned.\n\n\n\nSince then a number of clinical trials have been launched to see if a safe dose of ivermectin can fight Covid-19. In Singapore, for example, the National University Hospital is running a 5,000-person trial to see if it can prevent people from getting infected. As of now, theres no firm evidence that it works. Nevertheless ivermectin is being prescribed increasingly often in Latin America, much to the distress of disease experts.\n\n\n\nNOT PROMISING EVIDENCE IN CELLS AND HUMANS\n\nLopinavir and ritonavir\n\nTwenty years ago, the F.D.A. approved this combination of drugs to treat H.I.V. Recently, researchers tried them out on the new coronavirus and found that they stopped the virus from replicating. But clinical trials in patients proved disappointing. In early July, the World Health Organization suspended trials on patients hospitalized for Covid-19. They didnt rule out studies to see if the drugs could help patients not sick enough to be hospitalized, or to prevent people exposed to the new coronavirus from falling ill. The drug could also still have a role to play in certain combination treatments.\n\nNOT PROMISING EVIDENCE IN CELLS, ANIMALS AND HUMANS\n\nHydroxychloroquine and chloroquine\n\nGerman chemists synthesized chloroquine in the 1930s as a drug against malaria. A less toxic version, called hydroxychloroquine, was invented in 1946, and later was approved for other diseases such as lupus and rheumatoid arthritis. At the start of the Covid-19 pandemic, researchers discovered that both drugs could stop the coronavirus from replicating in cells.\n\n\n\nSince then, theyve had a tumultuous ride. A few small studies on patients offered some hope that hydroxychloroquine could treat Covid-19. The World Health Organization launched a randomized clinical trial in March to see if it was indeed safe and effective for Covid-19, as did Novartis and a number of universities. Meanwhile, President Trump repeatedly promoted hydroxychloroquine at press conferences, touting it as a game changer, and even took it himself. The F.D.A. temporarily granted hydroxychloroquine emergency authorization for use in Covid-19 patients  which a whistleblower later claimed was the result of political pressure. In the wake of the drugs newfound publicity, demand spiked, resulting in shortages for people who rely on hydroxychloroquine as a treatment for other diseases.\n\n\n\nBut more detailed studies proved disappointing. A study on monkeys found that hydroxychloroquine didnt prevent the animals from getting infected and didnt clear the virus once they got sick. Randomized clinical trials found that hydroxychloroquine didnt help people with Covid-19 get better or prevent healthy people from contracting the coronavirus. Another randomized clinical trial found that giving hydroxychloroquine to people right after being diagnosed with Covid-19 didnt reduce the severity of their disease. (One large-scale study that concluded the drug was harmful as well was later retracted.) The World Health Organization, the National Institutes of Health and Novartis have since halted trials investigating hydroxychloroquine as a treatment for Covid-19, and the F.D.A. revoked its emergency approval. The F.D.A. now warns that the drug can cause a host of serious side effects to the heart and other organs when used to treat Covid-19.\n\n\n\nIn July, researchers at Henry Ford hospital in Detroit published a study finding that hydroxychloroquine was associated with a reduction in mortality in Covid-19 patients. President Trump praised the study on Twitter, but experts raised doubts about it. The study was not a randomized controlled trial, in which some people got a placebo instead of hydroxychloroquine. The studys results might not be due to the drug killing the virus. Instead, doctors may have given the drug to people who were less sick, and thus more likely to recover anyway.\n\n\n\nDespite negative results, a number of hydroxychloroquine trials have continued, although most are small, testing a few dozen or a few hundred patients. A recent analysis by STAT and Applied XL found more than 180 ongoing clinical trials testing hydroxychloroquine or chloroquine, for treating or preventing Covid-19. Although its clear the drugs are no panacea, its theoretically possible they could provide some benefit in combination with other treatments, or when given in early stages of the disease. Only well-designed trials can determine if thats the case.\n\n\n\nMimicking the Immune System\n\nMost people who get Covid-19 successfully fight off the virus with a strong immune response. Drugs might help people who cant mount an adequate defense.\n\nTENTATIVE OR MIXED EVIDENCE EVIDENCE IN CELLS AND HUMANS\n\nConvalescent plasma\n\nA century ago, doctors filtered plasma from the blood of recovered flu patients. So-called convalescent plasma, rich with antibodies, helped people sick with flu fight their illness. Now researchers are trying out this strategy on Covid-19. In May, the F.D.A. designated convalescent plasma an investigational product. That means that despite not yet being shown as safe and effective, plasma can be used in clinical trials and given to some patients who are seriously ill with Covid-19. Tens of thousands of patients in the U.S. have received plasma through a program launched by the Mayo Clinic and the federal government.\n\n\n\nThe Trump administration has praised convalescent plasma, despite the lack of evidence yet that it works. The first wave of trials have been small and the results have been mixed. Large randomized clinical trials are underway, but theyve struggled to enroll enough participants, some of whom worry they will receive a placebo instead of the treatment itself.\n\n\n\nExperts say that its vital to complete these trials to determine if convalescent plasma is safe and effective. If these trials are successful, it could serve as an important stopgap measure until more potent therapies become widely available.\n\n\n\nTENTATIVE OR MIXED EVIDENCE EVIDENCE IN CELLS, ANIMALS AND HUMANS\n\nMonoclonal antibodies\n\nConvalescent plasma from people who recover from Covid-19 contains a mix of different antibodies. Some of the molecules can attack the coronavirus, but many are directed at other pathogens. Researchers have sifted through this slurry to find the most potent antibodies against Covid-19. They have then manufactured synthetic copies of these molecules, known as monoclonal antibodies. Researchers have begun investigating them as a treatment for Covid-19, either individually or in cocktails.\n\n\n\nMonoclonal antibodies were first developed as a therapy in the 1970s, and since then the F.D.A. has approved them for 79 diseases, ranging from cancer to AIDS. Since the start of the pandemic, researchers have found dozens of monoclonal antibodies that show promise against Covid-19 in preclinical studies on cells and animals. Companies like Eli Lilly and Regeneron recently began clinical trials studying monoclonal antibodies. Several other firms, as well as teams at universities, are slated to enter the race soon as well.\n\n\n\nTENTATIVE OR MIXED EVIDENCE EVIDENCE IN CELLS, ANIMALS AND HUMANS\n\nInterferons\n\nInterferons are molecules our cells naturally produce in response to viruses. They have profound effects on the immune system, rousing it to attack the invaders, while also reining it in to avoid damaging the bodys own tissues. Injecting synthetic interferons is now a standard treatment for a number of immune disorders. Rebif, for example, is prescribed for multiple sclerosis.\n\n\n\nAs part of its strategy to attack our bodies, the coronavirus appears to tamp down interferon. That finding has encouraged researchers to see whether a boost of interferon might help people weather Covid-19, particularly early in infection. Early studies, including experiments in cells and mice, have yielded encouraging results that have led to clinical trials.\n\n\n\nAn open-label study in China suggested that the molecules could help prevent healthy people from getting infected. On July 20, the British pharmaceutical company Synairgen announced that an inhaled form of interferon called SNG001 lowered the risk of severe Covid-19 in infected patients in a small clinical trial. The full data have not yet been released to the public, or published in a scientific journal. On August 6, the National Institute of Allergy and Infectious Diseases launched a Phase III trial on a combination of Rebif and the antiviral remdesivir, with results expected by fall 2020.\n\n\n\nPutting Out Friendly Fire\n\nThe most severe symptoms of Covid-19 are the result of the immune systems overreaction to the virus. Scientists are testing drugs that can rein in its attack.\n\nPROMISING EVIDENCE EVIDENCE IN HUMANS\n\nDexamethasone\n\nThis cheap and widely available steroid blunts many types of immune responses. Doctors have long used it to treat allergies, asthma and inflammation. In June, it became the first drug shown to reduce Covid-19 deaths. That study of more than 6,000 people, which in July was published in the New England Journal of Medicine, found that dexamethasone reduced deaths by one-third in patients on ventilators, and by one-fifth in patients on oxygen. It may be less likely to help  and may even harm  patients who are at an earlier stage of Covid-19 infections, however. In its Covid-19 treatment guidelines, the National Institutes of Health recommends only using dexamethasone in patients with COVID-19 who are on a ventilator or are receiving supplemental oxygen.\n\nTENTATIVE OR MIXED EVIDENCE EVIDENCE IN HUMANS\n\nCytokine Inhibitors\n\nThe body produces signaling molecules called cytokines to fight off diseases. But manufactured in excess, cytokines can trigger the immune system to wildly overreact to infections, in a process sometimes called a cytokine storm. Researchers have created a number of drugs to halt cytokine storms, and they have proven effective against arthritis and other inflammatory disorders. Some turn off the supply of molecules that launch the production of the cytokines themselves. Others block the receptors on immune cells to which cytokines would normally bind. A few block the cellular messages they send. Depending on how the drugs are formulated, they can block one cytokine at a time, or muffle signals from several at once.\n\n\n\nAgainst the coronavirus, several of these drugs have offered modest help in some trials, but faltered in others. Drug companies Regeneron and Roche drug both recently announced that two drugs called sarilumab and tocilizumab, which both target the cytokine IL-6, did not appear to benefit patients in Phase 3 clinical trials. Many other trials remain underway, several of which combine cytokine inhibitors with other treatments.\n\n\n\nTENTATIVE OR MIXED EVIDENCE EVIDENCE IN HUMANS EMERGENCY USE AUTHORIZATION\n\nBlood filtration systems\n\nThe F.D.A. has granted emergency use authorization to several devices that filter cytokines from the blood in an attempt to cool cytokine storms. One machine, called Cytosorb, can reportedly purify a patients entire blood supply about 70 times in a 24-hour period. A small study in March suggested that Cytosorb had helped dozens of severely ill Covid-19 patients in Europe and China, but it was not a randomized clinical trial that could conclusively demonstrate it was effective. A number of studies on blood filtration systems are underway, but experts caution that these devices carry some risks. For example, such filters could remove beneficial components of blood as well, such as vitamins or medications.\n\n\n\nTENTATIVE OR MIXED EVIDENCE EVIDENCE IN HUMANS\n\nStem cells\n\nCertain kinds of stem cells can secrete anti-inflammatory molecules. Over the years, researchers have tried to use them as a treatment for cytokine storms, and now dozens of clinical trials are under way to see if they can help patients with Covid-19. But these stem cell treatments havent worked well in the past, and its not clear yet if theyll work against the coronavirus.\n\nOther Treatments\n\nDoctors and nurses often administer other supportive treatments to help patients with Covid-19.\n\nWIDELY USED\n\nProne positioning\n\nThe simple act of flipping Covid-19 patients onto their bellies opens up the lungs. The maneuver has become commonplace in hospitals around the world since the start of the pandemic. It might help some individuals avoid the need for ventilators entirely. The treatments benefits continue to be tested in a range of clinical trials.\n\nWIDELY USED EMERGENCY USE AUTHORIZATION\n\nVentilators and other respiratory support devices\n\nDevices that help people breathe are an essential tool in the fight against deadly respiratory illnesses. Some patients do well if they get an extra supply of oxygen through the nose or via a mask connected to an oxygen machine. Patients in severe respiratory distress may need to have a ventilator breathe for them until their lungs heal. Doctors are divided about how long to treat patients with noninvasive oxygen before deciding whether or not they need a ventilator. Not all Covid-19 patients who go on ventilators survive, but the devices are thought to be lifesaving in many cases.\n\nTENTATIVE OR MIXED EVIDENCE EVIDENCE IN HUMANS\n\nAnticoagulants\n\nThe coronavirus can invade cells in the lining of blood vessels, leading to tiny clots that can cause strokes and other serious harm. Anticoagulants are commonly used for other conditions, such as heart disease, to slow the formation of clots, and doctors sometimes use them on patients with Covid-19 who have clots. Many clinical trials teasing out this relationship are now underway. Some of these trials are looking at whether giving anticoagulants before any sign of clotting is beneficial.\n\nPseudoscience and Fraud\n\nFalse claims about Covid-19 cures abound. The F.D.A. maintains a list of more than 80 fraudulent Covid-19 products, and the W.H.O. debunks many myths about the disease.\n\nWARNING: DO NOT DO THIS\n\nDrinking or injecting bleach and disinfectants\n\nIn April, President Trump suggested that disinfectants such as alcohol or bleach might be effective against the coronavirus if directly injected into the body. His comments were immediately refuted by health professionals and researchers around the world  as well as the makers of Lysol and Clorox. Ingesting disinfectant would not only be ineffective against the virus, but also hazardous  possibly even deadly. In July, Federal prosecutors charged four Florida men with marketing bleach as a cure for COVID-19.\n\nWARNING: NO EVIDENCE\n\nUV light\n\nPresident Trump also speculated about hitting the body with ultraviolet or just very powerful light. Researchers have used UV light to sterilize surfaces, including killing viruses, in carefully managed laboratories. But UV light would not be able to purge the virus from within a sick persons body. This kind of radiation can also damage the skin. Most skin cancers are a result of exposure to the UV rays naturally present in sunlight.\n\nWARNING: NO EVIDENCE\n\nSilver\n\nThe F.D.A. has threatened legal action against a host of people claiming silver-based products are safe and effective against Covid-19  including televangelist Jim Bakker and InfoWars host Alex Jones. Several metals do have natural antimicrobial properties. But products made from them have not been shown to prevent or treat the coronavirus.\n\nTracking the Coronavirus\n\n\n\n\n\nNote: After additional discussions with experts we have adjusted several labels on the tracker. The Strong evidence label has been removed until further research identifies treatments that consistently benefit groups of patients infected by the coronavirus. In its place, Promising evidence will be used for drugs such as remdesivir and dexamethasone that have shown promise in at least one randomized controlled trial, and Widely used for treatments such as proning and ventilators that are often used with severely ill patients, including those with Covid-19. And we may reintroduce the Ineffective label when ongoing clinical trials repeatedly end with disappointing results.\n\nSources: National Library of Medicine; National Institutes of Health; William Amarquaye, University of South Florida; Paul Bieniasz, Rockefeller University; Jeremy Faust, Brigham & Womens Hospital; Matt Frieman, University of Maryland School of Medicine; Noah Haber, Stanford University; Swapnil Hiremath, University of Ottawa; Akiko Iwasaki, Yale University; Paul Knoepfler, University of California, Davis; Elena Massarotti, Brigham and Womens Hospital; John Moore and Douglas Nixon, Weill Cornell Medical College; Erica Ollman Saphire, La Jolla Institute for Immunology; Regina Rabinovich, Harvard T.H.

In very rare cases, it can cause a severe inflammatory response. Seek emergency care if a child shows any of these warning signs or symptoms that cause concern.\n\nThe virus also appears to attach to the insides of blood vessels, and in rare cases causes life-threatening blood clots that travel to the lungs, heart or brain. In very rare cases, clots can cut off blood flow in the limbs, requiring amputation. Patients sick enough to visit the hospital may be given blood thinning medications to prevent or treat blood clots.\n\nThe virus can show up in unusual ways across the body. Strange rashes  bumpy, smooth, itchy or innocuous  have been reported. In rare cases, the virus inflames joints or damages muscles in the thighs, shoulders or back, causing severe pain.\n\nSome patients develop Covid pneumonia as the virus attacks the lungs. Sometimes oxygen levels can drop so slowly that the patient doesnt notice. Short, rapid breathing or severe shortness of breath, particularly at rest, are signs that require urgent medical attention.\n\nPainful headache is common, but more serious neurological problems are less common or rare. Mild symptoms include dizziness or feeling lightheaded. Symptoms needing urgent care include confusion, an inability to wake, uncoordinated movement or signs of stroke like facial drooping, numbness or garbled speech.\n\nThe nose is ground zero for Covid-19.

Republicans also successfully blocked an executive order by Mr. Evers on Monday to use emergency powers to delay the election, after the State Supreme Court, which is controlled by conservatives, reversed Mr. Everss order.\n\nThe consequence was an election on Tuesday that was criticized as both unsafe and illegitimate. National figures like Senator Bernie Sanders of Vermont called for it to be delayed, and the leaders of the Democratic Party of Wisconsin  which was seeking to win a vital State Supreme Court seat  said it could not encourage people to vote in good faith.\n\nErin Baldeon Fischer, a 32-year-old graduate student, said she saw the line at her Milwaukee polling place on Tuesday and decided the health risk might be too great.\n\nI have a 9-month-old; Im not sure I feel comfortable being there with an infant at home, she said. Im not sure its a responsible decision as a mother.\n\nMary Corder, 70, usually votes in her senior assisted living facility, but decided she couldnt vote in this election after the location was shut down. Ms. Corder said she found out her polling place was closed only yesterday, after voting there for years.'

This is The Daily.\n\n[music]\n\nAgainst the advice of public health officials and the wishes of its own governor, Wisconsin will hold its democratic primary today in the middle of a pandemic. Astead Herndon on how that happened. Its Tuesday, April 7.\n\nastead herndon\n\nMarch was always going to be one of the most consequential months of the presidential election. By the time we get to the middle of March, though \n\narchived recording So heres what were watching. Breaking news. Louisiana officially could become the first state to postpone its Democratic primary election over the coronavirus pandemic.\n\nastead herndon\n\n it becomes clear that the coronavirus global health pandemic has really upended the race completely.\n\n[music]\n\nastead herndon\n\nAfter Super Tuesday, states that are scheduled to vote start postponing and sometimes outright canceling their scheduled primaries.\n\narchived recording 1 Georgia becoming the second state to delay its presidential primary. archived recording 2 Kentucky announced that theyd delay their contest as well. archived recording 3 Ohios governor pushed back its primary just hours before polls were set to open. archived recording 4 Other states  Connecticut, Indiana and Maryland.\n\nastead herndon\n\nThese are all states that said that the public health crisis was too great for them to hold in-person elections in March. But theres one state that refuses to budge, even as public health officials are urging them and states across the country have taken that drastic step. Its Wisconsin.\n\nmichael barbaro\n\nAnd what explains that? Whats happening in Wisconsin?\n\nastead herndon\n\nWell, when most people look at these presidential primaries, particularly in a state like Wisconsin, they think that this is just about the two candidates at the top  Joe Biden versus Bernie Sanders, and who gets the delegates out of that. But the reason why Wisconsin was holding out and keeping its primary schedule was really to do with more state and local concerns. Initially, the Democratic governor, Tony Evers, and state Republican leaders were on the same page. They both agreed that the April 7 election should go forward. And they said so for a couple reasons. Not only had the virus not really ravaged the state in the same way that we have seen in other parts of the country at the initial time in March when they were making this decision, but they agreed on the importance of the state and local races that would be decided down ballot on the same day of the presidential primary.\n\narchived recording (tony evers) I just want to make sure people understand the complexity of our spring general election. Its not a primary election. Its only a primary election for the presidential candidates.\n\nastead herndon\n\nRaces like sheriffs and mayors and court judges. Theres a particularly important Supreme Court race thats happening in the state. And both sides agreed that filling these roles was important for the continuance of state government.\n\narchived recording (tony evers) How long do we potentially leave offices not filled because were into July and August and we havent held a general election?\n\nastead herndon\n\nAnd thats why they proceeded with the primary.\n\narchived recording (robin vos) You know, I want to give credit to Governor Evers. I agree with his decision to say that we are going to hold this election.\n\nmichael barbaro\n\nHm. So despite the risks of holding an in-person primary in the middle of a pandemic, despite the fact that many states are postponing these primaries, the Republican and Democratic officials in Wisconsin say that this is necessary for the functioning of their government?\n\nastead herndon\n\nRight. And thats the position they held for about a week.\n\nmichael barbaro\n\nAnd what happens after a week?\n\nastead herndon\n\nWell, kind of most clearly, the factors around the decision changed.\n\narchived recording (tony evers) We need an all-hands-on-deck approach to stop the spread of Covid-19 in Wisconsin.\n\nastead herndon\n\nThe pandemic becomes more acutely felt in the Midwest and particularly in Wisconsin.\n\narchived recording (tony evers) And here is the bottom line  folks need to start taking this seriously. So today Im asking for your help.\n\nastead herndon\n\nAnd the governor issues a stay-at-home order like many other governors did across the country and closes all non-essential businesses.\n\narchived recording (tony evers) Its not something I wanted to do, and its not something I take lightly.\n\nastead herndon\n\nAnd people across the state are starting to say, well, if we cant leave our houses, how are we supposed to vote?\n\nmichael barbaro\n\nRight. And whats the answer?\n\nastead herndon\n\nThe governor and state Republicans keep holding this line that voting was something that was so essential, that the primary was something that was so important, that they would try to find some workarounds that included expanding access to absentee ballots and encouraging people to use that measure. It included counties taking precautionary measures which include maybe drive-through voting or socially distanced lines. But besides all of these creative measures, there is an increasing fear, particularly among poll workers, that the election would be unsafe for them to staff. These are people who, 90 percent of them are senior citizens.\n\nmichael barbaro\n\nPoll workers?\n\nastead herndon\n\nMm-hmm. One of the most vulnerable population to this deadly virus. And they start dropping off, informing their local jurisdictions that they dont think that they want to participate in the scheduled election. A survey from the Election Commission in the state showed that more than a hundred jurisdictions cannot adequately staff their polling locations, because they wouldnt have the right poll workers to do so.\n\nmichael barbaro\n\nWow.\n\nastead herndon\n\nThat becomes the first real point of pressure to say, how can this election go forward?\n\nmichael barbaro\n\nSo what do officials do in response to this severe shortage of poll workers?\n\nastead herndon\n\nWell, they go back to trying to find creative workarounds. So the first thing that some of the local jurisdictions do is close and limit their polling locations. Some of the more drastic examples include Milwaukee, the biggest city in the state, going from 180 polling locations, typically, down to just five or seven.\n\nmichael barbaro\n\nAnd yet everyone still seems committed to holding this election?\n\nastead herndon\n\nThey were, until the virus intensifies in the state and cases increase. As the deaths increase, thats when you see a real shift from the governor.\n\narchived recording (tony evers) Hi there, folks. Governor Evers here.\n\nastead herndon\n\nAnd its a big one.\n\narchived recording (tony evers) So today, Im asking the legislature to come together to take bipartisan action to ensure that every registered voter receives an absentee ballot to vote in the upcoming election.\n\nastead herndon\n\nHe proposes a dramatic expansion in the states absentee ballot voting system, essentially making it a universal vote-by-mail system.\n\narchived recording (tony evers) So I hope that the legislature will act swiftly to send absentee ballots to every single registered voter living in Wisconsin.\n\nastead herndon\n\nThe state would mail 3.3 million eligible voters a ballot, whether they requested it or not. And that represents a real change in how kind of the electoral process would work throughout the state.\n\narchived recording (tony evers) This is not a Republican issue or a Democratic issue. This is an issue of democracy. I dont care who gets the credit. I just want to make sure that everyone has a chance to cast their ballot this April. Thanks for watching, and lets get it done, folks.\n\nastead herndon\n\nAnd thats when we really see the partisan pushback start.\n\n[music]\n\nWhat began as a Democratic governor and a Republican state legislature that were basically on the same page has now devolved into what is, by all accounts, a partisan bloodbath. From the moment that Evers proposes that every person would be mailed a ballot whether they ask for it or not, Republicans go haywire.\n\narchived recording Right now, Senate Majority Leader Scott Fitzgerald is calling this idea a fantasy. archived recording (scott fitzgerald) Yeah, this has probably been my biggest disappointment so far in working with the administration since this all happened.\n\nastead herndon\n\nThey say that this is not only logistically impractical \n\narchived recording (scott fitzgerald) It was completely disingenuous for the governor to tape a video and post it as if this was reality. To float the idea that they were going to find enough outer envelopes, ballots themselves, inner envelopes with first class postage, and mail it out to 3.3 million people in Wisconsin is completely made up.\n\nastead herndon\n\n but also kind of morally and democratically wrong.\n\narchived recording (scott fitzgerald) You know, that happens sometimes, I guess, if youre feeling pressure from one of your own special interests or from the party themselves. But \n\nastead herndon\n\nAnd Evers knows that state law does not allow him to kind of unilaterally make huge changes in how Wisconsin runs the election.\n\narchived recording (tony evers) Folks, I cant move this election or change the rules on my own. My hands are tied.\n\nastead herndon\n\nHe needs the help of the legislature. And so one of the measures he tries to do is call a special session of the legislature, and encourage them to delay the election and implement changes that would allow every person to be able to vote without going in person.\n\narchived recording (tony evers) I urge the legislators to take this call for a special session seriously.\n\nastead herndon\n\nIt doesnt go well. The legislature gavels in a session this past Saturday.\n\narchived recording (legislature) April 2020, special session of the Senate will come to order. With no objection, the April 2020 special session will stand adjourned until Monday, April 6.\n\nastead herndon\n\nAnd less than a minute later \n\narchived recording (legislature) April 2020, special session is adjourned.\n\nastead herndon\n\n gavels out.\n\nmichael barbaro\n\nWhoa.\n\nastead herndon\n\nThis is kind of an extraordinary move by the legislature to really thumb their nose at the power of the executive and the governor. The biggest elected official in the state has called them into session and said, take up this issue. And they basically start the session and end it without doing what he asked.\n\nmichael barbaro\n\nSo the Republicans do not grant the governor his wish for a mail-in balloting system?\n\nastead herndon\n\nRight.\n\n[music]\n\nmichael barbaro\n\nAstead, why is it that Wisconsin has so quickly erupted into a really nasty partisan battle over something as seemingly basic as making sure people can vote safely in a primary election? I mean, that would seem to be in everyones bipartisan interest to protect life, right? I mean, Democrats and Republicans will be casting ballots.\n\nastead herndon\n\nIt would seem as if safe voting and public health would be an issue in which partisanship would be left to the side and that Democrats and Republicans can agree on the best way to move forward. But in Wisconsin, there is no issue in which that can be left aside. What we see is a state that has become so deeply wrested by Republican control that even something like safe voting turns into a mud fest. And for this governor, for the Democratic governor Tony Evers, thats been clear since the day he was elected.\n\nmichael barbaro\n\nWell be right back.\n\n[music]\n\nmichael barbaro\n\nAstead, where does this political dysfunction that youre describing in Wisconsin, where does that start?\n\nastead herndon\n\nWell, the state is one that is unique in its political history.\n\n[music]\n\narchived recording Few places reflect the growing political chasm in the U.S. as does the state of Wisconsin.\n\nastead herndon\n\nWisconsin was a united Republican government under Scott Walker \n\narchived recording Republicans won everything in Wisconsin in 2010.\n\nastead herndon\n\n from 2010 until 2018.\n\narchived recording They won the legislature. They won this Republican majority in Wisconsin.\n\nastead herndon\n\nAnd this wasnt just a Republican government that passed kind of conventional conservative bills. This was seen as really a laboratory of conservative ideas.\n\narchived recording Governor Scott Walker is the man at the center of a bitter fight that has cleaved Wisconsin like a block of its best cheddar cheese.\n\nastead herndon\n\nAnd so we saw a government that targeted teachers unions, that seized power on key boards, and really kind of had a wish list of conservative ideas nationally playing out in the state.\n\narchived recording He proposed slashing spending, raising no taxes, and most controversial of all, sharply curtailing public employees right to collective bargaining.\n\n[music]\n\nastead herndon\n\nEven as the state voted for Barack Obama twice \n\narchived recording Incumbent Republican Governor Scott Walker has won his re-election bid.\n\nastead herndon\n\n they kept winning.\n\narchived recording For the third time in four years, Republican Scott Walker has won a statewide election for governor.\n\nastead herndon\n\nSo by the time you get to 2018 \n\narchived recording Major shift happened overnight. Wisconsin voters, youve elected a Democrat as governor.\n\nastead herndon\n\n when Walker loses his re-election bid to Tony Evers \n\narchived recording The race was almost too close to call. But overnight, Democrat Tony Evers narrowly beat out G.O.P. incumbent Scott Walker, denying him a third term.\n\nastead herndon\n\n Republicans in the state legislature have already learned a lesson from the years prior, that its more important to wield power than it is to be seen as a political compromiser.\n\nmichael barbaro\n\nSo how does that play out when all of a sudden there is a Democratic governor in Evers, who I assume wants to start making compromises with the Republican legislature?\n\nastead herndon\n\nThe Republicans make clear that that is not what theyre interested in.\n\narchived recording 1 Republicans, stung by their losses in the midterms, are moving forward with last ditch efforts to hang onto power. Its happening in at least two swing states, Wisconsin and Michigan. archived recording 2 The country is really watching this morning as lawmakers here in Wisconsin work through the night to amend and vote on a number of bills.\n\nastead herndon\n\nSo in a special session that happens before Evers takes office, Republicans do a kind of classic power grab.\n\narchived recording Wisconsins Republican-controlled legislature passed a series of bills late Wednesday night that would limit the powers of incoming Democratic governor Tony Evers.\n\nastead herndon\n\nThey pass a number of bills that limit the power of the incoming Democratic governor and take away things that were available to his Republican predecessor.\n\narchived recording Now the bills would put lawmakers in charge of litigation, which would effectively block incoming Democratic Governor Tony Evers and the Democratic Attorney General-elect from withdrawing the state from a lawsuit to overturn Obamacare.\n\nastead herndon\n\nSo Evers would not have the power to make key appointments.\n\narchived recording And another bill would require the governor to get permission from the legislature to ban guns.\n\nastead herndon\n\nEvers would not have the power to regulate guns in the same way that existed for his predecessor. They also limit early voting, which is a kind of tool of access to the ballot box that has sometimes helped Democrats, because more people in bigger areas can get to the polls. These were all really nakedly partisan, and Republicans didnt really even try to hide it.\n\narchived recording (robin vos) We dont want to usurp his power. Thats never been our goal. Our goal is just to guarantee that we have an opportunity to sit at the table, negotiate and do it fairly. archived recording It puts us on an equal playing field as the legislature, and I think thats a positive step for the state of Wisconsin.\n\nmichael barbaro\n\nSo that is the political backdrop, youre saying, for this current battle over how to hold a primary in the middle of a pandemic?\n\nastead herndon\n\nYeah. It is that sense of affirmation, the sense of rightness that Republicans enter into Everss administration with, and it allows them to openly flout the typical means of political pressure that the governor tries to put on them around the election.\n\n[music]\n\narchived recording The legislature  they came in, the gaveled in for about 10 seconds, gaveled out and they moved on. They said that was not a serious proposal and said the time for proposals like that was several weeks ago when the crisis began.\n\nmichael barbaro\n\nSo what happens after that special session, that minute-long special session about the election?\n\nastead herndon\n\nWell, theres been a significant amount of legal legislation that has surrounded all of this political action.\n\narchived recording 1 So much going on here at the State Capitol today. archived recording 2 Lets break down and give you a brief summary of what happened today, because its been a wild day politically.\n\nastead herndon\n\nThere was a court ruling that basically affirmed that the Republicans probably have control over when the election should be held, but the ruling expanded access to absentee voting. Republicans appealed that straight to the U.S. Supreme Court. And then on Monday \n\narchived recording 1 It started with Governor Evers issuing an executive order, pushing back the spring election from tomorrow to June 9. archived recording 2 This morning, Governor Tony Evers issued an executive order to postpone tomorrows election due to Covid-19 concerns. archived recording (tony evers) The bottom line is that I have an obligation to keep people safe.\n\nastead herndon\n\n the governor makes his most drastic step, unilaterally postponing Tuesdays election until June, claiming that he has the emergency powers to do so. This is a affront to the Republicans.\n\narchived recording Republican legislators mounted a legal challenge immediately.\n\nastead herndon\n\nAnd they immediately initiate emergency legislation, going straight to the Wisconsin Supreme Court, saying that the governor does not have the right to do this.\n\narchived recording And just about an hour ago, the State Supreme Court issued its ruling, saying that indeed, the election will happen tomorrow.\n\nastead herndon\n\nAnd the court agreed with him, ruling just hours later that the governor did not have the power to postpone the Tuesday primary, meaning the election will go on in person today.\n\nmichael barbaro\n\nYou know, Astead, Im struck by the fact that earlier on, you told us that Democrats and Republicans in the state, they had basically been on the same page about this primary until the virus gets worse and the governor advocates for a different kind of voting system through absentee ballots. And then it all breaks down, and Republicans are attempting at every turn to block him now in court. And how do you explain that? I mean, how do Republicans in the state legislature explain that?\n\nastead herndon\n\nRepublican county chairs and folks in the state legislature say a couple things. The first is that their position hasnt changed. They thought the governor didnt have the power then, and they dont think he has the power now to change how the election is run. The other point is that they see Wisconsin, again, as a microcosm of the conservative fight that could happen largely, and what could be a new reality of how American elections are run in this pandemic era. And in that view, dramatically expanding the electorate in these ways are not something that Republicans are all that keen on. Because what theyre worried about is an election in which people who may not have participated, or may not have come out, all of a sudden have the opportunity to do so and to cast a ballot. And that kind of changes the center of power within the state.\n\nmichael barbaro\n\nWhat do you mean?\n\nastead herndon\n\nIf people participate in different numbers, in bigger numbers, if it changes the type of people who want to participate in the spring election thats not necessarily always seen the biggest turnout, that changes who can win.\n\nmichael barbaro\n\nAnd who has benefited from those systems in the past, and who might benefit if they were to change along the lines of what Governor Evers is asking for?\n\nastead herndon\n\nIts hard to say exactly, because were talking about an unprecedented situation. But we do know that the people who are typically benefited from early voting, from early registration, from online registration, or a vote-by-mail are people who usually dont participate in the process  younger voters, minority voters, people that lean Democratic. And just in the ways that Republicans limited early voting in that special session they had after Evers won, its the same thought process. That when more people get involved, when people who typically sit out get involved, that helps Democrats.\n\nmichael barbaro\n\nMm. Do Democrats acknowledge that an absentee balloting system that is suddenly much more widespread than it has been in the past would be advantageous to them in Wisconsin?\n\nastead herndon\n\nThey principally try to appeal to voters using small d democratic ideals  the general, basic American principle that everyone should be given the easiest access to vote. They try to appeal to people through public health measures, noting how unsafe it is for people to gather at polls. But when you ask folks in Democratic circles, they know that when the electorate expands, particularly in national and statewide elections, thats usually good news for Democrats.\n\nmichael barbaro\n\nIts interesting. This is not just a debate about how to vote in a pandemic, although clearly thats whats driving a lot of this. But in the background, from what youre saying, is this other question, which is whether the systems needed to vote during a pandemic may fundamentally change who votes, how many people vote and which party wins.\n\nastead herndon\n\nExactly. This is not just about public health. This is about access to power and the kind of most basic fundamental principles of democracy. If the system that we have been traditionally used to cant hold, what replaces it? And weve seen real resistance to that in this state, and we may see that resistance all across the country.\n\nmichael barbaro\n\nWell, why would you say that? Because its very tempting to see this story as an anomaly, right, in that the governor of Wisconsin waited a very long time to try to postpone the states primary  perhaps too long  and the state legislature is this hyper-partisan, conservative, activist body that is trying to use its power for political advantage. So all those factors would seem to make Wisconsin a bit of an outlier.\n\nastead herndon\n\nWell, what may seem like an anomaly right now might actually just be a pacesetter. And this could be a preview as to what comes for state after state. If you are a place like Georgia or Louisiana or Ohio that has functionally delayed its election by three, four weeks, and if this virus persists to that time, there will still be questions about whether it is safe to hold in-person balloting then.\n\nmichael barbaro\n\nRight.\n\nastead herndon\n\nAnd when those questions come and the remedies are proposed, whether its online or vote-by-mail or the like, these same struggles of power will persist. And we will see factions emerge that question whether the new systems are fair and who politically benefits from them.\n\n[music]\n\nmichael barbaro\n\nAstead, thank you very much.\n\nastead herndon\n\nThank you.\n\nmichael barbaro\n\nOn Monday night, the U.S. Supreme Court sided with Republican lawmakers in Wisconsin, who had opposed extending the deadline for absentee ballots in todays election.

This is The Daily.\n\n[music]\n\nAgainst the advice of public health officials and the wishes of its own governor, Wisconsin will hold its democratic primary today in the middle of a pandemic. Astead Herndon on how that happened. Its Tuesday, April 7.\n\nastead herndon\n\nMarch was always going to be one of the most consequential months of the presidential election. By the time we get to the middle of March, though \n\narchived recording So heres what were watching. Breaking news. Louisiana officially could become the first state to postpone its Democratic primary election over the coronavirus pandemic.\n\nastead herndon\n\n it becomes clear that the coronavirus global health pandemic has really upended the race completely.\n\n[music]\n\nastead herndon\n\nAfter Super Tuesday, states that are scheduled to vote start postponing and sometimes outright canceling their scheduled primaries.\n\narchived recording 1 Georgia becoming the second state to delay its presidential primary. archived recording 2 Kentucky announced that theyd delay their contest as well. archived recording 3 Ohios governor pushed back its primary just hours before polls were set to open. archived recording 4 Other states  Connecticut, Indiana and Maryland.\n\nastead herndon\n\nThese are all states that said that the public health crisis was too great for them to hold in-person elections in March. But theres one state that refuses to budge, even as public health officials are urging them and states across the country have taken that drastic step. Its Wisconsin.\n\nmichael barbaro\n\nAnd what explains that? Whats happening in Wisconsin?\n\nastead herndon\n\nWell, when most people look at these presidential primaries, particularly in a state like Wisconsin, they think that this is just about the two candidates at the top  Joe Biden versus Bernie Sanders, and who gets the delegates out of that. But the reason why Wisconsin was holding out and keeping its primary schedule was really to do with more state and local concerns. Initially, the Democratic governor, Tony Evers, and state Republican leaders were on the same page. They both agreed that the April 7 election should go forward. And they said so for a couple reasons. Not only had the virus not really ravaged the state in the same way that we have seen in other parts of the country at the initial time in March when they were making this decision, but they agreed on the importance of the state and local races that would be decided down ballot on the same day of the presidential primary.\n\narchived recording (tony evers) I just want to make sure people understand the complexity of our spring general election. Its not a primary election. Its only a primary election for the presidential candidates.\n\nastead herndon\n\nRaces like sheriffs and mayors and court judges. Theres a particularly important Supreme Court race thats happening in the state. And both sides agreed that filling these roles was important for the continuance of state government.\n\narchived recording (tony evers) How long do we potentially leave offices not filled because were into July and August and we havent held a general election?\n\nastead herndon\n\nAnd thats why they proceeded with the primary.\n\narchived recording (robin vos) You know, I want to give credit to Governor Evers. I agree with his decision to say that we are going to hold this election.\n\nmichael barbaro\n\nHm. So despite the risks of holding an in-person primary in the middle of a pandemic, despite the fact that many states are postponing these primaries, the Republican and Democratic officials in Wisconsin say that this is necessary for the functioning of their government?\n\nastead herndon\n\nRight. And thats the position they held for about a week.\n\nmichael barbaro\n\nAnd what happens after a week?\n\nastead herndon\n\nWell, kind of most clearly, the factors around the decision changed.\n\narchived recording (tony evers) We need an all-hands-on-deck approach to stop the spread of Covid-19 in Wisconsin.\n\nastead herndon\n\nThe pandemic becomes more acutely felt in the Midwest and particularly in Wisconsin.\n\narchived recording (tony evers) And here is the bottom line  folks need to start taking this seriously. So today Im asking for your help.\n\nastead herndon\n\nAnd the governor issues a stay-at-home order like many other governors did across the country and closes all non-essential businesses.\n\narchived recording (tony evers) Its not something I wanted to do, and its not something I take lightly.\n\nastead herndon\n\nAnd people across the state are starting to say, well, if we cant leave our houses, how are we supposed to vote?\n\nmichael barbaro\n\nRight. And whats the answer?\n\nastead herndon\n\nThe governor and state Republicans keep holding this line that voting was something that was so essential, that the primary was something that was so important, that they would try to find some workarounds that included expanding access to absentee ballots and encouraging people to use that measure. It included counties taking precautionary measures which include maybe drive-through voting or socially distanced lines. But besides all of these creative measures, there is an increasing fear, particularly among poll workers, that the election would be unsafe for them to staff. These are people who, 90 percent of them are senior citizens.\n\nmichael barbaro\n\nPoll workers?\n\nastead herndon\n\nMm-hmm. One of the most vulnerable population to this deadly virus. And they start dropping off, informing their local jurisdictions that they dont think that they want to participate in the scheduled election. A survey from the Election Commission in the state showed that more than a hundred jurisdictions cannot adequately staff their polling locations, because they wouldnt have the right poll workers to do so.\n\nmichael barbaro\n\nWow.\n\nastead herndon\n\nThat becomes the first real point of pressure to say, how can this election go forward?\n\nmichael barbaro\n\nSo what do officials do in response to this severe shortage of poll workers?\n\nastead herndon\n\nWell, they go back to trying to find creative workarounds. So the first thing that some of the local jurisdictions do is close and limit their polling locations. Some of the more drastic examples include Milwaukee, the biggest city in the state, going from 180 polling locations, typically, down to just five or seven.\n\nmichael barbaro\n\nAnd yet everyone still seems committed to holding this election?\n\nastead herndon\n\nThey were, until the virus intensifies in the state and cases increase. As the deaths increase, thats when you see a real shift from the governor.\n\narchived recording (tony evers) Hi there, folks. Governor Evers here.\n\nastead herndon\n\nAnd its a big one.\n\narchived recording (tony evers) So today, Im asking the legislature to come together to take bipartisan action to ensure that every registered voter receives an absentee ballot to vote in the upcoming election.\n\nastead herndon\n\nHe proposes a dramatic expansion in the states absentee ballot voting system, essentially making it a universal vote-by-mail system.\n\narchived recording (tony evers) So I hope that the legislature will act swiftly to send absentee ballots to every single registered voter living in Wisconsin.\n\nastead herndon\n\nThe state would mail 3.3 million eligible voters a ballot, whether they requested it or not. And that represents a real change in how kind of the electoral process would work throughout the state.\n\narchived recording (tony evers) This is not a Republican issue or a Democratic issue. This is an issue of democracy. I dont care who gets the credit. I just want to make sure that everyone has a chance to cast their ballot this April. Thanks for watching, and lets get it done, folks.\n\nastead herndon\n\nAnd thats when we really see the partisan pushback start.\n\n[music]\n\nWhat began as a Democratic governor and a Republican state legislature that were basically on the same page has now devolved into what is, by all accounts, a partisan bloodbath. From the moment that Evers proposes that every person would be mailed a ballot whether they ask for it or not, Republicans go haywire.\n\narchived recording Right now, Senate Majority Leader Scott Fitzgerald is calling this idea a fantasy. archived recording (scott fitzgerald) Yeah, this has probably been my biggest disappointment so far in working with the administration since this all happened.\n\nastead herndon\n\nThey say that this is not only logistically impractical \n\narchived recording (scott fitzgerald) It was completely disingenuous for the governor to tape a video and post it as if this was reality. To float the idea that they were going to find enough outer envelopes, ballots themselves, inner envelopes with first class postage, and mail it out to 3.3 million people in Wisconsin is completely made up.\n\nastead herndon\n\n but also kind of morally and democratically wrong.\n\narchived recording (scott fitzgerald) You know, that happens sometimes, I guess, if youre feeling pressure from one of your own special interests or from the party themselves. But \n\nastead herndon\n\nAnd Evers knows that state law does not allow him to kind of unilaterally make huge changes in how Wisconsin runs the election.\n\narchived recording (tony evers) Folks, I cant move this election or change the rules on my own. My hands are tied.\n\nastead herndon\n\nHe needs the help of the legislature. And so one of the measures he tries to do is call a special session of the legislature, and encourage them to delay the election and implement changes that would allow every person to be able to vote without going in person.\n\narchived recording (tony evers) I urge the legislators to take this call for a special session seriously.\n\nastead herndon\n\nIt doesnt go well. The legislature gavels in a session this past Saturday.\n\narchived recording (legislature) April 2020, special session of the Senate will come to order. With no objection, the April 2020 special session will stand adjourned until Monday, April 6.\n\nastead herndon\n\nAnd less than a minute later \n\narchived recording (legislature) April 2020, special session is adjourned.\n\nastead herndon\n\n gavels out.\n\nmichael barbaro\n\nWhoa.\n\nastead herndon\n\nThis is kind of an extraordinary move by the legislature to really thumb their nose at the power of the executive and the governor. The biggest elected official in the state has called them into session and said, take up this issue. And they basically start the session and end it without doing what he asked.\n\nmichael barbaro\n\nSo the Republicans do not grant the governor his wish for a mail-in balloting system?\n\nastead herndon\n\nRight.\n\n[music]\n\nmichael barbaro\n\nAstead, why is it that Wisconsin has so quickly erupted into a really nasty partisan battle over something as seemingly basic as making sure people can vote safely in a primary election? I mean, that would seem to be in everyones bipartisan interest to protect life, right? I mean, Democrats and Republicans will be casting ballots.\n\nastead herndon\n\nIt would seem as if safe voting and public health would be an issue in which partisanship would be left to the side and that Democrats and Republicans can agree on the best way to move forward. But in Wisconsin, there is no issue in which that can be left aside. What we see is a state that has become so deeply wrested by Republican control that even something like safe voting turns into a mud fest. And for this governor, for the Democratic governor Tony Evers, thats been clear since the day he was elected.\n\nmichael barbaro\n\nWell be right back.\n\n[music]\n\nmichael barbaro\n\nAstead, where does this political dysfunction that youre describing in Wisconsin, where does that start?\n\nastead herndon\n\nWell, the state is one that is unique in its political history.\n\n[music]\n\narchived recording Few places reflect the growing political chasm in the U.S. as does the state of Wisconsin.\n\nastead herndon\n\nWisconsin was a united Republican government under Scott Walker \n\narchived recording Republicans won everything in Wisconsin in 2010.\n\nastead herndon\n\n from 2010 until 2018.\n\narchived recording They won the legislature. They won this Republican majority in Wisconsin.\n\nastead herndon\n\nAnd this wasnt just a Republican government that passed kind of conventional conservative bills. This was seen as really a laboratory of conservative ideas.\n\narchived recording Governor Scott Walker is the man at the center of a bitter fight that has cleaved Wisconsin like a block of its best cheddar cheese.\n\nastead herndon\n\nAnd so we saw a government that targeted teachers unions, that seized power on key boards, and really kind of had a wish list of conservative ideas nationally playing out in the state.\n\narchived recording He proposed slashing spending, raising no taxes, and most controversial of all, sharply curtailing public employees right to collective bargaining.\n\n[music]\n\nastead herndon\n\nEven as the state voted for Barack Obama twice \n\narchived recording Incumbent Republican Governor Scott Walker has won his re-election bid.\n\nastead herndon\n\n they kept winning.\n\narchived recording For the third time in four years, Republican Scott Walker has won a statewide election for governor.\n\nastead herndon\n\nSo by the time you get to 2018 \n\narchived recording Major shift happened overnight. Wisconsin voters, youve elected a Democrat as governor.\n\nastead herndon\n\n when Walker loses his re-election bid to Tony Evers \n\narchived recording The race was almost too close to call. But overnight, Democrat Tony Evers narrowly beat out G.O.P. incumbent Scott Walker, denying him a third term.\n\nastead herndon\n\n Republicans in the state legislature have already learned a lesson from the years prior, that its more important to wield power than it is to be seen as a political compromiser.\n\nmichael barbaro\n\nSo how does that play out when all of a sudden there is a Democratic governor in Evers, who I assume wants to start making compromises with the Republican legislature?\n\nastead herndon\n\nThe Republicans make clear that that is not what theyre interested in.\n\narchived recording 1 Republicans, stung by their losses in the midterms, are moving forward with last ditch efforts to hang onto power. Its happening in at least two swing states, Wisconsin and Michigan. archived recording 2 The country is really watching this morning as lawmakers here in Wisconsin work through the night to amend and vote on a number of bills.\n\nastead herndon\n\nSo in a special session that happens before Evers takes office, Republicans do a kind of classic power grab.\n\narchived recording Wisconsins Republican-controlled legislature passed a series of bills late Wednesday night that would limit the powers of incoming Democratic governor Tony Evers.\n\nastead herndon\n\nThey pass a number of bills that limit the power of the incoming Democratic governor and take away things that were available to his Republican predecessor.\n\narchived recording Now the bills would put lawmakers in charge of litigation, which would effectively block incoming Democratic Governor Tony Evers and the Democratic Attorney General-elect from withdrawing the state from a lawsuit to overturn Obamacare.\n\nastead herndon\n\nSo Evers would not have the power to make key appointments.\n\narchived recording And another bill would require the governor to get permission from the legislature to ban guns.\n\nastead herndon\n\nEvers would not have the power to regulate guns in the same way that existed for his predecessor. They also limit early voting, which is a kind of tool of access to the ballot box that has sometimes helped Democrats, because more people in bigger areas can get to the polls. These were all really nakedly partisan, and Republicans didnt really even try to hide it.\n\narchived recording (robin vos) We dont want to usurp his power. Thats never been our goal. Our goal is just to guarantee that we have an opportunity to sit at the table, negotiate and do it fairly. archived recording It puts us on an equal playing field as the legislature, and I think thats a positive step for the state of Wisconsin.\n\nmichael barbaro\n\nSo that is the political backdrop, youre saying, for this current battle over how to hold a primary in the middle of a pandemic?\n\nastead herndon\n\nYeah. It is that sense of affirmation, the sense of rightness that Republicans enter into Everss administration with, and it allows them to openly flout the typical means of political pressure that the governor tries to put on them around the election.\n\n[music]\n\narchived recording The legislature  they came in, the gaveled in for about 10 seconds, gaveled out and they moved on. They said that was not a serious proposal and said the time for proposals like that was several weeks ago when the crisis began.\n\nmichael barbaro\n\nSo what happens after that special session, that minute-long special session about the election?\n\nastead herndon\n\nWell, theres been a significant amount of legal legislation that has surrounded all of this political action.\n\narchived recording 1 So much going on here at the State Capitol today. archived recording 2 Lets break down and give you a brief summary of what happened today, because its been a wild day politically.\n\nastead herndon\n\nThere was a court ruling that basically affirmed that the Republicans probably have control over when the election should be held, but the ruling expanded access to absentee voting. Republicans appealed that straight to the U.S. Supreme Court. And then on Monday \n\narchived recording 1 It started with Governor Evers issuing an executive order, pushing back the spring election from tomorrow to June 9. archived recording 2 This morning, Governor Tony Evers issued an executive order to postpone tomorrows election due to Covid-19 concerns. archived recording (tony evers) The bottom line is that I have an obligation to keep people safe.\n\nastead herndon\n\n the governor makes his most drastic step, unilaterally postponing Tuesdays election until June, claiming that he has the emergency powers to do so. This is a affront to the Republicans.\n\narchived recording Republican legislators mounted a legal challenge immediately.\n\nastead herndon\n\nAnd they immediately initiate emergency legislation, going straight to the Wisconsin Supreme Court, saying that the governor does not have the right to do this.\n\narchived recording And just about an hour ago, the State Supreme Court issued its ruling, saying that indeed, the election will happen tomorrow.\n\nastead herndon\n\nAnd the court agreed with him, ruling just hours later that the governor did not have the power to postpone the Tuesday primary, meaning the election will go on in person today.\n\nmichael barbaro\n\nYou know, Astead, Im struck by the fact that earlier on, you told us that Democrats and Republicans in the state, they had basically been on the same page about this primary until the virus gets worse and the governor advocates for a different kind of voting system through absentee ballots. And then it all breaks down, and Republicans are attempting at every turn to block him now in court. And how do you explain that? I mean, how do Republicans in the state legislature explain that?\n\nastead herndon\n\nRepublican county chairs and folks in the state legislature say a couple things. The first is that their position hasnt changed. They thought the governor didnt have the power then, and they dont think he has the power now to change how the election is run. The other point is that they see Wisconsin, again, as a microcosm of the conservative fight that could happen largely, and what could be a new reality of how American elections are run in this pandemic era.

The other analyzed published opinions in the courts 12 regional circuits to gain insights into ruling patterns and rates of dissent.\n\nThe Biographies\n\nThe Times compared the appellate judges experiences outside the court. All told, there were 168 appointees  51 by Mr. Trump, 55 by Mr. Obama and 62 by Mr. Bush.\n\nThe database drew primarily on biographical questionnaires the appointees had submitted to the Senate Judiciary Committee, obtained from staff members, the Congressional Record and other sources. They listed jobs and internships held since college, judicial clerkships, club memberships, affiliations with political campaigns and other information. Some judges volunteered more detail than others.\n\nSeparately, campaign finance data was compiled from two sources: the National Institute on Money in Politics, which has access to state donations since 2000 and federal ones since 2010, and the Center for Responsive Politics, which tracks federal donations beginning in 1989. In searching the donations, The Times sometimes found matches by using variations of judges names, including maiden names, as well as other relevant information like employment.\n\nCalculations of partisan donations were based on federal contributions to political candidates or causes of the same party as the judges appointing president. Past political activity was measured more broadly and included work for politicians of any party; volunteer or paid work for political campaigns of any party; memberships affiliated with any party; donations to campaigns of any party; participation as a candidate for any party; references to Republican or Democrat in any answer in the questionnaire; and work in a political post in the federal government, including political duties assigned to a federal employee.\n\nThe age of judges on their appointment date was based on years of birth provided by the Federal Judicial Center, the official clearinghouse for court research.\n\nThe Rulings and Dissents\n\nThe database includes more than 10,000 opinions published from 2017 through last year in the 12 regional circuit courts. The 13th appeals court, the Federal Circuit, hears mostly intellectual property cases and has no Trump appointees.\n\nThe case list was published by the Federal Judicial Center. Only cases designated published, written and signed were included in the analysis, because they carry the weight of precedence and represent the most legally impactful work. For consistency, all of the cases involved a standard three-judge panel with a named opinion author.\n\nFor every case, The Times parsed the text of the opinion to identify the judges, whose names are redacted from the judicial centers data. Additional information about the judges was obtained by joining the case data to a separate biography data set kept by the center.\n\nThe data was analyzed in two ways: first, to determine how often cases involved a dissent, and second, to determine how often individual judges agreed or disagreed with their two colleagues on a panel.\n\nOn the case level, the data showed that when a judge named by Mr. Trump served in a pivotal role  as the author of an opinion on a panel with only one Democratic appointee, or as the only Republican appointee on a panel  the rate of dissent increased significantly.\n\nFor individual judges, the analysis split each panel into three pairings. If the case was unanimously decided, all judges were deemed to have agreed. If one judge dissented, that judge was deemed to have disagreed with the other two. While judges appointed by presidents of different parties were more likely to disagree than judges appointed by presidents of the same party, the difference was far more pronounced for many, though not all, of the new Trump appointees, the analysis found.\n\nThere were caveats to the findings. Some of the circuits have a higher dissent rate overall, for example, and some circuits appear more often in the database because they conduct a higher share of their work in the form of published opinions.\n\nEven accounting for those factors, the findings were supported by a separate regression analysis, which accounted for other variables, including the circuit hearing the case, the topic before the court, the type of appeal and whether the ruling affirmed or overturned a decision by a lower court.\n\nHillary Flynn and Jaclyn Peiser contributed reporting.

Mr. Trumps statements revived claims he made during the campaign, as polls suggested he was losing to Mrs. Clinton, about a rigged and corrupt system.\n\nThe Twitter outburst also came as Mr. Trump is laboring to fill crucial positions in his cabinet, with his advisers enmeshed in a rift over whom he should select as secretary of state. On Sunday morning, Kellyanne Conway, a top adviser, extended a public campaign to undermine one contender, Mitt Romney  a remarkable display by a member of a president-elects team. In television appearances, she accused Mr. Romney of having gone out of his way to hurt Mr. Trump during the Republican primary contests.'

It cannot do its job.\n\nMr. de Blasio reviewed the litany of Tuesdays problems: broken scanners at dozens of polling sites, including some sites where at some point all the scanners were down, and long waits to vote that lasted in some cases two or three hours.\n\nIts as if there was a purposeful plan to make voting as unappealing as possible, he said, although he added that he did not think that was the case. But he said that the board is making it harder for people to vote, not easier. It is part of the problem. It must change.'

Youre watching a recent Senate Intelligence Committee hearing about how foreign internet trolls are using social media to influence American politics.

Ben Nimmo is a senior fellow at the Atlantic Councils Digital Forensic Research Lab. He works to identify and analyze online disinformation. The way these accounts work has always been a combination of infiltration and radicalization. He walked us through some of the imagery and strategies used by notorious online trolls from Russia and, perhaps, elsewhere. First, they pick a hot-button issue. There are certain very high-profile problems that American society has, which are well-known abroad. And it tended to be those ones which are targeted. So the original troll factory accounts were very heavily engaged in the debate on gun control and the Second Amendment, on womens rights and abortion rights. They were heavily engaged on Black Lives Matter. A slew of inauthentic accounts that Facebook recently deleted took the same approach, updated to fit the latest top news. They use identity politics and emotion to appeal to followers. Next step, tap into a community. So you start off by making positive comments about the target group. Lets say you want to masquerade as a Black Lives Matter supporter. You start by making lots of positive comments about the African-American community. You talk about how beautiful the girls are. You talk about their glorious cultural history and you try and engage with real activists who are busy on this subject. Now its time to ramp it up. Once youve established your credentials, you start slipping more and more toxic content into the mix. So, rather than saying positive things about your community, you start saying negative things about other communities. The war against colonialism is a theme that comes up on this page time and again. Its a hint at violence. And last, they try to move from the online world into real life. And then maybe you slip into the mix a suggestion: Lets have a protest. Lets get real people out on the streets. And then, because youre operating probably from some time zones away, you need to think, Well, how do we get this to happen? And you start trying to reach out to genuine local organizations. Maybe you say, Well, we cant turn up on that day because weve got something else going on. Why dont you organize this for us? In 2016, Russian trolls organized political events for and against both presidential candidates. At an Islamic center in Houston, they organized a protest and the corresponding counterprotest. Down with the racists! Down with the Nazis! So why go to such lengths? These bad actors are trying to polarize the American public by exploiting existing tensions in our society. The goal? Make Americans see each other as enemies, especially during high-stakes events such as elections. If people feel they cant trust their neighbors or their government, democracy falters.

Decision'	true	[]		trusted	[]	https://www.nytimes.com/2020/08/12/podcasts/the-daily/biden-kamala-harris-vp.html	https://www.nytimes.com/	b'michael barbaro\n\nFrom The New York Times, Im Michael Barbaro. This is The Daily. Today: Joe Biden picks Senator Kamala Harris of California as his running mate, making her the first Black woman and the first Asian-American woman to run for vice president on a major party ticket. Alex Burns on the historic decision. Its Wednesday, August 12. Alex, did you get the text message from the Biden campaign?\n\nalex burns\n\nYou know, I had the text messages forwarded to me by several other people before I got it myself. But I suppose I was notified by text message, just not directly from the Biden campaign.\n\nmichael barbaro\n\nJust not the Biden text message? I actually am pretty disappointed. Because I signed up for the text message from the Biden campaign, and I didnt get a text message. So I suppose this answers the inevitable question, how do you make an enormous announcement during a pandemic? Which is you do it via text message. You just dont send it to Alex Burns or Michael Barbaro.\n\nalex burns\n\n[LAUGHS]\n\nmichael barbaro\n\nOK. So onto the decision itself. It is 7:00 p.m. on Tuesday evening. Joe Biden announced his choice about three hours ago, that it was going to be Kamala Harris. And Alex, the last time that we spoke with you, we talked about three overlapping realities that you said were influencing Bidens choice of a running mate  the nationwide protests over race and policing, the pandemic and the economic collapse. And then there was Bidens age, the fact that he would be the oldest president to assume the office. So how does Biden get from those realities to Kamala Harris?\n\nalex burns\n\nSo I think in some ways they are three distinct forces. And in some ways, they really are different strands of the same big current. Which is that Biden was looking from the start for a running mate who he saw and who he believed the country would see as a really serious person for really serious times. Now that could mean a whole bunch of different things. But one of the reasons why I think you end up seeing Kamala Harris emerge as the vice president is that she straddles all the different forces of this moment in a way that nobody else on the short list did or, at least demonstrated that they did. She was a senator who marched in racial justice protests this spring and who led a charge in the Senate to make lynching a federal crime. She is a familiar face to Democratic voters, not only from her presidential campaign, but from her interrogations of Trump officials in the Judiciary Committee at a time when Democrats are really struggling to hold the administration to account over its handling of the coronavirus pandemic. And shes somebody of, clearly in Joe Bidens eyes, sufficient and diverse enough political experience and stature that she will look to voters like somebody who is ready to be president.\n\nmichael barbaro\n\nMhm. Well lets drill into these three realities, each individually, just a little bit further. And I want to start with the nationwide protests, the questions around race. How did that influence the choice? You mentioned Kamala Harris marching in some of these protests and the work she has done in the Senate.\n\nalex burns\n\nRight. You had, at the outset of the season of protest, a number of figures on Bidens vice presidential list really speak up about matters of racial justice and policing. You had Val Demings, the congresswoman from Florida, a former police chief, become an outspoken champion of police reform. But you also saw people come under the microscope in less flattering ways, including Val Demings. That there was a sense from the start among Democrats that anybody on the short list who has touched the criminal justice system in their career is going to really need to have their record picked over. And that happened with Val Demings. She was the police chief in Orlando. And there are some questions about how appropriately she handled matters of police misconduct on her watch.\n\nmichael barbaro\n\nWell, what about Harriss history as attorney general in California? Because that was a significant focus during her own primary run for president. And my sense is that a lot of progressive voters, a lot of Black voters  especially in California  are skeptical of her record and question whether or not shes the right figure in this moment. I recall that she once described herself as the states top cop.\n\nalex burns\n\nI think thats one of the questions that we are going to see play out in this campaign going forward  is whether she can address the criticism of her record as a prosecutor more convincingly in a general election than she did during the primary. And the question is, has she done enough in the last few months, in the wake of George Floyd, in the midst of these demonstrations, to show that she is serious about criminal justice reform as a matter of governing now, that people who looked askance at her record during the Democratic primaries say, you know what? This is good enough or even better than good enough.\n\nmichael barbaro\n\nAnd in thinking about race and this moment, how should we be thinking about fact that Harris is herself a Black woman?\n\nalex burns\n\nWell thats of course of enormous importance in this moment. That I think starting in the late spring, the sense among people close to Biden was that it would be tough in this moment to really meet the political mood of the country if the Democrats put forward an all white ticket. That Joe Biden, as a 77-year-old white guy, needed a running mate who could speak to the countrys multiracial future in a way that he with his identity could not. And so, between her identity as a Black woman and as an Indian-American woman, Senator Harris, I think, clearly has an opportunity to speak to the country in a different way than a white running mate with her criminal justice record might have had. That there are people who may be willing to accept her embrace, her evolution on certain matters of police misconduct, police reform, criminal justice, because she can speak to those issues from the perspective of her own identity in a way that a white candidate could not.\n\nmichael barbaro\n\nOK. So next in these overlapping realities that guided Bidens choice, we have the pandemic, both as a public health crisis and an economic crisis. So how did that further narrow the field, influence the choice?\n\nalex burns\n\nSo this is a trickier one. Because the candidates for vice president who were most directly in contact with the pandemic, most directly involved in responding to the pandemic, were governors and mayors. But the pandemic has made it really hard for a lot of people to imagine choosing a running mate who would be campaigning for vice president at the same time as they were managing a crisis on the ground, where it would just be awfully difficult to imagine the governor of a state being out at a political fundraiser every day, or doing political morning shows when their state is experiencing a second wave of the virus in October.\n\nmichael barbaro\n\nSo are you saying that Kamala Harriss lack of responsibility in this pandemic was actually kind of an asset.\n\nalex burns\n\nWell, I think for all the senators the lack of day-to-day management responsibility in the coronavirus pandemic  yes, absolutely an asset to them in being considered as a political candidate for the fall.\n\nmichael barbaro\n\nAnd finally, Bidens age and his energy are kind of this third overlapping reality that you said would shape the decision. So how did that shape it?\n\nalex burns\n\nIt shapes it in a couple ways. Some of them are about governing, and some of them are about the political future of the Democratic party. When you talk to voters, when you see polls about how people see Biden, how people think about his vice presidential choice, there is clearly a sense that he is choosing a back up president in a way that you might not have if Biden were 57. And you put that together with the gravity of the crisis that this country is in, and the bar for what a vice president needs to bring to the table on the first day gets a lot higher. Kamala Harris ran for president. People know her as a former presidential candidate. Shes not a new face to most of the country. And that feeds into the dimension to this thats about the political future of the Democratic party as well.\n\nmichael barbaro\n\nWell, so youre starting to get at this. But how strongly do you think the age question, the succession question, influenced who Biden felt he could select in terms of their politics? Not just in terms of the future of the party, but the future of his ticket, whether he can win in the fall. And Im thinking about a voter who might be comfortable with the idea of a Vice President Warren, for example, right? But if they are thinking to themselves, but if something happens to Biden or if he doesnt seek re-election, am I comfortable with a President Warren? And therefore, he needed to choose a candidate whose politics aligned with his, resembled his, so that voters didnt feel like a more progressive figure was kind of being snuck into office through the back door of Joe Biden.\n\nalex burns\n\nWell, that is exactly the message that the Trump campaign is trying to push about Joe Biden. That he is a Trojan horse for the left. So we know that Joe Biden feels an affinity and a respect for Elizabeth Warren. And theyve gotten closer over the last few months. It clearly would have been a significant political risk for him to choose a running mate who is seen by a lot of the moderate white folks who are currently supporting him as an alternative to President Trump  might make them feel, like, maybe the president has a point. But in Kamala Harris, I think they feel they have somebody who cannot easily be caricatured as some flag burning radical who wants to burn down police stations. Right? Thats not the truth of her political biography. And it leaves the Trump campaign with a somewhat difficult task in trying to caricature the Biden ticket and a potential Biden administration as some kind of stealth project of the extreme left in this country.\n\nmichael barbaro\n\nSo with everything that you have laid out here, did all this leave Biden with many choices? Did you expect it to be Harris?\n\nalex burns\n\nSo Ill say two things to that. The first is, and Im glad you asked this. Because part of how weve been talking about this, I hope it doesnt sound to people like this was merely a process of elimination with Kamala Harris as the last person standing. She was one of the strongest candidates at the start, and in the middle, and obviously at the end. And there was never really any doubt that she would be one of the finalists. And the second part of this is that one thing we heard consistently was that he was making the selection from a position of political strength. That he is substantially ahead of President Trump in the polls right now. And if he had felt like, you know, the governing partner I want is somebody who I will have to defend from attacks that she is too liberal, like Elizabeth Warren, or that shes inexperienced, like Keisha Lance Bottoms, he definitely could have done that. And he didnt. He chose Kamala Harris.\n\nmichael barbaro\n\nSo now that we have Harris as the running mate, lets talk about what she brings and what kind of voters she is meant to appeal to. Who might go to the polls, or I guess the mailbox in this case, because of this choice of Kamala Harris? In the mind of Joe Biden and his advisers, I mean, how does this help him win in the fall?\n\nalex burns\n\nI think that they hope she will keep the broad appeal that Joe Biden currently has, while exciting groups that are currently voting for him but maybe without an enormous amount of enthusiasm. Think about young people. Think about educated left of left of center voters who may have supported Elizabeth Warren in the Democratic primary and see Joe Biden as just a figure from the past. Theyre not looking at Kamala Harris as somebody who is going to go out there and electrify the left the way somebody closer to Bernie Sanders or Elizabeth Warren might. Theyre looking at her as somebody who will excite Democrats and liberals and young people, because she does represent a breakthrough for the country, because she can speak about the themes of the Biden campaign with a perspective and a biography that Joe Biden himself lacks. And so the hope among Democrats and the hope of the Biden campaign is that Kamala Harris can do all of that without becoming a divisive or scary figure to voters in the center and to the right of center who are currently supporting Joe Biden but maybe havent voted for a Democrat in a while or ever.\n\nmichael barbaro\n\nSo what Harris does theoretically, in the eyes of the Biden campaign, is she firms up Biden supporters who may be skeptical. She helps bring in some people who might be on the fence. And she does that without alienating his existing base of supporters and without inflaming a whole bunch of other Americans, including Trump supporters.\n\nalex burns\n\nAgain, thats the hope. Whether it turns out that way I think is a really open question. And there are Democrats, including pretty senior Democrats who are pretty close to the Biden campaign, who will acknowledge at least in private that they really dont know how a lot of those voters in the middle will react to the idea of a Black woman being a 78-year-old heartbeat away from the presidency. So its not that theres no risk involved here. There is just a bet that there are more people in the country by a lot who will be excited by somebody who looks and sounds like Kamala Harris than people who will be turned off, or at least people who will be turned off who were open to Joe Biden to begin with. But, again, I think there is a high degree of confidence that the country is broadly ready for a ticket that looks like this. There is just some uncertainty about exactly who is ready for it.\n\n[music]\n\nmichael barbaro\n\nWell be right back Alex, weve been talking a lot about Biden, how hes thinking about this decision of a running mate. We havent talked much about how Kamala Harris is thinking about it. And I am mindful that she delivered the single most searing and memorable attack on Joe Biden \n\narchived recording (kamala harris) Vice President Biden \n\nmichael barbaro\n\n during the Democratic primary.\n\narchived recording (kamala harris) I do not believe you are a racist. But I also believe, and it is personal  and I was actually very  it was hurtful to hear you talk about the reputations of two United States senators who built their reputations and career on the segregation of race in this country. And it was not only that, but you also worked with them to oppose busing.\n\nmichael barbaro\n\nBasically saying that he was sympathetic to segregation and segregationists.\n\narchived recording (kamala harris) Do you agree today that you were wrong to oppose busing in America then? Do you agree? archived recording (joe biden) I did not oppose busing in America. What I opposed is busing ordered by the Department of Education.\n\nmichael barbaro\n\nWords that you really cant ever take back when you have said them on live television. So how does Harris square that  that point of view, that statement  with this decision to be Bidens running mate?\n\nalex burns\n\nIn a couple ways. You know, even at the most pitched moments of conflict between Joe Biden and Kamala Harris in the Democratic primary, I didnt talk to anybody in either of their camps who suggested that they just cannot stand each other, that they fundamentally see each other as bad people who were in politics for the wrong reasons. I think its pretty clear at this point that she did not think that his views on race were utterly disqualifying. And one of the things that I am personally going to be watching for with great interest is: What is the public chemistry and personal rapport between Joe Biden and Kamala Harris? How do they talk about this stuff when they get asked about it?\n\nmichael barbaro\n\nRight.\n\nalex burns\n\nI think its hard to imagine that Joe Biden would have chosen her if he didnt feel he had sufficient confidence based on their private conversations that the past is the past. But lets hear him say that for himself, if that is indeed how he feels.\n\nmichael barbaro\n\nAlex, do you think in any way the Biden campaign liked the idea of picking someone who had so publicly attacked him? Did they see any value in that?\n\nalex burns\n\nIll tell you what they did like, is they liked the idea of picking somebody who can deliver that kind of attack. Not against Joe Biden, but against Donald Trump, against Mike Pence in a vice presidential debate. You know, just a recognition that that person has real moves and real skills.\n\nmichael barbaro\n\nRight.\n\nalex burns\n\nAnd that even people who didnt like what she did to Joe Biden recognize that there was a kind of political dexterity and panache that Joe Biden himself has really not exhibited in this race.\n\nmichael barbaro\n\nWell, to that point, are we expecting Kamala Harris to be used to attack the president over the next three months or so? I mean, I vividly remember people during the Democratic debates, the pundit class, talking about the prospect of seeing Harris apply the same kind of sharp prosecutorial flair that she had used against Biden on Donald Trump.\n\nalex burns\n\nI think theres a universal expectation among Democrats that Kamala Harris will be a obviously major carrier of a message of criticism and denunciation against the Trump administration. And that in her role in the Senate, she will continue to really hold the administrations feet to the fire in different ways. There is  not to get too far ahead of the game here  but if we did have a Supreme Court confirmation battle in the middle of all of this, she is a member of the Judiciary Committee. That has been a major source of her stature and popularity within the Democratic party, because of how she handled moments like the Brett Kavanaugh confirmations.\n\narchived recording (kamala harris) So Im going to ask you one last time, are you willing to ask the White House to authorize the F.B.I. to investigate the claims that have been made against you? archived recording (brett kavanaugh) Well, Ill do whatever the committee wants, of course. archived recording (kamala harris) And Ive heard you say that. archived recording (brett kavanaugh) The witness statements  archived recording (kamala harris) Ive not heard you ask  Ive not heard you answer a very specific question thats been asked.\n\nalex burns\n\nSo I think theres a high degree of optimism and sky high expectations for the role that Harris will play in, as she would put it, prosecuting the case against Donald Trump.\n\narchived recording (kamala harris) So are you willing to ask the White House to do it?

Decision'	2020-08-12	[]	[b'president', b'recording', b'trump', b'historic', b'think', b'really', b'harris', b'decision', b'know', b'biden', b'joe', b'vp', b'kamala']	b'michael barbaro\n\nFrom The New York Times, Im Michael Barbaro. This is The Daily. Today: Joe Biden picks Senator Kamala Harris of California as his running mate, making her the first Black woman and the first Asian-American woman to run for vice president on a major party ticket. Alex Burns on the historic decision. Its Wednesday, August 12. Alex, did you get the text message from the Biden campaign?\n\nalex burns\n\nYou know, I had the text messages forwarded to me by several other people before I got it myself. But I suppose I was notified by text message, just not directly from the Biden campaign.\n\nmichael barbaro\n\nJust not the Biden text message? I actually am pretty disappointed. Because I signed up for the text message from the Biden campaign, and I didnt get a text message. So I suppose this answers the inevitable question, how do you make an enormous announcement during a pandemic? Which is you do it via text message. You just dont send it to Alex Burns or Michael Barbaro.\n\nalex burns\n\n[LAUGHS]\n\nmichael barbaro\n\nOK. So onto the decision itself. It is 7:00 p.m. on Tuesday evening. Joe Biden announced his choice about three hours ago, that it was going to be Kamala Harris. And Alex, the last time that we spoke with you, we talked about three overlapping realities that you said were influencing Bidens choice of a running mate  the nationwide protests over race and policing, the pandemic and the economic collapse. And then there was Bidens age, the fact that he would be the oldest president to assume the office. So how does Biden get from those realities to Kamala Harris?\n\nalex burns\n\nSo I think in some ways they are three distinct forces. And in some ways, they really are different strands of the same big current. Which is that Biden was looking from the start for a running mate who he saw and who he believed the country would see as a really serious person for really serious times. Now that could mean a whole bunch of different things. But one of the reasons why I think you end up seeing Kamala Harris emerge as the vice president is that she straddles all the different forces of this moment in a way that nobody else on the short list did or, at least demonstrated that they did. She was a senator who marched in racial justice protests this spring and who led a charge in the Senate to make lynching a federal crime. She is a familiar face to Democratic voters, not only from her presidential campaign, but from her interrogations of Trump officials in the Judiciary Committee at a time when Democrats are really struggling to hold the administration to account over its handling of the coronavirus pandemic. And shes somebody of, clearly in Joe Bidens eyes, sufficient and diverse enough political experience and stature that she will look to voters like somebody who is ready to be president.\n\nmichael barbaro\n\nMhm. Well lets drill into these three realities, each individually, just a little bit further. And I want to start with the nationwide protests, the questions around race. How did that influence the choice? You mentioned Kamala Harris marching in some of these protests and the work she has done in the Senate.\n\nalex burns\n\nRight. You had, at the outset of the season of protest, a number of figures on Bidens vice presidential list really speak up about matters of racial justice and policing. You had Val Demings, the congresswoman from Florida, a former police chief, become an outspoken champion of police reform. But you also saw people come under the microscope in less flattering ways, including Val Demings. That there was a sense from the start among Democrats that anybody on the short list who has touched the criminal justice system in their career is going to really need to have their record picked over. And that happened with Val Demings. She was the police chief in Orlando. And there are some questions about how appropriately she handled matters of police misconduct on her watch.\n\nmichael barbaro\n\nWell, what about Harriss history as attorney general in California? Because that was a significant focus during her own primary run for president. And my sense is that a lot of progressive voters, a lot of Black voters  especially in California  are skeptical of her record and question whether or not shes the right figure in this moment. I recall that she once described herself as the states top cop.\n\nalex burns\n\nI think thats one of the questions that we are going to see play out in this campaign going forward  is whether she can address the criticism of her record as a prosecutor more convincingly in a general election than she did during the primary. And the question is, has she done enough in the last few months, in the wake of George Floyd, in the midst of these demonstrations, to show that she is serious about criminal justice reform as a matter of governing now, that people who looked askance at her record during the Democratic primaries say, you know what? This is good enough or even better than good enough.\n\nmichael barbaro\n\nAnd in thinking about race and this moment, how should we be thinking about fact that Harris is herself a Black woman?\n\nalex burns\n\nWell thats of course of enormous importance in this moment. That I think starting in the late spring, the sense among people close to Biden was that it would be tough in this moment to really meet the political mood of the country if the Democrats put forward an all white ticket. That Joe Biden, as a 77-year-old white guy, needed a running mate who could speak to the countrys multiracial future in a way that he with his identity could not. And so, between her identity as a Black woman and as an Indian-American woman, Senator Harris, I think, clearly has an opportunity to speak to the country in a different way than a white running mate with her criminal justice record might have had. That there are people who may be willing to accept her embrace, her evolution on certain matters of police misconduct, police reform, criminal justice, because she can speak to those issues from the perspective of her own identity in a way that a white candidate could not.\n\nmichael barbaro\n\nOK. So next in these overlapping realities that guided Bidens choice, we have the pandemic, both as a public health crisis and an economic crisis. So how did that further narrow the field, influence the choice?\n\nalex burns\n\nSo this is a trickier one. Because the candidates for vice president who were most directly in contact with the pandemic, most directly involved in responding to the pandemic, were governors and mayors. But the pandemic has made it really hard for a lot of people to imagine choosing a running mate who would be campaigning for vice president at the same time as they were managing a crisis on the ground, where it would just be awfully difficult to imagine the governor of a state being out at a political fundraiser every day, or doing political morning shows when their state is experiencing a second wave of the virus in October.\n\nmichael barbaro\n\nSo are you saying that Kamala Harriss lack of responsibility in this pandemic was actually kind of an asset.\n\nalex burns\n\nWell, I think for all the senators the lack of day-to-day management responsibility in the coronavirus pandemic  yes, absolutely an asset to them in being considered as a political candidate for the fall.\n\nmichael barbaro\n\nAnd finally, Bidens age and his energy are kind of this third overlapping reality that you said would shape the decision. So how did that shape it?\n\nalex burns\n\nIt shapes it in a couple ways. Some of them are about governing, and some of them are about the political future of the Democratic party. When you talk to voters, when you see polls about how people see Biden, how people think about his vice presidential choice, there is clearly a sense that he is choosing a back up president in a way that you might not have if Biden were 57. And you put that together with the gravity of the crisis that this country is in, and the bar for what a vice president needs to bring to the table on the first day gets a lot higher. Kamala Harris ran for president. People know her as a former presidential candidate. Shes not a new face to most of the country. And that feeds into the dimension to this thats about the political future of the Democratic party as well.\n\nmichael barbaro\n\nWell, so youre starting to get at this. But how strongly do you think the age question, the succession question, influenced who Biden felt he could select in terms of their politics? Not just in terms of the future of the party, but the future of his ticket, whether he can win in the fall. And Im thinking about a voter who might be comfortable with the idea of a Vice President Warren, for example, right? But if they are thinking to themselves, but if something happens to Biden or if he doesnt seek re-election, am I comfortable with a President Warren? And therefore, he needed to choose a candidate whose politics aligned with his, resembled his, so that voters didnt feel like a more progressive figure was kind of being snuck into office through the back door of Joe Biden.\n\nalex burns\n\nWell, that is exactly the message that the Trump campaign is trying to push about Joe Biden. That he is a Trojan horse for the left. So we know that Joe Biden feels an affinity and a respect for Elizabeth Warren. And theyve gotten closer over the last few months. It clearly would have been a significant political risk for him to choose a running mate who is seen by a lot of the moderate white folks who are currently supporting him as an alternative to President Trump  might make them feel, like, maybe the president has a point. But in Kamala Harris, I think they feel they have somebody who cannot easily be caricatured as some flag burning radical who wants to burn down police stations. Right? Thats not the truth of her political biography. And it leaves the Trump campaign with a somewhat difficult task in trying to caricature the Biden ticket and a potential Biden administration as some kind of stealth project of the extreme left in this country.\n\nmichael barbaro\n\nSo with everything that you have laid out here, did all this leave Biden with many choices? Did you expect it to be Harris?\n\nalex burns\n\nSo Ill say two things to that. The first is, and Im glad you asked this. Because part of how weve been talking about this, I hope it doesnt sound to people like this was merely a process of elimination with Kamala Harris as the last person standing. She was one of the strongest candidates at the start, and in the middle, and obviously at the end. And there was never really any doubt that she would be one of the finalists. And the second part of this is that one thing we heard consistently was that he was making the selection from a position of political strength. That he is substantially ahead of President Trump in the polls right now. And if he had felt like, you know, the governing partner I want is somebody who I will have to defend from attacks that she is too liberal, like Elizabeth Warren, or that shes inexperienced, like Keisha Lance Bottoms, he definitely could have done that. And he didnt. He chose Kamala Harris.\n\nmichael barbaro\n\nSo now that we have Harris as the running mate, lets talk about what she brings and what kind of voters she is meant to appeal to. Who might go to the polls, or I guess the mailbox in this case, because of this choice of Kamala Harris? In the mind of Joe Biden and his advisers, I mean, how does this help him win in the fall?\n\nalex burns\n\nI think that they hope she will keep the broad appeal that Joe Biden currently has, while exciting groups that are currently voting for him but maybe without an enormous amount of enthusiasm. Think about young people. Think about educated left of left of center voters who may have supported Elizabeth Warren in the Democratic primary and see Joe Biden as just a figure from the past. Theyre not looking at Kamala Harris as somebody who is going to go out there and electrify the left the way somebody closer to Bernie Sanders or Elizabeth Warren might. Theyre looking at her as somebody who will excite Democrats and liberals and young people, because she does represent a breakthrough for the country, because she can speak about the themes of the Biden campaign with a perspective and a biography that Joe Biden himself lacks. And so the hope among Democrats and the hope of the Biden campaign is that Kamala Harris can do all of that without becoming a divisive or scary figure to voters in the center and to the right of center who are currently supporting Joe Biden but maybe havent voted for a Democrat in a while or ever.\n\nmichael barbaro\n\nSo what Harris does theoretically, in the eyes of the Biden campaign, is she firms up Biden supporters who may be skeptical. She helps bring in some people who might be on the fence. And she does that without alienating his existing base of supporters and without inflaming a whole bunch of other Americans, including Trump supporters.\n\nalex burns\n\nAgain, thats the hope. Whether it turns out that way I think is a really open question. And there are Democrats, including pretty senior Democrats who are pretty close to the Biden campaign, who will acknowledge at least in private that they really dont know how a lot of those voters in the middle will react to the idea of a Black woman being a 78-year-old heartbeat away from the presidency. So its not that theres no risk involved here. There is just a bet that there are more people in the country by a lot who will be excited by somebody who looks and sounds like Kamala Harris than people who will be turned off, or at least people who will be turned off who were open to Joe Biden to begin with. But, again, I think there is a high degree of confidence that the country is broadly ready for a ticket that looks like this. There is just some uncertainty about exactly who is ready for it.\n\n[music]\n\nmichael barbaro\n\nWell be right back Alex, weve been talking a lot about Biden, how hes thinking about this decision of a running mate. We havent talked much about how Kamala Harris is thinking about it. And I am mindful that she delivered the single most searing and memorable attack on Joe Biden \n\narchived recording (kamala harris) Vice President Biden \n\nmichael barbaro\n\n during the Democratic primary.\n\narchived recording (kamala harris) I do not believe you are a racist. But I also believe, and it is personal  and I was actually very  it was hurtful to hear you talk about the reputations of two United States senators who built their reputations and career on the segregation of race in this country. And it was not only that, but you also worked with them to oppose busing.\n\nmichael barbaro\n\nBasically saying that he was sympathetic to segregation and segregationists.\n\narchived recording (kamala harris) Do you agree today that you were wrong to oppose busing in America then?

John Eligon on the thinking behind those plans and what they might look like in practice. Its Tuesday, June 9.\n\narchived recording (protestors) (CHANTING) I cant breathe! I cant breathe!\n\njohn eligon\n\nIn the early days of the protests after George Floyd was killed \n\narchived recording (protestors) (CHANTING) No justice, no peace! No justice, no peace!\n\njohn eligon\n\n it was just pure emotions and raw rage.\n\narchived recording (protestors) [EXPLETIVE] these racist [EXPLETIVE] police!\n\njohn eligon\n\nBut pretty soon, once the more fiery protests and fiery unrest died down, then we started seeing the organizers come in and talking about what they want. And one thing we quickly saw were these face masks that people were wearing. They were black, and they had yellow writing on them. And they said, Defund police.\n\nmichael barbaro\n\nHmm.\n\njohn eligon\n\nAnd from there, you start hearing these calls at protest, at rallies.\n\narchived recording (protestors) (CHANTING) Defund the police! Defund the police!\n\njohn eligon\n\nYou start hearing, Defund the police. You start hearing calls to abolish the police. You start seeing people waving signs. And it became clear that this was an opening that a lot of activists saw to take this moment of a very brutal police killing and turn it into something much larger.\n\narchived recording (protestor 1) Do the right thing! archived recording (protestor 2) Defund the police!\n\nmichael barbaro\n\nSo John, what do these concepts  defund, dismantle, abolish the police  what exactly do they mean?\n\njohn eligon\n\nTo defund, when activists say that, what they mean is taking money away from the police departments budget and redirect it toward other things  whether that be social services, agencies, maybe mental health agencies  that can do functions that police are often called on to do.\n\nmichael barbaro\n\nMm-hmm.\n\njohn eligon\n\nBut if you fully defund it, you can get to a space where the police department is abolished. And so essentially, what that means is that there is no more police department as we know it. You dont call these men and women in blue shirts to come racing to your door with their guns in hand. It means that they have to figure out some other form of providing that public safety, and the police department would not be that form.\n\nmichael barbaro\n\nAnd where did these concepts come from?\n\njohn eligon\n\nWell, at their core, they come from the problems and issues that especially communities of color, especially black communities, have had with policing. They see police coming into their communities to brutalize them, not to protect and serve them. And that has really influenced this desire to keep the police away, to do something else. And weve seen, basically, that governments and police forces, they respond with certain reforms. Weve seen efforts for body cameras. Weve seen diversifying the police departments. Weve seen changes to the rules on use of force.\n\nmichael barbaro\n\nMm-hmm.\n\njohn eligon\n\nBut what became clear to a lot of todays activists, and what they say explicitly, is that these reforms are not working. If you look at since Michael Brown was killed in Ferguson, Missouri six years ago, the police have continued to kill people at high rates, and especially black people at disproportionately high rates. And so for them, the only solution is to tear it down and build something new.\n\nmichael barbaro\n\nSo John, what might it actually look like in practice to defund or abolish a police department?\n\njohn eligon\n\nSo for instance, if someone is homeless and theyre struggling on the streets, a person can call 9-1-1, and instead of an armed police officer being sent out, perhaps there can be an outreach worker from a homeless services agency. Or if you have someone having a mental health episode, then again, you can call 9-1-1, and instead of a police officer, maybe a health care worker, a mental health worker will come out. And the idea behind it is to really cut down the interactions between armed police officers and civilians. And by doing that, the hope is that it will reduce their conflict and the potential for people getting hurt or killed by police officers.\n\nmichael barbaro\n\nRight. I mean, that makes a certain sense, especially for a community where theres not a lot of violent crime. But every community is different, right? And some towns, some cities  I think about New York City, for example  have a significantly higher rate of violent crime that would seem to require having armed police. So how do activists think about that?\n\njohn eligon\n\nFor a lot of the activists that I spoke to, the issue was about centering public safety on communities. And one activist that I spoke to, Arianna Nason, she said essentially its going to be up to each community to decide what public safety looks like for itself.\n\narianna nason Its going to be up to every community to decide what they need. We cant decide that.\n\njohn eligon\n\nSo maybe thats armed patrols. Maybe thats mental health workers. Maybe thats some sort of mobile units with social workers sitting in it, and people are trained in using force and different things. One of the big ideas is this idea of community policing, community watch. And its interesting. I had said isnt an issue, though, with community policing or community patrols, neighborhood watch, that if I walk into that community, as a black man with dreadlocks, if I walk into one of these communities, we see what happens with neighborhood watch. We see Trayvon Martin. We see Ahmaud Arbery.\n\njohn eligon Should that be a concern, then? I guess with this community-type based model that certain people who look a certain way might go into the neighborhood, and that community might decide to take it into their own hands and then take it overboard, I guess.\n\njohn eligon\n\nAnd she took off her sunglasses. She looked at me, and she said \n\narianna nason No, I get that. And Ill be really real with you. For me, personally, I dont have all the answers for that. I dont. And I wish I did. A lot of it is \n\njohn eligon\n\nHonestly, I dont really know the answer to that right now.\n\nmichael barbaro\n\nHuh.\n\njohn eligon\n\nShe was not sure exactly what the answer was. And see, this is all to say, its still very tricky and very much a work in progress. But what she did say is that the current system also is not working for me either. So its a matter of what are they going to do differently? And they believe that something drastically different needs to be done.\n\nmichael barbaro\n\nMm-hmm. As best you can tell, would any of the familiar elements of an existing police department  Im thinking, for the sake of argument, homicide detectives, special victims units that investigate sexual assault or rape  do those remain? Do they take a different form? Do they adopt a different name? Has that been fleshed out?\n\njohn eligon\n\nI would say, no, its not been fleshed out. Because again, we go back to the fact that this is not going to be some federal commission, or even state commission or a city commission for anywhere thats going to come up with, like, these are the rules for public safety now. And these are all things that need to be worked out. And I think what people say with things like homicide investigations, with sex crimes investigations and things like that, they say a couple of things. One, the police are not doing a good job at those anyways. So you have lots of cities where the clearance rate on homicides and other investigations is miserable. You had, even here in Minneapolis, there was a big scandal with all the rape kits that they had untested. So they had a lot of issues with crimes that were not being investigated properly. And then, the second thing that people say is that those jobs can be taken up by specialized, trained people. You can build new institutions to do those things that arent necessary policing. I did talk to one council member who said, maybe theres still police, but for very, very limited role, and many of their responsibilities are farmed out. You know, anything short of some sort of active violence, you dont need police for. So in some peoples eyes, that would still be a police force. But one thing that the people who are most ardent about abolishing the police or defunding the police, even, they make it clear that they dont just want a system in which its police in another name, police with another uniform on.\n\n[music]\n\nAnd these demands to defund the police, theyve actually been brewing in Minneapolis for several years now. Ever since a police killing back in 2015, theres been several local activist groups working on it. And those activist groups came together this past weekend in what was probably the biggest and most clearest demand for defunding the police.\n\nmichael barbaro\n\nWell be right back.\n\narchived recording (protestors) (CHANTING) Abolish the M.P.D.!\n\njohn eligon\n\nSo there were hundreds of activists who went and gathered in front of the mayor Jacob Freys house.\n\narchived recording (protestors) Abolish the M.P.D.! And they had a megaphone. They were chanting. They were screaming. And sure enough, the mayor came out to talk to the protesters. He kind of made his way through the crowd, walked up to the front, and you had one of the lead organizers for a group called the Black Visions Collective. Kandace Montgomery, she was standing up on a riser there, talking down in a megaphone to the mayor. archived recording (kandace montgomery) Jacob Frey, we have a yes-or-no question for you. Yes or no, will you commit to defunding Minneapolis Police Department? archived recording (jacob frey) [INAUDIBLE]\n\njohn eligon\n\nAnd you could tell, like, there is this hesitation because he knows this is not going to go well, right? You have all these very vocal, very ardent activists around you who want you to defund the police.\n\narchived recording (kandace montgomery) Will you defund the Minneapolis Police Department? archived recording [CROWD MURMURING] archived recording (kandace montgomery) All right, be quiet yall. Be quiet, because its important that we actually hear this. Its important that we hear this, because if yall dont know, hes up for re-election next year. archived recording [CROWD CHEERING]\n\njohn eligon\n\nAnd then \n\narchived recording (jacob frey) I do not support the full abolition of the police department. archived recording (kandace montgomery) All right! archived recording (speaker) Youre wasting our time! Get the [EXPLETIVE] out of here!\n\njohn eligon\n\nAnd he gives his answer  he does not support full abolition of the police.\n\narchived recording (crowd) (CHANTING) Go home, Jacob, go home! Go home, Jacob, go home!\n\njohn eligon\n\nAnd he turns around, and he just kind of walked off into the sea of people.\n\narchived recording (crowd) (CHANTING) Shame! Shame! Shame! Shame! Shame! Shame! Shame! Shame! Shame!\n\njohn eligon\n\nSo after this event, there was already an event planned for the following day by some of these same activists organizations, in which they were going to bring council members who were supportive of their cause onto a stage in a park in the Southern part of the city. And they were going to try to get them to make a commitment to defunding the police.\n\nmichael barbaro\n\nSo a lot like what they had done to the mayor?\n\njohn eligon\n\nExactly.\n\narchived recording (lisa bender) Hi, Minneapolis. You look so beautiful today. Im Lisa Bender. Im the president of the Minneapolis City Council.\n\njohn eligon\n\nAnd so we had this gathering where there were hundreds of residents.\n\narchived recording (lisa bender) Our efforts at incremental reform have failed. Period.\n\njohn eligon\n\nAnd you had council members.\n\narchived recording (lisa bender) Our commitment is to do whats necessary to keep every single member of our community safe, and to tell the truth that the Minneapolis Police are not doing that. [CROWD CHEERS]\n\njohn eligon\n\nAnd you had nine of them who went up on the stage.\n\narchived recording (council member 1) We are here today to begin the process of ending the Minneapolis Police Department. [CROWD CHEERS]\n\njohn eligon\n\nAnd then all nine of them each read a part pledging to defend the police.\n\narchived recording (council member 2) All of us on this stage support this statement, and we stand with the people of Minneapolis in fighting for a safer community. [CROWD CHEERS]\n\njohn eligon\n\nThe last council member, he basically said, and we are all committing to this pledge. And at that moment, it was like this emotional eruption.\n\narchived recording (speaker) [INAUDIBLE], get up, yall. We are transforming our city right now. Get up! get\n\njohn eligon\n\nYou had white people, black people, Asian people, all putting their fists in the air, shouting, defund the police, defund police.\n\narchived recording (crowd) (CHANTING) Defund M.P.D.! Defund M.P.D.! Defund M.P.D.!\n\nmichael barbaro\n\nSo just to be clear, this is not a vote, and not necessarily even a pledge to vote, but this is a public commitment to defund the police  to do the very thing that the mayor, when asked, declined to agree to 24 hours before.\n\njohn eligon\n\nYes, exactly. This is a pledge that they are going to defund the police. It is not a vote. It is not anything set in stone or written. But these are putting them all on record in front of many community members, saying that we are going to do this. And I even asked the activists about that. I said, weve heard politicians say things before and not keep those pledges. But this is something that they saw theyve been working on with them together in tandem. So I think theres a level of trust there that this pledge has really meant something. And you could see it in the reaction of the people who were there. They were really describing it as their Civil Rights Movement, their Voting Rights Act moment.\n\nmichael barbaro\n\nWow. And John, can the members of the City Council who were in that park, making this pledge, do they have the actual authority to take away funding from the police department?\n\njohn eligon\n\nYes, they absolutely have voting authority to do that. The council actually controls the police departments budget. And whats more significant about this moment is that because there were nine of them, those nine seats represents a veto-proof majority. So even if the mayor, Jacob Frey, does not want this to happen, if that coalition sticks together, they can do this on their own. And I think what were seeing is this sentiment is growing in traction in certain places. Like we already have in New York and Los Angeles, the mayors in both of those cities have already said that they are going to be redirecting funds that were intended for the police toward other parts of the city, toward other agencies in the city.\n\nmichael barbaro\n\nIm curious what the appetite for this kind of change to policing is, beyond the cities where there are largely Democratic city councils and mayors, and where this is now under discussion.\n\njohn eligon\n\nThats a very key question, right? Were already seeing conservatives coming out against this and talking about this is as very radical leftist step to be taking. We see Donald Trump already tweeting about it. So certainly, this is something that, for conservative communities, something like this would be a tougher sell. And so again, policing is a very local thing. So what you experience and what the police force does or does not look like in Minneapolis is going to be very different than what it does or does not look like in Edina, which is just outside of Minneapolis, or any other suburb. So its going to be, in some ways, a patchwork of public safety, I think, if these things start happening around the country.\n\nmichael barbaro\n\nAnd I guess an open question is whether or not this has entered the mainstream, even of the Democratic Party. Just a few hours before you and I began to talk, Joe Biden came out and said he does not support defunding the police.\n\njohn eligon\n\nYeah, this is certainly not something that is part of the mainstream or moderate Democratic platform. That said, you do get some people who might be in these more moderate spaces, you do get their attention and you do get their ear, is this sense that policing is not working  which is just the basis of what these defund or abolish the police efforts are about, is that the system is not working. And so you will get even the more moderate folks to say that, to buy into that. And that may not result in them supporting a defund or abolishment, but will it support more stringent reforms, more significant reforms to police? So well see what happens.\n\nmichael barbaro\n\nI wonder how the activists that youre talking to see the challenge of explaining what these concepts are going to mean. Because in this moment, I think many Americans are really hearing these calls  defund, dismantle, abolish  for the first time. And they may be very wary of them, and they may see them as quite radical.\n\njohn eligon\n\nWhat the activists will tell you is that while it might sound radical for many Americans, this actually is not all that radical for a large section of this country.\n\njohn eligon What was your name, sir? yahzerah brazelton Yaazirah john eligon How do you spell that? yahzerah brazelton Y-A-H- \n\njohn eligon\n\nIf you go to black and brown communities  like I went up to the North Side of Minneapolis  and you talk to people about their experiences with the police there, it is not the experience of expecting an officer to come and help you. Its exactly the opposite. And I was speaking with a couple there, Amanda and Yaazirah Brazelton.\n\nyahzerah brazelton Its about time for a change. amanda brazelton A change, yeah. yahzerah brazelton Yeah. About time for a change.\n\njohn eligon\n\nAnd they were telling me that from a young age, essentially, they already had horrific experiences with the police.\n\nyahzerah brazelton [INAUDIBLE] I have police put guns in my face, you know, at seven years old, coming to my house with my mother and my father arguing, just regular argument that happens with a husband and wife.\n\njohn eligon\n\nYaazirah, he was seven years old when the police came to his house when his parents were having an argument.\n\nyahzerah brazelton And they put guns in my face and put us all on the ground.\n\njohn eligon\n\nAnd then they stuck a gun in his face.\n\nyahzerah brazelton They traumatized me in childhood, so I was really against white police officers since.\n\njohn eligon\n\nAnd his wife Amanda, she was 14 when she was in a car with white people, and shes black.\n\namanda brazelton We were driving in the car. All my white friends got out. And as soon as I got out, they pulled guns, yelled at \n\njohn eligon\n\nAnd when they were pulled over, the cops let the white people out, but then they pulled guns on her.\n\namanda brazelton Im 14 years old, in the backseat of the car, not doing nothing wrong. And that was my first real incident with the police in that interaction.\n\njohn eligon\n\nAnd so the way they see the police department is not a force where you call and then an Officer Friendly shows up.\n\namanda brazelton Man, I got a houseful of kids that are scared of the police because of what theyve seen.\n\njohn eligon\n\nIts one where Amanda recalled her children have already had run-ins with the police that when someone was breaking into their house once, she didnt call the police, but she called family and friends.\n\namanda brazelton And I called him. I called my brother. I called my uncle. I called my dad, my mom, before called the police.\n\njohn eligon\n\nWhy didnt you call the police?\n\namanda brazelton Because they kill black people. Theyll call me, Ill get killed in my own home.\n\njohn eligon\n\nSo its already a lived experience, a lived reality for people in many black communities, that the police are essentially a force that only exists, in their eyes, to harass them, to brutalize them and not to protect them. And what the activists hope is that people who are scared that abolishing police will suddenly lead to a breakdown in their communities and just rampant violence, theyre saying, no, this will create outcomes that will make the community safer and better, not just for affluent white communities, but for all communities across the country. And so what activists are asking is that people who see this as a radical idea, who cant envision a world without police, theyre asking them to just walk in these peoples shoes, understand what theyre going through.\n\n[music]\n\nmichael barbaro\n\nJohn, thank you very much.\n\njohn eligon\n\nThank you.\n\narchived recording (lisa bender) The nine members of the city council that came from every corner of our city to stand together to make this commitment, we dont have all the answers.\n\nmichael barbaro\n\nIn an interview on Monday, the president of the Minneapolis City Council, one of the nine members who has pledged to defund the citys police department, acknowledged that implementing the plan would likely take years.\n\narchived recording (lisa bender) And if you look back at the last 150 years of our police department, it is becoming increasingly clear that that model of policing isnt working. I hope it wont take 150 years to get to that looking forward, that next solution. But we have a lot of wisdom in our community. We have invested in [INAUDIBLE] \n\n[music]\n\nmichael barbaro\n\nWell be right back. Heres what else you need to know today.\n\narchived recording (karen bass) Good morning, everyone. The Justice in Policing Act establishes a bold, transformative vision of policing in America.\n\nmichael barbaro\n\nOn Monday, Congressional Democrats introduced the most sweeping federal plan to reform the police in modern memory.\n\narchived recording (karen bass) Never again should the world be subjected to witnessing what we saw on the streets in Minneapolis  the slow murder of an individual by a uniformed police officer.\n\nmichael barbaro\n\nThe legislation would reduce the legal protections that now shield police officers accused of misconduct from being prosecuted, and would impose new restrictions to prevent police officers from using deadly force. The measure is expected to quickly pass in the House, where theres a Democratic majority, but faces an uncertain future in the Republican-controlled Senate. Meanwhile, state-level reforms continue. On Monday, New Yorks legislature banned the use of chokeholds by police and repealed a statute that effectively hid the disciplinary records of police officers. And \n\narchived recording (dr. tedros adhonom) Almost 7 million cases of Covid-19 have now been reported to W.H.O., and almost 400,000 deaths. Although the situation in Europe is improving, globally, its worsening.\n\nmichael barbaro\n\nThe World Health Organization said that the number of new daily infections from the coronavirus hit a record high  more than 136,000 on Sunday  and warned that mass protests in places like the U.S. could further spread the virus.\n\narchived recording (dr. tedros adhonom) We encourage all those protesting around the world to do so safely. Clean your hands, cover your cough and wear a mask if you attend a protest.\n\nmichael barbaro\n\nFinally, the National Bureau of Economic Research said that because of the pandemic, the United States economy officially entered a recession in February, ending the longest economic expansion on record. It began in 2009 and lasted 128 months.\n\n[music]'	b'What Would Efforts to Defund or Disband Police Departments Really Mean?'	2020-06-08	[b'Dionne Searcey']	[b'efforts', b'communities', b'defund', b'minneapolis', b'disband', b'mean', b'eligonand', b'really', b'brazelton', b'department', b'activists', b'community', b'going', b'recording', b'departments']	b'michael barbaro\n\nFrom The New York Times, Im Michael Barbaro.

But one thing that the people who are most ardent about abolishing the police or defunding the police, even, they make it clear that they dont just want a system in which its police in another name, police with another uniform on.\n\n[music]\n\nAnd these demands to defund the police, theyve actually been brewing in Minneapolis for several years now. Ever since a police killing back in 2015, theres been several local activist groups working on it. And those activist groups came together this past weekend in what was probably the biggest and most clearest demand for defunding the police.\n\nmichael barbaro\n\nWell be right back.\n\narchived recording (protestors) (CHANTING) Abolish the M.P.D.!\n\njohn eligon\n\nSo there were hundreds of activists who went and gathered in front of the mayor Jacob Freys house.\n\narchived recording (protestors) Abolish the M.P.D.! And they had a megaphone. They were chanting. They were screaming. And sure enough, the mayor came out to talk to the protesters. He kind of made his way through the crowd, walked up to the front, and you had one of the lead organizers for a group called the Black Visions Collective. Kandace Montgomery, she was standing up on a riser there, talking down in a megaphone to the mayor. archived recording (kandace montgomery) Jacob Frey, we have a yes-or-no question for you. Yes or no, will you commit to defunding Minneapolis Police Department? archived recording (jacob frey) [INAUDIBLE]\n\njohn eligon\n\nAnd you could tell, like, there is this hesitation because he knows this is not going to go well, right? You have all these very vocal, very ardent activists around you who want you to defund the police.\n\narchived recording (kandace montgomery) Will you defund the Minneapolis Police Department? archived recording [CROWD MURMURING] archived recording (kandace montgomery) All right, be quiet yall. Be quiet, because its important that we actually hear this. Its important that we hear this, because if yall dont know, hes up for re-election next year. archived recording [CROWD CHEERING]\n\njohn eligon\n\nAnd then \n\narchived recording (jacob frey) I do not support the full abolition of the police department. archived recording (kandace montgomery) All right! archived recording (speaker) Youre wasting our time! Get the [EXPLETIVE] out of here!\n\njohn eligon\n\nAnd he gives his answer  he does not support full abolition of the police.\n\narchived recording (crowd) (CHANTING) Go home, Jacob, go home! Go home, Jacob, go home!\n\njohn eligon\n\nAnd he turns around, and he just kind of walked off into the sea of people.\n\narchived recording (crowd) (CHANTING) Shame! Shame! Shame! Shame! Shame! Shame! Shame! Shame! Shame!\n\njohn eligon\n\nSo after this event, there was already an event planned for the following day by some of these same activists organizations, in which they were going to bring council members who were supportive of their cause onto a stage in a park in the Southern part of the city. And they were going to try to get them to make a commitment to defunding the police.\n\nmichael barbaro\n\nSo a lot like what they had done to the mayor?\n\njohn eligon\n\nExactly.\n\narchived recording (lisa bender) Hi, Minneapolis. You look so beautiful today. Im Lisa Bender. Im the president of the Minneapolis City Council.\n\njohn eligon\n\nAnd so we had this gathering where there were hundreds of residents.\n\narchived recording (lisa bender) Our efforts at incremental reform have failed. Period.\n\njohn eligon\n\nAnd you had council members.\n\narchived recording (lisa bender) Our commitment is to do whats necessary to keep every single member of our community safe, and to tell the truth that the Minneapolis Police are not doing that. [CROWD CHEERS]\n\njohn eligon\n\nAnd you had nine of them who went up on the stage.\n\narchived recording (council member 1) We are here today to begin the process of ending the Minneapolis Police Department. [CROWD CHEERS]\n\njohn eligon\n\nAnd then all nine of them each read a part pledging to defend the police.\n\narchived recording (council member 2) All of us on this stage support this statement, and we stand with the people of Minneapolis in fighting for a safer community. [CROWD CHEERS]\n\njohn eligon\n\nThe last council member, he basically said, and we are all committing to this pledge. And at that moment, it was like this emotional eruption.\n\narchived recording (speaker) [INAUDIBLE], get up, yall. We are transforming our city right now. Get up! get\n\njohn eligon\n\nYou had white people, black people, Asian people, all putting their fists in the air, shouting, defund the police, defund police.\n\narchived recording (crowd) (CHANTING) Defund M.P.D.! Defund M.P.D.! Defund M.P.D.!\n\nmichael barbaro\n\nSo just to be clear, this is not a vote, and not necessarily even a pledge to vote, but this is a public commitment to defund the police  to do the very thing that the mayor, when asked, declined to agree to 24 hours before.\n\njohn eligon\n\nYes, exactly. This is a pledge that they are going to defund the police. It is not a vote. It is not anything set in stone or written. But these are putting them all on record in front of many community members, saying that we are going to do this. And I even asked the activists about that. I said, weve heard politicians say things before and not keep those pledges. But this is something that they saw theyve been working on with them together in tandem. So I think theres a level of trust there that this pledge has really meant something. And you could see it in the reaction of the people who were there. They were really describing it as their Civil Rights Movement, their Voting Rights Act moment.\n\nmichael barbaro\n\nWow. And John, can the members of the City Council who were in that park, making this pledge, do they have the actual authority to take away funding from the police department?\n\njohn eligon\n\nYes, they absolutely have voting authority to do that. The council actually controls the police departments budget. And whats more significant about this moment is that because there were nine of them, those nine seats represents a veto-proof majority. So even if the mayor, Jacob Frey, does not want this to happen, if that coalition sticks together, they can do this on their own. And I think what were seeing is this sentiment is growing in traction in certain places. Like we already have in New York and Los Angeles, the mayors in both of those cities have already said that they are going to be redirecting funds that were intended for the police toward other parts of the city, toward other agencies in the city.\n\nmichael barbaro\n\nIm curious what the appetite for this kind of change to policing is, beyond the cities where there are largely Democratic city councils and mayors, and where this is now under discussion.\n\njohn eligon\n\nThats a very key question, right? Were already seeing conservatives coming out against this and talking about this is as very radical leftist step to be taking. We see Donald Trump already tweeting about it. So certainly, this is something that, for conservative communities, something like this would be a tougher sell. And so again, policing is a very local thing. So what you experience and what the police force does or does not look like in Minneapolis is going to be very different than what it does or does not look like in Edina, which is just outside of Minneapolis, or any other suburb. So its going to be, in some ways, a patchwork of public safety, I think, if these things start happening around the country.\n\nmichael barbaro\n\nAnd I guess an open question is whether or not this has entered the mainstream, even of the Democratic Party. Just a few hours before you and I began to talk, Joe Biden came out and said he does not support defunding the police.\n\njohn eligon\n\nYeah, this is certainly not something that is part of the mainstream or moderate Democratic platform. That said, you do get some people who might be in these more moderate spaces, you do get their attention and you do get their ear, is this sense that policing is not working  which is just the basis of what these defund or abolish the police efforts are about, is that the system is not working. And so you will get even the more moderate folks to say that, to buy into that. And that may not result in them supporting a defund or abolishment, but will it support more stringent reforms, more significant reforms to police? So well see what happens.\n\nmichael barbaro\n\nI wonder how the activists that youre talking to see the challenge of explaining what these concepts are going to mean. Because in this moment, I think many Americans are really hearing these calls  defund, dismantle, abolish  for the first time. And they may be very wary of them, and they may see them as quite radical.\n\njohn eligon\n\nWhat the activists will tell you is that while it might sound radical for many Americans, this actually is not all that radical for a large section of this country.\n\njohn eligon What was your name, sir? yahzerah brazelton Yaazirah john eligon How do you spell that? yahzerah brazelton Y-A-H- \n\njohn eligon\n\nIf you go to black and brown communities  like I went up to the North Side of Minneapolis  and you talk to people about their experiences with the police there, it is not the experience of expecting an officer to come and help you. Its exactly the opposite. And I was speaking with a couple there, Amanda and Yaazirah Brazelton.\n\nyahzerah brazelton Its about time for a change. amanda brazelton A change, yeah. yahzerah brazelton Yeah. About time for a change.\n\njohn eligon\n\nAnd they were telling me that from a young age, essentially, they already had horrific experiences with the police.\n\nyahzerah brazelton [INAUDIBLE] I have police put guns in my face, you know, at seven years old, coming to my house with my mother and my father arguing, just regular argument that happens with a husband and wife.\n\njohn eligon\n\nYaazirah, he was seven years old when the police came to his house when his parents were having an argument.\n\nyahzerah brazelton And they put guns in my face and put us all on the ground.\n\njohn eligon\n\nAnd then they stuck a gun in his face.\n\nyahzerah brazelton They traumatized me in childhood, so I was really against white police officers since.\n\njohn eligon\n\nAnd his wife Amanda, she was 14 when she was in a car with white people, and shes black.\n\namanda brazelton We were driving in the car. All my white friends got out. And as soon as I got out, they pulled guns, yelled at \n\njohn eligon\n\nAnd when they were pulled over, the cops let the white people out, but then they pulled guns on her.\n\namanda brazelton Im 14 years old, in the backseat of the car, not doing nothing wrong. And that was my first real incident with the police in that interaction.\n\njohn eligon\n\nAnd so the way they see the police department is not a force where you call and then an Officer Friendly shows up.\n\namanda brazelton Man, I got a houseful of kids that are scared of the police because of what theyve seen.\n\njohn eligon\n\nIts one where Amanda recalled her children have already had run-ins with the police that when someone was breaking into their house once, she didnt call the police, but she called family and friends.\n\namanda brazelton And I called him. I called my brother. I called my uncle. I called my dad, my mom, before called the police.\n\njohn eligon\n\nWhy didnt you call the police?\n\namanda brazelton Because they kill black people. Theyll call me, Ill get killed in my own home.\n\njohn eligon\n\nSo its already a lived experience, a lived reality for people in many black communities, that the police are essentially a force that only exists, in their eyes, to harass them, to brutalize them and not to protect them. And what the activists hope is that people who are scared that abolishing police will suddenly lead to a breakdown in their communities and just rampant violence, theyre saying, no, this will create outcomes that will make the community safer and better, not just for affluent white communities, but for all communities across the country. And so what activists are asking is that people who see this as a radical idea, who cant envision a world without police, theyre asking them to just walk in these peoples shoes, understand what theyre going through.\n\n[music]\n\nmichael barbaro\n\nJohn, thank you very much.\n\njohn eligon\n\nThank you.\n\narchived recording (lisa bender) The nine members of the city council that came from every corner of our city to stand together to make this commitment, we dont have all the answers.\n\nmichael barbaro\n\nIn an interview on Monday, the president of the Minneapolis City Council, one of the nine members who has pledged to defund the citys police department, acknowledged that implementing the plan would likely take years.\n\narchived recording (lisa bender) And if you look back at the last 150 years of our police department, it is becoming increasingly clear that that model of policing isnt working. I hope it wont take 150 years to get to that looking forward, that next solution. But we have a lot of wisdom in our community. We have invested in [INAUDIBLE] \n\n[music]\n\nmichael barbaro\n\nWell be right back. Heres what else you need to know today.\n\narchived recording (karen bass) Good morning, everyone. The Justice in Policing Act establishes a bold, transformative vision of policing in America.\n\nmichael barbaro\n\nOn Monday, Congressional Democrats introduced the most sweeping federal plan to reform the police in modern memory.\n\narchived recording (karen bass) Never again should the world be subjected to witnessing what we saw on the streets in Minneapolis  the slow murder of an individual by a uniformed police officer.\n\nmichael barbaro\n\nThe legislation would reduce the legal protections that now shield police officers accused of misconduct from being prosecuted, and would impose new restrictions to prevent police officers from using deadly force. The measure is expected to quickly pass in the House, where theres a Democratic majority, but faces an uncertain future in the Republican-controlled Senate. Meanwhile, state-level reforms continue. On Monday, New Yorks legislature banned the use of chokeholds by police and repealed a statute that effectively hid the disciplinary records of police officers. And \n\narchived recording (dr. tedros adhonom) Almost 7 million cases of Covid-19 have now been reported to W.H.O., and almost 400,000 deaths. Although the situation in Europe is improving, globally, its worsening.\n\nmichael barbaro\n\nThe World Health Organization said that the number of new daily infections from the coronavirus hit a record high  more than 136,000 on Sunday  and warned that mass protests in places like the U.S. could further spread the virus.\n\narchived recording (dr. tedros adhonom) We encourage all those protesting around the world to do so safely. Clean your hands, cover your cough and wear a mask if you attend a protest.\n\nmichael barbaro\n\nFinally, the National Bureau of Economic Research said that because of the pandemic, the United States economy officially entered a recession in February, ending the longest economic expansion on record. It began in 2009 and lasted 128 months.\n\n[music]'
trusted	b'After Protests, Politicians Reconsider Police Budgets and Discipline'	true	[]		trusted	[]	https://www.nytimes.com/2020/06/08/us/unrest-defund-police.html	https://www.nytimes.com/	b'michael barbaro\n\nFrom The New York Times, Im Michael Barbaro. This is The Daily.\n\n[music]\n\nToday, several major U.S. cities are now proposing ways to defund and even dismantle their police departments. John Eligon on the thinking behind those plans and what they might look like in practice. Its Tuesday, June 9.\n\narchived recording (protestors) (CHANTING) I cant breathe! I cant breathe!\n\njohn eligon\n\nIn the early days of the protests after George Floyd was killed \n\narchived recording (protestors) (CHANTING) No justice, no peace! No justice, no peace!\n\njohn eligon\n\n it was just pure emotions and raw rage.\n\narchived recording (protestors) [EXPLETIVE] these racist [EXPLETIVE] police!\n\njohn eligon\n\nBut pretty soon, once the more fiery protests and fiery unrest died down, then we started seeing the organizers come in and talking about what they want. And one thing we quickly saw were these face masks that people were wearing. They were black, and they had yellow writing on them. And they said, Defund police.\n\nmichael barbaro\n\nHmm.\n\njohn eligon\n\nAnd from there, you start hearing these calls at protest, at rallies.\n\narchived recording (protestors) (CHANTING) Defund the police! Defund the police!\n\njohn eligon\n\nYou start hearing, Defund the police. You start hearing calls to abolish the police. You start seeing people waving signs. And it became clear that this was an opening that a lot of activists saw to take this moment of a very brutal police killing and turn it into something much larger.\n\narchived recording (protestor 1) Do the right thing! archived recording (protestor 2) Defund the police!\n\nmichael barbaro\n\nSo John, what do these concepts  defund, dismantle, abolish the police  what exactly do they mean?\n\njohn eligon\n\nTo defund, when activists say that, what they mean is taking money away from the police departments budget and redirect it toward other things  whether that be social services, agencies, maybe mental health agencies  that can do functions that police are often called on to do.\n\nmichael barbaro\n\nMm-hmm.\n\njohn eligon\n\nBut if you fully defund it, you can get to a space where the police department is abolished. And so essentially, what that means is that there is no more police department as we know it. You dont call these men and women in blue shirts to come racing to your door with their guns in hand. It means that they have to figure out some other form of providing that public safety, and the police department would not be that form.\n\nmichael barbaro\n\nAnd where did these concepts come from?\n\njohn eligon\n\nWell, at their core, they come from the problems and issues that especially communities of color, especially black communities, have had with policing. They see police coming into their communities to brutalize them, not to protect and serve them. And that has really influenced this desire to keep the police away, to do something else. And weve seen, basically, that governments and police forces, they respond with certain reforms. Weve seen efforts for body cameras. Weve seen diversifying the police departments. Weve seen changes to the rules on use of force.\n\nmichael barbaro\n\nMm-hmm.\n\njohn eligon\n\nBut what became clear to a lot of todays activists, and what they say explicitly, is that these reforms are not working. If you look at since Michael Brown was killed in Ferguson, Missouri six years ago, the police have continued to kill people at high rates, and especially black people at disproportionately high rates. And so for them, the only solution is to tear it down and build something new.\n\nmichael barbaro\n\nSo John, what might it actually look like in practice to defund or abolish a police department?\n\njohn eligon\n\nSo for instance, if someone is homeless and theyre struggling on the streets, a person can call 9-1-1, and instead of an armed police officer being sent out, perhaps there can be an outreach worker from a homeless services agency. Or if you have someone having a mental health episode, then again, you can call 9-1-1, and instead of a police officer, maybe a health care worker, a mental health worker will come out. And the idea behind it is to really cut down the interactions between armed police officers and civilians. And by doing that, the hope is that it will reduce their conflict and the potential for people getting hurt or killed by police officers.\n\nmichael barbaro\n\nRight. I mean, that makes a certain sense, especially for a community where theres not a lot of violent crime. But every community is different, right? And some towns, some cities  I think about New York City, for example  have a significantly higher rate of violent crime that would seem to require having armed police. So how do activists think about that?\n\njohn eligon\n\nFor a lot of the activists that I spoke to, the issue was about centering public safety on communities. And one activist that I spoke to, Arianna Nason, she said essentially its going to be up to each community to decide what public safety looks like for itself.\n\narianna nason Its going to be up to every community to decide what they need. We cant decide that.\n\njohn eligon\n\nSo maybe thats armed patrols. Maybe thats mental health workers. Maybe thats some sort of mobile units with social workers sitting in it, and people are trained in using force and different things. One of the big ideas is this idea of community policing, community watch. And its interesting. I had said isnt an issue, though, with community policing or community patrols, neighborhood watch, that if I walk into that community, as a black man with dreadlocks, if I walk into one of these communities, we see what happens with neighborhood watch. We see Trayvon Martin. We see Ahmaud Arbery.\n\njohn eligon Should that be a concern, then? I guess with this community-type based model that certain people who look a certain way might go into the neighborhood, and that community might decide to take it into their own hands and then take it overboard, I guess.\n\njohn eligon\n\nAnd she took off her sunglasses. She looked at me, and she said \n\narianna nason No, I get that. And Ill be really real with you. For me, personally, I dont have all the answers for that. I dont. And I wish I did. A lot of it is \n\njohn eligon\n\nHonestly, I dont really know the answer to that right now.\n\nmichael barbaro\n\nHuh.\n\njohn eligon\n\nShe was not sure exactly what the answer was. And see, this is all to say, its still very tricky and very much a work in progress. But what she did say is that the current system also is not working for me either. So its a matter of what are they going to do differently? And they believe that something drastically different needs to be done.\n\nmichael barbaro\n\nMm-hmm. As best you can tell, would any of the familiar elements of an existing police department  Im thinking, for the sake of argument, homicide detectives, special victims units that investigate sexual assault or rape  do those remain? Do they take a different form? Do they adopt a different name? Has that been fleshed out?\n\njohn eligon\n\nI would say, no, its not been fleshed out. Because again, we go back to the fact that this is not going to be some federal commission, or even state commission or a city commission for anywhere thats going to come up with, like, these are the rules for public safety now. And these are all things that need to be worked out. And I think what people say with things like homicide investigations, with sex crimes investigations and things like that, they say a couple of things. One, the police are not doing a good job at those anyways. So you have lots of cities where the clearance rate on homicides and other investigations is miserable. You had, even here in Minneapolis, there was a big scandal with all the rape kits that they had untested. So they had a lot of issues with crimes that were not being investigated properly. And then, the second thing that people say is that those jobs can be taken up by specialized, trained people. You can build new institutions to do those things that arent necessary policing. I did talk to one council member who said, maybe theres still police, but for very, very limited role, and many of their responsibilities are farmed out. You know, anything short of some sort of active violence, you dont need police for. So in some peoples eyes, that would still be a police force. But one thing that the people who are most ardent about abolishing the police or defunding the police, even, they make it clear that they dont just want a system in which its police in another name, police with another uniform on.\n\n[music]\n\nAnd these demands to defund the police, theyve actually been brewing in Minneapolis for several years now.

Because in this moment, I think many Americans are really hearing these calls  defund, dismantle, abolish  for the first time. And they may be very wary of them, and they may see them as quite radical.\n\njohn eligon\n\nWhat the activists will tell you is that while it might sound radical for many Americans, this actually is not all that radical for a large section of this country.\n\njohn eligon What was your name, sir? yahzerah brazelton Yaazirah john eligon How do you spell that? yahzerah brazelton Y-A-H- \n\njohn eligon\n\nIf you go to black and brown communities  like I went up to the North Side of Minneapolis  and you talk to people about their experiences with the police there, it is not the experience of expecting an officer to come and help you. Its exactly the opposite. And I was speaking with a couple there, Amanda and Yaazirah Brazelton.\n\nyahzerah brazelton Its about time for a change. amanda brazelton A change, yeah. yahzerah brazelton Yeah. About time for a change.\n\njohn eligon\n\nAnd they were telling me that from a young age, essentially, they already had horrific experiences with the police.\n\nyahzerah brazelton [INAUDIBLE] I have police put guns in my face, you know, at seven years old, coming to my house with my mother and my father arguing, just regular argument that happens with a husband and wife.\n\njohn eligon\n\nYaazirah, he was seven years old when the police came to his house when his parents were having an argument.\n\nyahzerah brazelton And they put guns in my face and put us all on the ground.\n\njohn eligon\n\nAnd then they stuck a gun in his face.\n\nyahzerah brazelton They traumatized me in childhood, so I was really against white police officers since.\n\njohn eligon\n\nAnd his wife Amanda, she was 14 when she was in a car with white people, and shes black.\n\namanda brazelton We were driving in the car. All my white friends got out. And as soon as I got out, they pulled guns, yelled at \n\njohn eligon\n\nAnd when they were pulled over, the cops let the white people out, but then they pulled guns on her.\n\namanda brazelton Im 14 years old, in the backseat of the car, not doing nothing wrong. And that was my first real incident with the police in that interaction.\n\njohn eligon\n\nAnd so the way they see the police department is not a force where you call and then an Officer Friendly shows up.\n\namanda brazelton Man, I got a houseful of kids that are scared of the police because of what theyve seen.\n\njohn eligon\n\nIts one where Amanda recalled her children have already had run-ins with the police that when someone was breaking into their house once, she didnt call the police, but she called family and friends.\n\namanda brazelton And I called him. I called my brother. I called my uncle. I called my dad, my mom, before called the police.\n\njohn eligon\n\nWhy didnt you call the police?\n\namanda brazelton Because they kill black people. Theyll call me, Ill get killed in my own home.\n\njohn eligon\n\nSo its already a lived experience, a lived reality for people in many black communities, that the police are essentially a force that only exists, in their eyes, to harass them, to brutalize them and not to protect them. And what the activists hope is that people who are scared that abolishing police will suddenly lead to a breakdown in their communities and just rampant violence, theyre saying, no, this will create outcomes that will make the community safer and better, not just for affluent white communities, but for all communities across the country. And so what activists are asking is that people who see this as a radical idea, who cant envision a world without police, theyre asking them to just walk in these peoples shoes, understand what theyre going through.\n\n[music]\n\nmichael barbaro\n\nJohn, thank you very much.\n\njohn eligon\n\nThank you.\n\narchived recording (lisa bender) The nine members of the city council that came from every corner of our city to stand together to make this commitment, we dont have all the answers.\n\nmichael barbaro\n\nIn an interview on Monday, the president of the Minneapolis City Council, one of the nine members who has pledged to defund the citys police department, acknowledged that implementing the plan would likely take years.\n\narchived recording (lisa bender) And if you look back at the last 150 years of our police department, it is becoming increasingly clear that that model of policing isnt working.

This is The Daily.\n\n[music]\n\nToday, several major U.S. cities are now proposing ways to defund and even dismantle their police departments. John Eligon on the thinking behind those plans and what they might look like in practice. Its Tuesday, June 9.\n\narchived recording (protestors) (CHANTING) I cant breathe! I cant breathe!\n\njohn eligon\n\nIn the early days of the protests after George Floyd was killed \n\narchived recording (protestors) (CHANTING) No justice, no peace! No justice, no peace!\n\njohn eligon\n\n it was just pure emotions and raw rage.\n\narchived recording (protestors) [EXPLETIVE] these racist [EXPLETIVE] police!\n\njohn eligon\n\nBut pretty soon, once the more fiery protests and fiery unrest died down, then we started seeing the organizers come in and talking about what they want. And one thing we quickly saw were these face masks that people were wearing. They were black, and they had yellow writing on them. And they said, Defund police.\n\nmichael barbaro\n\nHmm.\n\njohn eligon\n\nAnd from there, you start hearing these calls at protest, at rallies.\n\narchived recording (protestors) (CHANTING) Defund the police! Defund the police!\n\njohn eligon\n\nYou start hearing, Defund the police. You start hearing calls to abolish the police. You start seeing people waving signs. And it became clear that this was an opening that a lot of activists saw to take this moment of a very brutal police killing and turn it into something much larger.\n\narchived recording (protestor 1) Do the right thing! archived recording (protestor 2) Defund the police!\n\nmichael barbaro\n\nSo John, what do these concepts  defund, dismantle, abolish the police  what exactly do they mean?\n\njohn eligon\n\nTo defund, when activists say that, what they mean is taking money away from the police departments budget and redirect it toward other things  whether that be social services, agencies, maybe mental health agencies  that can do functions that police are often called on to do.\n\nmichael barbaro\n\nMm-hmm.\n\njohn eligon\n\nBut if you fully defund it, you can get to a space where the police department is abolished. And so essentially, what that means is that there is no more police department as we know it. You dont call these men and women in blue shirts to come racing to your door with their guns in hand. It means that they have to figure out some other form of providing that public safety, and the police department would not be that form.\n\nmichael barbaro\n\nAnd where did these concepts come from?\n\njohn eligon\n\nWell, at their core, they come from the problems and issues that especially communities of color, especially black communities, have had with policing. They see police coming into their communities to brutalize them, not to protect and serve them. And that has really influenced this desire to keep the police away, to do something else. And weve seen, basically, that governments and police forces, they respond with certain reforms. Weve seen efforts for body cameras. Weve seen diversifying the police departments. Weve seen changes to the rules on use of force.\n\nmichael barbaro\n\nMm-hmm.\n\njohn eligon\n\nBut what became clear to a lot of todays activists, and what they say explicitly, is that these reforms are not working. If you look at since Michael Brown was killed in Ferguson, Missouri six years ago, the police have continued to kill people at high rates, and especially black people at disproportionately high rates. And so for them, the only solution is to tear it down and build something new.\n\nmichael barbaro\n\nSo John, what might it actually look like in practice to defund or abolish a police department?\n\njohn eligon\n\nSo for instance, if someone is homeless and theyre struggling on the streets, a person can call 9-1-1, and instead of an armed police officer being sent out, perhaps there can be an outreach worker from a homeless services agency. Or if you have someone having a mental health episode, then again, you can call 9-1-1, and instead of a police officer, maybe a health care worker, a mental health worker will come out. And the idea behind it is to really cut down the interactions between armed police officers and civilians. And by doing that, the hope is that it will reduce their conflict and the potential for people getting hurt or killed by police officers.\n\nmichael barbaro\n\nRight. I mean, that makes a certain sense, especially for a community where theres not a lot of violent crime. But every community is different, right? And some towns, some cities  I think about New York City, for example  have a significantly higher rate of violent crime that would seem to require having armed police. So how do activists think about that?\n\njohn eligon\n\nFor a lot of the activists that I spoke to, the issue was about centering public safety on communities. And one activist that I spoke to, Arianna Nason, she said essentially its going to be up to each community to decide what public safety looks like for itself.\n\narianna nason Its going to be up to every community to decide what they need. We cant decide that.\n\njohn eligon\n\nSo maybe thats armed patrols. Maybe thats mental health workers. Maybe thats some sort of mobile units with social workers sitting in it, and people are trained in using force and different things. One of the big ideas is this idea of community policing, community watch. And its interesting. I had said isnt an issue, though, with community policing or community patrols, neighborhood watch, that if I walk into that community, as a black man with dreadlocks, if I walk into one of these communities, we see what happens with neighborhood watch. We see Trayvon Martin. We see Ahmaud Arbery.\n\njohn eligon Should that be a concern, then? I guess with this community-type based model that certain people who look a certain way might go into the neighborhood, and that community might decide to take it into their own hands and then take it overboard, I guess.\n\njohn eligon\n\nAnd she took off her sunglasses. She looked at me, and she said \n\narianna nason No, I get that. And Ill be really real with you. For me, personally, I dont have all the answers for that. I dont. And I wish I did. A lot of it is \n\njohn eligon\n\nHonestly, I dont really know the answer to that right now.\n\nmichael barbaro\n\nHuh.\n\njohn eligon\n\nShe was not sure exactly what the answer was. And see, this is all to say, its still very tricky and very much a work in progress. But what she did say is that the current system also is not working for me either. So its a matter of what are they going to do differently? And they believe that something drastically different needs to be done.\n\nmichael barbaro\n\nMm-hmm. As best you can tell, would any of the familiar elements of an existing police department  Im thinking, for the sake of argument, homicide detectives, special victims units that investigate sexual assault or rape  do those remain? Do they take a different form? Do they adopt a different name? Has that been fleshed out?\n\njohn eligon\n\nI would say, no, its not been fleshed out. Because again, we go back to the fact that this is not going to be some federal commission, or even state commission or a city commission for anywhere thats going to come up with, like, these are the rules for public safety now. And these are all things that need to be worked out. And I think what people say with things like homicide investigations, with sex crimes investigations and things like that, they say a couple of things. One, the police are not doing a good job at those anyways. So you have lots of cities where the clearance rate on homicides and other investigations is miserable. You had, even here in Minneapolis, there was a big scandal with all the rape kits that they had untested. So they had a lot of issues with crimes that were not being investigated properly. And then, the second thing that people say is that those jobs can be taken up by specialized, trained people. You can build new institutions to do those things that arent necessary policing. I did talk to one council member who said, maybe theres still police, but for very, very limited role, and many of their responsibilities are farmed out. You know, anything short of some sort of active violence, you dont need police for. So in some peoples eyes, that would still be a police force. But one thing that the people who are most ardent about abolishing the police or defunding the police, even, they make it clear that they dont just want a system in which its police in another name, police with another uniform on.\n\n[music]\n\nAnd these demands to defund the police, theyve actually been brewing in Minneapolis for several years now. Ever since a police killing back in 2015, theres been several local activist groups working on it. And those activist groups came together this past weekend in what was probably the biggest and most clearest demand for defunding the police.\n\nmichael barbaro\n\nWell be right back.\n\narchived recording (protestors) (CHANTING) Abolish the M.P.D.!\n\njohn eligon\n\nSo there were hundreds of activists who went and gathered in front of the mayor Jacob Freys house.\n\narchived recording (protestors) Abolish the M.P.D.! And they had a megaphone. They were chanting. They were screaming. And sure enough, the mayor came out to talk to the protesters. He kind of made his way through the crowd, walked up to the front, and you had one of the lead organizers for a group called the Black Visions Collective. Kandace Montgomery, she was standing up on a riser there, talking down in a megaphone to the mayor. archived recording (kandace montgomery) Jacob Frey, we have a yes-or-no question for you. Yes or no, will you commit to defunding Minneapolis Police Department? archived recording (jacob frey) [INAUDIBLE]\n\njohn eligon\n\nAnd you could tell, like, there is this hesitation because he knows this is not going to go well, right? You have all these very vocal, very ardent activists around you who want you to defund the police.\n\narchived recording (kandace montgomery) Will you defund the Minneapolis Police Department? archived recording [CROWD MURMURING] archived recording (kandace montgomery) All right, be quiet yall. Be quiet, because its important that we actually hear this. Its important that we hear this, because if yall dont know, hes up for re-election next year. archived recording [CROWD CHEERING]\n\njohn eligon\n\nAnd then \n\narchived recording (jacob frey) I do not support the full abolition of the police department. archived recording (kandace montgomery) All right! archived recording (speaker) Youre wasting our time! Get the [EXPLETIVE] out of here!\n\njohn eligon\n\nAnd he gives his answer  he does not support full abolition of the police.\n\narchived recording (crowd) (CHANTING) Go home, Jacob, go home! Go home, Jacob, go home!\n\njohn eligon\n\nAnd he turns around, and he just kind of walked off into the sea of people.\n\narchived recording (crowd) (CHANTING) Shame! Shame! Shame! Shame! Shame! Shame! Shame! Shame! Shame!\n\njohn eligon\n\nSo after this event, there was already an event planned for the following day by some of these same activists organizations, in which they were going to bring council members who were supportive of their cause onto a stage in a park in the Southern part of the city. And they were going to try to get them to make a commitment to defunding the police.\n\nmichael barbaro\n\nSo a lot like what they had done to the mayor?\n\njohn eligon\n\nExactly.\n\narchived recording (lisa bender) Hi, Minneapolis. You look so beautiful today. Im Lisa Bender. Im the president of the Minneapolis City Council.\n\njohn eligon\n\nAnd so we had this gathering where there were hundreds of residents.\n\narchived recording (lisa bender) Our efforts at incremental reform have failed. Period.\n\njohn eligon\n\nAnd you had council members.\n\narchived recording (lisa bender) Our commitment is to do whats necessary to keep every single member of our community safe, and to tell the truth that the Minneapolis Police are not doing that. [CROWD CHEERS]\n\njohn eligon\n\nAnd you had nine of them who went up on the stage.\n\narchived recording (council member 1) We are here today to begin the process of ending the Minneapolis Police Department. [CROWD CHEERS]\n\njohn eligon\n\nAnd then all nine of them each read a part pledging to defend the police.\n\narchived recording (council member 2) All of us on this stage support this statement, and we stand with the people of Minneapolis in fighting for a safer community. [CROWD CHEERS]\n\njohn eligon\n\nThe last council member, he basically said, and we are all committing to this pledge. And at that moment, it was like this emotional eruption.\n\narchived recording (speaker) [INAUDIBLE], get up, yall. We are transforming our city right now. Get up! get\n\njohn eligon\n\nYou had white people, black people, Asian people, all putting their fists in the air, shouting, defund the police, defund police.\n\narchived recording (crowd) (CHANTING) Defund M.P.D.! Defund M.P.D.! Defund M.P.D.!\n\nmichael barbaro\n\nSo just to be clear, this is not a vote, and not necessarily even a pledge to vote, but this is a public commitment to defund the police  to do the very thing that the mayor, when asked, declined to agree to 24 hours before.\n\njohn eligon\n\nYes, exactly. This is a pledge that they are going to defund the police. It is not a vote. It is not anything set in stone or written. But these are putting them all on record in front of many community members, saying that we are going to do this. And I even asked the activists about that. I said, weve heard politicians say things before and not keep those pledges. But this is something that they saw theyve been working on with them together in tandem. So I think theres a level of trust there that this pledge has really meant something. And you could see it in the reaction of the people who were there. They were really describing it as their Civil Rights Movement, their Voting Rights Act moment.\n\nmichael barbaro\n\nWow. And John, can the members of the City Council who were in that park, making this pledge, do they have the actual authority to take away funding from the police department?\n\njohn eligon\n\nYes, they absolutely have voting authority to do that. The council actually controls the police departments budget. And whats more significant about this moment is that because there were nine of them, those nine seats represents a veto-proof majority. So even if the mayor, Jacob Frey, does not want this to happen, if that coalition sticks together, they can do this on their own. And I think what were seeing is this sentiment is growing in traction in certain places. Like we already have in New York and Los Angeles, the mayors in both of those cities have already said that they are going to be redirecting funds that were intended for the police toward other parts of the city, toward other agencies in the city.\n\nmichael barbaro\n\nIm curious what the appetite for this kind of change to policing is, beyond the cities where there are largely Democratic city councils and mayors, and where this is now under discussion.\n\njohn eligon\n\nThats a very key question, right? Were already seeing conservatives coming out against this and talking about this is as very radical leftist step to be taking. We see Donald Trump already tweeting about it. So certainly, this is something that, for conservative communities, something like this would be a tougher sell. And so again, policing is a very local thing. So what you experience and what the police force does or does not look like in Minneapolis is going to be very different than what it does or does not look like in Edina, which is just outside of Minneapolis, or any other suburb. So its going to be, in some ways, a patchwork of public safety, I think, if these things start happening around the country.\n\nmichael barbaro\n\nAnd I guess an open question is whether or not this has entered the mainstream, even of the Democratic Party. Just a few hours before you and I began to talk, Joe Biden came out and said he does not support defunding the police.\n\njohn eligon\n\nYeah, this is certainly not something that is part of the mainstream or moderate Democratic platform. That said, you do get some people who might be in these more moderate spaces, you do get their attention and you do get their ear, is this sense that policing is not working  which is just the basis of what these defund or abolish the police efforts are about, is that the system is not working. And so you will get even the more moderate folks to say that, to buy into that. And that may not result in them supporting a defund or abolishment, but will it support more stringent reforms, more significant reforms to police? So well see what happens.\n\nmichael barbaro\n\nI wonder how the activists that youre talking to see the challenge of explaining what these concepts are going to mean. Because in this moment, I think many Americans are really hearing these calls  defund, dismantle, abolish  for the first time. And they may be very wary of them, and they may see them as quite radical.\n\njohn eligon\n\nWhat the activists will tell you is that while it might sound radical for many Americans, this actually is not all that radical for a large section of this country.\n\njohn eligon What was your name, sir? yahzerah brazelton Yaazirah john eligon How do you spell that? yahzerah brazelton Y-A-H- \n\njohn eligon\n\nIf you go to black and brown communities  like I went up to the North Side of Minneapolis  and you talk to people about their experiences with the police there, it is not the experience of expecting an officer to come and help you.

Still, she hesitated, refusing to endorse AB-86, a bill opposed by police unions that would have required her office to appoint special prosecutors to examine deadly police shootings.\n\nIn San Francisco, the police killed 18 people during Ms. Harriss six years as attorney general. But if there was a single flash point, it was the shooting of 26-year-old Mario Woods in December 2015. Widely circulated cellphone videos showed officers surrounding Mr. Woods  disturbed, strung out on methamphetamines and armed with a steak knife. Five officers fired 46 rounds, hitting him with 21.\n\nA series of rallies followed, and an 18-day hunger strike by five men who came to be known as the Frisco Five. Many believed that Ms. Harris would take action, as her predecessor, Jerry Brown, had done in 2009, when he obtained a court order placing the police department in Maywood under his oversight after widespread misconduct.\n\nIn a letter to Ms. Harris, Jeff Adachi, then San Franciscos public defender, urged her to exert her authority in the Woods case and several other shootings. An investigation, he said, would settle the pressing question of whether the racism evidenced in these incidents is endemic.\n\nUltimately, it was the Justice Department that intervened, led by Mr. Davis, the former East Palo Alto police chief, who had become director of the agencys office of community-oriented policing services.

Oppel Jr.']	[b'ms', b'justice', b'general', b'record', b'francisco', b'mr', b'san', b'attorney', b'harriss', b'harris', b'department', b'woods', b'cop', b'kamala', b'policing']	b'Ms. Harris began her second term as attorney general the next year by outlining steps to make policing fairer and more transparent, saying we must acknowledge that too many have felt the sting of injustice. Still, she hesitated, refusing to endorse AB-86, a bill opposed by police unions that would have required her office to appoint special prosecutors to examine deadly police shootings.\n\nIn San Francisco, the police killed 18 people during Ms. Harriss six years as attorney general. But if there was a single flash point, it was the shooting of 26-year-old Mario Woods in December 2015. Widely circulated cellphone videos showed officers surrounding Mr. Woods  disturbed, strung out on methamphetamines and armed with a steak knife. Five officers fired 46 rounds, hitting him with 21.\n\nA series of rallies followed, and an 18-day hunger strike by five men who came to be known as the Frisco Five. Many believed that Ms. Harris would take action, as her predecessor, Jerry Brown, had done in 2009, when he obtained a court order placing the police department in Maywood under his oversight after widespread misconduct.\n\nIn a letter to Ms. Harris, Jeff Adachi, then San Franciscos public defender, urged her to exert her authority in the Woods case and several other shootings. An investigation, he said, would settle the pressing question of whether the racism evidenced in these incidents is endemic.\n\nUltimately, it was the Justice Department that intervened, led by Mr. Davis, the former East Palo Alto police chief, who had become director of the agencys office of community-oriented policing services. Mr. Davis said his work was bolstered by warnings from Ms. Harris that she would investigate the San Francisco police if necessary.\n\nWe werent absent, said Venus Johnson, a former associate attorney general who advised Ms. Harris on criminal justice issues, adding that there were frequent discussions with San Francisco officials.

The jury took a week to convict Cooper, and one juror told reporters that there would have been no conviction if there had been one less piece of evidence.\n\nCooper was scheduled to be executed at 12:01 a.m. on Feb. 10, 2004. On Feb. 9, he was offered a last meal (he turned it down), and led on the dead man walking path to a holding area beside the execution cell. He was strip-searched, given new clothes to die in, and guards searched his arms for veins that could be used to administer lethal injections. A pastor visited to pray with him.\n\nYet on what was supposed to be his last day, the Court of Appeals for the Ninth Circuit granted a stay of execution, and a few hours before the end, the warden halted the machinery of death.\n\nCooper was now permitted to conduct a new test on the tan T-shirt, and this time the labs found something extraordinary. Yes, that may have been Coopers blood on it  but the blood had a chemical preservative called EDTA in it. That suggested that the blood came not from Cooper directly but from a test tube of his blood. Sure enough, the sheriffs deputies had taken a sample of Coopers blood and had kept it in a test tube with EDTA.\n\nNow the lab checked a swatch of blood from that test tube. More wonders! The test tube miraculously contained the blood of two or more people .\n\nThis indicated that the sheriffs office may have used the test tube of Coopers blood to frame him, and then topped off the test tube with someone elses blood.\n\nHow could there be blood from two people? Well, I ask you to remember the teenagers trick. Drink liquor from mom and dads bottle, and then you put some water back in to bring it back up to the line. How do we have blood from two people? Well how do you bring it back up to the line after youve taken blood from it?\n\nCoopers case began to get traction. The Ninth Circuit Court of Appeals en banc refused to hear an appeal by Cooper, but Fletcher wrote a remarkable 100-page dissent, concluding, The State of California may be about to execute an innocent man. Four judges joined in this extraordinary judicial opinion.\n\nLikewise, the Inter-American Commission on Human Rights found in 2015 that there had been profound flaws in the case and called for a review. The deans of four law schools and the president of the American Bar Association expressed concerns. At the end of his term in office, Gov. Arnold Schwarzenegger urged a thorough and careful review of the case.\n\nFive of the original jurors signed declarations expressing concerns about the case and calling for new DNA testing or for clemency. An award-winning book, Scapegoat, concluded that Cooper had been framed. In February 2016, Hile and the Orrick law firm submitted to Governor Brown a 235-page clemency petition , pleading for advanced DNA testing of evidence from the case.\n\nCoopers lawyers ask above all for new touch DNA testing  capable of detecting microscopic residues  of the tan T-shirt, the hatchet and the blond or brown hairs found in the victims hands. This might determine who wore the tan T-shirt or handled the hatchet, and whom the hairs came from. Was it Kevin Cooper? Or was it Lee?\n\nAs state attorney general, Kamala Harris refused to allow this advanced DNA testing and showed no interest in the case (on Friday, after the online publication of this column, Senator Harris called me to say ""I feel awful about this"" and put out a statement saying: ""As a firm believer in DNA testing, I hope the governor and the state will allow for such testing in the case of Kevin Cooper.""). As for Brown, he has not responded in the two years since the petition was filed, and he refused to be interviewed. His spokesman, Gareth Lacy, told me that the petition remains under review. Brown leaves office in January, and I think he is running out the clock.\n\nOne reason Brown may be hesitant to weigh in: For four years before becoming governor, he was attorney general, and during that time he suggested that no one on death row was innocent. I hope that this wont keep him from allowing advanced DNA testing.\n\nCalifornia voters in 2016 approved a ballot measure to hasten executions. So, depending on how litigation unfolds, Cooper could again be led to the execution chamber sometime in the next year or so  and even if he delays execution, he feels he is wasting away.\n\nKevin Cooper at San Quentin\n\nLook at how white my hair is, Cooper told me, bending over to show how his hair is graying. I dont have as much time left. Every day is one I wont get back.\n\nI was speaking to him in San Quentin Prison, in a cage where inmates are allowed to meet outsiders. Cooper lives on death row in San Quentin, in a 4.5-foot-by-11-foot cell.\n\nCooper told me about his abusive and troubled childhood in Pennsylvania, where he was adopted as a baby. When prosecutors said that Cooper had tangled with the law since the age of 7, they were right, but he says that the reason is that he was running away from home to escape beatings. His childhood involved shoplifting, marijuana smoking, juvenile detention and negligible education; he never graduated from high school.\n\nThese days in prison, Cooper has remedied his lack of education with a G.E.D. diploma and comes across as smart, passionate and articulate. But hes not optimistic that the governor or courts will block his execution.\n\nI dont have any confidence, he told me. I dont believe in the system. He also spends his time writing a memoir, which now stands at more than 300 pages. Thats my motivating factor to get out of here, to tell my story and tell the truth about this rotten-ass system, he said.\n\nI asked Cooper whom he blamed. The sheriff? The jury? I blame myself first and foremost, for walking out of Chino prison, for letting those people get their hands on me, he said. I regret that every day of my life.\n\nTime and again, Cooper came back to a larger point: The criminal justice system is unfair to poor people and members of minorities.\n\nIm frameable, because Im an uneducated black man in America, he said. Sometimes its race, and sometimes its class.\n\nThe only people here on death row to my understanding are the poor, he added. Even the white people on death row, theyre poor. If theyre white, racism goes away and classism jumps in and takes its place.\n\nAlthough Coopers defenders note that before the murders he had never been convicted of a violent offense, or even charged with one, its a bit more complicated: He has been accused of rape without being charged.\n\nIm particularly troubled by one episode. Cooper admits forcing a 17-year-old girl into a vehicle in 1982. She says that he also hit her, threatened to kill her and raped her, and she went afterward to a hospital to seek treatment; he flatly denies hitting or raping her. Hile says that if the evidence had been strong, Cooper would have been charged with rape. For my part, I cant think why the girl would have lied, and although its impossible to know after 36 years what happened, it bothers me.\n\nIts obvious to you by now that this is not a usual column  Im not sure The Times has ever published a column of this length  so why am I exploring the case with such passion? I became interested primarily because Fletcher and other respected federal appeals judges had said he was framed. That just doesnt happen.\n\nDeath Row Exonerations By State Since 1973 Each shape represents one person released from death row Calif. Ill. Fla. Tex. La. Okla. Ariz. N.C. Ohio Ala. Ga. Penn. Miss. Mass. N.M. Mo. Tenn. Del. Ark. Ind. S.C. Ida. Ky. Md. Neb. Sources: Death Penalty Information Center, news reports\n\nIm also haunted by something else. In 2000, I proposed reporting a lengthy piece about doubts about the conviction of Cameron Willingham, who was then on death row in Texas for the arson murder of his three children. An editor talked me out of it, and I never did write about Willingham, who was executed in 2004. Since then, growing evidence has emerged that he was innocent, and perhaps its partly to atone for my earlier failure that Ive taken up Coopers case.\n\nIf Cooper is innocent, he would have plenty of company. The Death Penalty Information Center says that since 1973, at least 162 people sentenced to death have been exonerated. One peer-reviewed study estimated that at least 4.1 percent of those sentenced to death in the United States are innocent; that would mean that on Californias death row alone, where 746 people await execution, about 30 have been wrongfully convicted.\n\nMoreover, theres abundant evidence that executions in America are linked to race: One study in Washington State found that jurors were three times as likely to hand down a death sentence for a black defendant as for a white defendant in a similar case.\n\nDecades after Coopers trial, many of the people involved have died or didnt want to talk to me. Some who were willing to talk insist that the trial was fair and Cooper was properly convicted.\n\nWilliam Baird, the sheriffs office lab expert who in 1983 found suspicious shoe print evidence supposedly linking Cooper to the crime scene, told me that the evidence was real. He acknowledged having stolen heroin from the evidence room but said that had nothing to do with the evidence against Cooper.\n\nI also spoke to Bill Hughes, who discovered the bodies of the Ryens and of his son, Chris. He is certain that Cooper is responsible: There is no doubt in my mind that he did that. His wife, Mary Ann, is equally passionate: She spoke of her familys suffering as the case drags on without closure, of her certainty that Cooper is simply trying to distract from overwhelming evidence against him, of her frustration at calls for further testing when there has already been forensic testing for 35 years.\n\nI told Bill and Mary Ann Hughes that my heart breaks for them. And of course, I cant be sure that Kevin Cooper is innocent. One lesson to absorb from the criminal justice systems past mistakes is that we need some humility about our own ability to ferret out truth.\n\nThats why the governor should allow advanced DNA testing, especially of the hairs and of the T-shirt and hatchet, and why Dianne Feinstein, Gavin Newsom and other California politicians should back the call.\n\nHatchet Hatchet found near the Ryen home Hair Locks of hair found in victim Jessica Ryens hands Tan t-shirt T-shirt recovered with victims blood Source: Court documents\n\nI know readers will ask me what they can do, and I dont have a good answer beyond contacting Browns office or signing a petition calling for clemency. Another takeaway is to regard our criminal justice system, especially in its interactions with the poor or racial minorities, with greater skepticism.\n\nMaybe in the grand scheme of things, the fate of one man on death row doesnt seem so important; innumerable people die tragically every day. Yet we aspire to be a nation where we are all equal before the law, and if we execute a man in so flawed a case without even bothering to test the evidence rigorously, then a piece of our justice system dies along with Kevin Cooper.\n\nGovernor Brown, if youre reading this, I understand that you may believe that Cooper is guilty. But other smart people, including federal judges and law school deans, believe him innocent. So how can you possibly execute him without even allowing advanced DNA testing, at the defenses expense, to resolve the doubt? Whats your argument for refusing to allow testing?\n\nThe former Supreme Court Justice Sandra Day OConnor once wrote that the execution of a legally and factually innocent person would be a constitutionally intolerable event. Shes right: It is not just Coopers life that is at stake, but also the legitimacy of our system of laws. This is a test of Governor Brown, of our justice system, of our politicians, and of us.\n\nThis is bigger than me, Cooper told me in our prison meeting. This is bigger than any one person.\n\nNicholas Kristof / May 10th 2018 An interview with San Bernardino County Inmate, Kevin Cooper, edited for clarity'"	"b""Opinion | One Test Could Exonerate Him.

My name is Monika Evstatieva, and Im a producer for The Daily. And I am here with Astead. Astead, introduce yourself. astead herndon Hi. Im Astead Herndon. Im a politics reporter covering the election. And Im driving on a very long highway. monika evstatieva Were driving on a very long highway in South Carolina because we came here to try to answer an interesting question. What is that question? astead herndon What happened to Kamala Harriss presidential campaign that took her from top-tier, front-runner status to the middle of the pack? monika evstatieva O.K. Lets try to figure this out.\n\n[music]\n\nmichael barbaro\n\nFrom The New York Times, Im Michael Barbaro. This is The Daily. When Senator Kamala Harris launched her presidential campaign 10 months ago, she drew a crowd of 20,000 to her kickoff rally, the biggest of any candidate, and was talked about as a potential heir to the political coalition that carried Barack Obama to the White House  twice. Today, shes polling in the single digits. My colleagues Astead Herndon and Monika Evstatieva went to South Carolina with the Harris campaign. Its Wednesday, November 20.\n\nmonika evstatieva\n\nAstead and I are in the car. We are driving from the capital, Columbia, to Greenwood, and Greenwood is a small town.\n\nastead herndon Folks are in suits? You know this is South Carolina.\n\nmonika evstatieva\n\nAnd why is South Carolina essential to her campaign?\n\nastead herndon\n\nSo shes in South Carolina because, frankly, thats where their campaign is putting their chips. Theyve had to, after falling on hard times, fire most of their New Hampshire team and really focus their resources on the first state, Iowa, and then South Carolina, where they think they can unlock black support. The thought process here is based somewhat on what Barack Obama did in 2008  that if you win white support in Iowa, it proves viability, it proves electability, and that the black voters who like you but are scared you cant win will eventually come around if you prove yourself in the early states. And South Carolina, the electorates more than 65 percent black. And she thinks that she shares a real kinship there. And while shes been in South Carolina many times before, this is her first time in this community. Her campaign understands these things arent going well and needs to reach out to people they havent talked to before.\n\nmonika evstatieva O.K. Were actually walking now. Lets see whats happening.\n\nmonika evstatieva\n\nWe get to the building. Its a very small building.\n\nastead herndon Hi. My name is Astead \n\nmonika evstatieva\n\nAnd its Veterans Day.\n\n[chatter] monika evstatieva So describe this room now. astead herndon Its like a veterans hall. There are rows of people kind of set up in a half circle around what will be a panel. Some people have on their veterans regalia. Weve got flags behind them. Pretty much a standard, intimate political event. monika evstatieva O.K. Lets go talk to some people. Sir, do you have a minute to just talk with us? speaker I dont do interviews. [LAUGHTER]\n\nastead herndon\n\nWe talk to voters to try to get a sense of why they decided to come.\n\nmonika evstatieva Why are you here today? speaker 1 Well, Im here to support Kamala Harris. speaker 2 Im here to be enlightened about her policies.\n\nastead herndon\n\nHave they decided on a particular candidate?\n\nspeaker 1 I really havent picked no candidate yet, you know. speaker 2 I havent made up my mind. speaker 3 Im still shopping, looking at all the options. monika evstatieva Today, youll be listening to what she has to say and if she can basically win you over? speaker Possible. Its possible, yes.\n\nmonika evstatieva\n\nA lot of people actually dont know a lot about her. Some people dont know anything about her.\n\nspeaker Well, I really hadnt ever heard of Senator Harris before, until Wednesday.\n\nastead herndon\n\nI think thats something people forget about voters. Not everyone is tuned in all the time.\n\nspeaker 1 I really hadnt been watching the news. speaker 2 I dont even think I watched the debate. As a matter of fact, I know I didnt. I didnt watch the debate.\n\nastead herndon\n\nThey know the field is large. And they know, kind of generally, whos up and whos down.\n\nmonika evstatieva\n\nAnd in every conversation we have with these voters \n\nspeaker This is still the South.\n\nmonika evstatieva\n\n race keeps coming up.\n\nastead herndon\n\nYou have to remember the context for these largely older African-American voters.\n\nspeaker And, good Lord willing and the creek dont rise, come March of next year, Ill be 70 years old. So Ive seen a lot. And basically, I still see the world as being one great big plantation.\n\nastead herndon\n\nThese are folks who have grown up in the shadow of the Confederacy their whole lives. They have lived under the brunt of Jim Crow, some of them. And that informs how they are making pragmatic political decisions moving forward.\n\nspeaker Within South Carolina, within the African-American community, we dont want to take a chance on someone that doesnt have a chance of beating Trump.\n\nastead herndon\n\nSo things like 2008 and Barack Obama defied their wildest dreams. It was an anomaly to them, and so theres still a fear, a risk that a lot of them associate with a person of color leading the ticket.\n\nspeaker I hope shes electable, but we have to change the minds of the people.\n\nastead herndon\n\nFear that maybe in this time, where black voters are very worried about the Trump presidency, that a black candidate or a woman of color was too risky.\n\nastead herndon Do you think that black men will have problems supporting a black woman candidate? speaker Yes. astead herndon Why do you think so? speaker The men have been the head.\n\nmonika evstatieva\n\nMany people we speak to mention as an alternative \n\nspeaker Joe Biden. I think that hes a good candidate.\n\nmonika evstatieva\n\n Joe Biden.\n\nspeaker 1 I like Joe. speaker 2 I would say Biden. speaker 3 Ive looked at Joe Biden.\n\nmonika evstatieva\n\nWhy?\n\nastead herndon\n\nTheres a lot of reasons why Joe Biden looms over South Carolina. One is name recognition.\n\nspeaker 1 Because he has been vice president, and I dont think we need someone now thats on-the-job training. speaker 2 He has a track record because he was there in an administration before.\n\nastead herndon\n\nThey know who he is. Hes a known quantity, and he is someone who has longstanding relationships in those communities.\n\nspeaker He has the debate experience. And I feel like he can go after him, also.\n\nastead herndon\n\nAnother reason is he has pitched himself as the candidate who is most likely to beat Trump.\n\nastead herndon Something kind of explicit. Like, when you say that he can beat Trump, do you think thats because white people are more likely to vote for Joe Biden than they are to vote for Kamala Harris? speaker Yes. Yes.\n\nastead herndon\n\nAnd so this is one of the big challenges Harris has to overcome. Even black voters, who sometimes like her instinctively, think that her identity as a black woman might be a liability for the election. And so they see Joe Biden, a white man with experience in the White House, and even this community thinks that maybe he is better suited to beat Trump. And ultimately, thats what they care about the most.\n\n[applause] floyd nicholson So again, we thank each one of you for taking time out of your busy schedule coming out today. And without further ado, it gives me great pleasure \n\nmonika evstatieva\n\nThen the event actually kicks off. There are several introductions.\n\nfloyd nicholson  the U.S. senator from that great state of California, the honorable Kamala Harris. [applause]\n\nmonika evstatieva\n\nAnd after some time, its her time to speak. And she needs to convince the people in this room that shes uniquely positioned to represent them best.\n\nkamala harris Thank you, Senator Nicholson! Hi, mama.\n\nmonika evstatieva\n\nWhat are some of the key points she makes in this speech?\n\nkamala harris Please have a seat. So I will tell you, my background is I am a daughter of parents who met when they were active in the civil rights movement in the 1960s in Berkeley and Oakland, California.\n\nastead herndon\n\nShe introduces herself to the audience, her personal narrative.\n\nkamala harris I grew up surrounded by a bunch of adults who spent full time marching and shouting for justice.\n\nastead herndon\n\nAnd then she turns very quickly to an issue she has gotten a lot of criticism for, her position on health care.\n\nkamala harris So Im running for president to put in place a Medicare for all plan, which means everyone will be covered, including people with pre-existing conditions.\n\nastead herndon\n\nAnd for her, health care looks like what she calls a Medicare for all plan that still preserves a role for the private insurance industry.\n\nmonika evstatieva\n\nAnd this is confusing, right?\n\nastead herndon\n\nIt can be. Shes had different positions on health care. She started the race as a co-sponsor on Bernie Sanderss Medicare for all bill, which is a single-payer system that eliminates private insurance. But she kind of hemmed and hawed about the specifics of that bill and then eventually offers her own plan \n\nkamala harris Im not trying to get rid of private insurance. So I heard from too many folks who said, Kamala, dont take away our choice.\n\nastead herndon\n\n which preserves a role for private insurance. And so, this is another one of the issues people cite around Kamala Harriss campaign, is that when you look at key policies, if you look at health care, the number one issue for Democrats in this race, she has not always stood for a singular position. Shes tried to have her cake and eat it, too, some voters say. Even now, as shes in between the progressive and moderate approaches, shes still borrowing language from that progressive lane.\n\nkamala harris We want the choice between a private plan or a public plan. Well, my plan will give you the choice that you deserve.\n\nmonika evstatieva\n\nAnd this is why I was a little bit confused when I hear her say that.\n\nastead herndon\n\n[LAUGHS] Youre not the only one.\n\nkamala harris But we need reasonable gun safety laws, including universal background checks.\n\nmonika evstatieva\n\nSo she goes through some other issues that are important to the Democratic voters, like gun safety, the challenges facing veterans.\n\nkamala harris  and putting them out of business when they were targeting our veterans.\n\nmonika evstatieva\n\nBut then \n\nkamala harris And Im just going to share with you one last thing, and then I would love to start our conversation.\n\nmonika evstatieva\n\n she turns to the issue of her electability. What does she say?\n\nastead herndon\n\nSenator Harris has added this in in the last couple months. As electability has become an increasing point of conversation in this race, shes decided to address it directly.\n\nkamala harris So I just want to have a brief conversation about something thats been coming up in connection with the campaign that I call the elephant in the room. But really its the donkey in the room. And its this conversation about electability. And the conversation goes something like this. Well, I dont know if America is ready for a woman of color to be president of the United States.\n\nastead herndon\n\nShes addressing the identity question head-on. Are Democrats too scared, or is it too much of a risk to put a black woman up against Donald Trump in this critical election?\n\nkamala harris I know Im ready, but I dont know if my neighbors are ready. Theyll say, well, maybe its not your turn.\n\nastead herndon\n\nAnd she says, this is not a new conversation for me.\n\nkamala harris In fact, this is a conversation I have heard in every campaign I have  and, now, here is the operative word  won. [applause]\n\nastead herndon\n\nAnd what shes trying to evoke there is that she has broken barriers before, and that if voters put their trust in her, she will do it again. And so, in this short time, shes addressing the two big challenges of her campaign, and shes trying to solve both. Shes trying to put forth a clear position on health care and sort of suggest that there was never any lack of clarity to begin with. And then she also tries to present her identity not as a hurdle to her success, but as a rallying point. That people can come together, and again, just like in the past, theyll overcome it.\n\nkamala harris Thank you all very much. Thank you. Thank you. Thank you.\n\n[music]\n\nmichael barbaro\n\nWell be right back.\n\nmonika evstatieva O.K. So were now headed to the town hall.\n\nmonika evstatieva\n\nThen were back on the road, and we keep following Senator Harris. And the next stop is Greenville.\n\nmonika evstatieva This is a bigger city, over 62,000 people.\n\nastead herndon\n\nYeah. Were headed from Greenwood to Greenville, a more urban community.\n\nmonika evstatieva Astead cannot be bothered with nothing but Beyonc right now. astead herndon (SINGING) To the left, to the left.\n\nmonika evstatieva\n\nAnd I actually find out you can sing.\n\nastead herndon\n\n[LAUGHS]\n\nmonika evstatieva\n\nSo we get to Greenville.\n\nspeaker Hi, welcome. Thank you very much for coming. Just through the glass doors on your right. I got to tell yall that.\n\nastead herndon\n\nWhen we come in, its a larger gymnasium. Its probably double or triple the amount of people in terms of crowd size, even though theres some empty seats. And theres also just a more elaborate setup. Thats all kind of just the campaign doing the more operational flexing of muscle for the bigger city.\n\nmonika evstatieva\n\nRight. So this is a more diverse place. Its more highly educated. Its younger. And people are following the election more closely, and so here, many people already know her.\n\nastead herndon Im sorry. You all are people who have picked a candidate? I know I see the shirts. speaker Yes. astead herndon But youre all in. speaker 1 Yes. Yes, all in. speaker 2 All in for Kamala.\n\nmonika evstatieva\n\nWhat are some of the things they tell us?\n\nastead herndon\n\nThey say what you hear from the Kamala Harris diehards, that she first came on their radar during the Senate committee hearings, where she was praised for her aggressive questioning of Bill Barr and Jeff Sessions.\n\nspeaker So I think it was during Sessionss confirmation hearings that I thought, shes going to run for president, and if she is, shes got my vote.\n\nastead herndon\n\nEventually, Brett Kavanaugh.\n\nspeaker Especially during the Kavanaugh hearings, when she talked to Dr. Ford and just looked at her in the eyes and said, I believe you, I believe you.\n\nastead herndon\n\nThey tell you that they like her debate interaction with Joe Biden in the first debate. She looked tough on the debate stage. And shes the one that they want to see go up against Donald Trump.\n\nmonika evstatieva\n\nAnd you asked them, but why is she not polling better?\n\nastead herndon What have you thought about the trajectory of her campaign? I mean, she started up there, but shes since kind of fallen. Why do you think that is?\n\nmonika evstatieva\n\nWhat are some of the things they cite as examples?\n\nastead herndon\n\nThese folks are following the race closely, and so they know that theres been a change in political standing from where Senator Harris started the race to where she arrived now. And when you ask her supporters that  why did that happen?  they again point to her identity.\n\nspeaker Shes been erased by the media. Shes been misrepresented by the media.\n\nastead herndon\n\nThey blame media for preferring, often, white candidates over people of color. And they point to a top tier, where the four candidates at the top are all white now in the Democratic Party.\n\nspeaker I mean, shes a black woman in a race that everyones looking for a white savior candidate. And so  but I think dont count her out. Shes got a strong ground game.\n\nmonika evstatieva\n\nThe event kicks off with a couple of introductions, including from a high school student.\n\nspeaker Ladies and gentlemen, I am proud to present to you someone who looks just like me.\n\nastead herndon\n\nYeah, theyve started having organizers introduce her, particularly women of color, to lean into that representation aspect.\n\nkamala harris Well, good afternoon, Greenville. It is wonderful to be back.\n\nmonika evstatieva\n\nAnd throughout the speech, the thing that gets the most ovation is when she goes after Trump.\n\nkamala harris We will need, as our nominee, someone who can stand on that debate stage and go toe-to-toe with Donald Trump. And Greenville, youre looking at her. Youre looking at her! ^[APPLAUSE]^\n\nastead herndon\n\nTheres a couple lines that any Democrat can say, and theyll get the audience on their feet. A surefire crowd-pleaser is to attack the president.\n\nkamala harris And somebody needs to remind Donald Trump that some of his closest relatives are immigrants, too. ^[APPLAUSE]^\n\nastead herndon\n\nAnd especially with the impeachment proceedings going on, Senator Harriss lines of justice being on the ballot or prosecuting the case against Donald Trump are always going to get the crowd on their feet. The question is if its just about Trump, why is that a reason to prefer Kamala Harris over the rest of the Democratic field, who are also making those same arguments?\n\nkamala harris And thats why Im running. I thank you all so very much. Thank you. Thank you. [applause] monika evstatieva O.K. Where are we going?\n\nastead herndon\n\nWe are in Greer, South Carolina \n\nmonika evstatieva\n\nThe following day, bright and early, we join her again.\n\nmonika evstatieva Its next to Greenville. And this time its raining.\n\nastead herndon\n\n at a community center \n\nmonika evstatieva O.K. Needmore Recreation Community Center. We are here.\n\nastead herndon\n\n where she is speaking to maybe 20, 25 people, all African-American, older residents.\n\nkamala harris So you all know, and have lived long, wonderful lives. And youll remember that for a large part of your life \n\nastead herndon\n\nShe spent a lot of her speech on lowering prescription drug costs and her health care plan, but she also mentions more systemic problems.\n\nkamala harris And remember those zero percent loans, nothing down? Predatory practices. The brokers made all kinds of money.\n\nastead herndon\n\nLike housing inequality and equitable education, issues that matter to older black voters.\n\nkamala harris And the father can look at his son and say, son, you dont have to go and get a loan from one of those private companies that are going to charge you these outrageous interest rates. Ill take some of the equity out of my home to help you pay for tuition. So thank you very much. Thank you, thank you. [applause]\n\nmonika evstatieva\n\nAfter the speech, we see something that I havent experienced so far.\n\nspeaker Pastor T., if you wanted to come up and say a couple words, or maybe pray over the senator. kamala harris Oh, yeah, I would love that.\n\nmonika evstatieva\n\nA pastor starts a prayer for her.\n\ntelley lynnette gadson So, were going to pray. kamala harris Yes. Yes. telley lynnette gadson Were going to pray. Were going to pray for protection.\n\nmonika evstatieva\n\nShe is literally holding her hands, and the whole room, everyone is standing up.\n\ntelley lynnette gadson Kamala Devi Harris, when you were in your mothers womb, God already knew about this stage of your life, and already knew that you would be in Greer, South Carolina, at the Needmore Community Center. It wasnt an accident.\n\nastead herndon\n\nThis is one of the cool things you can see while campaigning, specifically in South Carolina. Because the Democratic electorate is so black, and because the black electorate, particularly in these Southern states, is so religious, a lot of the campaigning happens through these religious communities. Pastors in black communities are not just religious leaders. They are community leaders. Theyre political leaders. Theyre cultural hubs. And particularly with black candidates, theres a sense of kinship there.\n\ntelley lynnette gadson God, for every flight that she will take, I pray that you are the pilot. God, for every car that she journeys in, I ask you to be the driver. And for every thought that she would think, I ask you to be the orchestrator.\n\nastead herndon\n\nKamala Harris is a religious woman. And there is a shared language of faith that happens at these events that you see with other candidates  its not like they wouldnt pray for a white candidate  but theres something different when its someone who they know has worshipped in their churches for their whole lives. And so she prays for her, and she mentions that the last presidential candidate she prayed for \n\ntelley lynnette gadson Now, the last person that I made my hands on and prayed for in the presidential election \n\nastead herndon\n\n was Barack Obama.\n\ntelley lynnette gadson  was Barack Hussein Obama. [applause]\n\nmonika evstatieva\n\nThe reverend is Reverend Gadson, but she goes by Pastor T.\n\ntelley lynnette gadson So we can be clear, they call me Pastor T., but Reverend Telley Lynnette Gadson. Thats who I am.\n\nmonika evstatieva\n\nAnd we actually catch up with her after the prayer.\n\nastead herndon That was your first time seeing the senator, I imagine, right? telley lynnette gadson First time seeing, but not first time hearing about.\n\nastead herndon\n\nAnd then we ask her about the race.\n\nastead herndon Are you someone who personally has made a decision about who you want to vote for? telley lynnette gadson I have not. I have not. And thats been because the field is so wide. But where I am, as Ive shared, is just a posture of, first of all, praying for our country. What is it that we \n\nastead herndon\n\nYou can see how that represents a problem for Kamala Harris.\n\n[music]\n\nmonika evstatieva\n\nSo we have this pastor who says she last laid hands on Barack Obama, but isnt ready to give her support to Kamala Harris, someone who started this race so strongly by trying to capture the same kind of coalition that Obama did. Weve heard that the challenges to her campaign are her identity and the lack of clarity on policy, but those same things could have been said for Obama. So whats different in 2019?\n\nastead herndon\n\nThe Barack Obama coalition that he rose to power with combined young people, liberals and historic turnout from black people. And theres not one candidate in this race that has yet been able to win those different demographic groups. And that was supposed to be Kamala Harris. I mean, it was supposed to be a number of people. It could have been Beto ORourke. It could have been Cory Booker. It could have been Kirsten Gillibrand. But when we entered this race, the thought, the reason why her candidacy was so feared, was because she was thought to be the one who could most quickly tap in to that coalition. Well, there are differences that we knew would be true from the start, and theres things that weve learned over the last six to eight months. From the start, we knew that, as a black woman running, she would have no historical touchstone and she would face unique barriers. And I think if you ask the campaign, they would say thats true. But its really about messaging. We knew that this race would be defined by a progressive wing, led by figures like Elizabeth Warren and Bernie Sanders, and a moderate wing, led by Joe Biden, and that people like Kamala Harris would have to exist threading both worlds. And thats been difficult. When you talk to voters, the most consistently repeated thing is, well, I dont necessarily know what she stands for. And I think that is borne out of those two wings, the progressive and moderate wings, defining this primary through their fight. And so Bernie Sanders and Elizabeth Warren can say, if you arent with single-payer health care, youre not a progressive. If youre not willing to raise taxes on corporations and wealthy individuals, then you dont have big ideas. And the moderate wing has defined themselves by rejecting that, by defining themselves by saying, well, we cant do that or we wont beat Trump. But if youre trying to do both of those things, if youre trying to thread in between those worlds, we have seen electorates that arent really willing to give people that benefit of the doubt. And thats driving a lot of the anxiety right now, particularly among the partys moderates.\n\nmonika evstatieva\n\nAnd thats why we see all these new candidates jump in the race.\n\nastead herndon\n\nThe anxiety breeds restlessness, right? And Deval Patrick, who just announced, Mike Bloomberg, whos expected to, are trying to capitalize on that anxiety. Because in the circles that like them, in the circles of elite, Democratic moderates, they are a group that expected to have more options. Theyre not that surprised at the way Joe Bidens candidacy has turned out. Where the biggest surprise is is they thought they would have an alternative figure to Joe Biden who could replicate that Obama lane. Now remember, these are a group of people who think that Warren and Sanderss progressive policies will lose them the general election. They think that Warren and Sanders, if they are the nominee, will struggle to bring out the type of people that put Democrats over the top. And without that, without someone in the top tier who is winning black voters and exciting young voters at the same time, there is fear that you cannot replicate what Obama did. Now, their argument is that thats because of the campaigns, that the individual candidates and individual campaigns havent done the things necessary to produce that support. But it could be because of a changing electorate and two wings of the party that just arent looking for a merging savior anymore.\n\n[music]\n\nmichael barbaro\n\nWell be right back. Heres what else you need to know today.\n\narchived recording (adam schiff) Colonel Vindman, what was your real-time reaction to hearing that call? archived recording (alexander vindman) Chairman, without hesitation, I knew that I had to report this to the White House counsel. I had concerns. And it was my duty to report my concerns to the proper people in the chain of command.\n\nmichael barbaro\n\nIn dramatic testimony on Tuesday, two White House officials who listened in on President Trumps phone call with the president of Ukraine described their alarm over his request for investigations into his political rivals.\n\narchived recording (adam schiff) And what was your concern? archived recording (alexander vindman) It was inappropriate. It was improper for the president to request an  to demand an investigation into a political opponent, especially a foreign power where there is, at best, dubious belief that this would be a completely impartial investigation.\n\nmichael barbaro'	b'Kamala Harris Campaign Cuts Staff in Effort to Keep Up With Top Rivals'	2019-10-30	[b'Astead W.

My name is Monika Evstatieva, and Im a producer for The Daily. And I am here with Astead. Astead, introduce yourself. astead herndon Hi. Im Astead Herndon. Im a politics reporter covering the election. And Im driving on a very long highway. monika evstatieva Were driving on a very long highway in South Carolina because we came here to try to answer an interesting question. What is that question? astead herndon What happened to Kamala Harriss presidential campaign that took her from top-tier, front-runner status to the middle of the pack? monika evstatieva O.K. Lets try to figure this out.\n\n[music]\n\nmichael barbaro\n\nFrom The New York Times, Im Michael Barbaro. This is The Daily. When Senator Kamala Harris launched her presidential campaign 10 months ago, she drew a crowd of 20,000 to her kickoff rally, the biggest of any candidate, and was talked about as a potential heir to the political coalition that carried Barack Obama to the White House  twice. Today, shes polling in the single digits. My colleagues Astead Herndon and Monika Evstatieva went to South Carolina with the Harris campaign. Its Wednesday, November 20.\n\nmonika evstatieva\n\nAstead and I are in the car. We are driving from the capital, Columbia, to Greenwood, and Greenwood is a small town.\n\nastead herndon Folks are in suits? You know this is South Carolina.\n\nmonika evstatieva\n\nAnd why is South Carolina essential to her campaign?\n\nastead herndon\n\nSo shes in South Carolina because, frankly, thats where their campaign is putting their chips. Theyve had to, after falling on hard times, fire most of their New Hampshire team and really focus their resources on the first state, Iowa, and then South Carolina, where they think they can unlock black support. The thought process here is based somewhat on what Barack Obama did in 2008  that if you win white support in Iowa, it proves viability, it proves electability, and that the black voters who like you but are scared you cant win will eventually come around if you prove yourself in the early states. And South Carolina, the electorates more than 65 percent black. And she thinks that she shares a real kinship there. And while shes been in South Carolina many times before, this is her first time in this community. Her campaign understands these things arent going well and needs to reach out to people they havent talked to before.\n\nmonika evstatieva O.K. Were actually walking now. Lets see whats happening.\n\nmonika evstatieva\n\nWe get to the building. Its a very small building.\n\nastead herndon Hi. My name is Astead \n\nmonika evstatieva\n\nAnd its Veterans Day.\n\n[chatter] monika evstatieva So describe this room now. astead herndon Its like a veterans hall. There are rows of people kind of set up in a half circle around what will be a panel. Some people have on their veterans regalia. Weve got flags behind them. Pretty much a standard, intimate political event. monika evstatieva O.K. Lets go talk to some people. Sir, do you have a minute to just talk with us? speaker I dont do interviews. [LAUGHTER]\n\nastead herndon\n\nWe talk to voters to try to get a sense of why they decided to come.\n\nmonika evstatieva Why are you here today? speaker 1 Well, Im here to support Kamala Harris. speaker 2 Im here to be enlightened about her policies.\n\nastead herndon\n\nHave they decided on a particular candidate?\n\nspeaker 1 I really havent picked no candidate yet, you know. speaker 2 I havent made up my mind. speaker 3 Im still shopping, looking at all the options. monika evstatieva Today, youll be listening to what she has to say and if she can basically win you over? speaker Possible. Its possible, yes.\n\nmonika evstatieva\n\nA lot of people actually dont know a lot about her. Some people dont know anything about her.\n\nspeaker Well, I really hadnt ever heard of Senator Harris before, until Wednesday.\n\nastead herndon\n\nI think thats something people forget about voters. Not everyone is tuned in all the time.\n\nspeaker 1 I really hadnt been watching the news. speaker 2 I dont even think I watched the debate. As a matter of fact, I know I didnt. I didnt watch the debate.\n\nastead herndon\n\nThey know the field is large. And they know, kind of generally, whos up and whos down.\n\nmonika evstatieva\n\nAnd in every conversation we have with these voters \n\nspeaker This is still the South.\n\nmonika evstatieva\n\n race keeps coming up.\n\nastead herndon\n\nYou have to remember the context for these largely older African-American voters.\n\nspeaker And, good Lord willing and the creek dont rise, come March of next year, Ill be 70 years old. So Ive seen a lot. And basically, I still see the world as being one great big plantation.\n\nastead herndon\n\nThese are folks who have grown up in the shadow of the Confederacy their whole lives. They have lived under the brunt of Jim Crow, some of them. And that informs how they are making pragmatic political decisions moving forward.\n\nspeaker Within South Carolina, within the African-American community, we dont want to take a chance on someone that doesnt have a chance of beating Trump.\n\nastead herndon\n\nSo things like 2008 and Barack Obama defied their wildest dreams. It was an anomaly to them, and so theres still a fear, a risk that a lot of them associate with a person of color leading the ticket.\n\nspeaker I hope shes electable, but we have to change the minds of the people.\n\nastead herndon\n\nFear that maybe in this time, where black voters are very worried about the Trump presidency, that a black candidate or a woman of color was too risky.\n\nastead herndon Do you think that black men will have problems supporting a black woman candidate? speaker Yes. astead herndon Why do you think so? speaker The men have been the head.\n\nmonika evstatieva\n\nMany people we speak to mention as an alternative \n\nspeaker Joe Biden. I think that hes a good candidate.\n\nmonika evstatieva\n\n Joe Biden.\n\nspeaker 1 I like Joe. speaker 2 I would say Biden. speaker 3 Ive looked at Joe Biden.\n\nmonika evstatieva\n\nWhy?\n\nastead herndon\n\nTheres a lot of reasons why Joe Biden looms over South Carolina. One is name recognition.\n\nspeaker 1 Because he has been vice president, and I dont think we need someone now thats on-the-job training. speaker 2 He has a track record because he was there in an administration before.\n\nastead herndon\n\nThey know who he is. Hes a known quantity, and he is someone who has longstanding relationships in those communities.\n\nspeaker He has the debate experience. And I feel like he can go after him, also.\n\nastead herndon\n\nAnother reason is he has pitched himself as the candidate who is most likely to beat Trump.\n\nastead herndon Something kind of explicit. Like, when you say that he can beat Trump, do you think thats because white people are more likely to vote for Joe Biden than they are to vote for Kamala Harris? speaker Yes. Yes.\n\nastead herndon\n\nAnd so this is one of the big challenges Harris has to overcome. Even black voters, who sometimes like her instinctively, think that her identity as a black woman might be a liability for the election. And so they see Joe Biden, a white man with experience in the White House, and even this community thinks that maybe he is better suited to beat Trump. And ultimately, thats what they care about the most.\n\n[applause] floyd nicholson So again, we thank each one of you for taking time out of your busy schedule coming out today. And without further ado, it gives me great pleasure \n\nmonika evstatieva\n\nThen the event actually kicks off. There are several introductions.\n\nfloyd nicholson  the U.S. senator from that great state of California, the honorable Kamala Harris. [applause]\n\nmonika evstatieva\n\nAnd after some time, its her time to speak. And she needs to convince the people in this room that shes uniquely positioned to represent them best.\n\nkamala harris Thank you, Senator Nicholson! Hi, mama.\n\nmonika evstatieva\n\nWhat are some of the key points she makes in this speech?\n\nkamala harris Please have a seat. So I will tell you, my background is I am a daughter of parents who met when they were active in the civil rights movement in the 1960s in Berkeley and Oakland, California.\n\nastead herndon\n\nShe introduces herself to the audience, her personal narrative.\n\nkamala harris I grew up surrounded by a bunch of adults who spent full time marching and shouting for justice.\n\nastead herndon\n\nAnd then she turns very quickly to an issue she has gotten a lot of criticism for, her position on health care.\n\nkamala harris So Im running for president to put in place a Medicare for all plan, which means everyone will be covered, including people with pre-existing conditions.\n\nastead herndon\n\nAnd for her, health care looks like what she calls a Medicare for all plan that still preserves a role for the private insurance industry.\n\nmonika evstatieva\n\nAnd this is confusing, right?\n\nastead herndon\n\nIt can be. Shes had different positions on health care. She started the race as a co-sponsor on Bernie Sanderss Medicare for all bill, which is a single-payer system that eliminates private insurance. But she kind of hemmed and hawed about the specifics of that bill and then eventually offers her own plan \n\nkamala harris Im not trying to get rid of private insurance. So I heard from too many folks who said, Kamala, dont take away our choice.\n\nastead herndon\n\n which preserves a role for private insurance. And so, this is another one of the issues people cite around Kamala Harriss campaign, is that when you look at key policies, if you look at health care, the number one issue for Democrats in this race, she has not always stood for a singular position. Shes tried to have her cake and eat it, too, some voters say. Even now, as shes in between the progressive and moderate approaches, shes still borrowing language from that progressive lane.\n\nkamala harris We want the choice between a private plan or a public plan. Well, my plan will give you the choice that you deserve.\n\nmonika evstatieva\n\nAnd this is why I was a little bit confused when I hear her say that.\n\nastead herndon\n\n[LAUGHS] Youre not the only one.\n\nkamala harris But we need reasonable gun safety laws, including universal background checks.\n\nmonika evstatieva\n\nSo she goes through some other issues that are important to the Democratic voters, like gun safety, the challenges facing veterans.\n\nkamala harris  and putting them out of business when they were targeting our veterans.\n\nmonika evstatieva\n\nBut then \n\nkamala harris And Im just going to share with you one last thing, and then I would love to start our conversation.\n\nmonika evstatieva\n\n she turns to the issue of her electability. What does she say?\n\nastead herndon\n\nSenator Harris has added this in in the last couple months. As electability has become an increasing point of conversation in this race, shes decided to address it directly.\n\nkamala harris So I just want to have a brief conversation about something thats been coming up in connection with the campaign that I call the elephant in the room. But really its the donkey in the room. And its this conversation about electability. And the conversation goes something like this. Well, I dont know if America is ready for a woman of color to be president of the United States.\n\nastead herndon\n\nShes addressing the identity question head-on. Are Democrats too scared, or is it too much of a risk to put a black woman up against Donald Trump in this critical election?\n\nkamala harris I know Im ready, but I dont know if my neighbors are ready. Theyll say, well, maybe its not your turn.\n\nastead herndon\n\nAnd she says, this is not a new conversation for me.\n\nkamala harris In fact, this is a conversation I have heard in every campaign I have  and, now, here is the operative word  won. [applause]\n\nastead herndon\n\nAnd what shes trying to evoke there is that she has broken barriers before, and that if voters put their trust in her, she will do it again. And so, in this short time, shes addressing the two big challenges of her campaign, and shes trying to solve both. Shes trying to put forth a clear position on health care and sort of suggest that there was never any lack of clarity to begin with. And then she also tries to present her identity not as a hurdle to her success, but as a rallying point. That people can come together, and again, just like in the past, theyll overcome it.\n\nkamala harris Thank you all very much. Thank you. Thank you. Thank you.\n\n[music]\n\nmichael barbaro\n\nWell be right back.\n\nmonika evstatieva O.K. So were now headed to the town hall.\n\nmonika evstatieva\n\nThen were back on the road, and we keep following Senator Harris. And the next stop is Greenville.\n\nmonika evstatieva This is a bigger city, over 62,000 people.\n\nastead herndon\n\nYeah. Were headed from Greenwood to Greenville, a more urban community.\n\nmonika evstatieva Astead cannot be bothered with nothing but Beyonc right now. astead herndon (SINGING) To the left, to the left.\n\nmonika evstatieva\n\nAnd I actually find out you can sing.\n\nastead herndon\n\n[LAUGHS]\n\nmonika evstatieva\n\nSo we get to Greenville.\n\nspeaker Hi, welcome. Thank you very much for coming. Just through the glass doors on your right. I got to tell yall that.\n\nastead herndon\n\nWhen we come in, its a larger gymnasium. Its probably double or triple the amount of people in terms of crowd size, even though theres some empty seats. And theres also just a more elaborate setup. Thats all kind of just the campaign doing the more operational flexing of muscle for the bigger city.\n\nmonika evstatieva\n\nRight. So this is a more diverse place. Its more highly educated. Its younger. And people are following the election more closely, and so here, many people already know her.\n\nastead herndon Im sorry. You all are people who have picked a candidate? I know I see the shirts. speaker Yes. astead herndon But youre all in. speaker 1 Yes. Yes, all in. speaker 2 All in for Kamala.\n\nmonika evstatieva\n\nWhat are some of the things they tell us?\n\nastead herndon\n\nThey say what you hear from the Kamala Harris diehards, that she first came on their radar during the Senate committee hearings, where she was praised for her aggressive questioning of Bill Barr and Jeff Sessions.\n\nspeaker So I think it was during Sessionss confirmation hearings that I thought, shes going to run for president, and if she is, shes got my vote.\n\nastead herndon\n\nEventually, Brett Kavanaugh.\n\nspeaker Especially during the Kavanaugh hearings, when she talked to Dr. Ford and just looked at her in the eyes and said, I believe you, I believe you.\n\nastead herndon\n\nThey tell you that they like her debate interaction with Joe Biden in the first debate. She looked tough on the debate stage. And shes the one that they want to see go up against Donald Trump.\n\nmonika evstatieva\n\nAnd you asked them, but why is she not polling better?\n\nastead herndon What have you thought about the trajectory of her campaign? I mean, she started up there, but shes since kind of fallen. Why do you think that is?\n\nmonika evstatieva\n\nWhat are some of the things they cite as examples?\n\nastead herndon\n\nThese folks are following the race closely, and so they know that theres been a change in political standing from where Senator Harris started the race to where she arrived now. And when you ask her supporters that  why did that happen?  they again point to her identity.\n\nspeaker Shes been erased by the media. Shes been misrepresented by the media.\n\nastead herndon\n\nThey blame media for preferring, often, white candidates over people of color. And they point to a top tier, where the four candidates at the top are all white now in the Democratic Party.\n\nspeaker I mean, shes a black woman in a race that everyones looking for a white savior candidate. And so  but I think dont count her out. Shes got a strong ground game.\n\nmonika evstatieva\n\nThe event kicks off with a couple of introductions, including from a high school student.\n\nspeaker Ladies and gentlemen, I am proud to present to you someone who looks just like me.\n\nastead herndon\n\nYeah, theyve started having organizers introduce her, particularly women of color, to lean into that representation aspect.\n\nkamala harris Well, good afternoon, Greenville. It is wonderful to be back.\n\nmonika evstatieva\n\nAnd throughout the speech, the thing that gets the most ovation is when she goes after Trump.\n\nkamala harris We will need, as our nominee, someone who can stand on that debate stage and go toe-to-toe with Donald Trump. And Greenville, youre looking at her. Youre looking at her! ^[APPLAUSE]^\n\nastead herndon\n\nTheres a couple lines that any Democrat can say, and theyll get the audience on their feet. A surefire crowd-pleaser is to attack the president.\n\nkamala harris And somebody needs to remind Donald Trump that some of his closest relatives are immigrants, too. ^[APPLAUSE]^\n\nastead herndon\n\nAnd especially with the impeachment proceedings going on, Senator Harriss lines of justice being on the ballot or prosecuting the case against Donald Trump are always going to get the crowd on their feet. The question is if its just about Trump, why is that a reason to prefer Kamala Harris over the rest of the Democratic field, who are also making those same arguments?\n\nkamala harris And thats why Im running. I thank you all so very much. Thank you. Thank you. [applause] monika evstatieva O.K. Where are we going?\n\nastead herndon\n\nWe are in Greer, South Carolina \n\nmonika evstatieva\n\nThe following day, bright and early, we join her again.\n\nmonika evstatieva Its next to Greenville. And this time its raining.\n\nastead herndon\n\n at a community center \n\nmonika evstatieva O.K. Needmore Recreation Community Center. We are here.\n\nastead herndon\n\n where she is speaking to maybe 20, 25 people, all African-American, older residents.\n\nkamala harris So you all know, and have lived long, wonderful lives. And youll remember that for a large part of your life \n\nastead herndon\n\nShe spent a lot of her speech on lowering prescription drug costs and her health care plan, but she also mentions more systemic problems.\n\nkamala harris And remember those zero percent loans, nothing down? Predatory practices. The brokers made all kinds of money.\n\nastead herndon\n\nLike housing inequality and equitable education, issues that matter to older black voters.\n\nkamala harris And the father can look at his son and say, son, you dont have to go and get a loan from one of those private companies that are going to charge you these outrageous interest rates. Ill take some of the equity out of my home to help you pay for tuition. So thank you very much. Thank you, thank you. [applause]\n\nmonika evstatieva\n\nAfter the speech, we see something that I havent experienced so far.\n\nspeaker Pastor T., if you wanted to come up and say a couple words, or maybe pray over the senator. kamala harris Oh, yeah, I would love that.\n\nmonika evstatieva\n\nA pastor starts a prayer for her.\n\ntelley lynnette gadson So, were going to pray. kamala harris Yes. Yes. telley lynnette gadson Were going to pray. Were going to pray for protection.\n\nmonika evstatieva\n\nShe is literally holding her hands, and the whole room, everyone is standing up.\n\ntelley lynnette gadson Kamala Devi Harris, when you were in your mothers womb, God already knew about this stage of your life, and already knew that you would be in Greer, South Carolina, at the Needmore Community Center. It wasnt an accident.\n\nastead herndon\n\nThis is one of the cool things you can see while campaigning, specifically in South Carolina. Because the Democratic electorate is so black, and because the black electorate, particularly in these Southern states, is so religious, a lot of the campaigning happens through these religious communities. Pastors in black communities are not just religious leaders. They are community leaders. Theyre political leaders. Theyre cultural hubs. And particularly with black candidates, theres a sense of kinship there.\n\ntelley lynnette gadson God, for every flight that she will take, I pray that you are the pilot. God, for every car that she journeys in, I ask you to be the driver. And for every thought that she would think, I ask you to be the orchestrator.\n\nastead herndon\n\nKamala Harris is a religious woman. And there is a shared language of faith that happens at these events that you see with other candidates  its not like they wouldnt pray for a white candidate  but theres something different when its someone who they know has worshipped in their churches for their whole lives. And so she prays for her, and she mentions that the last presidential candidate she prayed for \n\ntelley lynnette gadson Now, the last person that I made my hands on and prayed for in the presidential election \n\nastead herndon\n\n was Barack Obama.\n\ntelley lynnette gadson  was Barack Hussein Obama. [applause]\n\nmonika evstatieva\n\nThe reverend is Reverend Gadson, but she goes by Pastor T.\n\ntelley lynnette gadson So we can be clear, they call me Pastor T., but Reverend Telley Lynnette Gadson. Thats who I am.\n\nmonika evstatieva\n\nAnd we actually catch up with her after the prayer.\n\nastead herndon That was your first time seeing the senator, I imagine, right? telley lynnette gadson First time seeing, but not first time hearing about.\n\nastead herndon\n\nAnd then we ask her about the race.\n\nastead herndon Are you someone who personally has made a decision about who you want to vote for? telley lynnette gadson I have not. I have not. And thats been because the field is so wide. But where I am, as Ive shared, is just a posture of, first of all, praying for our country. What is it that we \n\nastead herndon\n\nYou can see how that represents a problem for Kamala Harris.\n\n[music]\n\nmonika evstatieva\n\nSo we have this pastor who says she last laid hands on Barack Obama, but isnt ready to give her support to Kamala Harris, someone who started this race so strongly by trying to capture the same kind of coalition that Obama did. Weve heard that the challenges to her campaign are her identity and the lack of clarity on policy, but those same things could have been said for Obama. So whats different in 2019?\n\nastead herndon\n\nThe Barack Obama coalition that he rose to power with combined young people, liberals and historic turnout from black people. And theres not one candidate in this race that has yet been able to win those different demographic groups. And that was supposed to be Kamala Harris. I mean, it was supposed to be a number of people. It could have been Beto ORourke. It could have been Cory Booker. It could have been Kirsten Gillibrand. But when we entered this race, the thought, the reason why her candidacy was so feared, was because she was thought to be the one who could most quickly tap in to that coalition. Well, there are differences that we knew would be true from the start, and theres things that weve learned over the last six to eight months. From the start, we knew that, as a black woman running, she would have no historical touchstone and she would face unique barriers. And I think if you ask the campaign, they would say thats true. But its really about messaging. We knew that this race would be defined by a progressive wing, led by figures like Elizabeth Warren and Bernie Sanders, and a moderate wing, led by Joe Biden, and that people like Kamala Harris would have to exist threading both worlds. And thats been difficult. When you talk to voters, the most consistently repeated thing is, well, I dont necessarily know what she stands for. And I think that is borne out of those two wings, the progressive and moderate wings, defining this primary through their fight. And so Bernie Sanders and Elizabeth Warren can say, if you arent with single-payer health care, youre not a progressive. If youre not willing to raise taxes on corporations and wealthy individuals, then you dont have big ideas. And the moderate wing has defined themselves by rejecting that, by defining themselves by saying, well, we cant do that or we wont beat Trump. But if youre trying to do both of those things, if youre trying to thread in between those worlds, we have seen electorates that arent really willing to give people that benefit of the doubt. And thats driving a lot of the anxiety right now, particularly among the partys moderates.\n\nmonika evstatieva\n\nAnd thats why we see all these new candidates jump in the race.\n\nastead herndon\n\nThe anxiety breeds restlessness, right? And Deval Patrick, who just announced, Mike Bloomberg, whos expected to, are trying to capitalize on that anxiety. Because in the circles that like them, in the circles of elite, Democratic moderates, they are a group that expected to have more options. Theyre not that surprised at the way Joe Bidens candidacy has turned out. Where the biggest surprise is is they thought they would have an alternative figure to Joe Biden who could replicate that Obama lane. Now remember, these are a group of people who think that Warren and Sanderss progressive policies will lose them the general election. They think that Warren and Sanders, if they are the nominee, will struggle to bring out the type of people that put Democrats over the top. And without that, without someone in the top tier who is winning black voters and exciting young voters at the same time, there is fear that you cannot replicate what Obama did. Now, their argument is that thats because of the campaigns, that the individual candidates and individual campaigns havent done the things necessary to produce that support. But it could be because of a changing electorate and two wings of the party that just arent looking for a merging savior anymore.\n\n[music]\n\nmichael barbaro\n\nWell be right back. Heres what else you need to know today.\n\narchived recording (adam schiff) Colonel Vindman, what was your real-time reaction to hearing that call? archived recording (alexander vindman) Chairman, without hesitation, I knew that I had to report this to the White House counsel.

Circles are sized by the amounts raised from individual contributions. Notes: Candidates are ordered by their ranking in each quarter. Some candidates raised more money in the third quarter, but their rankings were lower. Former Vice President Joseph R. Biden Jr. entered the race after the first quarter. Gov. Jay Inslee of Washington was the 10th candidate in the first quarter, but he has since dropped out of the race.\n\nSenator Elizabeth Warren of Massachusetts saw her fund-raising increase once again, just as she has steadily climbed in the polls. Former Vice President Joseph R. Biden Jr. brought in less money. Senator Bernie Sanders of Vermont remains strong.\n\nThe fund-raising numbers filed with the Federal Election Commission on Tuesday revealed the shifting financial fortunes of Democratic presidential candidates.\n\nMr. Sanders and Ms. Warren  two candidates who have sworn off big-money fund-raisers  led the Democratic field in the last three months, raising just shy of $50 million in total, which is more than the bottom 13 candidates put together.\n\n[See who led the money race in the first and second quarter.]\n\nMr. Biden raised about $6 million less than what he collected in the second quarter, a decline of nearly 30 percent and another indicator that his widespread name recognition has not translated into a flood of contributions from online donors. He ended the quarter with just under $9 million in cash on hand, far less than that of Mr. Sanders, Ms. Warren and Mayor Pete Buttigieg of South Bend, Ind.\n\nMr. Sanders had his best quarter this year, reporting the biggest quarterly total in the 2020 Democratic race.\n\nMr. Sanderss haul for the quarter was the latest demonstration of the power of grass-roots donors. As we showed over the summer in our maps of Democratic donors, Mr. Sanders has amassed a huge network of individual donors around the country.\n\nAmount Raised From Individual Contributions (in millions) Note: Third-quarter numbers are from July 1 to Sept. 30. Cycle totals include all activity in the 2020 election cycle. Candidates who reported raising less than $100,000 are excluded.\n\nMr. Sanders, Ms. Warren and Mr. Buttigieg have far more cash in the bank than the rest of their rivals.\n\nMr. Biden ended September with a fraction of the cash that Mr. Sanders, Ms. Warren and Mr. Buttigieg each had on hand. For every dollar that Mr. Sanders had, Mr. Biden had about 27 cents. How much cash a campaign has makes a big difference in how it can hire staff and pay for advertising as the first nominating contests approach.\n\nCash on Hand (in millions) Note: Figures are as of Sept. 30.\n\nPresident Trump has more cash than the three best-funded Democrats combined.\n\nAs the Democratic candidates fight for their partys presidential nomination, Mr. Trump has been able to continue building a huge cash reserve to fund his re-election bid.\n\nCash on Hand for Trump and Top Three Democrats (in millions) Note: Figures are as of Sept. 30.\n\nMore than half of the candidates spent more money than they took in from donors.\n\nFor the Democrats struggling to raise money, keeping the lights on is a real concern. Ten candidates  including Mr. Biden  spent more money in the third quarter than they collected in donations, even though the Iowa caucuses are still months away. The group also included Senator Kamala Harris of California and former Representative Beto ORourke of Texas.\n\nThe billionaire Tom Steyer and former Representative John Delaney of Maryland are not included in the count because they are largely self-financing their campaigns.\n\nBurn Rate Note: The burn rate shown is a candidates spending in the third quarter relative to individual contributions he or she received. Contribution refunds are excluded from the spending figures. The burn rate is greater than 100 percent if a candidate spent more than he or she raised. Candidates who are largely self-funding their campaigns are excluded.\n\nMr. Steyer spent far more than any other candidate.\n\nMr. Steyer, a former hedge fund manager, reported spending more than twice as much as any other candidate, with a majority of his money going toward advertising.\n\nThe leading Democratic contenders have hired big staffs, opened dozens of campaign offices and poured money into Facebook advertising, but their spending in the quarter still paled in comparison to Mr. Steyers. He spent more on advertising alone than any of the other Democrats spent in total.\n\nAmount Spent (in millions) Note: Second-quarter numbers are from July 1 to Sept. 30.

One nation under a groove, getting down  California Senator Kamala Harris has joined the race for the White House. Im running for president of the United States. And Im very excited about it. Im very excited about it. So who is she? Harris has a history of being the first. You may be the first to do many things, but make sure youre not the last. In 2010, she was the first woman and person of African and South Asian descent to become Californias attorney general. I decided to become a prosecutor because I believed that there were vulnerable and voiceless people who deserved to have a voice in that system. And in 2016 she became the first black senator from California. So my question to you  Harris serves on four Senate committees, and is perhaps best known for her tough questions. It makes me nervous. Is that a no? Is that a yes? Can I get to respond please, maam? No, sir. No, no. Shes moved to the left in recent years. But her political message remains broad, stressing unity and togetherness. We are all in this together. She has defended immigrants rights, as well as public schools and Medicare for All. But her signature issue is criminal justice reform. Crime is not a monolith. We cannot have a one-size-fits-all approach to criminal justice policy. Critics on her left have called her record into question, arguing that she failed to embrace progressive reforms during her tenure as district attorney and Californias attorney general. So, whats her dynamic with President Trump? Harris has voted against more Trump administration nominees than most of her peers. She has called Trumps border wall: his vanity project. And the government shutdown: a crisis of leadership. For now, Trump has said little about her. So, what are her chances? Political strategists believe Harris may be better positioned to build coalitions than some of her party rivals. This is our house. But despite strong initial fund-raising numbers and a liberal donor network in her home state, shes stagnated in the polls. As a relative newcomer to national politics, many voters may be waiting to hear more from Harris before making up their minds.

trusted	b'What Happened to Kamala Harris?'	true	[]		trusted	[]	https://www.nytimes.com/2019/11/20/podcasts/the-daily/kamala-harris.html	https://www.nytimes.com/	b'monika evstatieva Hi. My name is Monika Evstatieva, and Im a producer for The Daily. And I am here with Astead. Astead, introduce yourself. astead herndon Hi. Im Astead Herndon. Im a politics reporter covering the election. And Im driving on a very long highway. monika evstatieva Were driving on a very long highway in South Carolina because we came here to try to answer an interesting question. What is that question? astead herndon What happened to Kamala Harriss presidential campaign that took her from top-tier, front-runner status to the middle of the pack? monika evstatieva O.K. Lets try to figure this out.\n\n[music]\n\nmichael barbaro\n\nFrom The New York Times, Im Michael Barbaro. This is The Daily. When Senator Kamala Harris launched her presidential campaign 10 months ago, she drew a crowd of 20,000 to her kickoff rally, the biggest of any candidate, and was talked about as a potential heir to the political coalition that carried Barack Obama to the White House  twice. Today, shes polling in the single digits. My colleagues Astead Herndon and Monika Evstatieva went to South Carolina with the Harris campaign. Its Wednesday, November 20.\n\nmonika evstatieva\n\nAstead and I are in the car. We are driving from the capital, Columbia, to Greenwood, and Greenwood is a small town.\n\nastead herndon Folks are in suits? You know this is South Carolina.\n\nmonika evstatieva\n\nAnd why is South Carolina essential to her campaign?\n\nastead herndon\n\nSo shes in South Carolina because, frankly, thats where their campaign is putting their chips. Theyve had to, after falling on hard times, fire most of their New Hampshire team and really focus their resources on the first state, Iowa, and then South Carolina, where they think they can unlock black support. The thought process here is based somewhat on what Barack Obama did in 2008  that if you win white support in Iowa, it proves viability, it proves electability, and that the black voters who like you but are scared you cant win will eventually come around if you prove yourself in the early states. And South Carolina, the electorates more than 65 percent black. And she thinks that she shares a real kinship there. And while shes been in South Carolina many times before, this is her first time in this community. Her campaign understands these things arent going well and needs to reach out to people they havent talked to before.\n\nmonika evstatieva O.K. Were actually walking now. Lets see whats happening.\n\nmonika evstatieva\n\nWe get to the building. Its a very small building.\n\nastead herndon Hi. My name is Astead \n\nmonika evstatieva\n\nAnd its Veterans Day.\n\n[chatter] monika evstatieva So describe this room now. astead herndon Its like a veterans hall. There are rows of people kind of set up in a half circle around what will be a panel. Some people have on their veterans regalia. Weve got flags behind them. Pretty much a standard, intimate political event. monika evstatieva O.K. Lets go talk to some people. Sir, do you have a minute to just talk with us? speaker I dont do interviews. [LAUGHTER]\n\nastead herndon\n\nWe talk to voters to try to get a sense of why they decided to come.\n\nmonika evstatieva Why are you here today? speaker 1 Well, Im here to support Kamala Harris. speaker 2 Im here to be enlightened about her policies.\n\nastead herndon\n\nHave they decided on a particular candidate?\n\nspeaker 1 I really havent picked no candidate yet, you know. speaker 2 I havent made up my mind. speaker 3 Im still shopping, looking at all the options. monika evstatieva Today, youll be listening to what she has to say and if she can basically win you over? speaker Possible. Its possible, yes.\n\nmonika evstatieva\n\nA lot of people actually dont know a lot about her. Some people dont know anything about her.\n\nspeaker Well, I really hadnt ever heard of Senator Harris before, until Wednesday.\n\nastead herndon\n\nI think thats something people forget about voters. Not everyone is tuned in all the time.\n\nspeaker 1 I really hadnt been watching the news. speaker 2 I dont even think I watched the debate. As a matter of fact, I know I didnt. I didnt watch the debate.\n\nastead herndon\n\nThey know the field is large. And they know, kind of generally, whos up and whos down.\n\nmonika evstatieva\n\nAnd in every conversation we have with these voters \n\nspeaker This is still the South.\n\nmonika evstatieva\n\n race keeps coming up.\n\nastead herndon\n\nYou have to remember the context for these largely older African-American voters.\n\nspeaker And, good Lord willing and the creek dont rise, come March of next year, Ill be 70 years old. So Ive seen a lot. And basically, I still see the world as being one great big plantation.\n\nastead herndon\n\nThese are folks who have grown up in the shadow of the Confederacy their whole lives. They have lived under the brunt of Jim Crow, some of them. And that informs how they are making pragmatic political decisions moving forward.\n\nspeaker Within South Carolina, within the African-American community, we dont want to take a chance on someone that doesnt have a chance of beating Trump.\n\nastead herndon\n\nSo things like 2008 and Barack Obama defied their wildest dreams. It was an anomaly to them, and so theres still a fear, a risk that a lot of them associate with a person of color leading the ticket.\n\nspeaker I hope shes electable, but we have to change the minds of the people.\n\nastead herndon\n\nFear that maybe in this time, where black voters are very worried about the Trump presidency, that a black candidate or a woman of color was too risky.\n\nastead herndon Do you think that black men will have problems supporting a black woman candidate? speaker Yes. astead herndon Why do you think so? speaker The men have been the head.\n\nmonika evstatieva\n\nMany people we speak to mention as an alternative \n\nspeaker Joe Biden. I think that hes a good candidate.\n\nmonika evstatieva\n\n Joe Biden.\n\nspeaker 1 I like Joe. speaker 2 I would say Biden. speaker 3 Ive looked at Joe Biden.\n\nmonika evstatieva\n\nWhy?\n\nastead herndon\n\nTheres a lot of reasons why Joe Biden looms over South Carolina. One is name recognition.\n\nspeaker 1 Because he has been vice president, and I dont think we need someone now thats on-the-job training. speaker 2 He has a track record because he was there in an administration before.\n\nastead herndon\n\nThey know who he is. Hes a known quantity, and he is someone who has longstanding relationships in those communities.\n\nspeaker He has the debate experience. And I feel like he can go after him, also.\n\nastead herndon\n\nAnother reason is he has pitched himself as the candidate who is most likely to beat Trump.\n\nastead herndon Something kind of explicit. Like, when you say that he can beat Trump, do you think thats because white people are more likely to vote for Joe Biden than they are to vote for Kamala Harris? speaker Yes. Yes.\n\nastead herndon\n\nAnd so this is one of the big challenges Harris has to overcome. Even black voters, who sometimes like her instinctively, think that her identity as a black woman might be a liability for the election. And so they see Joe Biden, a white man with experience in the White House, and even this community thinks that maybe he is better suited to beat Trump. And ultimately, thats what they care about the most.\n\n[applause] floyd nicholson So again, we thank each one of you for taking time out of your busy schedule coming out today. And without further ado, it gives me great pleasure \n\nmonika evstatieva\n\nThen the event actually kicks off. There are several introductions.\n\nfloyd nicholson  the U.S. senator from that great state of California, the honorable Kamala Harris. [applause]\n\nmonika evstatieva\n\nAnd after some time, its her time to speak. And she needs to convince the people in this room that shes uniquely positioned to represent them best.\n\nkamala harris Thank you, Senator Nicholson! Hi, mama.\n\nmonika evstatieva\n\nWhat are some of the key points she makes in this speech?\n\nkamala harris Please have a seat. So I will tell you, my background is I am a daughter of parents who met when they were active in the civil rights movement in the 1960s in Berkeley and Oakland, California.\n\nastead herndon\n\nShe introduces herself to the audience, her personal narrative.\n\nkamala harris I grew up surrounded by a bunch of adults who spent full time marching and shouting for justice.\n\nastead herndon\n\nAnd then she turns very quickly to an issue she has gotten a lot of criticism for, her position on health care.\n\nkamala harris So Im running for president to put in place a Medicare for all plan, which means everyone will be covered, including people with pre-existing conditions.\n\nastead herndon\n\nAnd for her, health care looks like what she calls a Medicare for all plan that still preserves a role for the private insurance industry.\n\nmonika evstatieva\n\nAnd this is confusing, right?\n\nastead herndon\n\nIt can be. Shes had different positions on health care. She started the race as a co-sponsor on Bernie Sanderss Medicare for all bill, which is a single-payer system that eliminates private insurance. But she kind of hemmed and hawed about the specifics of that bill and then eventually offers her own plan \n\nkamala harris Im not trying to get rid of private insurance. So I heard from too many folks who said, Kamala, dont take away our choice.\n\nastead herndon\n\n which preserves a role for private insurance. And so, this is another one of the issues people cite around Kamala Harriss campaign, is that when you look at key policies, if you look at health care, the number one issue for Democrats in this race, she has not always stood for a singular position. Shes tried to have her cake and eat it, too, some voters say. Even now, as shes in between the progressive and moderate approaches, shes still borrowing language from that progressive lane.\n\nkamala harris We want the choice between a private plan or a public plan. Well, my plan will give you the choice that you deserve.\n\nmonika evstatieva\n\nAnd this is why I was a little bit confused when I hear her say that.\n\nastead herndon\n\n[LAUGHS] Youre not the only one.\n\nkamala harris But we need reasonable gun safety laws, including universal background checks.\n\nmonika evstatieva\n\nSo she goes through some other issues that are important to the Democratic voters, like gun safety, the challenges facing veterans.\n\nkamala harris  and putting them out of business when they were targeting our veterans.\n\nmonika evstatieva\n\nBut then \n\nkamala harris And Im just going to share with you one last thing, and then I would love to start our conversation.\n\nmonika evstatieva\n\n she turns to the issue of her electability. What does she say?\n\nastead herndon\n\nSenator Harris has added this in in the last couple months. As electability has become an increasing point of conversation in this race, shes decided to address it directly.\n\nkamala harris So I just want to have a brief conversation about something thats been coming up in connection with the campaign that I call the elephant in the room. But really its the donkey in the room. And its this conversation about electability. And the conversation goes something like this. Well, I dont know if America is ready for a woman of color to be president of the United States.\n\nastead herndon\n\nShes addressing the identity question head-on. Are Democrats too scared, or is it too much of a risk to put a black woman up against Donald Trump in this critical election?\n\nkamala harris I know Im ready, but I dont know if my neighbors are ready. Theyll say, well, maybe its not your turn.\n\nastead herndon\n\nAnd she says, this is not a new conversation for me.\n\nkamala harris In fact, this is a conversation I have heard in every campaign I have  and, now, here is the operative word  won. [applause]\n\nastead herndon\n\nAnd what shes trying to evoke there is that she has broken barriers before, and that if voters put their trust in her, she will do it again. And so, in this short time, shes addressing the two big challenges of her campaign, and shes trying to solve both. Shes trying to put forth a clear position on health care and sort of suggest that there was never any lack of clarity to begin with. And then she also tries to present her identity not as a hurdle to her success, but as a rallying point. That people can come together, and again, just like in the past, theyll overcome it.\n\nkamala harris Thank you all very much. Thank you. Thank you. Thank you.\n\n[music]\n\nmichael barbaro\n\nWell be right back.\n\nmonika evstatieva O.K. So were now headed to the town hall.\n\nmonika evstatieva\n\nThen were back on the road, and we keep following Senator Harris. And the next stop is Greenville.\n\nmonika evstatieva This is a bigger city, over 62,000 people.\n\nastead herndon\n\nYeah. Were headed from Greenwood to Greenville, a more urban community.\n\nmonika evstatieva Astead cannot be bothered with nothing but Beyonc right now. astead herndon (SINGING) To the left, to the left.\n\nmonika evstatieva\n\nAnd I actually find out you can sing.\n\nastead herndon\n\n[LAUGHS]\n\nmonika evstatieva\n\nSo we get to Greenville.\n\nspeaker Hi, welcome. Thank you very much for coming. Just through the glass doors on your right. I got to tell yall that.\n\nastead herndon\n\nWhen we come in, its a larger gymnasium. Its probably double or triple the amount of people in terms of crowd size, even though theres some empty seats. And theres also just a more elaborate setup. Thats all kind of just the campaign doing the more operational flexing of muscle for the bigger city.\n\nmonika evstatieva\n\nRight. So this is a more diverse place. Its more highly educated. Its younger. And people are following the election more closely, and so here, many people already know her.\n\nastead herndon Im sorry. You all are people who have picked a candidate? I know I see the shirts. speaker Yes. astead herndon But youre all in. speaker 1 Yes. Yes, all in. speaker 2 All in for Kamala.\n\nmonika evstatieva\n\nWhat are some of the things they tell us?\n\nastead herndon\n\nThey say what you hear from the Kamala Harris diehards, that she first came on their radar during the Senate committee hearings, where she was praised for her aggressive questioning of Bill Barr and Jeff Sessions.\n\nspeaker So I think it was during Sessionss confirmation hearings that I thought, shes going to run for president, and if she is, shes got my vote.\n\nastead herndon\n\nEventually, Brett Kavanaugh.\n\nspeaker Especially during the Kavanaugh hearings, when she talked to Dr. Ford and just looked at her in the eyes and said, I believe you, I believe you.\n\nastead herndon\n\nThey tell you that they like her debate interaction with Joe Biden in the first debate. She looked tough on the debate stage. And shes the one that they want to see go up against Donald Trump.\n\nmonika evstatieva\n\nAnd you asked them, but why is she not polling better?\n\nastead herndon What have you thought about the trajectory of her campaign? I mean, she started up there, but shes since kind of fallen. Why do you think that is?\n\nmonika evstatieva\n\nWhat are some of the things they cite as examples?\n\nastead herndon\n\nThese folks are following the race closely, and so they know that theres been a change in political standing from where Senator Harris started the race to where she arrived now. And when you ask her supporters that  why did that happen?  they again point to her identity.\n\nspeaker Shes been erased by the media. Shes been misrepresented by the media.\n\nastead herndon\n\nThey blame media for preferring, often, white candidates over people of color. And they point to a top tier, where the four candidates at the top are all white now in the Democratic Party.\n\nspeaker I mean, shes a black woman in a race that everyones looking for a white savior candidate. And so  but I think dont count her out. Shes got a strong ground game.\n\nmonika evstatieva\n\nThe event kicks off with a couple of introductions, including from a high school student.\n\nspeaker Ladies and gentlemen, I am proud to present to you someone who looks just like me.\n\nastead herndon\n\nYeah, theyve started having organizers introduce her, particularly women of color, to lean into that representation aspect.\n\nkamala harris Well, good afternoon, Greenville. It is wonderful to be back.\n\nmonika evstatieva\n\nAnd throughout the speech, the thing that gets the most ovation is when she goes after Trump.\n\nkamala harris We will need, as our nominee, someone who can stand on that debate stage and go toe-to-toe with Donald Trump. And Greenville, youre looking at her. Youre looking at her! ^[APPLAUSE]^\n\nastead herndon\n\nTheres a couple lines that any Democrat can say, and theyll get the audience on their feet. A surefire crowd-pleaser is to attack the president.\n\nkamala harris And somebody needs to remind Donald Trump that some of his closest relatives are immigrants, too. ^[APPLAUSE]^\n\nastead herndon\n\nAnd especially with the impeachment proceedings going on, Senator Harriss lines of justice being on the ballot or prosecuting the case against Donald Trump are always going to get the crowd on their feet. The question is if its just about Trump, why is that a reason to prefer Kamala Harris over the rest of the Democratic field, who are also making those same arguments?\n\nkamala harris And thats why Im running. I thank you all so very much. Thank you. Thank you. [applause] monika evstatieva O.K. Where are we going?\n\nastead herndon\n\nWe are in Greer, South Carolina \n\nmonika evstatieva\n\nThe following day, bright and early, we join her again.\n\nmonika evstatieva Its next to Greenville.

And youll remember that for a large part of your life \n\nastead herndon\n\nShe spent a lot of her speech on lowering prescription drug costs and her health care plan, but she also mentions more systemic problems.\n\nkamala harris And remember those zero percent loans, nothing down? Predatory practices. The brokers made all kinds of money.\n\nastead herndon\n\nLike housing inequality and equitable education, issues that matter to older black voters.\n\nkamala harris And the father can look at his son and say, son, you dont have to go and get a loan from one of those private companies that are going to charge you these outrageous interest rates. Ill take some of the equity out of my home to help you pay for tuition. So thank you very much. Thank you, thank you. [applause]\n\nmonika evstatieva\n\nAfter the speech, we see something that I havent experienced so far.\n\nspeaker Pastor T., if you wanted to come up and say a couple words, or maybe pray over the senator. kamala harris Oh, yeah, I would love that.\n\nmonika evstatieva\n\nA pastor starts a prayer for her.\n\ntelley lynnette gadson So, were going to pray. kamala harris Yes. Yes. telley lynnette gadson Were going to pray. Were going to pray for protection.\n\nmonika evstatieva\n\nShe is literally holding her hands, and the whole room, everyone is standing up.\n\ntelley lynnette gadson Kamala Devi Harris, when you were in your mothers womb, God already knew about this stage of your life, and already knew that you would be in Greer, South Carolina, at the Needmore Community Center. It wasnt an accident.\n\nastead herndon\n\nThis is one of the cool things you can see while campaigning, specifically in South Carolina. Because the Democratic electorate is so black, and because the black electorate, particularly in these Southern states, is so religious, a lot of the campaigning happens through these religious communities. Pastors in black communities are not just religious leaders. They are community leaders. Theyre political leaders. Theyre cultural hubs. And particularly with black candidates, theres a sense of kinship there.\n\ntelley lynnette gadson God, for every flight that she will take, I pray that you are the pilot. God, for every car that she journeys in, I ask you to be the driver. And for every thought that she would think, I ask you to be the orchestrator.\n\nastead herndon\n\nKamala Harris is a religious woman. And there is a shared language of faith that happens at these events that you see with other candidates  its not like they wouldnt pray for a white candidate  but theres something different when its someone who they know has worshipped in their churches for their whole lives. And so she prays for her, and she mentions that the last presidential candidate she prayed for \n\ntelley lynnette gadson Now, the last person that I made my hands on and prayed for in the presidential election \n\nastead herndon\n\n was Barack Obama.\n\ntelley lynnette gadson  was Barack Hussein Obama. [applause]\n\nmonika evstatieva\n\nThe reverend is Reverend Gadson, but she goes by Pastor T.\n\ntelley lynnette gadson So we can be clear, they call me Pastor T., but Reverend Telley Lynnette Gadson. Thats who I am.\n\nmonika evstatieva\n\nAnd we actually catch up with her after the prayer.\n\nastead herndon That was your first time seeing the senator, I imagine, right? telley lynnette gadson First time seeing, but not first time hearing about.\n\nastead herndon\n\nAnd then we ask her about the race.\n\nastead herndon Are you someone who personally has made a decision about who you want to vote for? telley lynnette gadson I have not. I have not. And thats been because the field is so wide. But where I am, as Ive shared, is just a posture of, first of all, praying for our country. What is it that we \n\nastead herndon\n\nYou can see how that represents a problem for Kamala Harris.\n\n[music]\n\nmonika evstatieva\n\nSo we have this pastor who says she last laid hands on Barack Obama, but isnt ready to give her support to Kamala Harris, someone who started this race so strongly by trying to capture the same kind of coalition that Obama did. Weve heard that the challenges to her campaign are her identity and the lack of clarity on policy, but those same things could have been said for Obama. So whats different in 2019?\n\nastead herndon\n\nThe Barack Obama coalition that he rose to power with combined young people, liberals and historic turnout from black people. And theres not one candidate in this race that has yet been able to win those different demographic groups. And that was supposed to be Kamala Harris. I mean, it was supposed to be a number of people. It could have been Beto ORourke. It could have been Cory Booker. It could have been Kirsten Gillibrand. But when we entered this race, the thought, the reason why her candidacy was so feared, was because she was thought to be the one who could most quickly tap in to that coalition. Well, there are differences that we knew would be true from the start, and theres things that weve learned over the last six to eight months. From the start, we knew that, as a black woman running, she would have no historical touchstone and she would face unique barriers. And I think if you ask the campaign, they would say thats true. But its really about messaging. We knew that this race would be defined by a progressive wing, led by figures like Elizabeth Warren and Bernie Sanders, and a moderate wing, led by Joe Biden, and that people like Kamala Harris would have to exist threading both worlds. And thats been difficult. When you talk to voters, the most consistently repeated thing is, well, I dont necessarily know what she stands for. And I think that is borne out of those two wings, the progressive and moderate wings, defining this primary through their fight. And so Bernie Sanders and Elizabeth Warren can say, if you arent with single-payer health care, youre not a progressive. If youre not willing to raise taxes on corporations and wealthy individuals, then you dont have big ideas. And the moderate wing has defined themselves by rejecting that, by defining themselves by saying, well, we cant do that or we wont beat Trump. But if youre trying to do both of those things, if youre trying to thread in between those worlds, we have seen electorates that arent really willing to give people that benefit of the doubt. And thats driving a lot of the anxiety right now, particularly among the partys moderates.\n\nmonika evstatieva\n\nAnd thats why we see all these new candidates jump in the race.\n\nastead herndon\n\nThe anxiety breeds restlessness, right? And Deval Patrick, who just announced, Mike Bloomberg, whos expected to, are trying to capitalize on that anxiety. Because in the circles that like them, in the circles of elite, Democratic moderates, they are a group that expected to have more options. Theyre not that surprised at the way Joe Bidens candidacy has turned out. Where the biggest surprise is is they thought they would have an alternative figure to Joe Biden who could replicate that Obama lane. Now remember, these are a group of people who think that Warren and Sanderss progressive policies will lose them the general election. They think that Warren and Sanders, if they are the nominee, will struggle to bring out the type of people that put Democrats over the top. And without that, without someone in the top tier who is winning black voters and exciting young voters at the same time, there is fear that you cannot replicate what Obama did. Now, their argument is that thats because of the campaigns, that the individual candidates and individual campaigns havent done the things necessary to produce that support. But it could be because of a changing electorate and two wings of the party that just arent looking for a merging savior anymore.\n\n[music]\n\nmichael barbaro\n\nWell be right back. Heres what else you need to know today.\n\narchived recording (adam schiff) Colonel Vindman, what was your real-time reaction to hearing that call? archived recording (alexander vindman) Chairman, without hesitation, I knew that I had to report this to the White House counsel.

It was improper for the president to request an  to demand an investigation into a political opponent, especially a foreign power where there is, at best, dubious belief that this would be a completely impartial investigation.\n\nmichael barbaro'	b'What Happened to Kamala Harris?'	2019-11-20	[]	[b'evstatieva', b'speaker', b'thats', b'black', b'happened', b'think', b'harris', b'know', b'herndon', b'shes', b'kamala']	b'monika evstatieva Hi. My name is Monika Evstatieva, and Im a producer for The Daily. And I am here with Astead. Astead, introduce yourself. astead herndon Hi. Im Astead Herndon. Im a politics reporter covering the election. And Im driving on a very long highway. monika evstatieva Were driving on a very long highway in South Carolina because we came here to try to answer an interesting question. What is that question? astead herndon What happened to Kamala Harriss presidential campaign that took her from top-tier, front-runner status to the middle of the pack? monika evstatieva O.K. Lets try to figure this out.\n\n[music]\n\nmichael barbaro\n\nFrom The New York Times, Im Michael Barbaro. This is The Daily. When Senator Kamala Harris launched her presidential campaign 10 months ago, she drew a crowd of 20,000 to her kickoff rally, the biggest of any candidate, and was talked about as a potential heir to the political coalition that carried Barack Obama to the White House  twice. Today, shes polling in the single digits. My colleagues Astead Herndon and Monika Evstatieva went to South Carolina with the Harris campaign. Its Wednesday, November 20.\n\nmonika evstatieva\n\nAstead and I are in the car. We are driving from the capital, Columbia, to Greenwood, and Greenwood is a small town.\n\nastead herndon Folks are in suits? You know this is South Carolina.\n\nmonika evstatieva\n\nAnd why is South Carolina essential to her campaign?\n\nastead herndon\n\nSo shes in South Carolina because, frankly, thats where their campaign is putting their chips. Theyve had to, after falling on hard times, fire most of their New Hampshire team and really focus their resources on the first state, Iowa, and then South Carolina, where they think they can unlock black support. The thought process here is based somewhat on what Barack Obama did in 2008  that if you win white support in Iowa, it proves viability, it proves electability, and that the black voters who like you but are scared you cant win will eventually come around if you prove yourself in the early states. And South Carolina, the electorates more than 65 percent black. And she thinks that she shares a real kinship there. And while shes been in South Carolina many times before, this is her first time in this community. Her campaign understands these things arent going well and needs to reach out to people they havent talked to before.\n\nmonika evstatieva O.K. Were actually walking now. Lets see whats happening.\n\nmonika evstatieva\n\nWe get to the building. Its a very small building.\n\nastead herndon Hi. My name is Astead \n\nmonika evstatieva\n\nAnd its Veterans Day.\n\n[chatter] monika evstatieva So describe this room now. astead herndon Its like a veterans hall. There are rows of people kind of set up in a half circle around what will be a panel. Some people have on their veterans regalia. Weve got flags behind them. Pretty much a standard, intimate political event. monika evstatieva O.K. Lets go talk to some people. Sir, do you have a minute to just talk with us? speaker I dont do interviews. [LAUGHTER]\n\nastead herndon\n\nWe talk to voters to try to get a sense of why they decided to come.\n\nmonika evstatieva Why are you here today? speaker 1 Well, Im here to support Kamala Harris. speaker 2 Im here to be enlightened about her policies.\n\nastead herndon\n\nHave they decided on a particular candidate?\n\nspeaker 1 I really havent picked no candidate yet, you know. speaker 2 I havent made up my mind. speaker 3 Im still shopping, looking at all the options. monika evstatieva Today, youll be listening to what she has to say and if she can basically win you over? speaker Possible. Its possible, yes.\n\nmonika evstatieva\n\nA lot of people actually dont know a lot about her. Some people dont know anything about her.\n\nspeaker Well, I really hadnt ever heard of Senator Harris before, until Wednesday.\n\nastead herndon\n\nI think thats something people forget about voters. Not everyone is tuned in all the time.\n\nspeaker 1 I really hadnt been watching the news. speaker 2 I dont even think I watched the debate. As a matter of fact, I know I didnt. I didnt watch the debate.\n\nastead herndon\n\nThey know the field is large. And they know, kind of generally, whos up and whos down.\n\nmonika evstatieva\n\nAnd in every conversation we have with these voters \n\nspeaker This is still the South.\n\nmonika evstatieva\n\n race keeps coming up.\n\nastead herndon\n\nYou have to remember the context for these largely older African-American voters.\n\nspeaker And, good Lord willing and the creek dont rise, come March of next year, Ill be 70 years old. So Ive seen a lot. And basically, I still see the world as being one great big plantation.\n\nastead herndon\n\nThese are folks who have grown up in the shadow of the Confederacy their whole lives. They have lived under the brunt of Jim Crow, some of them. And that informs how they are making pragmatic political decisions moving forward.\n\nspeaker Within South Carolina, within the African-American community, we dont want to take a chance on someone that doesnt have a chance of beating Trump.\n\nastead herndon\n\nSo things like 2008 and Barack Obama defied their wildest dreams. It was an anomaly to them, and so theres still a fear, a risk that a lot of them associate with a person of color leading the ticket.\n\nspeaker I hope shes electable, but we have to change the minds of the people.\n\nastead herndon\n\nFear that maybe in this time, where black voters are very worried about the Trump presidency, that a black candidate or a woman of color was too risky.\n\nastead herndon Do you think that black men will have problems supporting a black woman candidate? speaker Yes. astead herndon Why do you think so? speaker The men have been the head.\n\nmonika evstatieva\n\nMany people we speak to mention as an alternative \n\nspeaker Joe Biden. I think that hes a good candidate.\n\nmonika evstatieva\n\n Joe Biden.\n\nspeaker 1 I like Joe. speaker 2 I would say Biden. speaker 3 Ive looked at Joe Biden.\n\nmonika evstatieva\n\nWhy?\n\nastead herndon\n\nTheres a lot of reasons why Joe Biden looms over South Carolina. One is name recognition.\n\nspeaker 1 Because he has been vice president, and I dont think we need someone now thats on-the-job training. speaker 2 He has a track record because he was there in an administration before.\n\nastead herndon\n\nThey know who he is. Hes a known quantity, and he is someone who has longstanding relationships in those communities.\n\nspeaker He has the debate experience. And I feel like he can go after him, also.\n\nastead herndon\n\nAnother reason is he has pitched himself as the candidate who is most likely to beat Trump.\n\nastead herndon Something kind of explicit. Like, when you say that he can beat Trump, do you think thats because white people are more likely to vote for Joe Biden than they are to vote for Kamala Harris? speaker Yes. Yes.\n\nastead herndon\n\nAnd so this is one of the big challenges Harris has to overcome. Even black voters, who sometimes like her instinctively, think that her identity as a black woman might be a liability for the election. And so they see Joe Biden, a white man with experience in the White House, and even this community thinks that maybe he is better suited to beat Trump. And ultimately, thats what they care about the most.\n\n[applause] floyd nicholson So again, we thank each one of you for taking time out of your busy schedule coming out today. And without further ado, it gives me great pleasure \n\nmonika evstatieva\n\nThen the event actually kicks off. There are several introductions.\n\nfloyd nicholson  the U.S. senator from that great state of California, the honorable Kamala Harris. [applause]\n\nmonika evstatieva\n\nAnd after some time, its her time to speak. And she needs to convince the people in this room that shes uniquely positioned to represent them best.\n\nkamala harris Thank you, Senator Nicholson! Hi, mama.\n\nmonika evstatieva\n\nWhat are some of the key points she makes in this speech?\n\nkamala harris Please have a seat. So I will tell you, my background is I am a daughter of parents who met when they were active in the civil rights movement in the 1960s in Berkeley and Oakland, California.\n\nastead herndon\n\nShe introduces herself to the audience, her personal narrative.\n\nkamala harris I grew up surrounded by a bunch of adults who spent full time marching and shouting for justice.\n\nastead herndon\n\nAnd then she turns very quickly to an issue she has gotten a lot of criticism for, her position on health care.\n\nkamala harris So Im running for president to put in place a Medicare for all plan, which means everyone will be covered, including people with pre-existing conditions.\n\nastead herndon\n\nAnd for her, health care looks like what she calls a Medicare for all plan that still preserves a role for the private insurance industry.\n\nmonika evstatieva\n\nAnd this is confusing, right?\n\nastead herndon\n\nIt can be. Shes had different positions on health care. She started the race as a co-sponsor on Bernie Sanderss Medicare for all bill, which is a single-payer system that eliminates private insurance. But she kind of hemmed and hawed about the specifics of that bill and then eventually offers her own plan \n\nkamala harris Im not trying to get rid of private insurance. So I heard from too many folks who said, Kamala, dont take away our choice.\n\nastead herndon\n\n which preserves a role for private insurance. And so, this is another one of the issues people cite around Kamala Harriss campaign, is that when you look at key policies, if you look at health care, the number one issue for Democrats in this race, she has not always stood for a singular position. Shes tried to have her cake and eat it, too, some voters say. Even now, as shes in between the progressive and moderate approaches, shes still borrowing language from that progressive lane.\n\nkamala harris We want the choice between a private plan or a public plan. Well, my plan will give you the choice that you deserve.\n\nmonika evstatieva\n\nAnd this is why I was a little bit confused when I hear her say that.\n\nastead herndon\n\n[LAUGHS] Youre not the only one.\n\nkamala harris But we need reasonable gun safety laws, including universal background checks.\n\nmonika evstatieva\n\nSo she goes through some other issues that are important to the Democratic voters, like gun safety, the challenges facing veterans.\n\nkamala harris  and putting them out of business when they were targeting our veterans.\n\nmonika evstatieva\n\nBut then \n\nkamala harris And Im just going to share with you one last thing, and then I would love to start our conversation.\n\nmonika evstatieva\n\n she turns to the issue of her electability. What does she say?\n\nastead herndon\n\nSenator Harris has added this in in the last couple months. As electability has become an increasing point of conversation in this race, shes decided to address it directly.\n\nkamala harris So I just want to have a brief conversation about something thats been coming up in connection with the campaign that I call the elephant in the room. But really its the donkey in the room. And its this conversation about electability. And the conversation goes something like this. Well, I dont know if America is ready for a woman of color to be president of the United States.\n\nastead herndon\n\nShes addressing the identity question head-on. Are Democrats too scared, or is it too much of a risk to put a black woman up against Donald Trump in this critical election?\n\nkamala harris I know Im ready, but I dont know if my neighbors are ready. Theyll say, well, maybe its not your turn.\n\nastead herndon\n\nAnd she says, this is not a new conversation for me.\n\nkamala harris In fact, this is a conversation I have heard in every campaign I have  and, now, here is the operative word  won. [applause]\n\nastead herndon\n\nAnd what shes trying to evoke there is that she has broken barriers before, and that if voters put their trust in her, she will do it again. And so, in this short time, shes addressing the two big challenges of her campaign, and shes trying to solve both. Shes trying to put forth a clear position on health care and sort of suggest that there was never any lack of clarity to begin with. And then she also tries to present her identity not as a hurdle to her success, but as a rallying point. That people can come together, and again, just like in the past, theyll overcome it.\n\nkamala harris Thank you all very much. Thank you. Thank you. Thank you.\n\n[music]\n\nmichael barbaro\n\nWell be right back.\n\nmonika evstatieva O.K. So were now headed to the town hall.\n\nmonika evstatieva\n\nThen were back on the road, and we keep following Senator Harris. And the next stop is Greenville.\n\nmonika evstatieva This is a bigger city, over 62,000 people.\n\nastead herndon\n\nYeah. Were headed from Greenwood to Greenville, a more urban community.\n\nmonika evstatieva Astead cannot be bothered with nothing but Beyonc right now. astead herndon (SINGING) To the left, to the left.\n\nmonika evstatieva\n\nAnd I actually find out you can sing.\n\nastead herndon\n\n[LAUGHS]\n\nmonika evstatieva\n\nSo we get to Greenville.\n\nspeaker Hi, welcome. Thank you very much for coming. Just through the glass doors on your right. I got to tell yall that.\n\nastead herndon\n\nWhen we come in, its a larger gymnasium. Its probably double or triple the amount of people in terms of crowd size, even though theres some empty seats. And theres also just a more elaborate setup. Thats all kind of just the campaign doing the more operational flexing of muscle for the bigger city.\n\nmonika evstatieva\n\nRight. So this is a more diverse place. Its more highly educated. Its younger. And people are following the election more closely, and so here, many people already know her.\n\nastead herndon Im sorry. You all are people who have picked a candidate? I know I see the shirts. speaker Yes. astead herndon But youre all in. speaker 1 Yes. Yes, all in. speaker 2 All in for Kamala.\n\nmonika evstatieva\n\nWhat are some of the things they tell us?\n\nastead herndon\n\nThey say what you hear from the Kamala Harris diehards, that she first came on their radar during the Senate committee hearings, where she was praised for her aggressive questioning of Bill Barr and Jeff Sessions.\n\nspeaker So I think it was during Sessionss confirmation hearings that I thought, shes going to run for president, and if she is, shes got my vote.\n\nastead herndon\n\nEventually, Brett Kavanaugh.\n\nspeaker Especially during the Kavanaugh hearings, when she talked to Dr. Ford and just looked at her in the eyes and said, I believe you, I believe you.\n\nastead herndon\n\nThey tell you that they like her debate interaction with Joe Biden in the first debate. She looked tough on the debate stage. And shes the one that they want to see go up against Donald Trump.\n\nmonika evstatieva\n\nAnd you asked them, but why is she not polling better?\n\nastead herndon What have you thought about the trajectory of her campaign? I mean, she started up there, but shes since kind of fallen. Why do you think that is?\n\nmonika evstatieva\n\nWhat are some of the things they cite as examples?\n\nastead herndon\n\nThese folks are following the race closely, and so they know that theres been a change in political standing from where Senator Harris started the race to where she arrived now. And when you ask her supporters that  why did that happen?  they again point to her identity.\n\nspeaker Shes been erased by the media. Shes been misrepresented by the media.\n\nastead herndon\n\nThey blame media for preferring, often, white candidates over people of color. And they point to a top tier, where the four candidates at the top are all white now in the Democratic Party.\n\nspeaker I mean, shes a black woman in a race that everyones looking for a white savior candidate. And so  but I think dont count her out. Shes got a strong ground game.\n\nmonika evstatieva\n\nThe event kicks off with a couple of introductions, including from a high school student.\n\nspeaker Ladies and gentlemen, I am proud to present to you someone who looks just like me.\n\nastead herndon\n\nYeah, theyve started having organizers introduce her, particularly women of color, to lean into that representation aspect.\n\nkamala harris Well, good afternoon, Greenville. It is wonderful to be back.\n\nmonika evstatieva\n\nAnd throughout the speech, the thing that gets the most ovation is when she goes after Trump.\n\nkamala harris We will need, as our nominee, someone who can stand on that debate stage and go toe-to-toe with Donald Trump. And Greenville, youre looking at her. Youre looking at her! ^[APPLAUSE]^\n\nastead herndon\n\nTheres a couple lines that any Democrat can say, and theyll get the audience on their feet. A surefire crowd-pleaser is to attack the president.\n\nkamala harris And somebody needs to remind Donald Trump that some of his closest relatives are immigrants, too. ^[APPLAUSE]^\n\nastead herndon\n\nAnd especially with the impeachment proceedings going on, Senator Harriss lines of justice being on the ballot or prosecuting the case against Donald Trump are always going to get the crowd on their feet. The question is if its just about Trump, why is that a reason to prefer Kamala Harris over the rest of the Democratic field, who are also making those same arguments?\n\nkamala harris And thats why Im running. I thank you all so very much. Thank you. Thank you. [applause] monika evstatieva O.K. Where are we going?\n\nastead herndon\n\nWe are in Greer, South Carolina \n\nmonika evstatieva\n\nThe following day, bright and early, we join her again.\n\nmonika evstatieva Its next to Greenville. And this time its raining.\n\nastead herndon\n\n at a community center \n\nmonika evstatieva O.K. Needmore Recreation Community Center. We are here.\n\nastead herndon\n\n where she is speaking to maybe 20, 25 people, all African-American, older residents.\n\nkamala harris So you all know, and have lived long, wonderful lives. And youll remember that for a large part of your life \n\nastead herndon\n\nShe spent a lot of her speech on lowering prescription drug costs and her health care plan, but she also mentions more systemic problems.\n\nkamala harris And remember those zero percent loans, nothing down? Predatory practices. The brokers made all kinds of money.\n\nastead herndon\n\nLike housing inequality and equitable education, issues that matter to older black voters.\n\nkamala harris And the father can look at his son and say, son, you dont have to go and get a loan from one of those private companies that are going to charge you these outrageous interest rates. Ill take some of the equity out of my home to help you pay for tuition. So thank you very much. Thank you, thank you. [applause]\n\nmonika evstatieva\n\nAfter the speech, we see something that I havent experienced so far.\n\nspeaker Pastor T., if you wanted to come up and say a couple words, or maybe pray over the senator. kamala harris Oh, yeah, I would love that.\n\nmonika evstatieva\n\nA pastor starts a prayer for her.\n\ntelley lynnette gadson So, were going to pray. kamala harris Yes. Yes. telley lynnette gadson Were going to pray. Were going to pray for protection.\n\nmonika evstatieva\n\nShe is literally holding her hands, and the whole room, everyone is standing up.\n\ntelley lynnette gadson Kamala Devi Harris, when you were in your mothers womb, God already knew about this stage of your life, and already knew that you would be in Greer, South Carolina, at the Needmore Community Center. It wasnt an accident.\n\nastead herndon\n\nThis is one of the cool things you can see while campaigning, specifically in South Carolina. Because the Democratic electorate is so black, and because the black electorate, particularly in these Southern states, is so religious, a lot of the campaigning happens through these religious communities. Pastors in black communities are not just religious leaders. They are community leaders. Theyre political leaders. Theyre cultural hubs. And particularly with black candidates, theres a sense of kinship there.\n\ntelley lynnette gadson God, for every flight that she will take, I pray that you are the pilot. God, for every car that she journeys in, I ask you to be the driver. And for every thought that she would think, I ask you to be the orchestrator.\n\nastead herndon\n\nKamala Harris is a religious woman. And there is a shared language of faith that happens at these events that you see with other candidates  its not like they wouldnt pray for a white candidate  but theres something different when its someone who they know has worshipped in their churches for their whole lives. And so she prays for her, and she mentions that the last presidential candidate she prayed for \n\ntelley lynnette gadson Now, the last person that I made my hands on and prayed for in the presidential election \n\nastead herndon\n\n was Barack Obama.\n\ntelley lynnette gadson  was Barack Hussein Obama. [applause]\n\nmonika evstatieva\n\nThe reverend is Reverend Gadson, but she goes by Pastor T.\n\ntelley lynnette gadson So we can be clear, they call me Pastor T., but Reverend Telley Lynnette Gadson. Thats who I am.\n\nmonika evstatieva\n\nAnd we actually catch up with her after the prayer.\n\nastead herndon That was your first time seeing the senator, I imagine, right? telley lynnette gadson First time seeing, but not first time hearing about.\n\nastead herndon\n\nAnd then we ask her about the race.\n\nastead herndon Are you someone who personally has made a decision about who you want to vote for? telley lynnette gadson I have not. I have not. And thats been because the field is so wide. But where I am, as Ive shared, is just a posture of, first of all, praying for our country. What is it that we \n\nastead herndon\n\nYou can see how that represents a problem for Kamala Harris.\n\n[music]\n\nmonika evstatieva\n\nSo we have this pastor who says she last laid hands on Barack Obama, but isnt ready to give her support to Kamala Harris, someone who started this race so strongly by trying to capture the same kind of coalition that Obama did. Weve heard that the challenges to her campaign are her identity and the lack of clarity on policy, but those same things could have been said for Obama. So whats different in 2019?\n\nastead herndon\n\nThe Barack Obama coalition that he rose to power with combined young people, liberals and historic turnout from black people. And theres not one candidate in this race that has yet been able to win those different demographic groups. And that was supposed to be Kamala Harris. I mean, it was supposed to be a number of people. It could have been Beto ORourke. It could have been Cory Booker. It could have been Kirsten Gillibrand. But when we entered this race, the thought, the reason why her candidacy was so feared, was because she was thought to be the one who could most quickly tap in to that coalition. Well, there are differences that we knew would be true from the start, and theres things that weve learned over the last six to eight months. From the start, we knew that, as a black woman running, she would have no historical touchstone and she would face unique barriers. And I think if you ask the campaign, they would say thats true. But its really about messaging. We knew that this race would be defined by a progressive wing, led by figures like Elizabeth Warren and Bernie Sanders, and a moderate wing, led by Joe Biden, and that people like Kamala Harris would have to exist threading both worlds. And thats been difficult. When you talk to voters, the most consistently repeated thing is, well, I dont necessarily know what she stands for. And I think that is borne out of those two wings, the progressive and moderate wings, defining this primary through their fight. And so Bernie Sanders and Elizabeth Warren can say, if you arent with single-payer health care, youre not a progressive. If youre not willing to raise taxes on corporations and wealthy individuals, then you dont have big ideas. And the moderate wing has defined themselves by rejecting that, by defining themselves by saying, well, we cant do that or we wont beat Trump. But if youre trying to do both of those things, if youre trying to thread in between those worlds, we have seen electorates that arent really willing to give people that benefit of the doubt. And thats driving a lot of the anxiety right now, particularly among the partys moderates.\n\nmonika evstatieva\n\nAnd thats why we see all these new candidates jump in the race.\n\nastead herndon\n\nThe anxiety breeds restlessness, right? And Deval Patrick, who just announced, Mike Bloomberg, whos expected to, are trying to capitalize on that anxiety. Because in the circles that like them, in the circles of elite, Democratic moderates, they are a group that expected to have more options. Theyre not that surprised at the way Joe Bidens candidacy has turned out. Where the biggest surprise is is they thought they would have an alternative figure to Joe Biden who could replicate that Obama lane. Now remember, these are a group of people who think that Warren and Sanderss progressive policies will lose them the general election. They think that Warren and Sanders, if they are the nominee, will struggle to bring out the type of people that put Democrats over the top. And without that, without someone in the top tier who is winning black voters and exciting young voters at the same time, there is fear that you cannot replicate what Obama did. Now, their argument is that thats because of the campaigns, that the individual candidates and individual campaigns havent done the things necessary to produce that support. But it could be because of a changing electorate and two wings of the party that just arent looking for a merging savior anymore.\n\n[music]\n\nmichael barbaro\n\nWell be right back.

Jill and Natalie held hands for much of the ceremony. Biden was the first to speak and kept his remarks brief. Addressing Gold Star families in attendance, Biden noted that it was the anniversary of Beaus death. Four years ago today, we lost Natalies dad, he said. Still speaking to the Gold Star families, Biden said: We all know the loss of a loved one  somehow the pain fades a little bit, but those moments when we remember are bittersweet because theyre the days when everything comes back. The pride as well as the pain. A little while later, several members of the Delaware National Guard, in which Beau had served  including about a year in Iraq  stepped forward to place a flower on the wreath that would be laid in front of the monument. As they passed in front of Biden, I thought I saw his jaw muscles tighten.\n\nTed Kaufman, Bidens close friend and an informal adviser to the campaign, told me that Biden would have run for president in 2016 had Beau not fallen ill. Donilon had written a 25-page memo outlining Bidens path to the Democratic nomination and then the White House. But Biden couldnt make a decision until Beaus situation was resolved, as Kaufman delicately put it, and by the time Beau died, in May 2015, it was too late  there was no way logistically at that point to be competitive with Hillary Clinton. (It has been reported that Obama actively discouraged Biden from seeking the presidency in 2016. In Promise Me, Dad, Biden notes that Obama asked him if he intended to run and was not encouraging.) But the determining factor was the emotional toll from Beaus death, a point Jill Biden made when she and I spoke by phone on the morning of the Miami debate. As Joe has said, when you run for president, your whole heart and your whole soul has to be in it, and we just werent there because of Beaus death, she told me. Beau was part of the discussion as her husband weighed a decision for 2020. We talked to one another and thought we were ready, she said. As she put it: Its something you wake up to every morning. It never leaves you.\n\nWhen I mentioned Beau in our conversation in June, a stricken expression fell across Bidens face. He said that contrary to what many people assumed, the promise he made to Beau wasnt a promise to run for president  rather, when Beau knew that he was dying, he made his father promise that he wouldnt crumble in grief and withdraw from life. He knew how much I adored him, and he was worried that I might just drop out, Biden said. He looked down at the table as he spoke and twisted his phone around in his hands like it was a Rubiks Cube. He strongly thought I should run for president, he said. That wasnt the promise. The promise was to stay engaged.\n\nWhat stunned me, Biden went on, was he had come to grips with his own death. God, he was an incredible guy. He said that Beau was now his lodestar. Almost every morning I get up, I think to myself, I hope hes proud of me, Biden said. I know hes still here. I know hes still with me. I really do. I really do.\n\nThough Biden can be careless with his words, he is usually very disciplined in how he talks about Beau  he invokes his son not to gain sympathy but rather to express solidarity with others who have suffered loss. Still, there is some risk in making Beaus death part of the narrative of his campaign  it can seem exploitative. Cynics will inevitably see it as a ploy to insulate himself from criticism, or to at least force his opponents to go easy on him. During a recent interview with CNNs Chris Cuomo, Biden said he was surprised by Kamala Harriss broadside in Miami because she knew Beau  who had been Delawares attorney general  a comment that could be construed as an expectation that his sons death would grant him a degree of immunity.\n\nIt certainly wont against Trump. His campaign has already signaled that it intends to make an issue of Hunter Biden, whose business ventures during the Obama administration have drawn scrutiny, if no evidence of impropriety on his fathers part. Hunters complicated personal life, which includes a messy divorce and admitted drug use, will be additional fodder for the Republican Party. And it seems that even Beau will not be out of bounds. At Trumps re-election kickoff rally in Florida last month, his son Donald Jr. mocked Bidens initiative to cure cancer. Wow, why the hell didnt you do that over the last 50 years, Joe? the younger Trump sneered, eliciting laughter.\n\nIt is an axiom of American politics that campaigns must project a spirit of optimism. But the 2020 race is taking place against a backdrop of deep pessimism and a profound sense of loss. From the gutted middle class to Americas diminished stature, loss is the subtext to this election  and perhaps no political figure in American history has experienced loss as Biden has. During campaign appearances, Biden hits the requisite morning-in-America note, telling audiences that he has never been more optimistic about the country. But he often adds a qualifier  I know everyone says Im too optimistic, he said this month at a rally in Portsmouth, N.H.  that suggests hes aware the audience probably doesnt feel the same way.'	b'Joe Biden Wants to Take America Back to a Time Before Trump'	2019-07-23	[b'Michael Steinberger']	[b'hes', b'death', b'president', b'trump', b'run', b'america', b'wants', b'promise', b'loss', b'beau', b'know', b'beaus', b'joe', b'biden']	b'Biden was joined by his wife, Jill, and the couples granddaughter Natalie.

The fact that somebody has a younger body doesnt mean you dont have old ideas. I would like to speak on the issue of race. Vice President Biden, I do not believe you are a racist. But I also believe  and it is personal  and I was actually very, it was hurtful to hear you talk about the reputations of two United States senators who built their reputations and career on the segregation of race in this country. You know, there was a little girl in California who was part of the second class to integrate her public schools. And she was bused to school every day. And that little girl was me. Look, everything Ive done in my career  I ran because of civil rights. I continue to think we have to make fundamental changes in civil rights  My community is in anguish right now because of an officer-involved shooting: a black man, Eric Logan, killed by a white officer. This will be investigated and there will be accountability for the officer involved. But youre the mayor. You should fire the chief if thats the policy and someone died. People who have health care under Medicare for all will have no premiums, no deductables, no copayments, no out-of-pocket expenses. Yes, they will pay more in taxes, but less in health care. The quickest, fastest way to do it is build on Obamacare. I would call it Medicare for all who want it. On Day 1, we take out our executive order pen and we rescind every damn thing on this issue that Trump has done. I will release children from cages. When I see these kids at the border, I see my mom. She was separated from her parents for years during the Holocaust. To take children from the arms of their parents  This is collective child abuse.  actually put them up for adoption  Families always belong together.  in Colorado, we call that kidnapping. The first thing I would do is make sure that we defeat Donald Trump. We expose him for the fraud that he is. Hes torn apart the moral fabric of who we are. That is not reflective of our America and our values. And its got to end. But if you think were going to beat Donald Trump by just having all these plans, you got another thing coming.

Joe Biden was right when he said it was time to pass the torch to a new generation of Americans, 32 years ago. Im still holding on to that torch. The fact that somebody has a younger body doesnt mean you dont have old ideas. I would like to speak on the issue of race. Vice President Biden, I do not believe you are a racist. But I also believe  and it is personal  and I was actually very, it was hurtful to hear you talk about the reputations of two United States senators who built their reputations and career on the segregation of race in this country. You know, there was a little girl in California who was part of the second class to integrate her public schools. And she was bused to school every day. And that little girl was me. Look, everything Ive done in my career  I ran because of civil rights. I continue to think we have to make fundamental changes in civil rights  My community is in anguish right now because of an officer-involved shooting: a black man, Eric Logan, killed by a white officer. This will be investigated and there will be accountability for the officer involved. But youre the mayor. You should fire the chief if thats the policy and someone died. People who have health care under Medicare for all will have no premiums, no deductables, no copayments, no out-of-pocket expenses. Yes, they will pay more in taxes, but less in health care. The quickest, fastest way to do it is build on Obamacare. I would call it Medicare for all who want it. On Day 1, we take out our executive order pen and we rescind every damn thing on this issue that Trump has done. I will release children from cages. When I see these kids at the border, I see my mom. She was separated from her parents for years during the Holocaust. To take children from the arms of their parents  This is collective child abuse.  actually put them up for adoption  Families always belong together.  in Colorado, we call that kidnapping. The first thing I would do is make sure that we defeat Donald Trump. We expose him for the fraud that he is. Hes torn apart the moral fabric of who we are. That is not reflective of our America and our values. And its got to end. But if you think were going to beat Donald Trump by just having all these plans, you got another thing coming. Because he didnt win by saying he had a plan. He won by simply saying, Make America Great Again.'

KENNEDY, Democrat of Massachusetts: I'd like to direct your attention to the issues that were raised after the end of our hearing back at the earlier consideration for your nomination to go on the Supreme Court and this is related to the whole question of voter intimidation in Phoenix.\n\nAs you remember, these allegations came up after the conclusion of our hearings, Senator Bayh, Senator Hart, myself, inquired of you about your own conduct and your activities during the voter intimidation cases. At that time Chairman Eastland chose not to reopen the hearings. We did receive responses to our questions but we never did have an opportunity to go through the various allegations and charges during the course of that hearing or any direct opportunity to inquire of you about those particular allegations and charges. And it's my understanding and that these are quotes that are put in chronological order that are taken from the responses which you gave to us. A. Senator, I have a copy with me. Q. [ reading ] ''In 1958, I became involved in the election day program on quite short notice spent all the day at Republican County Headquarters in Phoenix. In 1960, on election day, I believe that I spent most of the day in county headquarters. In that year, however, we had enough other lawyers available in county headquarters so that I probably spent some of the day going to precincts where a dispute had risen and attempts to resolve it. With respect to 1962 on election day my recollection is that I spent most of the day in Republican County headquarters. However, I think that on several occasions in 1962, just as in 1960, I went to precincts where disputes had arisen in an effort to resolve them. With respect to 1964, my recollection is that on election day, during this particular election I spent all of my time in county headquarters. In none of these years did I personally engage in challenging the qualification of any voters. I have not, either in the general election of 1964 or in any other election at Bethune Precinct or in any other precinct, either myself harassed or intimidated voters or encouraged or approved of harassment or intimidation of voters by other persons.''\n\nAnd I believe, as part of that record, you actually signed an affidavit which I read now: ''I have read the affidavits of Jordan Harris and Robert Tate, both notarized in Maricopa County. So far as these affidavits pertain to me they are false.

If my memory is correct, two. He asked them, he said, 'Pardon me. Are you a qualified voter?' to this black gentleman. The man said 'Yes.' And he said 'Do you have any credentials to indicate that you are?' And the man said, 'No.' And he said, 'Well, then, perhaps there's a question of whether or not you're qualified.' And the man, instead of standing in line, if he had advanced, by that time he got to the voting table, he would have found his name on the voting list. But he turned on his heels and left the voting precinct. We felt, I felt, that the whole purpose of that was to discourage blacks from voting.'' Do you know Mr. Pine, Charlie Pine? A.

His solution? To give every American a universal basic income of $1,000 a month.\n\nThree questions about Andrew Yang\n\n1. How would his proposed universal basic income actually work? Mr. Yangs signature campaign proposal is to provide a monthly payment he calls the freedom dividend. Every American 18 and over would qualify  even billionaires. The payments, he argues, would go a long way toward blunting the impact of automation, which Mr. Yang fears will cause mass unemployment. Giving people all that money would come with a huge price tag, and Mr. Yang suggests paying for it, in part, by imposing a value-added tax of 10 percent.\n\n2. Free money sounds nice. Has his campaign gained any traction? Mr. Yang announced his campaign for president in February 2018, long before other candidates. At the time, he truly was a fringe candidate. But after some unconventional campaigning and appearances on the debate stage, Mr. Yang found new fans and his fund-raising efforts took off.

As a result, the greatest increase was in representation by Democratic women; Republican women actually lost ground in the 2018 midterms.\n\nWomen candidates benefited from getting in early, having dynamic fund-raising, and in many cases taking advantage of digital campaigns and social media to engage new voters.\n\nWomen of color are slowly gaining ground\n\nAlthough they make up 20 percent of the population, women of color still hold a meager 4 percent of all elected offices. But since 2015, the researchers found, women of color have increased their ranks by 41 percent in Congress and 38 percent in state legislatures.\n\nThe Democratic electorate is getting younger, more liberal and more diverse, and the Democratic candidates who are winning are reflecting both those demographic shifts and an increase in recruitment of such candidates. Indeed, for the first time since the group began tracking data in 2012, the majority of Democratic candidates in 2018 were not white men.\n\nAmong female Democrats who ran last year, 9 percent were women of color; among Republicans, a mere 1 percent were. Female Democrats, especially women of color, often find their easiest path to election is taking on a male incumbent from their own party in a primary, which political gatekeepers greatly discourage.\n\nState legislatures are ground zero for women gaining seats\n\nBefore the 2018 election, only two states  Colorado and Vermont  had 40 percent or more female lawmakers. There are now three more states that can claim that distinction: Oregon, Washington and Nevada, which boasts the nations only majority-female legislature.\n\nIn four states, the number of women legislators increased by 50 percent or more: Oklahoma, Wyoming, Michigan and Nebraska.

As a result, the greatest increase was in representation by Democratic women; Republican women actually lost ground in the 2018 midterms.\n\nWomen candidates benefited from getting in early, having dynamic fund-raising, and in many cases taking advantage of digital campaigns and social media to engage new voters.\n\nWomen of color are slowly gaining ground\n\nAlthough they make up 20 percent of the population, women of color still hold a meager 4 percent of all elected offices. But since 2015, the researchers found, women of color have increased their ranks by 41 percent in Congress and 38 percent in state legislatures.\n\nThe Democratic electorate is getting younger, more liberal and more diverse, and the Democratic candidates who are winning are reflecting both those demographic shifts and an increase in recruitment of such candidates. Indeed, for the first time since the group began tracking data in 2012, the majority of Democratic candidates in 2018 were not white men.\n\nAmong female Democrats who ran last year, 9 percent were women of color; among Republicans, a mere 1 percent were. Female Democrats, especially women of color, often find their easiest path to election is taking on a male incumbent from their own party in a primary, which political gatekeepers greatly discourage.\n\nState legislatures are ground zero for women gaining seats\n\nBefore the 2018 election, only two states  Colorado and Vermont  had 40 percent or more female lawmakers. There are now three more states that can claim that distinction: Oregon, Washington and Nevada, which boasts the nations only majority-female legislature.\n\nIn four states, the number of women legislators increased by 50 percent or more: Oklahoma, Wyoming, Michigan and Nebraska. Women make up almost 29 percent of state legislators over all, outpacing their ranks in Congress. White mens share of state legislative seats dropped by 6 percent from 2017 to 2019.'

trusted	b'Joe Bidens Vice-Presidential Pick: Kamala Harris'	true	[]		trusted	[]	https://www.nytimes.com/article/biden-vice-president-2020.html	https://www.nytimes.com/	b'[Joe Biden selected Senator Kamala Harris of California as his vice-presidential running mate.]\n\nJoseph R. Biden Jr. is expected to announce his vice-presidential choice within days. After missing one self-imposed deadline after another, he is running out of time to make his selection before the Democratic National Convention begins on Aug. 17.\n\nMr. Bidens advisers say he has spoken with several of the leading candidates in recent days, and it has been confirmed that he met in person in early August with Gov. Gretchen Whitmer of Michigan. We do not know exactly how many face-to-face interviews Mr. Biden has conducted with potential running mates. A small handful of women remain under serious consideration.\n\nAmong the candidates reviewed most closely by Mr. Bidens vetting team are Senators Elizabeth Warren and Kamala Harris, both former presidential candidates; Representatives Karen Bass of California and Val Demings of Florida; Senator Tammy Duckworth of Illinois and Susan E. Rice, the former national security adviser.\n\nThe lobbying for and against the various candidates has grown intense, and some prominent Democrats have spoken out in recent days against what appears to be a concerted effort by some Democrats to spread negative information about some of the contenders in hopes of boosting their own candidate of choice.\n\nBut people close to Mr. Biden acknowledge that, at this point, the V.P. choice is almost entirely in his hands. He has said all along that he wants a running mate with whom he has strong personal chemistry, and who could be a hand-in-glove partner in governing. Those criteria appear to have strengthened both Ms. Whitmer, with whom Mr. Biden developed a tight political bond this year, and Ms. Rice, who worked closely with Mr. Biden in the Obama administration.\n\nUltimately, only Mr. Biden can judge which person in this historically diverse vice-presidential field best meets his own view of what the job demands.\n\n[Follow along with The Timess coverage of Joe Bidens pick for vice president.]\n\nTop contenders\n\nKamala Harris\n\nImage\n\nBio: Senator from California since 2017; former presidential candidate; served as district attorney in San Francisco and state attorney general.\n\nHow seriously is she being vetted? Very seriously. Harris, 55, has long been seen as among the likeliest candidates to be chosen.\n\nSignature issues: Proposed cutting middle-class taxes; recently advocated policing reform; pushed a Senate bill to make lynching a federal crime; played a high-profile role in the confirmation hearings of Justice Brett M. Kavanaugh.\n\nRelationship with Biden: Harris had a friendly relationship with Biden before they competed in the 2020 primaries, and Harris knew his late son, Beau, when they served as attorneys general. But Harris also attacked Biden more harshly than any other Democrat in the 2020 race, rebuking him in the first televised debate for having worked with segregationist senators to oppose school busing policies in the 1970s.\n\nPros and cons: Harris is among the best-known Black women in American politics, with appeal to both moderates and liberals. But she ran an unsteady presidential campaign last year and struggled with questions about her law-enforcement record. The way she and her advisers handled the 2020 primary left some in the Biden campaign with significant reservations.\n\nOn being considered for vice president: I know that conversation is taking place in the press and among the pundits, and Im honored to even be considered, if thats the case.\n\nSusan Rice\n\nImage\n\nBio: National security adviser and ambassador to the United Nations under President Obama.\n\nHow seriously is she being vetted? Very seriously. Rice, 55, has been among the candidates furthest along in the vetting process.\n\nSignature issues: Closely identified with the Obama administrations foreign policy breakthroughs, including the Iran nuclear deal and the Paris climate agreement; recently called for statehood for Washington, D.C.\n\nRelationship with Biden: Rice served with Biden in the Obama administration for eight years, and their working relationship dates back to the 1990s when Rice was an assistant secretary of state and Biden was on the Senate Foreign Relations Committee.\n\nPros and cons: Rice has credentials on national security and foreign policy that no other candidate can match, as well as a deep working relationship with Biden. While she has never been a candidate, she is seen as an agile communicator on television who would likely fare well in a vice-presidential debate. But Rice has never been elected to office before, and putting her on the ticket would force Biden to relitigate some major controversies of the Obama administration  most significantly, the 2012 attack on the U.S. consulate in Benghazi, Libya.\n\nOn being considered for vice president: Im humbled and honored to be among the extremely accomplished women who are reportedly being considered in that regard.\n\nElizabeth Warren\n\nImage\n\nBio: Senator from Massachusetts since 2013; former presidential candidate; former Harvard Law School professor and bankruptcy expert; architect of the Consumer Financial Protection Bureau.\n\nHow seriously is she being vetted? Very seriously. Warren, 71, has been among the strongest contenders to be Mr. Bidens running mate.\n\nSignature issues: Has long criticized wealth concentration and corporate power; proposed plans to break up big companies, tax the extremely rich and use proceeds to fund new social benefits; recently called for investigations of how the Trump administration has distributed economic stimulus money and pushed a measure to strip the names of Confederate generals from military bases.\n\nRelationship with Biden: Warren and Biden have a relationship of mutual respect, framed by significant ideological differences. When Biden was a senator and Warren a Harvard professor, they clashed in a Senate hearing over bankruptcy regulation. But when Biden was mulling a campaign for president in 2016, he met with Warren privately and considered the idea of asking her to run with him.\n\nPros and cons: Warren would bring sterling progressive credentials and a forceful economic message to Bidens ticket. But she does not represent racial or generational diversity, and her populist record could unnerve some moderates.\n\nOn being considered for vice president: Im focused right now on this crisis.\n\nGretchen Whitmer\n\nImage\n\nBio: Governor of Michigan since 2019; former Democratic leader in the Michigan State Senate; delivered the Democratic response to President Trumps State of the Union address in February.\n\nHow seriously is she being vetted? Very seriously. Whitmer, 48, has acknowledged she has had contact with the Biden search team, but seems like a less prominent candidate than she was in the spring.\n\nSignature issues: Ran for governor on a platform of rebuilding Michigans broken roads, raising the minimum wage and investing in education; has grappled with the coronavirus pandemic reshaping her administration, putting public health and budgetary challenges at the center of her agenda.\n\nRelationship with Biden: Whitmer has described herself as having been friends with Biden for years, and he endorsed her campaign for governor in 2018. She returned the favor before the Michigan presidential primary in March.\n\nPros and cons: Whitmer is a popular young leader from a swing state, with a compelling story of leadership during the coronavirus pandemic. She is ideologically aligned with Biden and might help him lock down Midwestern and industrial battlegrounds  not only Michigan, but also Pennsylvania and Wisconsin. But Whitmer has only served half a term as governor, and if Biden selects her then Democrats would be putting forward an all-white ticket for the second consecutive election.\n\nOn being considered for vice president: I am making a little bit of time to stay connected to the campaign but the most important thing that I have to do right now is be the governor of my home state.\n\nKaren Bass\n\nImage\n\nBio: Representative from California since 2011; chair of the Congressional Black Caucus; former speaker of the California State Assembly.\n\nHow seriously is she being vetted? Very seriously. Bass, 66, joined the process later than some of the other candidates, but she has emerged this summer as a top contender for the vice presidency.\n\nSignature issues: Has been a prominent figure in the House debate over police reform; introduced legislation on public health, student debt and foster care; leads a House subcommittee on Africa, global health and human rights.\n\nRelationship with Biden: Bass and Biden do not have a deep relationship, but they appeared together at several events when he was vice president and Bass endorsed his candidacy in March.\n\nPros and cons: Bass has a longer legislative record  in Washington and California  than almost anyone else under consideration. She has a rich political record that has involved confronting civil unrest in Los Angeles and helping steer her state through the Great Recession. But she is little-known nationally and is only now receiving close scrutiny for aspects of her biography, including making multiple visits to Cuba under Fidel Castro.\n\nOn being considered for vice president: Im willing to serve my country in whatever way I am called upon.\n\nVal Demings\n\nImage\n\nBio: Representative from Florida since 2017; served as police chief in Orlando after a long career there as an officer.\n\nHow seriously is she being vetted? Very seriously. Demings, 63, has been interviewed at length and vetted intensively by the Biden team.\n\nSignature issues: Has been an outspoken voice in the House on issues related to gun control and law enforcement; served as an impeachment manager in the Senate trial of President Trump.\n\nRelationship with Biden: Demings and Biden do not have a longstanding relationship, but they campaigned together for Florida Democrats during the 2018 elections.\n\nPros and cons: Demings is a strong campaigner with a rsum that matches the moment, and she comes from a crucial part of the countrys biggest swing state. But she has not been closely vetted by the press and her experience in elected office is relatively brief.\n\nOn being considered for vice president: I hope, regardless of how it turns out, that when boys and girls and young men and women around this nation hear my personal story and theyve been told that they cant make it for whatever reason, that they will be inspired.\n\nTammy Duckworth\n\nImage\n\nBio: Senator from Illinois since 2017; served two terms in the House; former director of the Illinois Department of Veterans Affairs; a retired Army lieutenant colonel and helicopter pilot who lost both legs in combat while serving in Iraq.\n\nHow seriously is she being vetted? Very seriously. Duckworth, 52, has been interviewed by the Biden team and she has been asked to submit documents for vetting.\n\nSignature issues: Has been a prominent spokeswoman for her party on national security and the concerns of veterans and military families; championed policies to protect people with disabilities.\n\nRelationship with Biden: Duckworth does not have an especially close relationship with Biden, but as vice president he backed her 2016 candidacy to unseat a Republican senator, Mark Kirk. Duckworth introduced Bidens late son, Beau, as a speaker at the 2008 Democratic National Convention.\n\nPros and cons: Duckworths personal story could be powerful in a presidential campaign; she would be the first veteran on a national ticket since John McCain, and the first female veteran ever. She is a less prominent voice on some of the issues most central to the campaign, like policing and the economy.\n\nOn being considered for vice president: I can push back against Trump in a way others cant.'	b'Joe Bidens Vice-Presidential Pick: Kamala Harris'		[b'Alexander Burns']	[b'issues', b'bidens', b'served', b'senator', b'seriously', b'pick', b'president', b'considered', b'vetted', b'state', b'vicepresidential', b'harris', b'joe', b'biden', b'kamala', b'vice']	b'[Joe Biden selected Senator Kamala Harris of California as his vice-presidential running mate.]\n\nJoseph R.

Mr. Biden has been clear about his core requirements for a running mate: that he be simpatico with that person on major strategic matters and key priorities, and that she be prepared and experienced enough to assume the duties of the presidency immediately, if needed.

This is The Daily.\n\n[music]\n\nToday: Two weeks ago, the biggest story in the country was the Democratic presidential primary. Now, with the coronavirus, its been largely forgotten. Alex Burns on what happened when those two stories collided. Its Monday, March 23.\n\nmichael barbaro\n\nHello?\n\nalex burns\n\nHello, Michael.\n\nmichael barbaro\n\nHey. Its always nice to be heralded by a bing, you know?\n\nalex burns\n\nIs that not your usual entrance into halls and rooms?\n\nmichael barbaro\n\nUsually its trumpets. [LAUGHS] I feel like every day pretty much for two weeks, we would talk on the show. And then poof, we have this unplanned hiatus, and you go away. And so I kind of miss you a little bit.\n\nalex burns\n\n[LAUGHS] Its a particularly painful kind of social isolation, for me at least.\n\nmichael barbaro\n\nSo, bring us up to speed on the Democratic primary. How would you describe the current state of the race?\n\nalex burns\n\nWell, its pretty close to over at this point. Joe Biden has emerged as the overwhelming favorite to be the Democratic nominee. He clearly has a support from the majority of the party, wide lead in the delegate count. And Bernie Sanders has not conceded the race, but hes acknowledged that he is sort of reassessing his campaign. And thats often the first stage in the process of winding things down.\n\nmichael barbaro\n\nSo in effect, it feels like what you just described is more or less where we were a couple of weeks ago. But with the benefit of some hindsight and some reporting on your part, I wonder if you could tell us how exactly that happened, because I dont think weve properly accounted for the whiplash and the speed with which the Sanders campaign came kind of crashing down.\n\nalex burns\n\nNo, I dont think we have. And I think really, you have to rewind the tape almost exactly a month ago to what was the high point.\n\narchived recording (bernie sanders) And now, Im delighted to bring you some pretty good news. [CHEERING] I think all of you know, we won the popular vote in Iowa. [CHEERING] We won the New Hampshire primary. [CHEERING] And according to three networks in the A.P., we have now won the Nevada caucus! [CHEERING]\n\nalex burns\n\nHe wins the Nevada caucuses. And he wins them by just an enormous margin.\n\narchived recording (crowd) Bernie! Bernie! Bernie!\n\nalex burns\n\nHe crushes Joe Biden, Elizabeth Warren, Pete Buttigieg.\n\narchived recording (crowd) Bernie! Bernie! Bernie!\n\nalex burns\n\nHe wins young voters. He wins older voters. He wins folks who have participated in caucuses in the past and people who are participating for the first time. Its in Nevada, where we see him go from winning about a quarter of the vote to winning nearly half the vote.\n\narchived recording (bernie sanders) And no campaign has a grass-roots movement like we do, which is another reason why were going to win this election. [CROWD CHEERING]\n\nalex burns\n\nAnd that sends a really powerful signal across the Democratic Party.\n\nmichael barbaro\n\nAnd what does that signal?\n\nalex burns\n\nI think what most of us thought at the time was that it was sending a signal that Bernie Sanders was broadening his appeal, and that he was building a more diverse and more muscular political coalition than he had been able to demonstrate so far. Its also clear now that another message it sent to the rest of the Democratic Party was that Sanders was becoming a real freight train in this race. And that if you were going to stop him, you were going to need to do it real fast. So the moment where Sanders is riding high like that, I think hes kind of faced with a choice of either trying to more actively reassure the Democratic Party that they can trust him to be the nominee  and to make a more explicit case about his own electability and to address himself more clearly to moderate voters who have, you know, been beyond wary of his campaign, just terrified of the idea of nominating him. Or he can stick with the approach that got him there to begin with. And thats to run as this anti-establishment progressive populist who is taking on his own party in addition to taking on the Republican Party. And the question then I think is, which version are we going to hear over the coming week and the coming months from Bernie Sanders?\n\nmichael barbaro\n\nAnd what happens?\n\nalex burns\n\nThe day after he wins the Nevada caucuses, a 60 Minutes interview airs.\n\narchived recording (anderson cooper) Back in the 1980s, Sanders had some positive things to say about the former Soviet Union and the Sandinistas in Nicaragua. archived recording (bernie sanders) And everybody was totally convinced  archived recording (anderson cooper) Here he is explaining why the Cuban people didnt rise up and help the U.S. overthrow Cuban leader, Fidel Castro. archived recording (bernie sanders) He educated their kids, gave them health care \n\nalex burns\n\nThe piece of it that really pops out to a lot of Democrats is when Anderson Cooper asked Bernie Sanders about his past praise for the Castro regime in Cuba.\n\narchived recording (bernie sanders) Were very opposed to the authoritarian nature of Cuba. But its unfair to simply say, everything is bad. When Fidel Castro came into office, you know what he did? He had a massive literacy program. Is that a bad thing? Even though Fidel Castro \n\nalex burns\n\nAnd it just sends a shockwave through Democrats.\n\n[music]\n\narchived recording Bernie Sanders has the lead in total votes in delegates. But his comments he made Sunday night on 60 Minutes that are causing fresh panic for some Democrats. archived recording 1 Its absolutely inconceivable that any American as old as him, knowing everything we know about Fidel Castro and the people that hes murdered over the years, that anybody could support him in any way. archived recording 2 The blowback is emblematic of broader uncertainty about how nominating a self-described democratic socialist could impact Democrats chances in the general election. archived recording 3 I like Bernie. archived recording 4 How do you feel about him praising the Soviet Union and Fidel Castro? archived recording 5 Yeah, I dont like that part.\n\nalex burns\n\nSo to hear that from Sanders, and to hear him essentially be unapologetic about it, I think, was a real sign to people that if you thought this guy was going to start moving to the middle now, that is not happening.\n\narchived recording His response infuriated democratic lawmakers from South Florida, a key swing state where public support for the Castro regime is a nonstarter.\n\nalex burns\n\nMore specifically, and in a more localized, but really no less important way, this is terrifying to Democrats in Florida.\n\narchived recording (reporter) Freshman Congresswoman Debbie Mucarsel-Powell, she called Sanderss comment quote, absolutely unacceptable. archived recording (debbie mucarsel-powell) He made more than a mistake. Its what he believes. And its unacceptable to our community. archived recording (reporter) And Congresswoman Donna Shalala, who suggested that Sanders talk to her constituents before quote, singing the praises of a murderous tyrant, unquote.\n\nalex burns\n\nYou see just a unified, almost unified, wall of criticism of Sanders coming from Democrats in that state, saying, you are imperiling the general election in one of the biggest swing states on the map.\n\n[music]\n\nAfter the 60 Minutes interview, you then start to hear prominent national Democrats say something that many of them havent said so far, which is, we just cant nominate this guy.\n\narchived recording (jim clyburn) Let me thank all of you for joining us here this morning.\n\nalex burns\n\nAnd thats the point where you see Joe Biden get a major, major endorsement from Jim Clyburn, popular congressman from South Carolina, highest ranking African-American member of Congress.\n\narchived recording (jim clyburn) Well, I want the public to know that Im voting for Joe Biden. South Carolinans should be voting for Joe Biden. And heres why. I know Joe. We know Joe. But most importantly, Joe knows us. archived recording Thats right. Thats right. archived recording (jim clyburn) Thats important.\n\nalex burns\n\nSo we head into the South Carolina primary, which Joe Biden was always favored to win.\n\narchived recording NBC News is now projecting that former Vice President Joe Biden has won a decisive victory in the South Carolina Democratic primary.\n\nalex burns\n\nAnd he wins it by 30 points.\n\narchived recording And he has done so by a substantial margin, potentially changing the dynamics of a race dominated so far by Vermont Senator Bernie Sanders.\n\nalex burns\n\nThat is beyond what even the Biden campaign was expecting. Biden just coalesces the overwhelming majority of Democrats who are not for Bernie Sanders behind his campaign.\n\nmichael barbaro\n\nAnd so why in that moment did we not see Bidens win in South Carolina, which as you just said, was kind of mathematically quite significant as the beginning of a turning point kind of comeback?\n\nalex burns\n\nSo on the night of South Carolina, we can look at Bidens 30 point margin, and say, wow, that was impressive. And this guy is clearly more resilient than even some of his supporters, even some of his inner circle believed he was. What we didnt know is that the next day \n\narchived recording (pete buttigieg) So tonight, I am making the difficult decision to suspend my campaign for the presidency.\n\nalex burns\n\n Pete Buttigieg would drop out of the race.\n\narchived recording (pete buttigieg) I will no longer \n\nalex burns\n\nAnd then on Monday morning, Amy Klobuchar would drop out of the race.\n\narchived recording (amy klobuchar) Today, I am ending my campaign and endorsing Joe Biden for president. [CROWD CHEERING]\n\nalex burns\n\nAnd by the end of Monday \n\narchived recording (pete buttigieg) That Im delighted to endorse and support Joe Biden for president. [CROWD CHEERING]\n\nalex burns\n\n both of them would endorse Joe Biden.\n\narchived recording (beto o'rourke) I will be casting my ballot for Joe Biden. [CROWD CHEERING]\n\nalex burns\n\nAnd by the way, so would Beto ORourke, who dropped out of the race a couple of months ealier. We saw a transformation of voters preferences within this field at a speed that I dont think its an overstatement to call it totally unprecedented.\n\nmichael barbaro\n\nI want to understand this phenomenon. Let me just begin with those endorsements that you just described. Why did Buttigieg, did Klobuchar drop out and endorse him so quickly? Whats your understanding now of how that happened?\n\nalex burns\n\nThere are a couple of things going on here. Pete Buttigieg was on track to get totally waxed on Super Tuesday, which is just three days after South Carolina. So he is staring at the possibility of not just defeat and not just a setback, but something like political humiliation to go in a month from essentially winning Iowa  basically splitting the win with Bernie Sanders  to winning absolutely nothing on Super Tuesday. And so there is a logic of self-interest that says, maybe you should take your winnings and walk away from the table at this point. Amy Klobuchar faces a somewhat different situation because she does look like she will win her home state of Minnesota. But she is clear-eyed enough at that point to recognize theres really no path forward for her in the race beyond Super Tuesday. Beyond the self-interest, though, these are two of the candidates who have been the bluntest and most pointed all along about their concern for the implications of nominating Sanders. They have been talking about the idea of nominating Sanders as deeply, deeply politically risky. And there are people who can do the math for themselves and see that after Nevada and South Carolina, there are really only two candidates in this race who are putting up big numbers on the national level in the way that it would take to go the distance. And between those two candidates, theres no question about whether theyre closer to Biden or Sanders.\n\nmichael barbaro\n\nOK, so at this point, post-South Carolina and post-Super Tuesday, Biden is the front-runner. But theres a ton of primaries and delegates left. And still theoretically, time for a Sanders comeback, right?\n\nalex burns\n\nRight, and it turns out to be very much a theoretical exercise, the Sanders comeback. You see starting right after Super Tuesday, he points the way to the next round of primaries, most importantly, Michigan.\n\narchived recording Well, the Joementum continues. Former Vice President Biden swooping to victory overnight in a pivotal primary contest.\n\nalex burns\n\nSanders ends up totally flopping in Michigan. Its a blowout in the state.\n\narchived recording Biden sweeping every county in Michigan, Missouri and Mississippi. He also won Idaho. The wins giving him a commanding 160 delegate lead over Sanders.\n\nalex burns\n\nAnd what happens, essentially the night that Biden wins in Michigan and in a number of other important states, is that the campaign is essentially frozen in place by a force that hits the campaign and hits the entire country in a way that nobody could have anticipated. And of course, thats the coronavirus.\n\n[music]\n\nmichael barbaro\n\nWell be right back. Alex, how exactly does the coronavirus epidemic  eventually becomes a pandemic  how does that hurt Sanders and help Biden? Thats not entirely intuitive to me.\n\nalex burns\n\nWell, what it does is it essentially ends the active portion of the campaign. On the night of the March 10 primaries, both of them are supposed to hold election night events where they address a roaring crowd of supporters. Both of those events get canceled. There have been no campaign rallies since then. Bernie Sanders cannot hit the road and gather tens of thousands of people in stadiums and deliver a forceful plea to the Democratic Party to not go ahead and nominate Joe Biden. The window to make that argument has essentially closed. Whats also going on is that the terms of debate go from being about ideological differences and policy differences to the reality of a terrifying national crisis. And what we see consistently in public polling for months, and in exit polls taken around the March primaries, is that on the question of which candidate you trust to handle a major crisis, Joe Biden is overwhelmingly favored, not just over Bernie Sanders, but over every alternative that democratic voters had in the race.\n\nmichael barbaro\n\nSo in a sense, the coronavirus doesnt just freeze the campaign and freeze Joe Bidens advantages electorally, it amplifies them because many democratic voters see him as a crisis-style leader.\n\nalex burns\n\nExactly. Bidens biggest strengths from the beginning have involved his experience, and his perceived steadiness, and the fact that voters basically find him trustworthy, and reassuring.\n\nmichael barbaro\n\nWell, thats interesting because another way of thinking about this, and the impact that were seeing already on Americans from this pandemic  the health care shortcomings, the thin financial cushion on which so many Americans are living  thats the stuff that Bernie Sanders has been saying forever. So I could also imagine a version of this where the pandemic strengthens Sanderss candidacy, not weakens it.\n\nalex burns\n\nI think thats really, really sharply put. But I do think people are processing this differently than they would process, for instance, a crash just of the financial sector. That if you saw an economic collapse in which people felt like the government was racing to contain a contagion from the financial industry, and that their lives were basically safe, I suspect that we might be having a different political debate right now. And that you would see Bernie Sanders holding these enormous rallies and making exactly the case you just laid out. And I think that things are so turbulent and unpredictable right now that we cant totally rule out the possibility that maybe that happens at some point once people see the scale of economic damage and the kind of vividness that we certainly and unfortunately will. What we have right now, though, is people who are experiencing a terrifying disruption in their daily lives. Theyre experiencing it yes, as an economic crisis, but also as a public health crisis, and something that probably feels to a lot of people like a national security crisis. And while a lot of Sanderss themes and ideas about the economy will probably be a bigger part of the conversation in the coming months, I dont know that the country has reached that point yet.\n\nmichael barbaro\n\nSo I want to turn now to the practical question of how the rest of the Democratic primary unfolds. Because the situation were in hasnt just frozen the dynamics of the race, it also seems to have actually frozen the mechanics of the campaign. Which feels pretty tricky because people have to leave their homes and go vote in order for there to ever be a nominee. So how is that going to work?\n\nalex burns\n\nWell, the short answer is we still dont really know. Almost every day now, we hear from another state that is delaying its primary well into May or even into June. Now, some of the relevance of those changes is going to depend on what Bernie Sanders does next. If Sanders does stick around, and if Biden is not able to functionally unify the Democratic Party, with or without Bernie Sanderss support, then we could see this really weird long period of dormancy in the campaign followed by a sudden frenzy of activity again in the late spring when maybe the virus will be more under control, and maybe people will start voting again. Personally right now, I think that that is an unlikely scenario.\n\nmichael barbaro\n\nAlex, whats your understanding of how Bernie Sanders is thinking of the big and difficult question of how long to stay in the race if it doesnt really seem as a practical path to the nomination? Hes certainly hearing lots of calls to step aside in a moment of crisis, kind of let the party coalesce around a nominee and prepare itself for a general election.\n\nalex burns\n\nI think there are a couple things about the mindset of the Sanderss camp right now that are really worth emphasizing here. One is that this is a group that not that long ago thought that they were on, not a glide path, but a pretty convincing course to the nomination. And they saw it fall away with astonishing speed. So theres a level, I think, still of kind of shell shock, at feeling like they had this, or they were close to having this. And then it was yanked away from them. Thats a hard thing for a campaign, and especially, for a candidate to process. I think the conditions of the pandemic also make it harder for, well, anybody involved in the race at this point to think through, what is the right thing to do next? What we know about Bernie Sanders is that he cares a great deal about his agenda. And we also know that, as a personal matter, he likes Joe Biden. This is not the Sanders-Clinton rivalry. He doesnt feel that the party really conspired to kneecap him in this race in the way that he did, with some justification, in 2016. So what you see here is a candidate, Sanders, who I think understands what an underdog he is right now, and an opponent in Biden, who is a negotiator. And I think thats why youre seeing Biden make such explicit overtures to Sanders supporters.\n\narchived recording (joe biden) Tonight in keeping with the latest guidance from the CDC, Im speaking to you from my home in Wilmington, Delaware \n\nalex burns\n\nThat in the last two primary nights that well have for a while, he has in his election night remarks, addressed himself to Sanders supporters \n\narchived recording (joe biden) So let me say, especially to the young voters who have been inspired by Senator Sanders, I hear you. I know whats at stake. I know what we have to do.\n\nalex burns\n\n saying that he admires their enthusiasm and their ideas.\n\narchived recording (joe biden) Senator Sanders and his supporters have brought a remarkable passion and tenacity to all of these issues. And together they have shifted the fundamental conversation in this country.\n\nalex burns\n\nHe gave them credit for having fundamentally changed the framework of American politics. And he, specifically addressing young people, said \n\narchived recording (joe biden) Senator Sanders and I may disagree on tactics. But we share a common vision for the need to provide affordable health care for all Americans, reduce income inequity that has risen so drastically, to tackling the existential threat of our time, climate change.\n\nalex burns\n\n he understands the gravity of the challenges that they feel in their lives.

We just dont know what the conditions on the ground are going to be like in a couple of months, let alone in the general election.

The map just feels to me like its really up for grabs right now, because weve never conducted an election under these kinds of conditions.

And the question will become, once this crisis is over, what the general electorate views as the candidate of the crisis, who handled the crisis well and who would get us out of the crisis best.\n\nalex burns\n\nAnd is there a candidate they blame for the crisis? If people ultimately see the president as having let them down in this, that feels awfully hard to escape. As it is, we cant say that thats how the country is going to feel.

This is The Daily.\n\n[music]\n\nToday: Two weeks ago, the biggest story in the country was the Democratic presidential primary. Now, with the coronavirus, its been largely forgotten. Alex Burns on what happened when those two stories collided. Its Monday, March 23.\n\nmichael barbaro\n\nHello?\n\nalex burns\n\nHello, Michael.\n\nmichael barbaro\n\nHey. Its always nice to be heralded by a bing, you know?\n\nalex burns\n\nIs that not your usual entrance into halls and rooms?\n\nmichael barbaro\n\nUsually its trumpets. [LAUGHS] I feel like every day pretty much for two weeks, we would talk on the show. And then poof, we have this unplanned hiatus, and you go away. And so I kind of miss you a little bit.\n\nalex burns\n\n[LAUGHS] Its a particularly painful kind of social isolation, for me at least.\n\nmichael barbaro\n\nSo, bring us up to speed on the Democratic primary. How would you describe the current state of the race?\n\nalex burns\n\nWell, its pretty close to over at this point. Joe Biden has emerged as the overwhelming favorite to be the Democratic nominee. He clearly has a support from the majority of the party, wide lead in the delegate count. And Bernie Sanders has not conceded the race, but hes acknowledged that he is sort of reassessing his campaign. And thats often the first stage in the process of winding things down.\n\nmichael barbaro\n\nSo in effect, it feels like what you just described is more or less where we were a couple of weeks ago. But with the benefit of some hindsight and some reporting on your part, I wonder if you could tell us how exactly that happened, because I dont think weve properly accounted for the whiplash and the speed with which the Sanders campaign came kind of crashing down.\n\nalex burns\n\nNo, I dont think we have. And I think really, you have to rewind the tape almost exactly a month ago to what was the high point.\n\narchived recording (bernie sanders) And now, Im delighted to bring you some pretty good news. [CHEERING] I think all of you know, we won the popular vote in Iowa. [CHEERING] We won the New Hampshire primary. [CHEERING] And according to three networks in the A.P., we have now won the Nevada caucus! [CHEERING]\n\nalex burns\n\nHe wins the Nevada caucuses. And he wins them by just an enormous margin.\n\narchived recording (crowd) Bernie! Bernie! Bernie!\n\nalex burns\n\nHe crushes Joe Biden, Elizabeth Warren, Pete Buttigieg.\n\narchived recording (crowd) Bernie! Bernie! Bernie!\n\nalex burns\n\nHe wins young voters. He wins older voters. He wins folks who have participated in caucuses in the past and people who are participating for the first time. Its in Nevada, where we see him go from winning about a quarter of the vote to winning nearly half the vote.\n\narchived recording (bernie sanders) And no campaign has a grass-roots movement like we do, which is another reason why were going to win this election. [CROWD CHEERING]\n\nalex burns\n\nAnd that sends a really powerful signal across the Democratic Party.\n\nmichael barbaro\n\nAnd what does that signal?\n\nalex burns\n\nI think what most of us thought at the time was that it was sending a signal that Bernie Sanders was broadening his appeal, and that he was building a more diverse and more muscular political coalition than he had been able to demonstrate so far. Its also clear now that another message it sent to the rest of the Democratic Party was that Sanders was becoming a real freight train in this race. And that if you were going to stop him, you were going to need to do it real fast. So the moment where Sanders is riding high like that, I think hes kind of faced with a choice of either trying to more actively reassure the Democratic Party that they can trust him to be the nominee  and to make a more explicit case about his own electability and to address himself more clearly to moderate voters who have, you know, been beyond wary of his campaign, just terrified of the idea of nominating him. Or he can stick with the approach that got him there to begin with. And thats to run as this anti-establishment progressive populist who is taking on his own party in addition to taking on the Republican Party. And the question then I think is, which version are we going to hear over the coming week and the coming months from Bernie Sanders?\n\nmichael barbaro\n\nAnd what happens?\n\nalex burns\n\nThe day after he wins the Nevada caucuses, a 60 Minutes interview airs.\n\narchived recording (anderson cooper) Back in the 1980s, Sanders had some positive things to say about the former Soviet Union and the Sandinistas in Nicaragua. archived recording (bernie sanders) And everybody was totally convinced  archived recording (anderson cooper) Here he is explaining why the Cuban people didnt rise up and help the U.S. overthrow Cuban leader, Fidel Castro. archived recording (bernie sanders) He educated their kids, gave them health care \n\nalex burns\n\nThe piece of it that really pops out to a lot of Democrats is when Anderson Cooper asked Bernie Sanders about his past praise for the Castro regime in Cuba.\n\narchived recording (bernie sanders) Were very opposed to the authoritarian nature of Cuba. But its unfair to simply say, everything is bad. When Fidel Castro came into office, you know what he did? He had a massive literacy program. Is that a bad thing? Even though Fidel Castro \n\nalex burns\n\nAnd it just sends a shockwave through Democrats.\n\n[music]\n\narchived recording Bernie Sanders has the lead in total votes in delegates. But his comments he made Sunday night on 60 Minutes that are causing fresh panic for some Democrats. archived recording 1 Its absolutely inconceivable that any American as old as him, knowing everything we know about Fidel Castro and the people that hes murdered over the years, that anybody could support him in any way. archived recording 2 The blowback is emblematic of broader uncertainty about how nominating a self-described democratic socialist could impact Democrats chances in the general election. archived recording 3 I like Bernie. archived recording 4 How do you feel about him praising the Soviet Union and Fidel Castro? archived recording 5 Yeah, I dont like that part.\n\nalex burns\n\nSo to hear that from Sanders, and to hear him essentially be unapologetic about it, I think, was a real sign to people that if you thought this guy was going to start moving to the middle now, that is not happening.\n\narchived recording His response infuriated democratic lawmakers from South Florida, a key swing state where public support for the Castro regime is a nonstarter.\n\nalex burns\n\nMore specifically, and in a more localized, but really no less important way, this is terrifying to Democrats in Florida.\n\narchived recording (reporter) Freshman Congresswoman Debbie Mucarsel-Powell, she called Sanderss comment quote, absolutely unacceptable. archived recording (debbie mucarsel-powell) He made more than a mistake. Its what he believes. And its unacceptable to our community. archived recording (reporter) And Congresswoman Donna Shalala, who suggested that Sanders talk to her constituents before quote, singing the praises of a murderous tyrant, unquote.\n\nalex burns\n\nYou see just a unified, almost unified, wall of criticism of Sanders coming from Democrats in that state, saying, you are imperiling the general election in one of the biggest swing states on the map.\n\n[music]\n\nAfter the 60 Minutes interview, you then start to hear prominent national Democrats say something that many of them havent said so far, which is, we just cant nominate this guy.\n\narchived recording (jim clyburn) Let me thank all of you for joining us here this morning.\n\nalex burns\n\nAnd thats the point where you see Joe Biden get a major, major endorsement from Jim Clyburn, popular congressman from South Carolina, highest ranking African-American member of Congress.\n\narchived recording (jim clyburn) Well, I want the public to know that Im voting for Joe Biden. South Carolinans should be voting for Joe Biden. And heres why. I know Joe. We know Joe. But most importantly, Joe knows us. archived recording Thats right. Thats right. archived recording (jim clyburn) Thats important.\n\nalex burns\n\nSo we head into the South Carolina primary, which Joe Biden was always favored to win.\n\narchived recording NBC News is now projecting that former Vice President Joe Biden has won a decisive victory in the South Carolina Democratic primary.\n\nalex burns\n\nAnd he wins it by 30 points.\n\narchived recording And he has done so by a substantial margin, potentially changing the dynamics of a race dominated so far by Vermont Senator Bernie Sanders.\n\nalex burns\n\nThat is beyond what even the Biden campaign was expecting. Biden just coalesces the overwhelming majority of Democrats who are not for Bernie Sanders behind his campaign.\n\nmichael barbaro\n\nAnd so why in that moment did we not see Bidens win in South Carolina, which as you just said, was kind of mathematically quite significant as the beginning of a turning point kind of comeback?\n\nalex burns\n\nSo on the night of South Carolina, we can look at Bidens 30 point margin, and say, wow, that was impressive. And this guy is clearly more resilient than even some of his supporters, even some of his inner circle believed he was. What we didnt know is that the next day \n\narchived recording (pete buttigieg) So tonight, I am making the difficult decision to suspend my campaign for the presidency.\n\nalex burns\n\n Pete Buttigieg would drop out of the race.\n\narchived recording (pete buttigieg) I will no longer \n\nalex burns\n\nAnd then on Monday morning, Amy Klobuchar would drop out of the race.\n\narchived recording (amy klobuchar) Today, I am ending my campaign and endorsing Joe Biden for president. [CROWD CHEERING]\n\nalex burns\n\nAnd by the end of Monday \n\narchived recording (pete buttigieg) That Im delighted to endorse and support Joe Biden for president. [CROWD CHEERING]\n\nalex burns\n\n both of them would endorse Joe Biden.\n\narchived recording (beto o'rourke) I will be casting my ballot for Joe Biden. [CROWD CHEERING]\n\nalex burns\n\nAnd by the way, so would Beto ORourke, who dropped out of the race a couple of months ealier. We saw a transformation of voters preferences within this field at a speed that I dont think its an overstatement to call it totally unprecedented.\n\nmichael barbaro\n\nI want to understand this phenomenon. Let me just begin with those endorsements that you just described. Why did Buttigieg, did Klobuchar drop out and endorse him so quickly? Whats your understanding now of how that happened?\n\nalex burns\n\nThere are a couple of things going on here. Pete Buttigieg was on track to get totally waxed on Super Tuesday, which is just three days after South Carolina. So he is staring at the possibility of not just defeat and not just a setback, but something like political humiliation to go in a month from essentially winning Iowa  basically splitting the win with Bernie Sanders  to winning absolutely nothing on Super Tuesday. And so there is a logic of self-interest that says, maybe you should take your winnings and walk away from the table at this point. Amy Klobuchar faces a somewhat different situation because she does look like she will win her home state of Minnesota. But she is clear-eyed enough at that point to recognize theres really no path forward for her in the race beyond Super Tuesday. Beyond the self-interest, though, these are two of the candidates who have been the bluntest and most pointed all along about their concern for the implications of nominating Sanders. They have been talking about the idea of nominating Sanders as deeply, deeply politically risky. And there are people who can do the math for themselves and see that after Nevada and South Carolina, there are really only two candidates in this race who are putting up big numbers on the national level in the way that it would take to go the distance. And between those two candidates, theres no question about whether theyre closer to Biden or Sanders.\n\nmichael barbaro\n\nOK, so at this point, post-South Carolina and post-Super Tuesday, Biden is the front-runner. But theres a ton of primaries and delegates left. And still theoretically, time for a Sanders comeback, right?\n\nalex burns\n\nRight, and it turns out to be very much a theoretical exercise, the Sanders comeback. You see starting right after Super Tuesday, he points the way to the next round of primaries, most importantly, Michigan.\n\narchived recording Well, the Joementum continues. Former Vice President Biden swooping to victory overnight in a pivotal primary contest.\n\nalex burns\n\nSanders ends up totally flopping in Michigan. Its a blowout in the state.\n\narchived recording Biden sweeping every county in Michigan, Missouri and Mississippi. He also won Idaho. The wins giving him a commanding 160 delegate lead over Sanders.\n\nalex burns\n\nAnd what happens, essentially the night that Biden wins in Michigan and in a number of other important states, is that the campaign is essentially frozen in place by a force that hits the campaign and hits the entire country in a way that nobody could have anticipated. And of course, thats the coronavirus.\n\n[music]\n\nmichael barbaro\n\nWell be right back. Alex, how exactly does the coronavirus epidemic  eventually becomes a pandemic  how does that hurt Sanders and help Biden? Thats not entirely intuitive to me.\n\nalex burns\n\nWell, what it does is it essentially ends the active portion of the campaign. On the night of the March 10 primaries, both of them are supposed to hold election night events where they address a roaring crowd of supporters. Both of those events get canceled. There have been no campaign rallies since then. Bernie Sanders cannot hit the road and gather tens of thousands of people in stadiums and deliver a forceful plea to the Democratic Party to not go ahead and nominate Joe Biden. The window to make that argument has essentially closed. Whats also going on is that the terms of debate go from being about ideological differences and policy differences to the reality of a terrifying national crisis. And what we see consistently in public polling for months, and in exit polls taken around the March primaries, is that on the question of which candidate you trust to handle a major crisis, Joe Biden is overwhelmingly favored, not just over Bernie Sanders, but over every alternative that democratic voters had in the race.\n\nmichael barbaro\n\nSo in a sense, the coronavirus doesnt just freeze the campaign and freeze Joe Bidens advantages electorally, it amplifies them because many democratic voters see him as a crisis-style leader.\n\nalex burns\n\nExactly. Bidens biggest strengths from the beginning have involved his experience, and his perceived steadiness, and the fact that voters basically find him trustworthy, and reassuring.\n\nmichael barbaro\n\nWell, thats interesting because another way of thinking about this, and the impact that were seeing already on Americans from this pandemic  the health care shortcomings, the thin financial cushion on which so many Americans are living  thats the stuff that Bernie Sanders has been saying forever. So I could also imagine a version of this where the pandemic strengthens Sanderss candidacy, not weakens it.\n\nalex burns\n\nI think thats really, really sharply put. But I do think people are processing this differently than they would process, for instance, a crash just of the financial sector. That if you saw an economic collapse in which people felt like the government was racing to contain a contagion from the financial industry, and that their lives were basically safe, I suspect that we might be having a different political debate right now. And that you would see Bernie Sanders holding these enormous rallies and making exactly the case you just laid out. And I think that things are so turbulent and unpredictable right now that we cant totally rule out the possibility that maybe that happens at some point once people see the scale of economic damage and the kind of vividness that we certainly and unfortunately will. What we have right now, though, is people who are experiencing a terrifying disruption in their daily lives. Theyre experiencing it yes, as an economic crisis, but also as a public health crisis, and something that probably feels to a lot of people like a national security crisis. And while a lot of Sanderss themes and ideas about the economy will probably be a bigger part of the conversation in the coming months, I dont know that the country has reached that point yet.\n\nmichael barbaro\n\nSo I want to turn now to the practical question of how the rest of the Democratic primary unfolds. Because the situation were in hasnt just frozen the dynamics of the race, it also seems to have actually frozen the mechanics of the campaign. Which feels pretty tricky because people have to leave their homes and go vote in order for there to ever be a nominee. So how is that going to work?\n\nalex burns\n\nWell, the short answer is we still dont really know. Almost every day now, we hear from another state that is delaying its primary well into May or even into June. Now, some of the relevance of those changes is going to depend on what Bernie Sanders does next. If Sanders does stick around, and if Biden is not able to functionally unify the Democratic Party, with or without Bernie Sanderss support, then we could see this really weird long period of dormancy in the campaign followed by a sudden frenzy of activity again in the late spring when maybe the virus will be more under control, and maybe people will start voting again. Personally right now, I think that that is an unlikely scenario.\n\nmichael barbaro\n\nAlex, whats your understanding of how Bernie Sanders is thinking of the big and difficult question of how long to stay in the race if it doesnt really seem as a practical path to the nomination? Hes certainly hearing lots of calls to step aside in a moment of crisis, kind of let the party coalesce around a nominee and prepare itself for a general election.\n\nalex burns\n\nI think there are a couple things about the mindset of the Sanderss camp right now that are really worth emphasizing here. One is that this is a group that not that long ago thought that they were on, not a glide path, but a pretty convincing course to the nomination. And they saw it fall away with astonishing speed. So theres a level, I think, still of kind of shell shock, at feeling like they had this, or they were close to having this. And then it was yanked away from them. Thats a hard thing for a campaign, and especially, for a candidate to process. I think the conditions of the pandemic also make it harder for, well, anybody involved in the race at this point to think through, what is the right thing to do next? What we know about Bernie Sanders is that he cares a great deal about his agenda. And we also know that, as a personal matter, he likes Joe Biden. This is not the Sanders-Clinton rivalry. He doesnt feel that the party really conspired to kneecap him in this race in the way that he did, with some justification, in 2016. So what you see here is a candidate, Sanders, who I think understands what an underdog he is right now, and an opponent in Biden, who is a negotiator. And I think thats why youre seeing Biden make such explicit overtures to Sanders supporters.\n\narchived recording (joe biden) Tonight in keeping with the latest guidance from the CDC, Im speaking to you from my home in Wilmington, Delaware \n\nalex burns\n\nThat in the last two primary nights that well have for a while, he has in his election night remarks, addressed himself to Sanders supporters \n\narchived recording (joe biden) So let me say, especially to the young voters who have been inspired by Senator Sanders, I hear you. I know whats at stake. I know what we have to do.\n\nalex burns\n\n saying that he admires their enthusiasm and their ideas.\n\narchived recording (joe biden) Senator Sanders and his supporters have brought a remarkable passion and tenacity to all of these issues. And together they have shifted the fundamental conversation in this country.\n\nalex burns\n\nHe gave them credit for having fundamentally changed the framework of American politics. And he, specifically addressing young people, said \n\narchived recording (joe biden) Senator Sanders and I may disagree on tactics. But we share a common vision for the need to provide affordable health care for all Americans, reduce income inequity that has risen so drastically, to tackling the existential threat of our time, climate change.\n\nalex burns\n\n he understands the gravity of the challenges that they feel in their lives. When Biden takes those steps, its a clear signal that hes trying to show Bernie Sanders that he has respect for the movement that hes built.\n\narchived recording (joe biden) We have to step up and care for one another. Thank you all. Thank you all for listening.\n\nmichael barbaro\n\nFinally, Alex, if Joe Biden is becoming a kind of de facto nominee over the next few weeks during this dormancy in the campaign, and if it starts to feel like a general election is getting underway between Biden and President Trump, I wonder what this really unique set of circumstances  which has meant so much for the Democratic primary  is going to mean for Bidens potential challenger, the sitting president, Donald Trump.\n\nalex burns\n\nWe know that the president is not going to be able to run for re-election on a message that happy days are here again, and there is nothing but prosperity as far as we can see.

He would be 78 at inauguration, might not seek a second term should he win, and would be trying to rebuild the country in the wake of a pandemic  factors that make it less likely that he would select someone who offers strong political assets but a relatively thin rsum.'

First, Take a Look at How It Works'	true	[]		trusted	[]	https://www.nytimes.com/2020/06/23/upshot/poll-2020-election-method.html	https://www.nytimes.com/	b'The final Times/Siena polls, in Florida and North Carolina, had the president ahead or tied over the last 10 days of the race. Only one other live-interview pollster (the highly regarded Ann Selzer poll) found Mr. Trump leading in top-tier battleground states over the final stretch. Other surveys showing President Trump ahead appeared to do so because they did not contact voters via cellphone, and as a consequence would have tended to lean toward the G.O.P.\n\nOther high-quality polls also performed solidly in 2016. Most national polls, for instance, fared very well, including the final New York Times/CBS News survey that had Hillary Clinton ahead by three points nationwide, less than a percentage point from her final popular vote margin.\n\nWhen we analyzed our data after the election, we assessed that we were right for the right reasons, like showing Mr. Trump with a wide lead among white working-class voters, and that there were opportunities to refine our approach. We reached a different conclusion than you might expect: If we could go back, we would have wanted more of our own polling in 2016, not less.\n\nIn 2018, we conducted a greater number of political surveys. We had an average error of around three points over nearly 50 polls of House races over the final three weeks, with virtually no bias toward either party. Over the final 10 days, the average error was just over two points. Out of more than 400 pollsters, the Times/Siena poll is one of six to earn an A-plus rating from FiveThirtyEight.\n\nWhy do you think these polls are good?\n\nThere are three major advantages that we think help explain our track record and offer cause for confidence:\n\nPartisanship. Perhaps our most important advantage over even other high-quality pollsters is that we can adjust for the partisan makeup of the electorate, using data available on voter registration files. For instance, we can make sure we have the right number of registered Republicans or Democrats, the right number of people who voted in the 2020 Democratic primary, the right number of precincts that voted heavily for Mr. Trump. This works best in states with party registration, like Pennsylvania or Florida, and is harder in the states without it, like Wisconsin or Michigan, but even in the worst cases its a lot better than nothing. This is possible only because we start our poll with a voter registration file (not all pollsters do). It doesnt ensure our results are perfect (and a poll can still be top-notch without this step), but it gives us extra confidence that were not fundamentally missing Democrats or Republicans, who may at times become more or less likely to respond to surveys. And we go even further: We complete not just the right number of interviews with Democrats and Republicans, but also the right number by race and region. So, for instance, we have the right number of Hispanic registered Republicans in Miami-Dade County. To our knowledge, thats an assurance that no other public pollster can make.\n\nEducation. Our samples are adjusted to properly represent voters without a college degree, based on census data. Many state pollsters still dont adjust their samples by education, and this is considered one of the major reasons that state polls overestimated Mrs. Clintons standing in 2016.\n\nContacting hard-to-reach groups. We spend a lot of money to complete interviews with groups that all pollsters struggle to reach: low-turnout voters like younger people or Hispanics. These groups are always important, but properly representing low-turnout voters  especially low-turnout registered Democrats, who are often surprisingly favorable to Mr. Trump  was an essential part of why our polls were closer to the mark than most other polls in our postelection analysis of 2016 surveys.\n\nDoes anyone pick up the phone anymore?\n\nSome people do. Just not many. We usually complete interviews with about 1 or 2 percent of the voters we try to reach. Low response rates undoubtedly pose a serious challenge to survey research, and there are some known response biases. For instance, people who take telephone surveys are likelier to volunteer in their community than demographically similar individuals who do not take telephone surveys. But for now, it does not appear that the people who take telephone surveys are vastly different politically from those who do not, after accounting for their demographic characteristics.\n\nWhy not online?\n\nOnline polling is almost certainly the future of polling and, in many ways, its also the present. There are some online polls that are fairly or even favorably comparable to many telephone surveys. But as a whole, online polls continue to have a weaker track record in election polling than telephone polls, and real challenges remain.'	b'Second-Guessing Our Poll?

Omar quickly apologized on Twitter, but President Trump still went on to call for her resignation. What she said is so deep-seated in her heart that her lame apology, thats what it was, it was lame, and she didnt mean a word of it, was just not appropriate.

We have a 17-year history of Steve King and racist remarks, and there was absolute silence on the Republican side of the aisle until recently. So why the double standard?

Mr. Trump has stoked the flames with references to deep state and retweets of Qanon adherents. Q signs have appeared at rallies for Mr. Trump, and believers have been arrested in a series of troubling episodes, including an armed standoff near the Hoover Dam.\n\nThose actions have raised growing fears that delusional theories about a covert battle for global control could lead to more violence. Last May, the F.B.I. included QAnon in an intelligence bulletin that warned of potential violence stemming from fringe political conspiracy theories. But pushback against the conspiracy theory has been met with yet further theories of a growing plot.\n\nI believe that that was some of the deep state actors in the F.B.I. trying to put out disinformation, said Ms. Perkins, an insurance agent who had previously lost primary campaigns for seats in Congress in 2018, 2016 and 2014. She has promoted other issues in her campaign, including expanding the wall at the border with Mexico and restricting the size of the federal government.'

Now the Republicans will have little to no advantage at all.\n\nDemocrats couldnt have asked for much more from the new map. Its arguably even better for them than the maps they proposed themselves. Over all, a half-dozen competitive Republican-held congressional districts move to the left, endangering several incumbent Republicans, one of whom may now be all but doomed to defeat, and improving Democratic standing in two open races.\n\nBased on recent election results, the new congressional map comes very close to achieving partisan balance.\n\nCurrent\n\nmap New\n\nmap 2016 presidential election Districts won 6 12 8 10 Median vote Trump +9 Trump +6 Efficiency gap +14 Rep. +3 Rep. 2012 presidential election Districts won 5 13 9 9 Median vote Romney +5 Romney +1 Efficiency gap +21 Rep. +3 Rep. *Figures are rounded\n\nIn general, partisan balance is not usually a goal when redistricting. You could certainly argue that partisan balance and maximizing the number of competitive districts should be among the criteria, but, in general, they are not. Instead, a nonpartisan map usually means a partisan-blind map. It strives for compact districts that respect communities of interest, with little regard for the partisan outcome.\n\nA decision to pursue partisan balance in Pennsylvania would be particularly significant because Democrats are at a clear geographic disadvantage. They waste a lopsided number of votes in heavily Democratic Philadelphia and Pittsburgh; the Republicans dont waste as many votes in their best areas, and so the rest of the state (and therefore its districts) leans Republican. As a result, a partisan-blind map will tend to favor the Republicans by a notable amount.\n\nThe new Pennsylvania map released Monday meets every standard nonpartisan criteria. Its compact, minimizes county or municipal splits and preserves communities of interest. But it consistently makes subtle choices that suggest that partisan balance may have been an important consideration.\n\nThe courts apparent prioritization of partisan balance is something of a surprise, since the courts order didnt specify that partisan balance was an objective for the new map. If true, it would help explain why the map is even more favorable to the Democrats than the plans that Democrats submitted themselves. Republicans in the State Legislature will probably be deeply upset and could try to challenge the new maps in federal court.\n\nOn the other hand, the new map is quite fair if its judged based on the relationship between seats won and the statewide popular vote. By that measure, it may still tilt slightly to the Republicans. If you value partisan fairness, you can cheer the result. If you think maps should be partisan-blind, you can argue that the map was drawn to the advantage of Democrats.\n\nHeres how it shook out, district by district.\n\nCurrent District 7 New District 5 Current District Clinton +2 New district Clinton +28 Vote margin Dem. 15 30 Rep. 15 30 Other 15 30\n\nThe old moose-and-antlers-like Seventh District might have been the most gerrymandered district in the nation. Now not even the most imaginative child could come up with something other than cloud if the new Fifth drifted by in the sky.\n\nThe new Fifth might ultimately prove to be as glamorous as its predecessor, albeit in a very different career as an exemplar for nonpartisan redistricting. Its compact and follows jurisdictional lines. It includes all of Delaware County. It represents a natural political community: the Philadelphia suburbs.\n\nThis is now a safely Democratic district. Hillary Clinton won the new Seventh by nearly 30 points, and it's hard to imagine a Republican winning these well-educated and diverse suburbs in anything like this political environment.\n\nThis would have been a huge loss to Republicans a year ago. Now, its less painful. Democrats were probably favored to win the prior iteration of this district anyway, since it narrowly voted for Mrs. Clinton and the incumbent, Patrick Meehan, announced last month that he wouldnt seek re-election.\n\nCurrent District 15 New District 7 Current District Trump +8 New district Clinton +1 Vote margin Dem. 15 30 Rep. 15 30 Other 15 30\n\nThe old 15th District wasnt as easily caricatured as the old Seventh. But the old crayfish-like 15th was just about as likely to receive a makeover to the advantage of the Democrats.\n\nThe previous map split the Lehigh Valley, a Democratic-tilting urban area that naturally anchors a congressional district, and added a long, deeply Republican tail to the west. Together, it was enough to make a safe district for Charlie Dent, a moderate Republican who never faced a serious contest.\n\nNow Republicans are probably underdogs to hold the new Seventh. Mr. Dent retired last September, and the new district is considerably more Democratic without its tail. The Lehigh Valley is united, the crawdad tail amputated and replaced by diverse, Democratic-leaning parts of southern Monroe County.\n\nThe decision to push the new Seventh into Monroe, rather than heavily Republican Carbon County, was a highly favorable choice for the Democrats. Its the difference between making this a Clinton district and a Trump district.\n\nIts a perfectly defensible choice. But as youll see, thats a choice that gets made over and over again  and part of why it seems reasonable to argue that this map was drawn with statewide partisan balance in mind.\n\nCurrent District 6 New District 6 Current District Clinton +1 New district Clinton +9 Vote margin Dem. 15 30 Rep. 15 30 Other 15 30\n\nIf any single district was poised to determine whether the new congressional map was considered good or bad for Republicans or Democrats, it was probably the Sixth.\n\nIt is not the states most famous gerrymander. And since it already narrowly voted for Mrs. Clinton, it wouldn't seem like the most important question looming over an effort to undo a Republican partisan gerrymander.\n\nBut the Sixth poses a challenge for any map drawer. And unlike the Seventh or the 15th, which were bound to lurch toward the left, the Sixth could have evolved to the advantage of either party.\n\nThe issue is simple: The five core counties of the Philadelphia suburbs contain enough people for 5.7 congressional districts. The first five are easy enough, but the Sixth, which would presumably include the final seven-tenths of a district from the Philadelphia area and then three-tenths from somewhere else, is hard to draw. Alone, none of the adjacent counties combine with the outermost Philadelphia suburbs to create a natural district that represents a community of interest.\n\nMore important, the population at the periphery of the Philadelphia metropolitan area is politically diverse. Theres heavily conservative Amish Country, the working-class Democratic town of Reading and potentially the Democratic town of Lancaster. Depending on which areas are added, the result could be a strongly Republican or strongly Democratic district.\n\nNo option is obviously superior to another, and so the demonstration maps proposed by Pennsylvania's Republicans and Democrats produced highly divergent partisan outcomes from fundamentally similar districts.\n\nIn the end, the new Pennsylvania map takes the Democratic-leaning route into Berks County and toward the heavily Democratic town of Reading. The result is a district that voted for Mrs. Clinton by nine points. It is fair to say that the incumbent representative, Ryan Costello, is in very serious trouble, and one wonders whether he will even be inclined to seek re-election.\n\nCurrent District 16 New District 11 Current District Trump +7 New district Trump +26 Vote margin Dem. 15 30 Rep. 15 30 Other 15 30\n\nThe flip side of Pennsylvanias Sixth is the 16th. It sits just west of the Philadelphia suburbs in Lancaster County, and whatever didn't fall into the new Sixth was likely to end up in the old 16th. A more Democratic Sixth, for instance, would therefore yield a more Republican 16th and vice versa.\n\nThe district is naturally Republican; Lancaster County has voted Republican in all but one presidential election since 1860. But the current district is relatively competitive, since it stretches out to relieve other suburban Republicans of relatively Democratic parts of Chester and Berks Counties. The incumbent Republican, the first-term representative Lloyd Smucker, was potentially somewhat vulnerable on the current map.\n\nWithout the burden of helping out his Republican colleagues, Mr. Smuckers new 11th District moves to the right on the new map.\n\nMore surprising than the territory it gave up, though, is the territory it added: the heavily conservative countryside in York County. The formation of this deeply conservative district is a defensible choice but, again, one that works to the advantage of the Democrats by creating a Republican vote-sink. It winds up making it a lot harder for the Republican Scott Perry, who represents our next district.\n\nCurrent District 4 New District 10 Current District Trump +21 New district Trump +9 Vote margin Dem. 15 30 Rep. 15 30 Other 15 30\n\nPerhaps no Republican will be more surprised by the new map than Mr. Perry, an incumbent from safely conservative York County. Most of the demonstration maps kept him in a safely Republican district. But now his territory in northern York County has been added to the competitive Harrisburg area.\n\nThe result is a somewhat competitive district: The new 10th voted for Mr. Trump by nine points and for Mitt Romney by seven points in 2012. Given how much new territory hell have to represent, its possible Mr. Perry will have a tough race. Theres also an outside possibility hell choose to run against Mr. Smucker in the 16th, which would set up a tough primary race there and also open up the 10th to the Democrats.\n\nCurrent District 8 New District 1 Current District Even New district Clinton +2 Vote margin Dem. 15 30 Rep. 15 30 Other 15 30\n\nIf Pennsylvanias Seventh was the battleground district that was most obviously going to change, Pennsylvania's Eighth was the battleground likeliest to stay about the same.\n\nThe old Eighth District is so reasonable-looking that it almost appeared out of place on the map. It includes all of Bucks County, then juts across the Montgomery County line to get the additional 80,000 people it needs for population equality.\n\nDemocrats complain that those 80,000 people lean Republican, enough to flip Democratic-tilting Bucks County to a district that barely voted for Mr. Trump and Mr. Romney. But its a minor inconvenience at worst compared with the burden Democrats face elsewhere in the state.\n\nThe new First District preserves the core of Pennsylvanias Eighth and keeps Bucks County intact. But it now adds more Democratic territory from central Montgomery County, so going by 2016 results, its now a Clinton-leaning district instead of a Trump-leaning one.\n\nOver all, its a small but potentially significant change in such a competitive district. The Republican incumbent, the freshman Brian Fitzpatrick, is likely to face a competitive race. Its the sort of race that could be decided by the subtle shift ordered Monday.\n\nCurrent District 18 New District 14 Current District Trump +20 New district Trump +29 Vote margin Dem. 15 30 Rep. 15 30 Other 15 30\n\nPennsylvanias 18th would have been an afterthought a few months ago. Its a heavily Republican district now, and it would have been under just about any new map.\n\nBut the districts precise alignment became a lot more significant with the Republican Rick Saccone and the Democrat Conor Lamb locked in a competitive race for a special congressional election here next month.\n\nThe biggest question: whether the district would include much of southern Allegheny County, where Mr. Lamb resides along with many of the districts Democratic-leaning voters. Without Allegheny County, a Lamb win in March might not mean much for November. He might live far from the new district, and it would be more conservative for good measure.\n\nIn the end, thats exactly what happened. Mr. Lamb has been drawn out of the new 14th, the most natural successor to the 18th. The district has also moved to the right, and voted for Mr. Trump by 29 points. On the other hand, the district has added traditionally Democratic Fayette County, and its potentially competitive. There were single-digit races here for state treasurer and auditor in 2016.\n\nThe good news for Mr. Lamb, though, is that he now lives in the new 17th District, and that might be an even better opportunity for him than the old 18th.\n\nCurrent District 12 New District 17 Current District Trump +21 New district Trump +3 Vote margin Dem. 15 30 Rep. 15 30 Other 15 30\n\nMr. Lamb wouldnt have enjoyed running in the deeply conservative, hammer-like 12th District. It certainly dealt a big blow to Democrats; before redistricting, the area was represented by two Democrats.\n\nThe new map creates a highly competitive district consolidated entirely within the suburbs west of Pittsburgh. It voted for Mr. Trump by just 2.5 points in 2016 and voted for Democrats in downballot races that year.\n\nThis is probably a better district for Democrats than they would have hoped for. Other versions of this district might have comfortably voted for Mr. Trump, but the district scoops up several Democratic-leaning suburbs, including Mr. Lambs hometown, and avoids more Republican suburbs due north of Pittsburgh.\n\nKeith Rothfus, the Republican incumbent, will now find himself in a very difficult race.\n\nCurrent District 17 New District 8 Current District Trump +10 New district Trump +10 Vote margin Dem. 15 30 Rep. 15 30 Other 15 30\n\nThe octopus-like 17th District was one of Pennsylvanias least aesthetically pleasing congressional districts. The new 17th looks significantly different, but it might not wind up voting differently at all.\n\nThe current 17th looks like an octopus thanks to the quirk of the Democrat Tim Holdens winning re-election in 2010. He was the only Democrat from northeast Pennsylvania to survive the Republican sweep that year, but he represented a conservative area (his previous district included the octopus's conservative body). The result was that his district was never a true Democratic vote-sink, even after Republicans joined his conservative home county with tentacles stretching to far-flung Democratic urban areas.\n\nThe new district trades out the conservative body of the octopus for similarly conservative territory closer to the districts urban core in Scranton, resulting in no real shift in the overall partisan makeup of the district.\n\nOn the prior map, the Democratic representative Matt Cartwright was favored to win re-election. Theres some chance that swapping out familiar for unfamiliar conservative territory will dim his re-election prospects, but in this political environment he remains a favorite.\n\nCurrent District 1 New District 2 Current District Clinton +61 New district Clinton +48 Vote margin Dem. 15 30 Rep. 15 30 Other 15 30\n\nPennsylvanias Second is entirely within the city of Philadelphia, which is only significant because it now includes the northeast Philadelphia residence of the Democratic representative Brendan Boyle.\n\nThis isnt as big a problem for Democrats as it would have been a few months ago, since Representative Robert Brady chose not to seek re-election. If he had run, it might have set up a primary between Mr. Boyle and Mr. Brady, but as things are, Mr. Boyle will probably run for this seat.\n\nCurrent District 13 New District 4 Current District Clinton +34 New district Clinton +19 Vote margin Dem. 15 30 Rep. 15 30 Other 15 30\n\nIf Mr. Boyle does run for the Philadelphia-based Second District, the Montgomery County-based Fourth District will most likely be an open contest (Mr. Boyles old 13th District included much of Montgomery County, along with northeastern Philadelphia). Democrats will be heavily favored to hold this seat in 2018, but in other political conditions it could be somewhat competitive.\n\nCurrent District 2 New District 3 Current District Clinton +83 New district Clinton +84 Vote margin Dem. 15 30 Rep. 15 30 Other 15 30\n\nThe new Third District, which includes much of Philadelphia, will be one of the most Democratic districts in the country.\n\nCurrent District 3 New District 16 Current District Trump +26 New district Trump +20 Vote margin Dem. 15 30 Rep. 15 30 Other 15 30\n\nPennsylvanias Third was bound to move at least somewhat to the left once traditionally Democratic Erie County was reunified, but whether it would become a true battleground district hinged on the fate of the Pittsburgh suburbs.\n\nIn the end, most of the Democratic-leaning areas northwest of Pittsburgh were piled into the old 12th, leaving more conservative areas to the Republican Mike Kelly, who will most likely survive this somewhat more Democratic district.\n\nCurrent District 5 New District 15 Current District Trump +29 New district Trump +43 Vote margin Dem. 15 30 Rep. 15 30 Other 15 30\n\nThe Republican Glenn Thompsons district was already safely Republican, but it will be even safer now that it is not assisting Mr. Kelly by splitting Erie County.\n\nCurrent District 9 New District 13 Current District Trump +43 New district Trump +46 Vote margin Dem. 15 30 Rep. 15 30 Other 15 30\n\nThe new 13th will remain safely Republican.\n\nCurrent District 10 New District 12 Current District Trump +36 New district Trump +36 Vote margin Dem. 15 30 Rep. 15 30 Other 15 30\n\nThe new 12th adds State College (home to Penn State), but it gives up Democratic-leaning parts of northeastern Pennsylvania.

There were single-digit races here for state treasurer and auditor in 2016.\n\nThe good news for Mr. Lamb, though, is that he now lives in the new 17th District, and that might be an even better opportunity for him than the old 18th.\n\nCurrent District 12 New District 17 Current District Trump +21 New district Trump +3 Vote margin Dem. 15 30 Rep. 15 30 Other 15 30\n\nMr. Lamb wouldnt have enjoyed running in the deeply conservative, hammer-like 12th District. It certainly dealt a big blow to Democrats; before redistricting, the area was represented by two Democrats.\n\nThe new map creates a highly competitive district consolidated entirely within the suburbs west of Pittsburgh. It voted for Mr. Trump by just 2.5 points in 2016 and voted for Democrats in downballot races that year.\n\nThis is probably a better district for Democrats than they would have hoped for. Other versions of this district might have comfortably voted for Mr. Trump, but the district scoops up several Democratic-leaning suburbs, including Mr. Lambs hometown, and avoids more Republican suburbs due north of Pittsburgh.\n\nKeith Rothfus, the Republican incumbent, will now find himself in a very difficult race.\n\nCurrent District 17 New District 8 Current District Trump +10 New district Trump +10 Vote margin Dem. 15 30 Rep. 15 30 Other 15 30\n\nThe octopus-like 17th District was one of Pennsylvanias least aesthetically pleasing congressional districts. The new 17th looks significantly different, but it might not wind up voting differently at all.\n\nThe current 17th looks like an octopus thanks to the quirk of the Democrat Tim Holdens winning re-election in 2010. He was the only Democrat from northeast Pennsylvania to survive the Republican sweep that year, but he represented a conservative area (his previous district included the octopus's conservative body). The result was that his district was never a true Democratic vote-sink, even after Republicans joined his conservative home county with tentacles stretching to far-flung Democratic urban areas.\n\nThe new district trades out the conservative body of the octopus for similarly conservative territory closer to the districts urban core in Scranton, resulting in no real shift in the overall partisan makeup of the district.\n\nOn the prior map, the Democratic representative Matt Cartwright was favored to win re-election. Theres some chance that swapping out familiar for unfamiliar conservative territory will dim his re-election prospects, but in this political environment he remains a favorite.\n\nCurrent District 1 New District 2 Current District Clinton +61 New district Clinton +48 Vote margin Dem. 15 30 Rep. 15 30 Other 15 30\n\nPennsylvanias Second is entirely within the city of Philadelphia, which is only significant because it now includes the northeast Philadelphia residence of the Democratic representative Brendan Boyle.\n\nThis isnt as big a problem for Democrats as it would have been a few months ago, since Representative Robert Brady chose not to seek re-election. If he had run, it might have set up a primary between Mr. Boyle and Mr. Brady, but as things are, Mr. Boyle will probably run for this seat.\n\nCurrent District 13 New District 4 Current District Clinton +34 New district Clinton +19 Vote margin Dem. 15 30 Rep. 15 30 Other 15 30\n\nIf Mr. Boyle does run for the Philadelphia-based Second District, the Montgomery County-based Fourth District will most likely be an open contest (Mr. Boyles old 13th District included much of Montgomery County, along with northeastern Philadelphia). Democrats will be heavily favored to hold this seat in 2018, but in other political conditions it could be somewhat competitive.\n\nCurrent District 2 New District 3 Current District Clinton +83 New district Clinton +84 Vote margin Dem. 15 30 Rep. 15 30 Other 15 30\n\nThe new Third District, which includes much of Philadelphia, will be one of the most Democratic districts in the country.\n\nCurrent District 3 New District 16 Current District Trump +26 New district Trump +20 Vote margin Dem. 15 30 Rep. 15 30 Other 15 30\n\nPennsylvanias Third was bound to move at least somewhat to the left once traditionally Democratic Erie County was reunified, but whether it would become a true battleground district hinged on the fate of the Pittsburgh suburbs.\n\nIn the end, most of the Democratic-leaning areas northwest of Pittsburgh were piled into the old 12th, leaving more conservative areas to the Republican Mike Kelly, who will most likely survive this somewhat more Democratic district.\n\nCurrent District 5 New District 15 Current District Trump +29 New district Trump +43 Vote margin Dem. 15 30 Rep. 15 30 Other 15 30\n\nThe Republican Glenn Thompsons district was already safely Republican, but it will be even safer now that it is not assisting Mr. Kelly by splitting Erie County.\n\nCurrent District 9 New District 13 Current District Trump +43 New district Trump +46 Vote margin Dem. 15 30 Rep. 15 30 Other 15 30\n\nThe new 13th will remain safely Republican.\n\nCurrent District 10 New District 12 Current District Trump +36 New district Trump +36 Vote margin Dem. 15 30 Rep. 15 30 Other 15 30\n\nThe new 12th adds State College (home to Penn State), but it gives up Democratic-leaning parts of northeastern Pennsylvania. It remains safely Republican.\n\nCurrent District 11 New District 9 Current District Trump +24 New district Trump +34 Vote margin Dem. 15 30 Rep. 15 30 Other 15 30\n\nConservative Democrats were competitive in this area a decade ago; its where Mr. Holden won re-election to the inconvenience of Republicans in 2010, but its a stretch after years of Republican gains.\n\nCurrent District 14 New District 18 Current District Clinton +35 New district Clinton +27 Vote margin Dem. 15 30 Rep. 15 30 Other 15 30"""

Its the hand of Donald Trump, recognizing that we cannot afford to lose Senate seats because we are fighting with ourselves.\n\nBy ending their primaries against the two senators, Mr. McDaniel and Mr. Tarkanian snuffed out what was left of Mr. Bannons vision for remaking Congress with candidates in his populist mold. At one time, Mr. Bannon envisioned primaries in Mississippi, Nebraska, Arizona, Wyoming and Nevada.\n\nNow he has none.\n\nWith Mr. Bannon exiled by the president and Mr. Trump getting along with congressional leaders and taking counsel from largely mainstream Republicans in the post-Bannon White House, there is little political space for right-wing insurgents to oust incumbents.\n\nPerhaps no one is happier about that than Mr. McConnell, whom Mr. Bannon had once threatened to unseat. Chris Pack, the spokesman for the Senate Leadership Fund, a political action committee that Mr. McConnell helped found to ensure the re-election of incumbents, was succinct on Friday.\n\nWho is Steve Bannon? Mr. Pack asked wryly.\n\nMr. Bannon declined to comment.\n\nDemocrats said on Friday that the dynamics of the Nevada race had not changed much, and that they remained optimistic about their chances to pick up a Senate seat in a state won by Hillary Clinton. Mr. Tarkanian, party strategists said, has already caused lasting damage to Mr. Heller by forcing him into positions he will later regret in his campaign against Representative Jacky Rosen, the Democrat whose seat Mr. Tarkanian is now seeking.

Its the hand of Donald Trump, recognizing that we cannot afford to lose Senate seats because we are fighting with ourselves.\n\nBy ending their primaries against the two senators, Mr. McDaniel and Mr. Tarkanian snuffed out what was left of Mr. Bannons vision for remaking Congress with candidates in his populist mold. At one time, Mr. Bannon envisioned primaries in Mississippi, Nebraska, Arizona, Wyoming and Nevada.\n\nNow he has none.\n\nWith Mr. Bannon exiled by the president and Mr. Trump getting along with congressional leaders and taking counsel from largely mainstream Republicans in the post-Bannon White House, there is little political space for right-wing insurgents to oust incumbents.\n\nPerhaps no one is happier about that than Mr. McConnell, whom Mr. Bannon had once threatened to unseat. Chris Pack, the spokesman for the Senate Leadership Fund, a political action committee that Mr. McConnell helped found to ensure the re-election of incumbents, was succinct on Friday.\n\nWho is Steve Bannon? Mr. Pack asked wryly.\n\nMr. Bannon declined to comment.\n\nDemocrats said on Friday that the dynamics of the Nevada race had not changed much, and that they remained optimistic about their chances to pick up a Senate seat in a state won by Hillary Clinton.

And while polls show Mr. McMaster leading the pack, it is not clear that he will break the 50 percent threshold needed to avoid a runoff later this month. Read more\n\nA competitive primary is also expected in South Carolinas Fourth District, which is being vacated by Representative Trey Gowdy, perhaps best known for leading the House committee that investigated the Benghazi attack. The race is tremendously crowded, with 13 Republican candidates.\n\nAnd in the First District, Representative Mark Sanford, a Republican once expected to win re-election with little trouble, is now in danger of losing to a primary challenger, State Representative Katie Arrington. Ms. Arrington has attacked Mr. Sanford for his criticism of President Trump.\n\n MAGGIE ASTOR'

Read more\n\nAlso running are three Democrats: Carl Brewer, a former mayor of Wichita; Laura Kelly, a state senator; and Josh Svaty, a farmer and former state agriculture secretary. Any of them would face long odds in November in a state as conservative as Kansas. But some Democrats think that if Mr. Kobach wins the Republican nomination, it could give them an opening among voters who see him as too extreme.\n\nThere are also competitive races in two Republican-held congressional districts that Democrats hope to flip in November. Seven Republicans are vying for the nomination in the Second District, where Representative Lynn Jenkins is retiring; the winner will face Paul Davis, a Democrat who won the district during his unsuccessful run for governor in 2014. And in the Third District, which includes Democratic-leaning Kansas City and Overland Park, six Democrats are vying to challenge Representative Kevin Yoder.\n\n MAGGIE ASTOR\n\nRead more about todays most important races.'

And Republicans are likely to pick up a Democratic-held seat in northern Minnesota. If they do, Democrats would have to offset that loss by winning one more Republican-held seat, in order to win a majority.\n\nThere are an additional 56 Republican-held seats that are vulnerable, rated either as toss-ups or as leaning slightly to the right. Many are in red-state suburbs, near cities like Dallas, Salt Lake City and Raleigh, N.C., or in more rural parts of the country. Republicans must win nearly 90 percent of those seats to keep control.\n\nDemocrats must net a 23-seat gain in order to take power in the House, and there are now 17 districts currently held by Republicans that are leaning slightly or strongly toward Democratic candidates. These seats are mainly in affluent suburban areas, including half a dozen seats just in New Jersey and Pennsylvania.\n\nThe map of competitive House races has only continued to grow in the final month of the 2018 campaign, leaving Republicans scrambling to contain Democratic gains in even conservative-leaning areas. Republicans could still keep control of the House by a slim margin, but they would have to win the overwhelming majority of competitive races in order to hang on.\n\nThe list of close-run House races keeps growing as the midterm elections draw nearer, as Democrats keep putting Republicans on defense in traditionally conservative-leaning areas. Since August, the number of pure toss-up races  where both parties have a roughly even chance of winning  has grown to 30, including 28 seats currently held by Republicans. And there are nine Republican-held seats that currently lean toward the Democrats, up from seven a month ago. Democrats must gain a total of 23 seats to take the majority.\n\nMost of the changes to the electoral map have come in once-safe Republican areas  like the suburbs of St. Louis and Charlotte, N.C., or rural southern New Mexico. These areas have become more vulnerable for the party because of President Trumps unpopularity, especially with moderates and women. And seats in two solid-red districts, outside Buffalo, N.Y., and in San Diego, have become competitive because Republican lawmakers in both districts were indicted for corruption.\n\nThere were only a few encouraging shifts for Republicans, but they were important ones, including a Republican-held open seat in Miami that shifted back into the toss-up category after being seen for months as lost to the Democrats.\n\nAll together, there are now 64 Republican-held seats that are seriously contested, up from 58 in the middle of August.\n\nNearly all of these races remain very close, and a new shift in the national environment could tip many of them in either direction come Election Day.

The sample came from a 41-year-old man who worked at the seafood market in Wuhan where the first cluster of cases appeared.\n\nResearchers are now racing to make sense of this viral recipe, which could inspire drugs, vaccines and other tools to fight the ongoing pandemic.\n\nA String of RNA\n\nViruses must hijack living cells to replicate and spread. When the coronavirus finds a suitable cell, it injects a strand of RNA that contains the entire coronavirus genome.\n\nThe genome of the new coronavirus is less than 30,000 letters long. (The human genome is over 3 billion.) Scientists have identified genes for as many as 29 proteins, which carry out a range of jobs from making copies of the coronavirus to suppressing the bodys immune responses.\n\nThe first sequence of RNA letters reads:\n\nauuaaagguuuauaccuucccagguaacaaaccaaccaacuuucgaucucuuguagaucuguucucuaaacgaacuuuaaaaucuguguggcugucacucggcugcaugcuuagugcacucacgcaguauaauuaauaacuaauuacugucguugacaggacacgaguaacucgucuaucuucugcaggcugcuuacgguuucguccguguugcagccgaucaucagcacaucuagguuucguccgggugugaccgaaagguaag\n\nThis sequence recruits machinery inside the infected cell to read the RNA letters  a, c, g and u  and translate them into coronavirus proteins.\n\nThe full coronavirus genome and the proteins it encodes are shown below.\n\nA Chain of Proteins  ORF1ab\n\nThe first viral protein created inside the infected cell is actually a chain of 16 proteins joined together. Two of these proteins act like scissors, snipping the links between the different proteins and freeing them to do their jobs.\n\n Start of genome 30,000 RNA letters  THE SARS-CoV-2 GENOME ORF1ab PROTEIN STRUCTURAL PROTEINS Spike E M N NON-STRUCTURAL PROTEINS (NSPs) ACCESSORY PROTEINS 1 3 5 7 9 11 13 15 3a 6 7b 9b 10 2 4 6 8 10 12 14 16 3b 7a 8 9c THE SARS-CoV-2 GENOME Non-Structural Proteins (NSPs) Start of genome 1 2 ORF1ab Protein 3 4 5 6 7 8 9 10 11 12 13 14 15 16 Spike Accessory Proteins Structural Proteins 3b 3a E 6 M 7a 7b 8 9b N 9c 30,000 RNA letters 10 THE SARS-CoV-2 GENOME Non-Structural Proteins (NSPs) Start of genome 1 2 ORF1ab Protein 3 4 5 6 7 8 9 10 11 12 13 14 15 16 Spike Accessory Proteins 3b Structural Proteins 3a E 6 M 7a 7b 8 9b N 9c 30,000 RNA letters 10\n\nResearch on other coronaviruses has given scientists a good understanding of what some of the SARS-CoV-2 proteins do. But other proteins are far more mysterious, and some might do nothing at all.\n\nCellular Saboteur  NSP1\n\nThis protein slows down the infected cells production of its own proteins. This sabotage forces the cell to make more virus proteins and prevents it from assembling antiviral proteins that could stop the virus.\n\nauggagagccuugucccugguuucaacgagaaaacacacguccaacucaguuugccuguuuuacagguucgcgacgugcucguacguggcuuuggagacuccguggaggaggucuuaucagaggcacgucaacaucuuaaagauggcacuuguggcuuaguagaaguugaaaaaggcguuuugccucaacuugaacagcccuauguguucaucaaacguucggaugcucgaacugcaccucauggucauguuaugguugagcugguagcagaacucgaaggcauucaguacggucguaguggugagacacuugguguccuugucccucaugugggcgaaauaccaguggcuuaccgcaagguucuucuucguaagaacgguaauaaaggagcugguggccauaguuacggcgccgaucuaaagucauuugacuuaggcgacgagcuuggcacugauccuuaugaagauuuucaagaaaacuggaacacuaaacauagcagugguguuacccgugaacucaugcgugagcuuaacggaggg\n\nMystery Protein  NSP2\n\nScientists arent sure what NSP2 does.

One is cutting loose other viral proteins so they can do their own tasks. It also alters many of the infected cells proteins.\n\nNormally, a healthy cell tags old proteins for destruction.

The sample came from a 41-year-old man who worked at the seafood market in Wuhan where the first cluster of cases appeared.\n\nResearchers are now racing to make sense of this viral recipe, which could inspire drugs, vaccines and other tools to fight the ongoing pandemic.\n\nA String of RNA\n\nViruses must hijack living cells to replicate and spread. When the coronavirus finds a suitable cell, it injects a strand of RNA that contains the entire coronavirus genome.\n\nThe genome of the new coronavirus is less than 30,000 letters long. (The human genome is over 3 billion.) Scientists have identified genes for as many as 29 proteins, which carry out a range of jobs from making copies of the coronavirus to suppressing the bodys immune responses.\n\nThe first sequence of RNA letters reads:\n\nauuaaagguuuauaccuucccagguaacaaaccaaccaacuuucgaucucuuguagaucuguucucuaaacgaacuuuaaaaucuguguggcugucacucggcugcaugcuuagugcacucacgcaguauaauuaauaacuaauuacugucguugacaggacacgaguaacucgucuaucuucugcaggcugcuuacgguuucguccguguugcagccgaucaucagcacaucuagguuucguccgggugugaccgaaagguaag\n\nThis sequence recruits machinery inside the infected cell to read the RNA letters  a, c, g and u  and translate them into coronavirus proteins.\n\nThe full coronavirus genome and the proteins it encodes are shown below.\n\nA Chain of Proteins  ORF1ab\n\nThe first viral protein created inside the infected cell is actually a chain of 16 proteins joined together.

The outbreaks of SARS and MERS, which are also caused by coronaviruses, spurred lots of research. SARS and SARS-CoV-2, the virus that causes Covid-19, are roughly 80 percent identical, and both use so-called spike proteins to grab onto a specific receptor found on cells in human lungs. This helps explain how scientists developed a test for Covid-19 so quickly.\n\nTheres a cost to moving so quickly, however. The potential Covid-19 vaccines now in the pipeline might be more likely to fail because of the swift march through the research phase, said Robert van Exan, a cell biologist who has worked in the vaccine industry for decades. He predicts we wont see a vaccine approved until at least 2021 or 2022, and even then, this is very optimistic and of relatively low probability.\n\nAnd yet, he said, this kind of fast-tracking is worth the try  maybe we will get lucky.\n\nYears and years, at minimum The vaccine development process has typically taken a decade or longer.

Researchers relying on groundwork from the SARS and MERS outbreaks could theoretically move through planning steps swiftly.\n\nSanofi, a French biopharmaceutical company, expects to begin clinical trials late this year for a Covid-19 vaccine that it repurposed from work on a SARS vaccine. If successful, the vaccine could be ready by late 2021.\n\nMove at Pandemic Speed Through Trials\n\nOptions to shorten the timeline Use pandemic speed timeline Start subsequent steps before previous phases are completed Push to large-scale tests sooner Move more swiftly to Phase 3 trials by combining phases Use emergency provision Vaccinate front-line and essential workers early\n\nAs a rule, researchers dont begin jabbing people with experimental vaccines until after rigorous safety checks.\n\nThey test the vaccine first on small batches of people  a few dozen during Phase 1, then a few hundred in Phase 2, then thousands in Phase 3. Months normally pass between phases so that researchers can review the findings and get approvals for subsequent phases.\n\nBut if we do it the conventional way, theres no way were going to be reaching that timeline of 18 months, said Akiko Iwasaki, a professor of immunobiology at Yale University School of Medicine and an investigator at the Howard Hughes Medical Institute.\n\nThere are ways to slash time off this process by combining several phases and testing vaccines on more people without as much waiting.\n\nLast week the National Academy of Sciences showed an overlapping timeline, describing it as moving at pandemic speed.\n\nIts here that talk of fast-tracking the timeline meets the messiness of real life: What if a promising vaccine actually makes it easier to catch the virus, or makes the disease worse after someones infected?\n\nThats been the case for a few H.I.V. drugs and vaccines for dengue fever, because of a process called vaccine-induced enhancement, in which the body reacts unexpectedly and makes the disease more dangerous.\n\nResearchers cant easily infect vaccinated participants with the coronavirus to see how the body behaves. They normally wait until some volunteers contract the virus naturally. That means dosing people in regions hit hardest by the virus, like New York, or vaccinating family members of an infected person to see if they get the virus next. If the pandemic subsides, this step could be slowed.\n\nThats why vaccines take such a long time, said Dr. Iwasaki. But were making everything very short. Hopefully we can evaluate these risks as they occur, as soon as possible.\n\nThis is where the vaccine timelines start to diverge depending on who you are, and where some people might get left behind.\n\nIf a vaccine proves successful in early trials, regulators could issue an emergency-use provision so that doctors, nurses and other essential workers could get vaccinated right away  even before the end of the year. Researchers at Oxford announced this week that their coronavirus vaccine could be ready for emergency use by September if trials prove successful.\n\nSo researchers might produce a viable vaccine in just 12 to 18 months, but that doesnt mean youre going to get it. Millions of people could be in line before you. And thats only if the United States finds a vaccine first. If another country, like China, beats us to it, we could wait even longer while it doses its citizens first.\n\nYou might be glad of that, though, if it turned out that the fast-tracked vaccine caused unexpected problems. Only after hundreds or thousands are vaccinated would researchers be able to see if a fast-tracked vaccine led to problems like vaccine-induced enhancement.\n\nIts true that any new technology comes with a learning curve, said Dr. Paul Offit, the director of the Vaccine Education Center at the Childrens Hospital of Philadelphia. And sometimes that learning curve has a human price.\n\nStart Preparing Factories Now\n\nOptions to shorten the timeline Make vaccines early Build and manufacture early, anticipating that factories will be useful for a future vaccine and that the product will clear regulatory hurdles Take a bet on a successful mRNA vaccine This experimental technology may be faster to produce than traditional vaccines\n\nOnce we have a working vaccine in hand, companies will need to start producing millions  perhaps billions  of doses, in addition to the millions of vaccine doses that are already made each year for mumps, measles and other illnesses. Its an undertaking almost unimaginable in scope.\n\nCompanies normally build new facilities perfectly tailored to any given vaccine because each vaccine requires different equipment. Some flu vaccines are produced using chicken eggs, using large facilities where a version of the virus is incubated and harvested. Other vaccines require vats in which a virus is cultured in a broth of animal cells and later inactivated and purified.\n\nThose factories follow strict guidelines governing biological facilities and usually take around five years to build, costing at least three times more than conventional pharmaceutical factories. Manufacturers may be able to speed this up by creating or repurposing existing facilities in the middle of clinical trials, long before the vaccine in question receives F.D.A. approval.\n\nThey just cant wait, said Dr. Iwasaki. If it turns out to be a terrible vaccine, they wont distribute it. But at least theyll have the capability to do so if the vaccine is successful.\n\nThe Bill and Melinda Gates Foundation says it will build factories for seven different vaccines. Even though well end up picking at most two of them, were going to fund factories for all seven, just so that we dont waste time, Bill Gates said during an appearance on The Daily Show.\n\nIn the end, the United States will have the capacity to mass-produce only two or three vaccines, said Vijay Samant, the former head of vaccine manufacturing at Merck.\n\nThe manufacturing task is insurmountable, Mr. Samant said. I get sleepless nights thinking about it.\n\nConsider just one seemingly simple step: putting the vaccine into vials. Manufacturers need to procure billions of vials, and billions of stoppers to seal them. Sophisticated machines are needed to fill them precisely, and each vial is inspected on a high-speed line. Then vials are stored, shipped and released to the public using a chain of temperature-controlled facilities and trucks. At each of these stages, producers are already stretched to meet existing demands, Mr. Samant said.\n\nIts a bottleneck similar to the one that caused a dearth of ventilators, masks and other personal protective equipment just as Covid-19 surged across America.\n\nIf you talk about vaccines long enough, a new type of vaccine, called Messenger RNA (or mRNA for short), inevitably comes up. There are hopes it could be manufactured at a record clip. Mr. Gates even included it on his Time magazine list of six innovations that could change the world. Is it the miracle were waiting for?\n\nRather than injecting subjects with disease-specific antigens to stimulate antibody production, mRNA vaccines give the body instructions to create those antigens itself. Because mRNA vaccines dont need to be cultured in large quantities and then purified, they are much faster to produce. They could change the course of the fight against Covid-19.\n\nOn the other hand, said Dr. van Exan, no one has ever made an RNA vaccine for humans.\n\nResearchers conducting dozens of trials hope to change that, including one by the pharmaceutical company Moderna. Backed by investor capital and spurred by federal funding of up to $483 million to tackle Covid-19, Moderna has already fast-tracked an mRNA vaccine. Its entering Phase 1 trials this year and the company says it could have a vaccine ready for front-line workers later this year.\n\nCould it work? Yeah, it could work, said Dr. Fred Ledley, a professor of natural biology and applied sciences at Bentley University. But in terms of the probability of success, what our data says is that theres a lower chance of approval and the trials take longer.\n\nThe technology is decades old, yet mRNA is not very stable and can break down inside the body.\n\nAt this point, Im hoping for anything to work, said Dr. Iwasaki. If it does work, wonderful, thats great. We just dont know.\n\nThe fixation on mRNA shows the allure of new and untested treatments during a medical crisis. Faced with the unsatisfying reality that our standard arsenal takes years to progress, the mRNA vaccine offers an enticing story mixed with hope and a hint of mystery. But its riskier than other established approaches.\n\nSpeed Up Regulatory Approvals\n\nOptions to shorten the timeline Fast-track federal approvals Shorten approval window from a year to six months\n\nImagine that the fateful day arrives. Scientists have created a successful vaccine. Theyve manufactured huge quantities of it. People are dying. The economy is crumbling. Its time to start injecting people.\n\nBut first, the federal government wants to take a peek.\n\nThat might seem like a bureaucratic nightmare, a rubber stamp that could cost lives. Theres even a common gripe among researchers: For every scientist employed by the F.D.A., there are three lawyers. And all they care about is liability.\n\nYet F.D.A. approvals are no mere formality. Approvals typically take a full year, during which time scientists and advisory committees review the studies to make sure that the vaccine is as safe and effective as drug makers say it is.\n\nWhile some steps in the vaccine timeline can be fast-tracked or skipped entirely, approvals arent one of them. There are horror stories from the past where vaccines were not properly tested. In the 1950s, for example, a poorly produced batch of a polio vaccine was approved in a few hours. It contained a version of the virus that wasnt quite dead, so patients who got it actually contracted polio. Several children died.\n\nThe same scenario playing out today could be devastating for Covid-19, with the anti-vaccination movement and online conspiracy theorists eager to disrupt the public health response. So while the F.D.A. might do this as fast as possible, expect months to pass before any vaccine gets a green light for mass public use.\n\nAt this point you might be asking: Why are all these research teams announcing such optimistic forecasts when so many experts are skeptical about even an 18-month timeline? Perhaps because its not just the public listening  its investors, too.\n\nThese biotechs are putting out all these press announcements, said Dr. Hotez. You just need to recognize theyre writing this for their shareholders, not for the purposes of public health.\n\nWhat if It Takes Even Longer Than the Pessimists Predict?\n\nCovid-19 lives in the shadow of the most vexing virus weve ever faced: H.I.V. After nearly 40 years of work, here is what we have to show for our vaccine efforts: a few Phase 3 clinical trials, one of which actually made the disease worse, and another with a success rate of just 30 percent.\n\nDeaths per year The number of deaths from Covid-19 in 2020 has surpassed the number of deaths per year from H.I.V./AIDS during the height of the crisis in the 1990s. 60k deaths Deaths from Covid-19 in the U.S. 50k 40k Deaths from H.I.V./AIDS in the U.S. 30k 20k 10k 0 1990 2000 2010 2020 60k deaths Deaths from Covid-19 in the U.S. 50k 40k Deaths from H.I.V./AIDS in the U.S. 30k 20k 10k 0 1990 2000 2010 2020 Note: No H.I.V. death data available after 2018. Covid-19 deaths as of April 29. Source: Mortality Informatics and Research Analytics\n\nResearchers say they dont expect a successful H.I.V. vaccine until 2030 or later, putting the timeline at around 50 years.\n\nThats unlikely to be the case for Covid-19, because, as opposed to H.I.V., it doesnt appear to mutate significantly and exists within a family of familiar respiratory viruses. Even still, any delay will be difficult to bear.\n\nBut the history of H.I.V. offers a glimmer of hope for how life could continue even without a vaccine. Researchers developed a litany of antiviral drugs that lowered the death rate and improved health outcomes for people living with AIDS. Todays drugs can lower the viral load in an H.I.V.-positive person so the virus cant be transmitted through sex.\n\nTherapeutic drugs, rather than vaccines, might likewise change the fight against Covid-19. The World Health Organization began a global search for drugs to treat Covid-19 patients in March. If successful, those drugs could lower the number of hospital admissions and help people recover faster from home while narrowing the infection window so fewer people catch the virus.\n\nCombine that with rigorous testing and contact tracing  where infected patients are identified and their recent contacts notified and quarantined  and the future starts looking a little brighter. So far, the United States is conducting fewer than half the number of tests required and we need to recruit more than 300,000 contact-tracers. But other countries have started reopening following exactly these steps.\n\nIf all those things come together, life might return to normal long before a vaccine is ready to shoot into your arm.'	b'Opinion | How Long Will a Vaccine Really Take?'	2020-04-30	[b'Stuart A.

Months normally pass between phases so that researchers can review the findings and get approvals for subsequent phases.\n\nBut if we do it the conventional way, theres no way were going to be reaching that timeline of 18 months, said Akiko Iwasaki, a professor of immunobiology at Yale University School of Medicine and an investigator at the Howard Hughes Medical Institute.\n\nThere are ways to slash time off this process by combining several phases and testing vaccines on more people without as much waiting.\n\nLast week the National Academy of Sciences showed an overlapping timeline, describing it as moving at pandemic speed.\n\nIts here that talk of fast-tracking the timeline meets the messiness of real life: What if a promising vaccine actually makes it easier to catch the virus, or makes the disease worse after someones infected?\n\nThats been the case for a few H.I.V. drugs and vaccines for dengue fever, because of a process called vaccine-induced enhancement, in which the body reacts unexpectedly and makes the disease more dangerous.\n\nResearchers cant easily infect vaccinated participants with the coronavirus to see how the body behaves. They normally wait until some volunteers contract the virus naturally. That means dosing people in regions hit hardest by the virus, like New York, or vaccinating family members of an infected person to see if they get the virus next. If the pandemic subsides, this step could be slowed.\n\nThats why vaccines take such a long time, said Dr. Iwasaki. But were making everything very short. Hopefully we can evaluate these risks as they occur, as soon as possible.\n\nThis is where the vaccine timelines start to diverge depending on who you are, and where some people might get left behind.\n\nIf a vaccine proves successful in early trials, regulators could issue an emergency-use provision so that doctors, nurses and other essential workers could get vaccinated right away  even before the end of the year. Researchers at Oxford announced this week that their coronavirus vaccine could be ready for emergency use by September if trials prove successful.\n\nSo researchers might produce a viable vaccine in just 12 to 18 months, but that doesnt mean youre going to get it. Millions of people could be in line before you. And thats only if the United States finds a vaccine first. If another country, like China, beats us to it, we could wait even longer while it doses its citizens first.\n\nYou might be glad of that, though, if it turned out that the fast-tracked vaccine caused unexpected problems. Only after hundreds or thousands are vaccinated would researchers be able to see if a fast-tracked vaccine led to problems like vaccine-induced enhancement.\n\nIts true that any new technology comes with a learning curve, said Dr. Paul Offit, the director of the Vaccine Education Center at the Childrens Hospital of Philadelphia. And sometimes that learning curve has a human price.\n\nStart Preparing Factories Now\n\nOptions to shorten the timeline Make vaccines early Build and manufacture early, anticipating that factories will be useful for a future vaccine and that the product will clear regulatory hurdles Take a bet on a successful mRNA vaccine This experimental technology may be faster to produce than traditional vaccines\n\nOnce we have a working vaccine in hand, companies will need to start producing millions  perhaps billions  of doses, in addition to the millions of vaccine doses that are already made each year for mumps, measles and other illnesses. Its an undertaking almost unimaginable in scope.\n\nCompanies normally build new facilities perfectly tailored to any given vaccine because each vaccine requires different equipment. Some flu vaccines are produced using chicken eggs, using large facilities where a version of the virus is incubated and harvested. Other vaccines require vats in which a virus is cultured in a broth of animal cells and later inactivated and purified.\n\nThose factories follow strict guidelines governing biological facilities and usually take around five years to build, costing at least three times more than conventional pharmaceutical factories. Manufacturers may be able to speed this up by creating or repurposing existing facilities in the middle of clinical trials, long before the vaccine in question receives F.D.A. approval.\n\nThey just cant wait, said Dr. Iwasaki. If it turns out to be a terrible vaccine, they wont distribute it. But at least theyll have the capability to do so if the vaccine is successful.\n\nThe Bill and Melinda Gates Foundation says it will build factories for seven different vaccines. Even though well end up picking at most two of them, were going to fund factories for all seven, just so that we dont waste time, Bill Gates said during an appearance on The Daily Show.\n\nIn the end, the United States will have the capacity to mass-produce only two or three vaccines, said Vijay Samant, the former head of vaccine manufacturing at Merck.\n\nThe manufacturing task is insurmountable, Mr. Samant said. I get sleepless nights thinking about it.\n\nConsider just one seemingly simple step: putting the vaccine into vials. Manufacturers need to procure billions of vials, and billions of stoppers to seal them. Sophisticated machines are needed to fill them precisely, and each vial is inspected on a high-speed line. Then vials are stored, shipped and released to the public using a chain of temperature-controlled facilities and trucks. At each of these stages, producers are already stretched to meet existing demands, Mr. Samant said.\n\nIts a bottleneck similar to the one that caused a dearth of ventilators, masks and other personal protective equipment just as Covid-19 surged across America.\n\nIf you talk about vaccines long enough, a new type of vaccine, called Messenger RNA (or mRNA for short), inevitably comes up. There are hopes it could be manufactured at a record clip. Mr. Gates even included it on his Time magazine list of six innovations that could change the world. Is it the miracle were waiting for?\n\nRather than injecting subjects with disease-specific antigens to stimulate antibody production, mRNA vaccines give the body instructions to create those antigens itself. Because mRNA vaccines dont need to be cultured in large quantities and then purified, they are much faster to produce. They could change the course of the fight against Covid-19.\n\nOn the other hand, said Dr. van Exan, no one has ever made an RNA vaccine for humans.\n\nResearchers conducting dozens of trials hope to change that, including one by the pharmaceutical company Moderna. Backed by investor capital and spurred by federal funding of up to $483 million to tackle Covid-19, Moderna has already fast-tracked an mRNA vaccine. Its entering Phase 1 trials this year and the company says it could have a vaccine ready for front-line workers later this year.\n\nCould it work? Yeah, it could work, said Dr. Fred Ledley, a professor of natural biology and applied sciences at Bentley University. But in terms of the probability of success, what our data says is that theres a lower chance of approval and the trials take longer.\n\nThe technology is decades old, yet mRNA is not very stable and can break down inside the body.\n\nAt this point, Im hoping for anything to work, said Dr. Iwasaki. If it does work, wonderful, thats great. We just dont know.\n\nThe fixation on mRNA shows the allure of new and untested treatments during a medical crisis. Faced with the unsatisfying reality that our standard arsenal takes years to progress, the mRNA vaccine offers an enticing story mixed with hope and a hint of mystery. But its riskier than other established approaches.\n\nSpeed Up Regulatory Approvals\n\nOptions to shorten the timeline Fast-track federal approvals Shorten approval window from a year to six months\n\nImagine that the fateful day arrives. Scientists have created a successful vaccine. Theyve manufactured huge quantities of it. People are dying. The economy is crumbling. Its time to start injecting people.\n\nBut first, the federal government wants to take a peek.\n\nThat might seem like a bureaucratic nightmare, a rubber stamp that could cost lives. Theres even a common gripe among researchers: For every scientist employed by the F.D.A., there are three lawyers. And all they care about is liability.\n\nYet F.D.A. approvals are no mere formality. Approvals typically take a full year, during which time scientists and advisory committees review the studies to make sure that the vaccine is as safe and effective as drug makers say it is.\n\nWhile some steps in the vaccine timeline can be fast-tracked or skipped entirely, approvals arent one of them. There are horror stories from the past where vaccines were not properly tested. In the 1950s, for example, a poorly produced batch of a polio vaccine was approved in a few hours. It contained a version of the virus that wasnt quite dead, so patients who got it actually contracted polio. Several children died.\n\nThe same scenario playing out today could be devastating for Covid-19, with the anti-vaccination movement and online conspiracy theorists eager to disrupt the public health response. So while the F.D.A. might do this as fast as possible, expect months to pass before any vaccine gets a green light for mass public use.\n\nAt this point you might be asking: Why are all these research teams announcing such optimistic forecasts when so many experts are skeptical about even an 18-month timeline? Perhaps because its not just the public listening  its investors, too.\n\nThese biotechs are putting out all these press announcements, said Dr. Hotez. You just need to recognize theyre writing this for their shareholders, not for the purposes of public health.\n\nWhat if It Takes Even Longer Than the Pessimists Predict?\n\nCovid-19 lives in the shadow of the most vexing virus weve ever faced: H.I.V. After nearly 40 years of work, here is what we have to show for our vaccine efforts: a few Phase 3 clinical trials, one of which actually made the disease worse, and another with a success rate of just 30 percent.\n\nDeaths per year The number of deaths from Covid-19 in 2020 has surpassed the number of deaths per year from H.I.V./AIDS during the height of the crisis in the 1990s. 60k deaths Deaths from Covid-19 in the U.S. 50k 40k Deaths from H.I.V./AIDS in the U.S. 30k 20k 10k 0 1990 2000 2010 2020 60k deaths Deaths from Covid-19 in the U.S. 50k 40k Deaths from H.I.V./AIDS in the U.S. 30k 20k 10k 0 1990 2000 2010 2020 Note: No H.I.V. death data available after 2018. Covid-19 deaths as of April 29. Source: Mortality Informatics and Research Analytics\n\nResearchers say they dont expect a successful H.I.V. vaccine until 2030 or later, putting the timeline at around 50 years.\n\nThats unlikely to be the case for Covid-19, because, as opposed to H.I.V., it doesnt appear to mutate significantly and exists within a family of familiar respiratory viruses. Even still, any delay will be difficult to bear.\n\nBut the history of H.I.V. offers a glimmer of hope for how life could continue even without a vaccine. Researchers developed a litany of antiviral drugs that lowered the death rate and improved health outcomes for people living with AIDS. Todays drugs can lower the viral load in an H.I.V.-positive person so the virus cant be transmitted through sex.\n\nTherapeutic drugs, rather than vaccines, might likewise change the fight against Covid-19. The World Health Organization began a global search for drugs to treat Covid-19 patients in March. If successful, those drugs could lower the number of hospital admissions and help people recover faster from home while narrowing the infection window so fewer people catch the virus.\n\nCombine that with rigorous testing and contact tracing  where infected patients are identified and their recent contacts notified and quarantined  and the future starts looking a little brighter. So far, the United States is conducting fewer than half the number of tests required and we need to recruit more than 300,000 contact-tracers. But other countries have started reopening following exactly these steps.\n\nIf all those things come together, life might return to normal long before a vaccine is ready to shoot into your arm.'

For the rest of the week, were revisiting people we met in the early weeks of the pandemic, listening back and hearing whats happened to them since our original conversations first ran. Today: Dr. Fabiano Di Marco of Bergamo, Italy. Its Tuesday, July 14.\n\n[music]\n\ndr. fabiano di marco\n\nCan you see me? No, I think.\n\nmichael barbaro\n\nI cannot see you, but I can hear you. And I think I can hear you  ah, now I can see you.\n\ndr. fabiano di marco\n\nOK. Sorry for my English. I dont know if my English will be adequate for a podcast. But then you will decide, OK?\n\nmichael barbaro\n\nIts exceptional. And Im really grateful that youre making time for us.\n\ndr. fabiano di marco\n\nThank you. Thank you.\n\nmichael barbaro\n\nSo, where are you right now?\n\ndr. fabiano di marco\n\nNow, Im at home. After three weeks, today, in the afternoon, I am at home, because I have a big family with three children. And I decide to come back at home one day.\n\nmichael barbaro\n\nSo you have not been home in three weeks?\n\ndr. fabiano di marco\n\nThree weeks, yes. I have been in my hospital every day, start of the crisis, Friday the 21st of February. And since then, it was a total mess. Its like a war, to be honest.\n\nmichael barbaro\n\nFrom the New York Times, Im Michael Barbaro. This is The Daily.\n\n[music]\n\narchived recording This is how Italys cases have grown now for the last month  slowly at first, but now more rapidly. Its a textbook epidemic curve.\n\nmichael barbaro\n\nItaly has quickly become the new epicenter of the pandemic, with nearly 30,000 infections and more than 2,000 deaths, numbers that are soaring by the day, even after the government there took extreme measures to lock down much of the country.\n\narchived recording (dr. jerome adams) We are at a critical inflection point in this country.\n\nmichael barbaro\n\nOn Monday, the U.S. surgeon general warned that the United States is now on a strikingly similar path.\n\narchived recording (dr. jerome adams) People, we are where Italy was two weeks ago in terms of our numbers. And we have a choice to make as a nation. Do we want to go the direction of South Korea and really be aggressive and lower our mortality rates? Or do we want to go the direction of Italy?\n\nmichael barbaro\n\nToday: A conversation with a doctor in Bergamo, north of Milan, one of Italys hardest hit areas.\n\n[music]\n\nIts Tuesday, March 17.\n\nmichael barbaro\n\nCould I just ask you to just say your full name for me?\n\ndr. fabiano di marco\n\nOK. My name is Fabiano Di Marco. Im a professor of the University of Milan and the head of the respiratory unit of the Hospital Papa Giovanni XXIII of Bergamo, which is a town close to Milan.\n\nmichael barbaro\n\nCan you give me a sense, and maybe paint the picture, of what its like in the hospital right now, what youre dealing with?\n\ndr. fabiano di marco\n\nI have now  my ward has been totally transformed. Nothing is as before. Ive been in my hospital every single day for 14 hours or 15 hours a day \n\nmichael barbaro\n\nWow.\n\ndr. fabiano di marco\n\n to try to deal with the outbreak of coronavirus infection.\n\nmichael barbaro\n\nWhat has been the story of what has happened in your hospital these past few weeks? Because I think people in the United States are desperate to understand what you have seen, and what people have said to you, and what it has looked like. You described it as a war. So we want to understand what you mean.\n\ndr. fabiano di marco\n\nOK. Every day we receive, on average, between 50 to 70 patients with severe respiratory failure due to coronavirus infection. Every single day. And to describe my reality, my hospital is, at least in Europe, a huge hospital with 1,000 beds. But to receive every day between 50 and 70 patients with severe pneumonia due to coronavirus, its impossible. You have to change your organization day by day.\n\nmichael barbaro\n\nAnd tell me what you mean. How do you have to change your organization to deal with people who are in such severe respiratory condition?\n\ndr. fabiano di marco\n\nSo we change it, the normal ward, mainly surgery wards, because the activity of surgery has been reduced off at least 80 percent. And we transform it, so far five wards of surgery for patients with coronavirus. Now we have, between the five wards and the emergency room, at least 350 patients with respiratory failure due to coronavirus infection.\n\nmichael barbaro\n\nWow.\n\ndr. fabiano di marco\n\nToday is the first day in which we have more than 50 percent of the hospital dedicated to coronavirus patients. To organize these, we had to teach cardiologists, dermatologists, rheumatologists  specialists of something very different from respiratory failure  how to treat this patient. You try to find a solution. But day by day, its no longer enough. So I can tell you that my colleagues, both physicians and nurses, they cry every day.\n\nmichael barbaro\n\nWow.\n\ndr. fabiano di marco\n\nIm 47. Im not so, so old to be the head of a ward, at least in Italy. But I have with me 20 colleagues who are respiratory physician, with many fellow. They are 27, 30. So for me, its a huge responsibility. And I was scared they can be sick. OK? But we cry every day. And now, we have today, 460 nurse at home because they are sick. And I think we have \n\nmichael barbaro\n\nWow.\n\ndr. fabiano di marco\n\nYes. Its a very huge number.\n\nmichael barbaro\n\nYou have 460 nurses who are in a hospital in the middle of this crisis who are home because theyre sick?\n\ndr. fabiano di marco\n\nYeah, today. This is the outcome of today.\n\nmichael barbaro\n\nAnd is that because they are sick with the coronavirus?\n\ndr. fabiano di marco\n\nThere are some who are sick, some with a total burnout for the situation, and other who are contact of patients, so they stay in quarantine at home.\n\nmichael barbaro\n\nDoctor, you said you are upset, that you maybe even cry every day. And I wonder if there is an experience, maybe one story or one patient, that made you upset?\n\ndr. fabiano di marco\n\nThe main problem for us is to treat our colleagues. As doctor, we are used to treat patients. And for us its normal. There is not so emotional, luckily, because we are used to treat other people. But this is difficult when the patient is your colleague. And we have now admitted tens of colleagues or nurse, people who you will meet every day in your life.\n\nmichael barbaro\n\nYour colleagues are now your patients because they have contracted the virus.\n\ndr. fabiano di marco\n\nAbsolutely. For example, yesterday, the chief of my department come to the emergency room to be with a low level of oxygenation. He has a bilateral pneumonia due to coronavirus.\n\nmichael barbaro\n\nWow. Im sorry.\n\ndr. fabiano di marco\n\nNot very severe. But he was someone who tried to organize the hospital to deal with this infection three days ago. And we went to have a dinner with my wife and his wife one week ago.\n\nmichael barbaro\n\nWow.\n\ndr. fabiano di marco\n\nI dont know. We are scared because on Friday, only in my hospital, we had 20 deaths.\n\nmichael barbaro\n\n20 deaths.\n\ndr. fabiano di marco\n\nYeah. For coronavirus. In one day.\n\nmichael barbaro\n\nThats extraordinary.\n\ndr. fabiano di marco\n\nYeah. So another important thing, we have not had the opportunity to allow the relative to come to the hospital for two reasons. First, its a danger for them and for other people, evidently, because in 80 percent of the cases, they are infected. The second reason, which is not easy to understand if you are not in this situation, is that we do not have enough personal protective equipment  the mask in case of infection, something to cover the shoes, and the gown. Its impossible to find these now Europe, not only in Italy.\n\nmichael barbaro\n\nSo youre running out of those and you cant get them anywhere, in the region or anywhere in Europe. You just cant get them.\n\ndr. fabiano di marco\n\nYeah. Impossible to find.\n\nmichael barbaro\n\nWow.\n\ndr. fabiano di marco\n\nIf I allow one or two relative to come to the hospital, I have to give them these. But we do not have this for us.\n\nmichael barbaro\n\nRight. You need them for doctors.\n\ndr. fabiano di marco\n\nYeah. They cannot receive the relative in hospital. So the patients are alone. And they die alone. We  this is difficult for us. We try to call, every day, the relative. But I have to tell you that sometimes, in the confusion of this new organization with a dermatologist who is trying to treat a patient with severe respiratory failure, and probably the doctors cry, and the  no one remember to call the relative. So its happened that the relative call the hospital \n\nmichael barbaro\n\nAnd the persons already dead.\n\ndr. fabiano di marco\n\nYeah.\n\n[music]\n\nmichael barbaro\n\nWell be right back. Doctor, youve mentioned a lot of the choices that you and your staff have to make now that this is such a terrible situation. And I wonder how you make decisions about who gets which treatment, and who has the best chance to survive. How do you make those decisions?\n\ndr. fabiano di marco\n\nThis is, for us, a crucial point, because we have hundreds of very sick patients. But we have tens of I.C.U. beds.\n\nmichael barbaro\n\nRight.\n\ndr. fabiano di marco\n\nThe problem is that you can find many scores of gravity. But these scores of gravity have been thought for another reason. OK?\n\nmichael barbaro\n\nAnd when you say score of gravity, you mean, basically, kind of a calculation of who is in greatest need?\n\ndr. fabiano di marco\n\nAbsolutely. So for instance, if you are 80, you have a severe respiratory failure, and I dont know, you have also renal failure, I have to admit you in the I.C.U. because you are very severe. And you have a probability to die very high. OK. I have to admit you in the I.C.U.. But now we need another score, which is a score which help us to understand your probability to benefit of the I.C.U. bed. And we do not have this score. OK?\n\nmichael barbaro\n\nBecause it has not been created.\n\ndr. fabiano di marco\n\nAbsolutely. We are trying to do this now, because for example, the age, for all of the stage of severity, higher is the age, higher is the score. But when you have few beds for many people, the age is absolutely the opposite. If you are 85, I give the bed to another one who is 45.\n\nmichael barbaro\n\nBecause 45-year-old is more likely to benefit from the I.C.U. bed than the 80-year-old. So youre saying all the normal rules have to be thrown out the window.\n\ndr. fabiano di marco\n\nAbsolutely. We need a new tool we do not have, because so far, the difference between the number of patients, number or bed, is something totally new for us. OK? And not only for us, all the country will have to deal with this. But its difficult to tell people that if you are 80, you will never have the I.C.U. bed.\n\nmichael barbaro\n\nOf course.\n\ndr. fabiano di marco\n\nBut so far, if you have not the opportunity to build a new hospital with 1,000 bed, such as in China, we need this terrible tool, because this is a tool of selection.\n\nmichael barbaro\n\nRight  of who lives and who dies.\n\ndr. fabiano di marco\n\nYeah. And this is why its important. If you do not reduce the number of patients who are sick, its impossible to deal with this disease. Impossible. You have to reduce the rate of infection. And the only way to reduce the rate of infection is to change totally the life of people. Now, in Italy, everyone is at home. This is a tragedy for economy. No one is working. No one is working. But its the only way. There is not something in between.\n\nmichael barbaro\n\nIt sounds like youre saying that once you are in a hospital as a doctor, looking at a room full of people with this virus, overwhelmed, its too late. That the role of countries who are not yet at the place Italy is in is to make sure they dont ever get to that place, dont ever get to the point that your hospital is at. And to do whatever it takes to not get there.\n\ndr. fabiano di marco\n\nAbsolutely. You have two choices. You decide to not close all the activities, close the people in their home, and you will accept thousand of beds. Or, you have to close all the activity. There is not a choice in between. I know this is difficult to have this approach, because also in Italy, if you speak with my colleague in another town, its quite difficult to understand this. Because many people, including many physicians, have not this perception of this. Because in your reality, all is normal. Its difficult to be scared for something you have not the perception. OK? So I can understand that in other countries, its the same. But trust us, or, such as in Bergamo, each family will have a relative or a friend who dies. This is the situation in Bergamo. This is not a disease that you can discuss on TV, or you will have the perception of this in your family, in your relative, in your town. Its something very aggressive, very aggressive.\n\nmichael barbaro\n\nI wonder, as a doctor, what advice you would give to doctors in the United States who may have to do what you have to do and make the kind of difficult decisions that you have to make now.\n\ndr. fabiano di marco\n\nI think that the best is to speak with us to analyze the situation of Italy. It could be something important. Because you have to be prepared for this. This is the only thing I would suggest to my colleague. Because also in Italy, I have some colleague in the other part of Italy who are not prepared. And I speak with them. They are doing the same thing we did three weeks ago. This is incredible. This new reality we are living started the 23rd of February, not three years ago. OK? Three weeks ago. After three weeks, we are living in another dimension. For me, its difficult to think to my life before this. No one can be prepared for this  impossible.\n\nmichael barbaro\n\nI wonder, just a final question here. At the beginning of our conversation, you said you were finally home after three weeks. And I wonder what it was like to come home to your family. What are you telling them? And how are you feeling?\n\ndr. fabiano di marco\n\nMy children are at home now for three weeks. The schools are closed. Luckily there are three, so they can stay together. But we try to create a normal situation at home. For me, its difficult, because evidently, I have a risk of infection which is higher than compared to other people. So I had to decide what to do at home. If stay with a mask  sorry. And I decide to stay normal, without the mask.\n\nmichael barbaro\n\nIt sounds like this was a tough decision.\n\ndr. fabiano di marco\n\nYeah, because I have to find the solution between to protect the best, uh, my wife and do not scare my children. OK? The only good news is that children and young boys or girls are not affected. This is the only consolation for us. And I decide that I changed my approach to my children. OK? I pay attention to my hands. I pay attention to my towel. OK? But I decide to not wear a mask because it will be difficult for them to see the father who is a respiratory physician in Bergamo with those kind of cases, hundreds of that. So also for these, its really difficult to decide what is the best. And then I spoke with my wife. And we decided to do this.\n\nmichael barbaro\n\nIt sounds like on top of all the difficult decisions youve had to make, you had to go home and make one more difficult decision, which was this mask.\n\ndr. fabiano di marco\n\nYeah. Absolutely.\n\n[music]\n\nmichael barbaro\n\nDoctor, I really want to thank you so much for giving us your time. And I want to wish you the best of luck, you and all your colleagues, doctors and nurses at the hospital. Were going to be thinking about you a lot in the coming days.\n\ndr. fabiano di marco\n\nThank you. Thank you. It has been a privilege. I hope, indeed, to be useful for some of my colleagues and for you.\n\nmichael barbaro\n\nThe crisis in Bergamo has begun to subside. Last week, Dr. Di Marcos hospital discharged its last I.C.U. patient with severe symptoms of Covid-19. It was the first time that the unit had no cases in 137 days. The staff there marked the milestone by observing a moment of silence for the hundreds of patients who have died from the virus, followed by round of applause for those who had recovered from it. Dr. Di Marco says hes encouraged by the regions progress, but on guard for a second wave of infections. A few weeks ago, in recognition of his work, Italys president awarded Dr. Di Marco the prestigious title of Cavaliere, making him a knight of the Italian Republic. Well be right back.\n\n[music]\n\nHeres what else you need to know today.\n\narchived recording (gavin newsom) Ill remind you, a week or so ago, I was reporting just six lives lost, and then a few days later, well an excess of 100 lives lost.

For the rest of the week, were revisiting people we met in the early weeks of the pandemic, listening back and hearing whats happened to them since our original conversations first ran. Today: Dr. Fabiano Di Marco of Bergamo, Italy. Its Tuesday, July 14.\n\n[music]\n\ndr. fabiano di marco\n\nCan you see me? No, I think.\n\nmichael barbaro\n\nI cannot see you, but I can hear you. And I think I can hear you  ah, now I can see you.\n\ndr. fabiano di marco\n\nOK. Sorry for my English. I dont know if my English will be adequate for a podcast. But then you will decide, OK?\n\nmichael barbaro\n\nIts exceptional. And Im really grateful that youre making time for us.\n\ndr. fabiano di marco\n\nThank you. Thank you.\n\nmichael barbaro\n\nSo, where are you right now?\n\ndr. fabiano di marco\n\nNow, Im at home. After three weeks, today, in the afternoon, I am at home, because I have a big family with three children. And I decide to come back at home one day.\n\nmichael barbaro\n\nSo you have not been home in three weeks?\n\ndr. fabiano di marco\n\nThree weeks, yes. I have been in my hospital every day, start of the crisis, Friday the 21st of February. And since then, it was a total mess. Its like a war, to be honest.\n\nmichael barbaro\n\nFrom the New York Times, Im Michael Barbaro. This is The Daily.\n\n[music]\n\narchived recording This is how Italys cases have grown now for the last month  slowly at first, but now more rapidly. Its a textbook epidemic curve.\n\nmichael barbaro\n\nItaly has quickly become the new epicenter of the pandemic, with nearly 30,000 infections and more than 2,000 deaths, numbers that are soaring by the day, even after the government there took extreme measures to lock down much of the country.\n\narchived recording (dr. jerome adams) We are at a critical inflection point in this country.\n\nmichael barbaro\n\nOn Monday, the U.S. surgeon general warned that the United States is now on a strikingly similar path.\n\narchived recording (dr. jerome adams) People, we are where Italy was two weeks ago in terms of our numbers. And we have a choice to make as a nation. Do we want to go the direction of South Korea and really be aggressive and lower our mortality rates? Or do we want to go the direction of Italy?\n\nmichael barbaro\n\nToday: A conversation with a doctor in Bergamo, north of Milan, one of Italys hardest hit areas.\n\n[music]\n\nIts Tuesday, March 17.\n\nmichael barbaro\n\nCould I just ask you to just say your full name for me?\n\ndr. fabiano di marco\n\nOK. My name is Fabiano Di Marco. Im a professor of the University of Milan and the head of the respiratory unit of the Hospital Papa Giovanni XXIII of Bergamo, which is a town close to Milan.\n\nmichael barbaro\n\nCan you give me a sense, and maybe paint the picture, of what its like in the hospital right now, what youre dealing with?\n\ndr. fabiano di marco\n\nI have now  my ward has been totally transformed. Nothing is as before. Ive been in my hospital every single day for 14 hours or 15 hours a day \n\nmichael barbaro\n\nWow.\n\ndr. fabiano di marco\n\n to try to deal with the outbreak of coronavirus infection.\n\nmichael barbaro\n\nWhat has been the story of what has happened in your hospital these past few weeks? Because I think people in the United States are desperate to understand what you have seen, and what people have said to you, and what it has looked like. You described it as a war. So we want to understand what you mean.\n\ndr. fabiano di marco\n\nOK. Every day we receive, on average, between 50 to 70 patients with severe respiratory failure due to coronavirus infection. Every single day. And to describe my reality, my hospital is, at least in Europe, a huge hospital with 1,000 beds. But to receive every day between 50 and 70 patients with severe pneumonia due to coronavirus, its impossible. You have to change your organization day by day.\n\nmichael barbaro\n\nAnd tell me what you mean. How do you have to change your organization to deal with people who are in such severe respiratory condition?\n\ndr. fabiano di marco\n\nSo we change it, the normal ward, mainly surgery wards, because the activity of surgery has been reduced off at least 80 percent. And we transform it, so far five wards of surgery for patients with coronavirus. Now we have, between the five wards and the emergency room, at least 350 patients with respiratory failure due to coronavirus infection.\n\nmichael barbaro\n\nWow.\n\ndr. fabiano di marco\n\nToday is the first day in which we have more than 50 percent of the hospital dedicated to coronavirus patients. To organize these, we had to teach cardiologists, dermatologists, rheumatologists  specialists of something very different from respiratory failure  how to treat this patient. You try to find a solution. But day by day, its no longer enough. So I can tell you that my colleagues, both physicians and nurses, they cry every day.\n\nmichael barbaro\n\nWow.\n\ndr. fabiano di marco\n\nIm 47. Im not so, so old to be the head of a ward, at least in Italy. But I have with me 20 colleagues who are respiratory physician, with many fellow. They are 27, 30. So for me, its a huge responsibility. And I was scared they can be sick. OK? But we cry every day. And now, we have today, 460 nurse at home because they are sick. And I think we have \n\nmichael barbaro\n\nWow.\n\ndr. fabiano di marco\n\nYes. Its a very huge number.\n\nmichael barbaro\n\nYou have 460 nurses who are in a hospital in the middle of this crisis who are home because theyre sick?\n\ndr. fabiano di marco\n\nYeah, today. This is the outcome of today.\n\nmichael barbaro\n\nAnd is that because they are sick with the coronavirus?\n\ndr. fabiano di marco\n\nThere are some who are sick, some with a total burnout for the situation, and other who are contact of patients, so they stay in quarantine at home.\n\nmichael barbaro\n\nDoctor, you said you are upset, that you maybe even cry every day. And I wonder if there is an experience, maybe one story or one patient, that made you upset?\n\ndr. fabiano di marco\n\nThe main problem for us is to treat our colleagues. As doctor, we are used to treat patients. And for us its normal. There is not so emotional, luckily, because we are used to treat other people. But this is difficult when the patient is your colleague. And we have now admitted tens of colleagues or nurse, people who you will meet every day in your life.\n\nmichael barbaro\n\nYour colleagues are now your patients because they have contracted the virus.\n\ndr. fabiano di marco\n\nAbsolutely. For example, yesterday, the chief of my department come to the emergency room to be with a low level of oxygenation. He has a bilateral pneumonia due to coronavirus.\n\nmichael barbaro\n\nWow. Im sorry.\n\ndr. fabiano di marco\n\nNot very severe. But he was someone who tried to organize the hospital to deal with this infection three days ago. And we went to have a dinner with my wife and his wife one week ago.\n\nmichael barbaro\n\nWow.\n\ndr. fabiano di marco\n\nI dont know. We are scared because on Friday, only in my hospital, we had 20 deaths.\n\nmichael barbaro\n\n20 deaths.\n\ndr. fabiano di marco\n\nYeah. For coronavirus. In one day.\n\nmichael barbaro\n\nThats extraordinary.\n\ndr. fabiano di marco\n\nYeah. So another important thing, we have not had the opportunity to allow the relative to come to the hospital for two reasons. First, its a danger for them and for other people, evidently, because in 80 percent of the cases, they are infected. The second reason, which is not easy to understand if you are not in this situation, is that we do not have enough personal protective equipment  the mask in case of infection, something to cover the shoes, and the gown. Its impossible to find these now Europe, not only in Italy.\n\nmichael barbaro\n\nSo youre running out of those and you cant get them anywhere, in the region or anywhere in Europe. You just cant get them.\n\ndr. fabiano di marco\n\nYeah. Impossible to find.\n\nmichael barbaro\n\nWow.\n\ndr. fabiano di marco\n\nIf I allow one or two relative to come to the hospital, I have to give them these. But we do not have this for us.\n\nmichael barbaro\n\nRight. You need them for doctors.\n\ndr. fabiano di marco\n\nYeah. They cannot receive the relative in hospital. So the patients are alone. And they die alone. We  this is difficult for us. We try to call, every day, the relative. But I have to tell you that sometimes, in the confusion of this new organization with a dermatologist who is trying to treat a patient with severe respiratory failure, and probably the doctors cry, and the  no one remember to call the relative. So its happened that the relative call the hospital \n\nmichael barbaro\n\nAnd the persons already dead.\n\ndr. fabiano di marco\n\nYeah.\n\n[music]\n\nmichael barbaro\n\nWell be right back. Doctor, youve mentioned a lot of the choices that you and your staff have to make now that this is such a terrible situation. And I wonder how you make decisions about who gets which treatment, and who has the best chance to survive. How do you make those decisions?\n\ndr. fabiano di marco\n\nThis is, for us, a crucial point, because we have hundreds of very sick patients. But we have tens of I.C.U. beds.\n\nmichael barbaro\n\nRight.\n\ndr. fabiano di marco\n\nThe problem is that you can find many scores of gravity. But these scores of gravity have been thought for another reason. OK?\n\nmichael barbaro\n\nAnd when you say score of gravity, you mean, basically, kind of a calculation of who is in greatest need?\n\ndr. fabiano di marco\n\nAbsolutely. So for instance, if you are 80, you have a severe respiratory failure, and I dont know, you have also renal failure, I have to admit you in the I.C.U. because you are very severe. And you have a probability to die very high. OK. I have to admit you in the I.C.U.. But now we need another score, which is a score which help us to understand your probability to benefit of the I.C.U. bed. And we do not have this score. OK?\n\nmichael barbaro\n\nBecause it has not been created.\n\ndr. fabiano di marco\n\nAbsolutely. We are trying to do this now, because for example, the age, for all of the stage of severity, higher is the age, higher is the score. But when you have few beds for many people, the age is absolutely the opposite. If you are 85, I give the bed to another one who is 45.\n\nmichael barbaro\n\nBecause 45-year-old is more likely to benefit from the I.C.U. bed than the 80-year-old. So youre saying all the normal rules have to be thrown out the window.\n\ndr. fabiano di marco\n\nAbsolutely. We need a new tool we do not have, because so far, the difference between the number of patients, number or bed, is something totally new for us. OK? And not only for us, all the country will have to deal with this. But its difficult to tell people that if you are 80, you will never have the I.C.U. bed.\n\nmichael barbaro\n\nOf course.\n\ndr. fabiano di marco\n\nBut so far, if you have not the opportunity to build a new hospital with 1,000 bed, such as in China, we need this terrible tool, because this is a tool of selection.\n\nmichael barbaro\n\nRight  of who lives and who dies.\n\ndr. fabiano di marco\n\nYeah. And this is why its important. If you do not reduce the number of patients who are sick, its impossible to deal with this disease. Impossible. You have to reduce the rate of infection. And the only way to reduce the rate of infection is to change totally the life of people. Now, in Italy, everyone is at home. This is a tragedy for economy. No one is working. No one is working. But its the only way. There is not something in between.\n\nmichael barbaro\n\nIt sounds like youre saying that once you are in a hospital as a doctor, looking at a room full of people with this virus, overwhelmed, its too late. That the role of countries who are not yet at the place Italy is in is to make sure they dont ever get to that place, dont ever get to the point that your hospital is at. And to do whatever it takes to not get there.\n\ndr. fabiano di marco\n\nAbsolutely. You have two choices. You decide to not close all the activities, close the people in their home, and you will accept thousand of beds. Or, you have to close all the activity. There is not a choice in between. I know this is difficult to have this approach, because also in Italy, if you speak with my colleague in another town, its quite difficult to understand this. Because many people, including many physicians, have not this perception of this. Because in your reality, all is normal. Its difficult to be scared for something you have not the perception. OK? So I can understand that in other countries, its the same. But trust us, or, such as in Bergamo, each family will have a relative or a friend who dies. This is the situation in Bergamo. This is not a disease that you can discuss on TV, or you will have the perception of this in your family, in your relative, in your town. Its something very aggressive, very aggressive.\n\nmichael barbaro\n\nI wonder, as a doctor, what advice you would give to doctors in the United States who may have to do what you have to do and make the kind of difficult decisions that you have to make now.\n\ndr. fabiano di marco\n\nI think that the best is to speak with us to analyze the situation of Italy. It could be something important. Because you have to be prepared for this. This is the only thing I would suggest to my colleague. Because also in Italy, I have some colleague in the other part of Italy who are not prepared. And I speak with them. They are doing the same thing we did three weeks ago. This is incredible. This new reality we are living started the 23rd of February, not three years ago. OK? Three weeks ago. After three weeks, we are living in another dimension. For me, its difficult to think to my life before this. No one can be prepared for this  impossible.\n\nmichael barbaro\n\nI wonder, just a final question here. At the beginning of our conversation, you said you were finally home after three weeks. And I wonder what it was like to come home to your family. What are you telling them? And how are you feeling?\n\ndr. fabiano di marco\n\nMy children are at home now for three weeks. The schools are closed. Luckily there are three, so they can stay together. But we try to create a normal situation at home. For me, its difficult, because evidently, I have a risk of infection which is higher than compared to other people. So I had to decide what to do at home. If stay with a mask  sorry. And I decide to stay normal, without the mask.\n\nmichael barbaro\n\nIt sounds like this was a tough decision.\n\ndr. fabiano di marco\n\nYeah, because I have to find the solution between to protect the best, uh, my wife and do not scare my children. OK? The only good news is that children and young boys or girls are not affected. This is the only consolation for us. And I decide that I changed my approach to my children. OK?

But I decide to not wear a mask because it will be difficult for them to see the father who is a respiratory physician in Bergamo with those kind of cases, hundreds of that. So also for these, its really difficult to decide what is the best. And then I spoke with my wife. And we decided to do this.\n\nmichael barbaro\n\nIt sounds like on top of all the difficult decisions youve had to make, you had to go home and make one more difficult decision, which was this mask.\n\ndr. fabiano di marco\n\nYeah. Absolutely.\n\n[music]\n\nmichael barbaro\n\nDoctor, I really want to thank you so much for giving us your time. And I want to wish you the best of luck, you and all your colleagues, doctors and nurses at the hospital. Were going to be thinking about you a lot in the coming days.\n\ndr. fabiano di marco\n\nThank you. Thank you. It has been a privilege.

But for-profit drug giants or biotechnology start-ups have dominated the development race, especially in the United States, a vital market because of its high drug prices.\n\nThe British laboratory, at Imperial College London, could alter that landscape, in part because its technology has the potential to develop a vaccine that is cheaper and easier to manufacture than others, said Robin Shattock, the lead scientist on the project.\n\nIf successful, he said, the vaccines lower cost could appeal to the large donor organizations that typically supply low-income countries, which make up much of the world. It could also provide a cheaper alternative in affluent countries.'
